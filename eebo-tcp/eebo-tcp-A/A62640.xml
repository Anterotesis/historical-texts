         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>BEING, I hope, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my Life, releaſed from that irkſome and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant work of <hi>Controverſy</hi> and <hi>Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> about Religion, I ſhall now turn my thoughts to ſomething more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my temper, and of a more direct and immediate tendency to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of true Religion, to the happineſs of Human Society, and the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World.</p>
            <p>I have no intention to reflect upon any that ſtand up in defence of the <hi>Truth</hi> and contend earneſtly for it, endeavouring <hi>in the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to reclaim thoſe that are in <hi>Error.</hi> For I doubt not but a very good man
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:34942:3"/>
may upon ſeveral occaſions be almoſt unavoidably engaged in <hi>Controverſies</hi> of Religion; and if he have a head clear and cool enough, ſo as to be maſter of his own <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> in that hot kind of Service, he may therein do conſiderable advantage to the <hi>Truth:</hi> Though a man that hath once <hi>drawn blood in Controver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> as <hi>Mr. Mede</hi> expreſſeth it, is ſeldom known ever perfectly to recover his own good temper afterwards.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon a good Man ſhould not be very willing, <hi>when his Lord comes,</hi> to <hi>be found ſo doing,</hi> and as it were <hi>beating his fellow-ſervants:</hi> And all <hi>Controver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> as it is uſually managed, is little better. A good man would be loth to be taken out of the World reeking hot from a ſharp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with a perverſe Adverſary; and not a little out of countenance, to find himſelf in this temper tranſlated into the calm and peaceable <hi>Regions</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> where nothing but perfect <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>good will</hi> reign for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:34942:3"/>
I know not whether St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had been <hi>taken up into the third Heavens,</hi> did by that Queſtion of his, <hi>Where is the Diſputer of THIS WORLD?</hi> intend to inſinuate that this <hi>wrangling</hi> work hath place only in <hi>this World,</hi> and upon this <hi>Earth</hi> where <hi>only</hi> there is a <hi>Duſt</hi> to be raiſed; but will have no place in the <hi>Other.</hi> But whether <hi>St. Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this or not, the thing it ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf I think is true, that in the <hi>other World</hi> all things will be clear and paſt <hi>diſpute.</hi> To be ſure, among the <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> and probably alſo among the <hi>Miſerable,</hi> unleſs fierce and furious Contentions, with great <hi>Heat</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Light,</hi> about things of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and concernment to them, ſhould be deſign'd for a part of their <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the following <hi>Sermons,</hi> I am ſenſible that the <hi>Style</hi> of them is more looſe and full of words, than is agreeable to juſt and exact <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes:</hi> But ſo I think the <hi>Style</hi> of <hi>Popular Sermons</hi> ought to be.
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:34942:4"/>
And therefore I have not been very careful to mend this matter; chuſing rather that they ſhould appear in that native ſimplicity in which, ſo many years ago, they were firſt fram'd, than dreſs'd up with too much care and Art. As they are, I hope the candid and ingenuous Readers will take them in good part.</p>
            <p>And I do heartily wiſh that all that are concern'd in the reſpective <hi>Duties,</hi> treated on in the following <hi>Sermons,</hi> would be perſuaded ſo to lay them to heart as to put them effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in practice: That how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Reformation of this corrupt and degenerate Age in which we live is almoſt utterly to be deſpair'd of, we may yet have a more comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of future Times, by ſeeing the foundation of a better World begun to be laid in the careful and conſcientious diſcharge of the Duties here mention'd: That by this means <hi>the Generations to come may know God, and the Children yet unborn may fear the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:34942:4"/>
I have great reaſon to be ſenſible how faſt the infirmities of Age are coming upon me, and therefore <hi>muſt work the Works of Him,</hi> whoſe Providence hath placed me in the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> wherein I am, <hi>whilſt it is Day, becauſe the Night cometh when no man can work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I knew very well, before I enter'd upon this great and weighty <hi>Charge,</hi> my own manifold defects, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal my beſt abilities were for the due diſcharge of it; but I did not feel this ſo ſenſibly as I now do every day more and more. And therefore that I might make ſome ſmall amends for greater failings, I knew not how bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to place the broken hours I had to ſpare from almoſt perpetual buſineſs of one kind or other, than in preparing ſomething for the Publick that might be of uſe to recover the decayed Piety and Virtue of the preſent Age; in which iniquity doth ſo much abound, and the Love of God and Religion is grown ſo cold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:34942:5"/>
To this end I have choſen to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh theſe plain <hi>Sermons,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to the ſerious peruſal and faithful practice both of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> and <hi>People</hi> committed to my Charge; earneſtly beſeeching Almighty God, that by his Bleſſing they may prove effectual to that good end for which they are ſincerely deſign'd.</p>

            <p>After this, he calls them together a <hi>ſecond</hi> time, and gives them a brief hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical account and deduction of the great Mercies of God to them and their Fathers, from the days of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom he had called out from among his Idolatrous Kindred and Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, unto that Day.</p>
            <p>From the conſideration of all which, he earneſtly exhorts them to renew their Covenant with God; and for his particular ſatisfaction, before he left the World, ſolemnly to promiſe that they would for ever ſerve God and forſake the ſervice of Idols: <hi>Now therefore fear the Lord, and ſerve Him in ſincerity and in truth: And put away the Gods which your Fathers ſerved on the other ſide of the Flood, and in Egypt; and ſerve ye the Lord.</hi>

            <p>And then in the <hi>Text,</hi> by a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant <hi>Scheme</hi> of Speech he does, as it were, once more ſet them at liberty; and, as if they had never engaged themſelves to God by Covenant before, he leaves them to their free choice:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34942:7"/>
               <hi>And if it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day whom ye will ſerve; whether the Gods whom your Fathers ſerved on the other ſide of the Flood, or the Gods of the Amorites in whoſe Land ye dwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that they were at liberty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would ſerve the true God, or not; but to inſinuate to them that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ought to be their free choice: And likewiſe, that the true Religion hath thoſe real advantages on its Side, that it may ſafely be referr'd to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Man's choice: <hi>If it ſeem evil unto you;</hi> as if he had ſaid, If after all the demonſtrations which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his Miraculous Preſence among you, and the mighty obligations which he hath laid upon you by bringing you out of the <hi>Land of Egypt,</hi> and the <hi>Houſe of Bondage</hi> by ſo out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tretched an Arm; and by driving out the Nations before you, and giving you their Land to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs: If after all this, you can think it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it to quit the ſervice of <hi>this God,</hi> and to worſhip the <hi>Idols</hi> of the Nations whom you have ſubdued, thoſe vanquiſhed and baffled Deities: If you can think it reaſonable ſo to do, but ſurely you cannot; then take your choice: <hi>If it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34942:7"/>
               <hi>chuſe you this day whom ye will ſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to direct and encourage them to make a right choice, he declares to them his own Reſolution, which he hopes will alſo be theirs; and as he had heretofore been their <hi>Captain,</hi> ſo now he offers himſelf to be their <hi>Example:</hi> But whether they will follow him or not, he for his part is fix'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable in this Reſolution; <hi>But as for ME and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In effect he tells them; I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the beſt Religion to your choice, and I cannot but think, nay I cannot but hope, that you will all ſtedfaſtly adhere to it. It is ſo reaſonable and wiſe, ſo much your Intereſt and your Happineſs to do it. But if you ſhould do otherwiſe, if you ſhould be ſo weak as not to diſcern the Truth, ſo wilful and ſo wicked as not to embrace it: Though you ſhould all make another choice, and run away from the true God to the worſhip of Idols; I for my part am ſtedfaſtly reſolved what to do: In a caſe ſo manifeſt, in a matter ſo reaſonable, no Number, no Example ſhall prevail with me to the contrary; I will, if need be, ſtand alone in that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34942:8"/>
which is ſo evidently and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Right: And though this whole Nation ſhould revolt all at once from the Worſhip of the true God, and join with the reſt of the World in a falſe Religion and in the Worſhip of Idols; and mine were the only Family left in all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nay in the whole World, that continued to worſhip the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I would ſtill be of the ſame mind; I would ſtill perſiſt in this Reſolution, and act according to it; <hi>As for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Reſolution truly worthy of ſo great a Prince and ſo good a Man: In which he is a double Pattern to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of the brave Reſolution of a <hi>good Man,</hi> namely, That if there were occaſion, and things were brought to that extremity, he would ſtand alone in the Profeſſion and Practice of the true Religion: <hi>As for ME, I will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the pious Care of a <hi>good Father and Maſter of a Family,</hi> to train up thoſe under his Charge in the true Religion and Worſhip of God; <hi>As for me and MY HOUSE,</hi> we will ſerve the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:34942:8"/>
I ſhall at this time, by God's aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, treat of the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, namely,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Of the brave Reſolution of a <hi>good Man,</hi> that if there were occaſion, and things were brought to that extremity, he would ſtand alone in the Profeſſion and Practice of God's true Religion: <hi>Chuſe you this day,</hi> ſays <hi>Joſhua, whom ye will ſerve; but as for ME, I will ſerve the Lord. Joſhua</hi> here puts the Caſe at the utmoſt extremity, That not only the great Nations of the World, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and all the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Nations round about them, and in whoſe Land they dwelt, were all long ſince revolted to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and pretended great Antiquity and long Preſcription for the Worſhip of their falſe Gods: But he ſuppoſeth yet further, That the only true and viſible Church of God then known in the World, the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould likewiſe generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt and forſake the Worſhip of the <hi>true God,</hi> and cleave to the Service of <hi>Idols:</hi> Yet in this Caſe, if we could ſuppoſe it to happen, he declares his firm and ſtedfaſt Reſolution to adhere to the Worſhip of the true God: And though all others ſhould fall off from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34942:9"/>
it, that he would ſtand alone in the Profeſſion and Practice of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: <hi>But as for ME, I will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of this Argument I ſhall do theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider the <hi>matter</hi> of this Reſolution, and the due <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>limits</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of this Reſolution from the <hi>Objections</hi> to which this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and peremptory kind of Reſolution may ſeem liable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider the <hi>matter</hi> of this Reſolution, and the due <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>limits</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1ſt. The <hi>matter</hi> of this Reſolution. <hi>Joſhua</hi> here reſolves that if need were, and things were brought to that paſs, he would ſtand alone, or with very few adhering to him, in the Profeſſion and Practice of the true Religion. And this is not a mere Suppoſition of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible Caſe, which can never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: For it may, and hath really and in fact happen'd in ſeveral Ages and Places of the World.</p>
            <p>There hath been a general Apoſtacy of ſome great part of God's Church
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34942:9"/>
from the Belief and Profeſſion of the true Religion to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and to <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Errors and Hereſies:</hi> And ſome good Men have, upon the matter, ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the open Profeſſion of the true Religion, in the midſt of this general Defection from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elijah</hi> in that general Revolt of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they had <hi>forſaken the Covenant of the Lord, and broken down his Altars, and ſlain his Prophets,</hi> and <hi>he only,</hi> as he thought, <hi>was left</hi> to ſtand <hi>alone:</hi> I ſay, in this Caſe when, as he verily believed, he had no body to ſtand by him, <hi>he was very zealous for the Lord God of Hoſts,</hi> 1 Kings 18. 18. and with an undaunted courage ſtood up for the Worſhip of the true God, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Ahab</hi> to his face for his defection to the Worſhip of Idols.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thoſe</hi> three <hi>brave</hi> Youths, <hi>in the Prophecy of</hi> Daniel, <hi>chap. 3. did in the like reſolute and undaunted manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to obey the Command of the great King</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, to worſhip the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which he had ſet up; <hi>when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Submitted, and paid Honour to it: Telling him plainly,</hi> If it be ſo, our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery Furnance, and He
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34942:10"/>
will deliver us out of thy hand: If not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy Gods, nor worſhip the golden Image which thou haſt ſet up. <hi>v. 17, 18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In like manner, and with the ſame Spirit and courage,</hi> Daniel <hi>withſtood the Decree of</hi> Darius, <hi>which forbad men to</hi> ask a Petition of any God or man for thirty days, ſave of the King only; Dan. <hi>6. 7. and this under the pain of being</hi> caſt into the Den of Lions: <hi>and when all others gave obedience to it, he</hi> ſet open the windows of his chamber to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Jeruſalem, and kneeled down upon his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks, as he did afore time. <hi>v. 10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the prevalency of the <hi>Arian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy <hi>Athanaſius</hi> almoſt ſtood alone in the profeſſion and maintenance of the Truth. And in the Reign of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> the <hi>true Church</hi> of God is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by a <hi>Woman</hi> flying into the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> and living there in obſcurity for a long time; inſomuch that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Truth ſhould hardly be found. And yet during that Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of ſo great a Part of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, and the prevalency of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> for ſo many Ages, ſome few in every Age did appear who did reſolutely
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34942:10"/>
own the Truth and bear Witneſs to it with their Blood: But theſe did almoſt ſtand alone and by themſelves, like a few ſcattered Sheep wandring up and down in a wide <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, in the heighth of <hi>Popery, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe</hi> appear'd here in <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> and <hi>John Huſs</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Bohemia.</hi> And in the beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> when <hi>Popery</hi> had quite over-run theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of the World and ſubdued her Enemies on every ſide, and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſate ſecurely in the quiet poſſeſſion of his Kingdom; <hi>Luther</hi> aroſe, a bold and rough Man, but a fit <hi>Wedge</hi> to cleave in ſunder ſo hard and <hi>knotty a Block;</hi> and appeared ſtoutly againſt the groſs <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and for a long time ſtood alone, and with a moſt invincible ſpirit and courage maintained his ground and reſiſted the united malice and force of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his <hi>Adherents;</hi> and gave him ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a Wound, that he is not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly healed and recovered of it.</p>
            <p>So that for a Man to ſtand alone, or with a very few adhering to him and ſtanding by him, is not a mere imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Suppoſition, but a Caſe that hath
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34942:11"/>
really and in fact happen'd in ſeveral Ages and Places of the World. Let us then proceed to conſider in the</p>
            <p>2d. place, The due <hi>limits</hi> and <hi>bounds</hi> of this peremptory Reſolution. In all matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> which are <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> either from <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> or from <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> this <hi>Reſolution</hi> ſeems to be very reaſonable: But in things <hi>doubtful</hi> a modeſt man, and every man hath reaſon to be ſo, would be very apt to be ſtagger'd by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a very Wiſe man; and much more of many ſuch, and eſpecially by the unanimous Judgment of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men; the general Voice and Opinion of Mankind being next to the Voice of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>For in matters of an <hi>indifferent</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which God hath neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nor forbidden, ſuch as are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of God's Worſhip, a man would not be ſingular, much leſs ſtiff and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in his ſingularity; but would be apt to yield and ſurrender himſelf to the <hi>general Vote</hi> and <hi>Opinion,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the <hi>common Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi> and much more with the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> whether
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34942:11"/>
               <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> Becauſe in things <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>indifferent,</hi> we are bound by the Rules of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Civility</hi> not to thwart the <hi>general Practice;</hi> and by the <hi>Commands</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we are certainly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obey the <hi>lawful Commands</hi> of <hi>lawful Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in things plainly contrary to the evidence of <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> a man would complement no Man, or Number of Men; nor would he pin his Faith upon any <hi>Church</hi> in the World; much leſs upon any <hi>ſingle Man,</hi> no not the <hi>Pope;</hi> no, though there were never ſo many probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought for the proof of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Caſe, a Man would be <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> and ſtand alone againſt the whole World; againſt the wrath and rage of a <hi>King</hi> and all the terrors of his <hi>fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace;</hi> as in other matters, a Man would not believe all the <hi>Learned Men</hi> in the World againſt the clear evidence of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> If all the great <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians</hi> of all Ages, <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and <hi>Euclide,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and <hi>Diophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> &amp;c. could be ſuppoſed to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a <hi>General Council,</hi> and ſhould there declare in the moſt <hi>ſolemn</hi> manner,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34942:12"/>
and give it under their <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Seals,</hi> that <hi>twice two did not make four, but five;</hi> this would not move me in the leaſt to be of their mind; nay, I who am no <hi>Mathematician</hi> would maintain the contrary, and would perſiſt in it without being in the leaſt ſtartled by the poſitive Opinion of theſe great and <hi>learned men;</hi> and ſhould moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that they were either all of them out of their Wits, or that they were byaſſed by ſome Intereſt or other, and ſwayed againſt the clear evidence of Truth and the full convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their own Reaſon to make ſuch a determination as this. They might indeed over-rule the Point by their Authority, but in my inward judgment I ſhould ſtill be where I was before.</p>
            <p>Juſt ſo in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> if any <hi>Church,</hi> though with never ſo glorious and confident a pretence to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ſhould declare for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> that is, that the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> by vertue of the <hi>Conſecration</hi> of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> are ſubſtantially changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>natural Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> this is ſo notoriouſly contrary both to the <hi>Senſe</hi> and Reaſon of Mankind, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34942:12"/>
a Man ſhould chuſe to ſtand ſingle in the oppoſition of it, and laugh at or rather pity the reſt of the World that could be ſo ſervilely blind as ſeemingly to conſpire in the belief of ſo <hi>monſtrous</hi> an <hi>Abſurdity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in like manner, if any Church ſhould declare, that <hi>Images</hi> are to be worſhipped, or that the Worſhip of God is to be performed in an <hi>unknown Tongue;</hi> and that the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> which contain the Word and Will of God, and teach men what they are to believe and do in order to their eternal Salvation, are to be lock'd up and kept concealed from the People in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which they do not underſtand, leſt if they were permitted the free uſe of them in their <hi>Mother Tongue</hi> they ſhould know more of the Mind and Will of God than is convenient for the common People to know, whoſe <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Church does mainly depend upon their <hi>Ignorance:</hi> Or ſhould declare, that the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not offer'd <hi>once for all,</hi> but is and ought to be repeated ten Millions of times every Day: And that the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> ought to receive the <hi>Communion in one kind only,</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> by no means to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34942:13"/>
be truſted with them for fear the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Beards</hi> of the <hi>Laity</hi> ſhould drink of it: And that the <hi>ſaving efficacy</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> doth depend upon the <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſt,</hi> without which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver can have no benefit by them: Theſe are all of them ſo plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and moſt of them in <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſo abſurd, that the Authority of no Church whatſoever can oblige a man to the belief of them.</p>
            <p>Nay, I go yet further, that being evidently contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> though an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or an <hi>Angel from Heaven</hi> ſhould declare them, we ought to reject them. And for this I have St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s authority and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who ſpeaking of ſome that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by teaching things contrary to it, <hi>Though we,</hi> ſays he, <hi>or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed: As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, though an Apoſtle, though an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you than that which ye have received, let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1. 7, 8, 9. You ſee he repeats it over again, to expreſs not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own confident aſſurance, but the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34942:13"/>
certainty of the thing. And here is an <hi>Anathema</hi> with a witneſs, which we may confidently oppoſe to all the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>'s which the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> hath ſo liberally denounced againſt all thoſe who ſhall preſume to gainſay theſe <hi>New Doctrines</hi> of their Church; which are in truth <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> than that which our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> taught: And yet on their Side there is neither an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> nor an <hi>Angel from Heaven</hi> in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>To give but one <hi>Inſtance</hi> more: If <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhall tell me, as he expreſly does, That <hi>if the Pope ſhould declare Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to be Vice, and Vice to be Virtue, I were bound to believe him unleſs I would ſin againſt Conſcience:</hi> And if all the World ſhould ſay the ſame that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> does, namely, that this <hi>Infallible Declarer</hi> of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> were to be believed and followed; yet I could not poſſibly be of their mind, for this plain and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Reaſon; becauſe if <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> be all one, then Religion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; ſince the main Deſign of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is to teach men the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> and to oblige them to practiſe the <hi>one</hi> and to refrain from the <hi>other:</hi> And if Religion be nothing,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34942:14"/>
then Heaven and Hell are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: And if Heaven be nothing, then an <hi>infallible Guide</hi> thither is of no uſe and to no manner of purpoſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Guide no whither, and ſo his great <hi>Office</hi> ceaſes and falls of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now leſt any ſhould think me ſingular in this</hi> Aſſertion, <hi>and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I give a great deal too much to the ſingle Judgment of private Perſons, and too little to the Authority of a Church, I will produce the deliberate Judgment of a very Learned Man and a great Aſſertor of the Church's Authority, concerning the matter I am now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of: I mean Mr.</hi> Hooker, <hi>in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly admired</hi> Book <hi>of</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Policy. <hi>His words are theſe,</hi> I grant, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that Proof derived from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Man's Judgment is not able to work that Aſſurance which doth grow by a ſtronger proof: and therefore although ten thouſand General Councils ſhould ſet down one and the ſame Definitive Sentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any Point of Religion whatſoever, yet one Demonſtrative Reaſon alledged, or one Teſtimony cited from the Word of God himſelf to the contrary, could not chuſe but overſway them all: In as much as for them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34942:14"/>
to be deceived it is not ſo impoſſible, as it is that Demonſtrative Reaſon or Divine Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony ſhould deceive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again,</hi> For men, <hi>ſays he,</hi> to be tyed and led by Authority, as it were with a kind of Captivity of Judgment, and though there be Reaſon to the contrary not to liſten to it, but follow like Beaſts the firſt in the Herd, this were Brutiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> That the Authority of Men ſhould prevail with Men, either againſt or above Reaſon is no part of OUR Belief. Companies of Learned Men, though they be never ſo great and Reverend, are to yield unto Reaſon, the weight whereof is no whit prejudiced by the ſimplicity of the Perſon which doth alledge it; but being found to be ſound and good, the bare Opinion of men to the contrary muſt of neceſſity ſtoop and give place. <hi>And this he delivers not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as his own particular Judgment, but that which he apprehended to be the Judgment of the</hi> Church of England.</p>
            <p>I have produced theſe clear and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of ſo learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Perſon, and of ſo great eſteem in our Church, on purpoſe to prevent any miſapprehenſion, as if by this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I intended to derogate from the Authority of the Church and her juſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34942:15"/>
and reaſonable Determinations, in things no wiſe contrary to plain <hi>Reaſon</hi> or the <hi>Word of God.</hi> And beyond this pitch no judicious <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> that I know of, ever ſtrain'd the Authority of the Church. I proceed now in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, to vindicate the <hi>Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi> of this <hi>Reſolution</hi> from the <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> to which this <hi>ſingular</hi> and <hi>peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> kind of <hi>Reſolution</hi> may ſeem liable; as</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it may very ſpeciouſly be ſaid, that this does not ſeem modeſt for a man to ſet up his own private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the general Suffrage and Vote. And it is very true, as I ſaid before, that about things <hi>indifferent</hi> a man ſhould not be ſtiff and ſingular; and in things <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>obſcure</hi> a man ſhould not be over-confident of his own Judgment, and inſiſt peremptorily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it againſt the general Opinion: But in things that are plain and evident, either from <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it is neither immodeſty, nor a culpable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, for a man to ſtand alone in the defence of the Truth. Becauſe in ſuch a Caſe a man does not oppoſe his own ſingle and private Judgment to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34942:15"/>
Judgment of <hi>Many,</hi> but the common Reaſon of Mankind and the Judgment of God plainly declared in his Word.</p>
            <p>If the generality of men ſhould turn <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and ſhould deny the <hi>Being</hi> of God, or his <hi>Providence;</hi> the <hi>Immortality</hi> of mens Souls, and the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> of another World: Or ſhould deny the Truth of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would not certainly be any breach of modeſty for a man to appear ſingle, if no body elſe would ſtand by him, in the reſolute defence of theſe great Truths.</p>
            <p>In like manner, when a whole Church, though never ſo large and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, ſhall conſpire together to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion ſo far as to impoſe upon Mankind, under the name of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> things plainly contrary to the Senſe and Reaſon of Mankind, and to the clear and expreſs Word of God, why muſt a Man needs be thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt, if he oppoſe ſuch groſs Errors and Corruptions of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? And what reaſon have the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to talk of modeſty in this Caſe, when they themſelves have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34942:16"/>
the face to impoſe upon Mankind the belief of things contrary to what they and every man elſe ſees? As they do in their Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And to require of them to do what God hath expreſly forbidden, as in the Worſhip of <hi>Images;</hi> beſides a great many other <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Practices of that Church: To deny the People the free uſe of the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>publick Service</hi> of God in a <hi>known Tongue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> contrary to the very end and deſign of all Religion, and in affront to the common Reaſon and Liberty of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is pretended that it is more prudent for private Perſons to err with the Church, than to be ſo pertinacious in their own Opinions. To which I anſwer, that it may indeed be pardonable in ſome Caſes to be led into miſtake by the Authority of thoſe to whoſe Judgment and Inſtruction we ought to pay a great deference and ſubmiſſion: Provided always it be in things which are not plain and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but ſurely it can never be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to err with any number, how great ſoever, in matters of Religion which are of moment, merely for <hi>Numbers</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:34942:16"/>
ſake: But to comply with the <hi>known Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> of any Church whatſoever is certainly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>Obj. 3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is pretended yet further, that men ſhall ſooner be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed in following the <hi>Church,</hi> than any particular <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Sect.</hi> To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is very true if the matter be doubtful, and eſpecially if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities be equal, or near equal on both Sides: But if the Error be groſs and palpable, it will be no excuſe to have followed any number of Men, or any Church whatſoever. For here the competition is not between Men and Men, but between God and Men: And in this Caſe we muſt forſake all Men to follow God and his Truth. <hi>Thou ſhalt in no wiſe follow a Multitude in a known Error,</hi> is a <hi>Rule</hi> which in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is of equal obligation with that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, Thou ſhalt in no wiſe follow a Multitude to do evil;</hi> or rather is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in it, becauſe to <hi>comply</hi> with a <hi>known Error</hi> is certainly to <hi>do Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this very <hi>Objection</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> made againſt our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> and the Doctrine which He taught, that the <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church did utterly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34942:17"/>
differ from <hi>Him,</hi> and were of a contrary mind, <hi>Have any of the Rulers,</hi> ſay they, <hi>believed on him?</hi> What? will you be wiſer than your Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors? What? follow the Doctrine of <hi>one ſingle Man</hi> againſt the unanimous Judgment and Sentence of the <hi>Great Sanhedrim,</hi> to whom the Trial of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> and pretended <hi>Prophets</hi> doth of right belong?</p>
            <p>But, as plauſible as this <hi>Objection</hi> may ſeem to be, it is to be conſidered that in a corrupt and degenerate Church the <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of it are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the worſt, and the moſt deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> of it. They brought them in at firſt, and their Succeſſors, who have been bred up in the belief and practice of them, are concern'd to uphold and maintain them: And ſo <hi>long a Preſcription</hi> gives a kind of <hi>Sacred Stamp</hi> even to <hi>Error,</hi> and an Authority not to be oppoſed and reſiſted.</p>
            <p>And thus it was in the corrupt State of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Time: And ſo likewiſe in that great Degeneracy of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Times of <hi>Popery, their Rulers made them to err:</hi> Inſomuch that when <hi>Martin</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:34942:17"/>
               <hi>Luther</hi> appeared in oppoſition to the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Superſtitions</hi> of that Church, and was hard preſt with this very <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> urg'd againſt our <hi>Saviour,</hi> he was forc'd to bolt out a kind of <hi>unmannerly Truth, Religio nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam magis periclitatur quàm inter Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſimos, Religion,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is never in greater hazard and worſe treated, than amongſt the moſt Reverend;</hi> meaning the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Hierarchy</hi> who had their dependance upon them.</p>
            <p>Obj. 4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it is <hi>Objected,</hi> That as on the one hand there may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Error</hi> in following blindly the Belief of the Church, ſo on the other hand there is as great a danger of <hi>Schiſm</hi> in forſaking the communion of the Church upon pretence of <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions.</hi> Very true; but where great <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> are not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but are real and evident: and where our <hi>Compliance</hi> with thoſe <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> is made a <hi>neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our <hi>Communion</hi> with that <hi>Church:</hi> In that Caſe, the guilt of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> how great a Crime ſoever it be, doth not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34942:18"/>
drive them out of it by the <hi>ſinful Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> which they impoſe upon them.</p>
            <p>And this is truly the <hi>Caſe</hi> between <hi>Us</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make good, and have fully done it upon all Occaſions; and they have never yet been able to vindicate and clear themſelves of thoſe groſs <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> which have been char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon them, and which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of all their <hi>Members</hi> as <hi>neceſſary Conditions</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> with them here, and of <hi>eternal Salvation</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>For we do not object to them doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matters, but things as plain as any are contained in the <hi>Bible,</hi> as every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would ſee if they durſt but let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body read it. The <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> is there as plainly forbidden in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue,</hi> as <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> are.

            <p>And, to add but one <hi>Inſtance</hi> more; <hi>Publick Prayers,</hi> and the <hi>Service</hi> of God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34942:18"/>
in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> are as plainly and fully declared againſt by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in a long <hi>Chapter</hi> upon this ſingle Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as any one thing in all his <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things are plain and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and being ſo, are a full juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>Reformation</hi> which She thought fit to make within her ſelf from the groſs <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> but likewiſe of <hi>particular Perſons</hi> who have at any time for the ſame Reaſons withdrawn themſelves from Her Communion, in any of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Countries: Yea though that <hi>ſingle Perſon</hi> ſhould happen to be in thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that he could not have the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of holding Communion with any <hi>other Church,</hi> that was free from thoſe <hi>Errors</hi> and Corruptions, and which did not impoſe them as <hi>neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if any <hi>Church</hi> fall off to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> every good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> not only may, but ought to forſake <hi>Her Communion;</hi> and ought rather to ſtand ſingle and alone in the Profeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r Communion:</hi> What? <hi>the Church err?</hi> That is ſuch an <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> as is by many thought ſufficient to put any <hi>Objection</hi> out of countenance. That the <hi>whole Church,</hi> that is, that <hi>all the Chriſtians</hi> in the World ſhould at any time fall off to <hi>Idolatry</hi> and into <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> directly contrary to the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine</hi> revealed in the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> is on all hands, I think, denied: But that any Particular Church may fall into ſuch <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> is, I think, as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally granted: Only in this Caſe they demand to have the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> excepted: And why I pray? Becauſe though the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> it is alſo the <hi>Univerſal Church:</hi> If this can be, and good ſenſe can be made of a <hi>Particular-Univerſal Church,</hi> then the <hi>Roman Church</hi> may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand this high Privilege of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the Fate of all other Churches; but if the <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> that is a <hi>Particular-Univerſal Church</hi> be a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34942:19"/>
groſs and palpable <hi>Contradiction,</hi> then it is plain that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no more pretence to this <hi>Privilege,</hi> than any other <hi>Particular Church</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>And which is yet more, ſome men talk of theſe matters at that rate, as if a man who thought himſelf obliged to quit the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould happen to be in thoſe Circumſtances that he had no Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of joining himſelf to any other Communion, he ought in that Caſe to give over all thoughts of Religion, and not be ſo conceited and preſumptuous as to think of going to Heaven alone by himſelf.</p>
            <p>It is without doubt a very great Sin to deſpiſe the Communion of the Church, or to break off from it ſo long as we can continue in it without Sin: But if things ſhould once come to that <hi>Paſs</hi> that we muſt either diſobey God for company, or ſtand alone in our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Him, we ought moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to obey God whatever comes of it; and to profeſs his Truth, whether any body elſe will join with us in that Profeſſion or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:34942:20"/>
And they who ſpeak otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the whole <hi>Reformation,</hi> and do in effect ſay that <hi>Martin Luther</hi> had done a very ill thing in breaking off from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> if no body elſe would have joined with him in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Deſign. And yet if it had been ſo, I hope God would have given him the Grace and Courage to have ſtood alone in ſo good and glorious a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and to have laid down his Life for it.</p>
            <p>And for any man to be of another Opinion, is juſt as if a man upon great deliberation ſhould chuſe rather to be drowned, than to be ſaved either by a <hi>Plank</hi> or a <hi>ſmall Boat;</hi> or to be carried into the Harbour any other way, than in a <hi>Great Ship</hi> of ſo many <hi>hundred Tuns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, a good man muſt reſolve to obey God and to profeſs his Truth, though all the World ſhould happen to do otherwiſe. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath promiſed to preſerve his Church <hi>to the end of the World,</hi> that is, he hath engaged his Word that he will take care that there ſhall always be, in ſome part of the World or other, ſome perſons that ſhall make a ſincere Profeſſion of his true Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34942:20"/>
But He hath no where promiſed to preſerve any <hi>one Part</hi> of his Church from ſuch <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions,</hi> as may oblige all good men to quit the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of <hi>that Part;</hi> yea though when they have done ſo, they may not know whither to reſort for actual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with any other <hi>ſound Part</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church. As it happened to ſome particular Perſons, during the Reign and Rage of <hi>Popery</hi> in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>The Reſult from all this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> is, to confirm and eſtabliſh us all, in this <hi>Hour of Temptation</hi> and of <hi>the Powers of Darkneſs,</hi> in the well-grounded Belief of the neceſſity and juſtice of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> from the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And to engage us <hi>to hold faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith without wavering:</hi> And not only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and promiſe as <hi>Peter</hi> did to our <hi>Lord, though all men forſake thee, yet will not I:</hi> But if there ſhould be Occaſion, to perform and make good this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with the hazard of all that is dear to us, and even of Life it ſelf. And whatever Trials God may permit any of us to fall into, to take up the pious Reſolution of <hi>Joſhua</hi> here in the <hi>Text,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34942:21"/>

            <p>And thus much may ſuffice to have ſpoken to the <hi>Firſt</hi> thing in the <hi>Text,</hi> namely, the pious Reſolution of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> that if there were Occaſion and things were brought to that extremity, he would ſtand alone in the Profeſſion and Practice of God's true Religion: <hi>Chuſe you this Day whom ye will ſerve, but as for ME, I will ſerve the Lord.</hi>

            <p>And this is the more neceſſary to be ſpoken to, becauſe it is a great and very
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34942:23"/>
eſſential part of Religion, but ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overlook'd and neglected in this looſe and degenerate Age in which we live. It is a great part of Religion; for next to our <hi>perſonal Homage</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> and the Care of our own Souls, it is incumbent upon us to make thoſe, who are under our Charge and ſubject to our Authority, God's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and his Children and Servants; which is a much more honourable and happy Relation, than that which they bear to us.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Children</hi> are a <hi>natural</hi> part of our ſelves, and the reſt of our Family are a <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> part: And not only we our ſelves, but all that we have and that belongs to us is God's, and ought to be devoted to his ſervice. And they that have the true Fear of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, will be careful to teach it to others; to thoſe eſpecially who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their more immediate Care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And therefore God had ſo great a confidence conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>he will command his Children and his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment.</hi> God paſſeth his Word for him, that he would not only take care to inſtruct his <hi>Children</hi> and the reſt of his numerous <hi>Family</hi> in the true Religion, but that he would likewiſe lay a ſtrict Charge upon them to propagate and tranſmit it to their Poſterity.</p>
            <p>And this certainly is the Duty of all <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Families;</hi> and an eſſential part of Religion, next to ſerving God in our own Perſons, to be very careful that all that belong to us do the ſame. For every man muſt not only give an account of himſelf to God, but of thoſe likewiſe that are committed to his Charge that they do do not miſcarry through his neglect.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking of this great and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Duty I ſhall do theſe <hi>four</hi> things.</p>

            <p n="1">I. I ſhall ſhew wherein the Practice of this Duty doth conſiſt. And in this I am ſure there is no need to be long, becauſe this Duty is much better known than practiſed. The principal <hi>Parts</hi> of it are theſe following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By ſetting up the conſtant Worſhip of God in our Families. By <hi>daily Pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs</hi> to God, every <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening;</hi> and by reading ſome Portion of the <hi>H. Scriptures</hi> at thoſe Times, eſpecially out of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And this is ſo neceſſary to keep alive and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſenſe of God and Religion in the minds of men, that where it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected I do not ſee how any Family can in reaſon be eſteemed a Family of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or indeed to have any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:34942:24"/>
And there are not wanting excellent <hi>Helps</hi> to this purpoſe for thoſe that ſtand in need of them, as I think moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies do for the due and decent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this ſolemn Duty of <hi>Prayer:</hi> I ſay, there are excellent Helps to this purpoſe, in the ſeveral <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> calculated for the private uſe of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as well as for <hi>Secret Prayer</hi> in our <hi>Cloſets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that beſides the reading of the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> which are the great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Divine Truth;</hi> we may do well likewiſe to add to theſe other pious and profitable <hi>Books,</hi> which by their plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are fitted for the inſtruction of all Capacities in the moſt neceſſary Points of <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Practice:</hi> Of which ſort, God be thanked, there is an abundant ſtore; but none that I think is more fitted for general and conſtant uſe than that <hi>excellent Book</hi> ſo well known by the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>The whole Duty of Man:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is conveniently divided into <hi>Parts</hi> or <hi>Sections; one</hi> of which may be read in the <hi>Family,</hi> at any time when there is leiſure for it; but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> when the whole Family may the more eaſily be brought and kept together, and have the Opportunity
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34942:25"/>
to attend upon theſe things without diſtraction.</p>
            <p>And, which I muſt by no means omit, becauſe it is in many Families already gone, and in others going out of Faſhion: I mean a ſolemn acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Providence of God, by begging his <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> at our <hi>Meals,</hi> upon his good Creatures provided for our uſe; and by returning <hi>Thanks</hi> to him for the benefit and refreſhment of them: This being a piece of <hi>Natural Religion</hi> owned and practiſed in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and in moſt Places of the World; but never ſo ſhamefully and ſcandalouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected, and I fear by many ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed, as it is amongſt us at this Day: And moſt neglected where there is greateſt Reaſon for the doing of it, I mean at the moſt plentiful <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> and among thoſe of higheſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: As if Great Perſons were aſhamed, or thought ſcorn to own from whence theſe Bleſſings come; like the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom God complains in the <hi>Prophet,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 8. <hi>She knew not that I gave Her Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, and multiplied her Silver and Gold: She knew not,</hi> that is, She would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge from whoſe <hi>Bounty</hi> all theſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34942:25"/>
               <hi>Bleſſings</hi> came: Or, as if the <hi>poor</hi> were obliged to thank God for a little, but thoſe who are <hi>fed to the full,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Cups overflow,</hi> ſo that they are almoſt every day ſurfeited of plenty, were not at leaſt equally bound to make returns of thankful acknowledgment to the <hi>Great Giver</hi> of all good things; and to implore <hi>His</hi> Bounty and Bleſſing, upon whom <hi>the eyes of all do wait,</hi> that <hi>He may give them their meat in due ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O crooked and perverſe Generation!</hi> Do you thus reaſon? <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, fooliſh and unwiſe?</hi> This is a very ſad and broad Sign of the prevalency of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi> among us, when ſo <hi>Natural</hi> and ſo <hi>Reaſonable</hi> a piece of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo meet and equal an acknomledgment of the conſtant and daily Care and Providence of Almighty God towards us begins to grow out of Date and uſe; in a Nation profeſſing Religion, and the Belief of the <hi>Being</hi> and Providence of God. Is it not a righteous thing with God to take away his Bleſſings from us, when we deny Him this juſt and eaſy Tribute of Praiſe and Thankſgiving? <hi>Shall not God viſit for</hi> this horrible <hi>Ingratitude?

               <hi>this? Hear, O Heavens, and be ye horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſtoniſhed at this!</hi> I hope it cannot be thought misbecoming the meaneſt of God's Miniſters, in a matter wherein the Honour of God is ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to reprove, even in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and Greateſt of the Sons of Men, ſo ſhameful and heinous a Fault, with a proportionable Vehemence and Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another, and that alſo a very conſiderable <hi>Part</hi> of this <hi>Duty,</hi> conſiſts in inſtructing thoſe committed to our Charge in the <hi>Fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and in the careful <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>neceſſary Duties</hi> of Religion; inſtilling theſe into <hi>Children</hi> in their tender years, as they are capable of them, <hi>line upon line,</hi> and <hi>precept upon precept, here a little and there a little;</hi> and into thoſe that are more <hi>grown up,</hi> by proper and ſuitable means of inſtruction, and by furniſhing them with ſuch <hi>Books</hi> as are moſt proper to teach them thoſe things in Religion which are moſt neceſſary by all to be believ'd and practis'd.</p>
            <p>And in order hereunto we ſhould take care that thoſe under our Charge, our <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> ſhould be taught to read, becauſe this will make
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34942:26"/>
the buſineſs of Inſtruction much eaſier; ſo that if they are diligent and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd they may, after having been taught the <hi>firſt Principles</hi> of Religion, by reading the <hi>H. Scriptures</hi> and other good <hi>Books,</hi> greatly improve themſelves, ſo as to be prepared to receive much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er benefit and advantage by the publick teaching of their Miniſters.</p>
            <p>And in this work of <hi>Inſtruction</hi> our great care ſhould be to plant thoſe <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of Religion in our <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> which are moſt fundamental and neceſſary, and are like to have the greateſt and moſt laſting influence upon their whole Lives: As right and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Apprehenſions of God, eſpecially of his infinite Goodneſs, and that <hi>He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity:</hi> And a lively ſenſe alſo of the great evil and danger of Sin: A firm belief of the Immortality of our Souls, and of the unſpeakable and endleſs Rewards and Puniſhments of another World. If theſe <hi>Principles</hi> once take root, they will ſpread ſtrangely, and probably ſtick by them and continue with them all their Days.</p>
            <p>Whereas if we plant in them <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> and inculcate
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34942:27"/>
upon them the <hi>Notions</hi> of a <hi>Sect,</hi> and the <hi>Jargon</hi> of a <hi>Party,</hi> this will turn to a very pitiful account, and we muſt expect that our <hi>Harveſt</hi> will be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our <hi>Husbandry: We have ſown the Wind, and ſhall reap the Whirlwind.</hi> But of this I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more particularly and fully in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>Sermons</hi> concerning <hi>the good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this work of <hi>Inſtruction</hi> of thoſe that are under our Charge, as it ought not to be neglected at other Times, ſo is it more peculiarly ſeaſonable on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> which ought to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us to Religious purpoſes, and in the Exerciſes of Piety and Devotion: Chiefly in the <hi>Publick Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of God, upon which we ſhould take care that our <hi>Children</hi> and Servants ſhould diligently and devoutly attend. Becauſe there God affords the <hi>Means</hi> which he hath appointed for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and increaſing of Piety and Goodneſs and to which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a more eſpecial Bleſſing: There they will have the opportunity of joining in the <hi>publick Prayers</hi> of God's Church, and of ſharing in the unſpeakable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t and advantage of them: And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34942:27"/>
there they will alſo have the advantage of being inſtructed by the Miniſters of God in the Doctrine of Salvation, and the way to Eternal Life; and of being powerfully incited to the practice of Piety and Virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There</hi> likewiſe they will be invited to the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> to participate of the <hi>H. Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s moſt bleſſed <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> which being the moſt <hi>Solemn Inſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the frequent participation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is by our <hi>B. Lord,</hi> in remembrance of his <hi>Dying Love,</hi> enjoined upon all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> we ought to take a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care that thoſe who are under our Charge, ſo ſoon as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, be duly inſtructed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it; that ſo as often as Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is offer'd for it, they may be preſent at this Holy Action, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the ineſtimable Benefits and Comforts of it.</p>
            <p>And when the <hi>Publick Worſhip</hi> of <hi>that Day</hi> is over, our Families ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed at <hi>Home,</hi> by having the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> and other good <hi>Books</hi> read to them; and care likewiſe ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that they do this themſelves; this being the chief Opportunity that moſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34942:28"/>
of them, eſpecially thoſe that are <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> have of minding the buſineſs of Religion, and thinking ſeriouſly of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World.</p>
            <p>And therefore I cannot but think it of very great conſequence to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and keeping alive of Religion in the World, that this <hi>Day</hi> be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved, and ſpent as much as may be in the exerciſes of Piety, and in the care of our Souls. For ſurely every one that hath a true ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will grant that it is neceſſary that ſome Time ſhould be ſolemnly ſet apart for this purpoſe, which is of all other our greateſt Concernment: And they who neglect this ſo proper Seaſon and Opportunity, will hardly find any other Time for it: Eſpecially thoſe who are under the Government and Command of others, as <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> who are ſeldom upon any other Day allowed to be ſo much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their Time, as upon <hi>this Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I add further, as a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> if they be deſirous to have their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious in good earneſt and would ſet them forward in the way to Heaven,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34942:28"/>
that they do not only allow them Time and Opportunity, but that they do alſo ſtrictly and earneſtly charge them to retire themſelves every Day, but more eſpecially on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> Morning and Evening, to <hi>pray</hi> to God for the Forgiveneſs of their Sins, and for his mercy and Bleſſing upon them; and likewiſe to <hi>Praiſe</hi> Him for all his Favours and Benefits conferred upon them from Day to Day.</p>
            <p>And in order to this, they ought to take care that their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> be furniſh'd with ſuch ſhort <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe,</hi> as are proper and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their capacities and conditions reſpectively; becauſe there are but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few that know how to ſet about and perform theſe <hi>Duties,</hi> eſpecially at firſt, without ſome <hi>Helps</hi> of this kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> another principal <hi>Part</hi> of this <hi>Duty</hi> conſiſts in giving <hi>good Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mple</hi> to our <hi>Families.</hi> This was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Reſolution, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 2. <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way, I will walk within my Houſe with a perfect heart.</hi> Take great care to be <hi>exemplary</hi> to thy Family in the beſt things; in a conſtant and devout ſerving of God,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34942:29"/>
and in a ſober and prudent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable Converſation.</p>
            <p>One of the beſt and moſt effectual ways to make thoſe who are under our Care and Authority good, is to be good our Selves, and by our good Example to ſhew them the way to be ſo. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this our beſt Inſtructions will ſignify but very little, and the main force and efficacy of them will be loſt. We un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the beſt Inſtructions we can give, when they are not ſeconded and confirmed by our own Example, and Practice. The want of this will weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Authority of all our good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and very little Reverence and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience will be paid to it. The Precepts and Admonitions of a very good Man have in them a great power of Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and are apt ſtrongly to move and to inflame others to <hi>go and do likewiſe:</hi> But the good Inſtructions of a bad Man are languid and faint, and of very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle force; becauſe they give no heart and encouragement to follow that Counſel which they ſee he that gives it does not think fit to take himſelf. But of this likewiſe I ſhall have Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak more fully in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> concerning the <hi>good Education</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:34942:29"/>
               <hi>of Children.</hi> And thus much may ſuffice to have ſpoken of the <hi>Firſt</hi> thing which I propoſed, namely, wherein the Practice of this <hi>Duty</hi> doth conſiſt. I proceed to the <hi>Second,</hi> namely,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider our <hi>Obligation</hi> to it, both in point of <hi>Duty</hi> and of <hi>Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In Point of <hi>Duty.</hi> All Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over others is a <hi>Talent</hi> intruſted with us by God for the benefit and good of others; and for which we are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if we do not improve it and make uſe of it to that end. We are obliged by all lawful means to provide for the <hi>temporal</hi> welfare of our Family, to feed and cloath their <hi>Bodies</hi> and to give them a comfortable Subſiſtence here in the World: And ſurely much more are we obliged to take care of their <hi>Souls,</hi> and to conſult their <hi>eternal</hi> Happineſs in another Life; in compariſon of which all <hi>temporal</hi> Concernments and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations are as nothing.</p>
            <p>It would be accounted a very barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing in a <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Maſter</hi> to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a <hi>Child</hi> to ſtarve for want of the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries</hi> of Life, <hi>food</hi> and <hi>raiment,</hi> and all the World would cry ſhame upon them for it: But how much greater Cruelty muſt it in reaſon be thought to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34942:30"/>
let an <hi>immortal</hi> Soul, and one <hi>for whom Chriſt died,</hi> periſh for want of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Inſtruction</hi> for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of <hi>eternal Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> thinks no words bad enough for thoſe who neglect the <hi>temporal</hi> welfare of their Families, <hi>He that provideth not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for his own, eſpecially for thoſe of his own Houſe, hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,</hi> that is, he does not deſerve the Name of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who neglects a Duty to which from the plain Dictates of <hi>Nature</hi> a <hi>Heathen</hi> thinks himſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. What then ſhall be ſaid for them who take no care to provide for the everlaſting Happineſs, and to prevent the eternal Miſery and Ruin of thoſe who are ſo immediately under their Charge, and ſo very nearly related to them?</p>
            <p>We are obliged to procure the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our <hi>Children</hi> not only by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but likewiſe by all the <hi>Natural</hi> bonds of <hi>Duty</hi> and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For our Children are a part of our Selves, and if they periſh by our fault and neglect, it will be a perpetual Wound and Sting to us; their Blood will be upon our heads, and the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34942:30"/>
guilt of it will for ever lye at our doors.</p>
            <p>Nay, we are obliged likewiſe in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and by way of Reparation, to take all poſſible care of their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for we have conveyed a ſad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to them, in thoſe corrupt and evil inclinations which they have deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from us: And therefore we ſhould with the greateſt care and diligence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to rectify their perverſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to cure thoſe curſed diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to evil which we have tranſmitted to them: And ſince God hath been pleaſed in ſo much mercy to provide, by the abundant <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſo powerful a <hi>Remedy</hi> for this <hi>hereditary Diſeaſe</hi> of our corrupt and degenerate Nature, we ſhould do what in us lies, that they may partake of the Bleſſing and Benefit of it.</p>
            <p>And as to other Members of our Family, whether they be <hi>Servants,</hi> or other <hi>Relations</hi> of whom we have taken the Charge; common <hi>Humanity</hi> will oblige us to be concerned for their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs as they are <hi>Men</hi> and of the ſame Nature with our Selves; and <hi>Charity</hi> likewiſe, as they are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> into the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> and capable of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34942:31"/>
the ſame <hi>common Salvation,</hi> does yet more ſtrictly oblige us by all means to endeavour that they may be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it; eſpecially ſince they are committed to our Care, and for that reaſon we muſt expect to be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God for them.</p>
            <p>So that our <hi>Obligation</hi> in point of <hi>Duty</hi> is very clear and ſtrong, and if we be remiſs and negligent in the diſcharge of it we can never anſwer it either to God, or to our own Conſciences: Which I hope will awaken us all who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it to the ſerious conſideration of it, and effectually engage us for the future to the faithful and conſcientious performance of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are hereto likewiſe <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> in point of <hi>Intereſt;</hi> becauſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for our ſervice and advantage that thoſe that belong to us ſhould ſerve and fear God: Religion being the beſt and ſureſt Foundation of the <hi>Duties</hi> of all <hi>Relations,</hi> and the beſt Caution and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the true diſcharge and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them.</p>
            <p>Would we have dutiful and obedient <hi>Children,</hi> diligent and faithful <hi>Servants?</hi> Nothing will ſo effectually oblige them to be ſo, as the Fear of God and the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34942:31"/>
Principles of Religion firmly ſettled and rooted in them. <hi>Abraham</hi> who by the Teſtimony of God himſelf was ſo eminent an Example in this kind, both of a good <hi>Father</hi> and a good <hi>Maſter</hi> of his Family, found the good ſucceſs of his Religious care in the happy effects of it, both upon his <hi>Son Iſaac,</hi> and his chief <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Steward</hi> of his Houſe, <hi>Eliezer</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What an unexampled Inſtance of the moſt profound reſpect and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Commands of his Father did <hi>Iſaac</hi> give, when without the leaſt murmuring or reluctancy he ſubmitted to be bound and laid upon the Altar, and to have been ſlain for a Sacrifice; if God had not by an Angel, ſent on purpoſe, interpoſed to prevent it?</p>
            <p>What an admirable <hi>Servant</hi> to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was the Steward of his Houſe, <hi>Eliezer</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus?</hi> How diligent and faithful was he in his <hi>Maſter</hi>'s ſervice? So that he truſted him in his greateſt Concernments and with all that he had. And when he employed him in that great Affair of the Marriage of his <hi>Son Iſaac,</hi> what pains did he take, what prudence did he uſe, what fidelity did he ſhew in the diſcharge of that great
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34942:32"/>
Truſt, giving himſelf no reſt till he had accompliſh'd the Buſineſs he was ſent about? God ſeems purpoſely to have left theſe two <hi>Inſtances</hi> upon Record in <hi>Scripture,</hi> to encourage <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of Families to a Religious care of their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſhew the power of Religion to oblige men to their Duty, I will add but one Inſtance more. How did the Fear of God ſecure <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s fidelity to his <hi>Maſter,</hi> in the Caſe of a very great and violent Temptation? When there was nothing elſe to reſtrain him from ſo lewd and wicked an act and to which he was ſo powerfully tempted, the conſideration of the great truſt his Maſter repoſed in him and the ſenſe of his Duty to him, but above all the <hi>Fear of God</hi> preſerved him from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to ſo vile and wicked an action, <hi>How can I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in prudence, and from a wiſe conſideration of the great benefit and advantage which will thereby redound to us, we ought with the greateſt care to inſtill the Principles of Religion into thoſe that belong to us. For if the Seeds of true Piety be ſown in them,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34942:32"/>
we ſhall reap the fruits of it: And if this be neglected, we ſhall certainly find the miſchief and inconvenience of it. If out <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> be not taught to fear and reverence God, how can we expect that they ſhould reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and regard us? at leaſt we can have no ſure hold of them. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Religion lays an obligation upon Conſcience, nor is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certain bond of Duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Fidelity: Men will break looſe from all other Ties when a fit Occaſion and a fair Opportunity doth ſtrongly tempt them. And as Religion is neceſſary to procure the favour of God and all the comfort and happineſs which that brings along with it, ſo it is neceſſary likewiſe to ſecure the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Duties and Offices of men to one another. I proceed to the <hi>Third</hi> thing which I propoſed, namely,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To enquire into the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the ſo common and ſhameful <hi>Neglect</hi> of this <hi>Duty,</hi> to the exceeding great decay of Piety among us. And this may in part be aſcribed to our Civil Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Diſtractions, but chiefly to our Diſſentions and Differences in Religion,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34942:33"/>
which have not only divided and ſcattered our <hi>Parochial</hi> Churches and <hi>Congregations,</hi> but have entred like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe into our <hi>Families,</hi> and made great diſturbances and diſorders there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This may in good part be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to our <hi>Civil</hi> Confuſions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, which for the time do lay all <hi>Laws</hi> aſleep, and do not only occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a general Licentiouſneſs and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of Manners, but have uſually a proportionable bad in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>luence upon the order and Government of <hi>Families;</hi> by weakning the Authority of thoſe that Govern, and by giving the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of greater Licenſe to thoſe that ſhould be <hi>governed:</hi> For when <hi>publick Laws</hi> loſe their Authority, it is hard to maintain and keep up the ſtrict <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> which after great and long Diſorder are very hard to be retriev'd and recover'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This great Neglect and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Religious Order in Families is chiefly owing to our Diſſentions and Differences in Religion, upon occaſion whereof many under the pretence of Conſcience have broke looſe into a boundleſs Liberty. So that among the manifold ill Conſequences of our <hi>Diviſions</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34942:33"/>
in Religion this is none of the leaſt, that the Religious Order of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies hath been in a great meaſure broken and diſſolved. Some will not meet at the ſame <hi>Prayers</hi> in the <hi>Family,</hi> nor go to the ſame <hi>Church</hi> and Place of <hi>publick Worſhip;</hi> and upon that pretence take the liberty to do what they pleaſe, and under colour of ſerving God in a different way according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, do either wholly or in great meaſure neglect the Worſhip of God; nay, it is well if they do not at that <hi>Time</hi> haunt and frequent Places of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery and Lewdneſs; which they may ſafely do, being from under the eye of their <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Maſters:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by this means it becomes impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the moſt careful <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> to take an account of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Charge how they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pend their time on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> and to train them up in any certain and orderly way of Religion.</p>
            <p>And this methinks is ſo great and ſenſible an inconvenience, and hath had ſuch diſmal effects in many Families, as ought effectually to convince us of the neceſſity of endeavouring a greater Union in matters of Religion; and to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34942:34"/>
put us in mind of thoſe happy Days when God was ſerved in one way, and whole Families <hi>went to the Houſe of God in Companies;</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> had their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually under their eye, and they were all united in their Worſhip and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both in their own Houſes and in the Houſe of God; and by this means the Work of Religious Education and Inſtruction was effectually carried on, and a ſteddy Authority and decent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was maintained in Families; men were edified and built up in Religion, and <hi>God in all things</hi> was <hi>glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we may aſſure our ſelves, that till we are better agreed in matters of Religion, and our unhappy and childiſh Differences are laid aſide; and till the Publick and unanimous Worſhip of God do in ſome meaſure recover its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, the good Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Families as to the great ends of Religion is never likely to obtain and to have any conſiderable effect. Which I hope will make all men who heartily love God and Religion, to conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly how neceſſary it is to put an end to theſe Differences; that in our private Families, as well as in the publick
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34942:34"/>
Aſſemblies of the Church, we may <hi>with one mind and with one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore Brethren, <hi>as St.</hi> Paul <hi>exhorts the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>1 Cor. 1. 10.</hi> by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you, but that ye be perfectly joined together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment, <hi>that is, ſo far as is neceſſary to the</hi> keeping of the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, <hi>and to prevent</hi> Diviſions <hi>and</hi> Separations <hi>among</hi> Chriſtians. <hi>I proceed to the</hi> Fourth <hi>and laſt thing I propoſed, and which remains to be very briefly ſpoken to, namely,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. The very miſchievous and fatal <hi>Conſequences</hi> of the neglect of this <hi>Duty,</hi> both to the <hi>Publick,</hi> and to <hi>our Selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To the <hi>Publick. Families</hi> are the firſt <hi>Seminaries</hi> of Religion, and if care be not there taken to prepare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, eſpecially in their tender years, for publick teaching and inſtruction, it is like to have but very little effect. The neglect of a due preparation of our Children and Servants at <hi>home,</hi> to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34942:35"/>
make them capable of profiting by what they hear and may learn at <hi>Church,</hi> is like an error in the firſt Concoction which can hardly ever be corrected af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. So that in this firſt neglect the foundation of an infinite Miſchief is laid; becauſe if no care be taken of perſons in their younger years, when they are moſt capable of the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion, how can it reaſonably be expected that they ſhould come to good afterwards? And if they continue void of the Fear of God, which there hath been no care taken to plant in them, they will almoſt neceſſarily be bad in all Relations; undutiful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſlothful and unfaithful Servants, ſcandalous Members of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to the Commonwealth, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to Governours both Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical and Civil; and in a word, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of the Earth, and ſo many Plagues of Human Society: And this Evil, if no Remedy be applied to it, will continually grow worſe, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and ſpread it ſelf farther in every Age, till Impiety and Wickedneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and Profaneneſs have over-run all, and the World be ripe for its final Ruin: Juſt as it was before the Deſtruction
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34942:35"/>
of the Old World, when <hi>the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of Man was great upon the Earth,</hi> and <hi>all Fleſh had corrupted their way,</hi> then <hi>the Flood came and ſwept them all away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Conſequences</hi> of this <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect</hi> will likewiſe be very diſmal to <hi>our Selves.</hi> We ſhall firſt of all others feel the <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> as we had the greateſt ſhare in the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it. We can have no manner of ſecurity of the Duty and Fidelity of thoſe of our Family to us, if they have no ſenſe of Religion, no fear of God before their eyes. If we have taken no care to inſtruct them in their Duty to God, it is no-wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they will make Conſcience of their Duty to us.</p>
            <p>So that we ſhall have the firſt ill <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> of their Miſcarriage; beſides the <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> of it: And not only ſo, but all the evil they commit ever after, will be in a great meaſure chargeable upon us, and will be put upon our ſcore in the Judgment of the Great Day. It ought to make us trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think with what bitterneſs and Rage our Children and Servants will then fly in our faces, for having been the Cauſe of their eternal Ruin, for want of due care on our part to prevent
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34942:36"/>
it. In <hi>that Day,</hi> next to <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>own Conſciences,</hi> our moſt terrible <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers</hi> will be thoſe of our own <hi>Houſe,</hi> nay thoſe that came out of our own <hi>Bowels,</hi> and were not only Part of our <hi>Family,</hi> but even of our <hi>Selves.</hi> But this alſo I ſhall have a proper Occaſion to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute more fully in the following <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> concerning the <hi>Education of Children,</hi> to which I refer it.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe Conſiderations and many more that might be urged upon us, we ſhould take up the pious Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Joſhua</hi> here in the Text, that <hi>We and OUR HOUSES will ſerve the Lord:</hi> And that, through God's Grace, we will do all that in us lies by our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Care and Diligence to repair our former neglects in this kind.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add this one <hi>Conſideration</hi> more to all that I have already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: If <hi>Children</hi> were carefully educated, and <hi>Families</hi> regularly and Religiouſly ordered, what a happy and delightful Place, what a Paradiſe would this World be, in compariſon of what now it is?</p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore <hi>Brethren,</hi> that theſe things which I have with ſo much plainneſs and faithfulneſs laid before
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34942:36"/>
you, may ſink into your hearts, before it be too late, and whilſt the thing may be remedied; that you may not for ever lament this neglect and repent of it, when the thing will be paſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and there will be no place for Repentance. <hi>But I hope better things of you, Brethren, and things that accompany Salvation, though I thus ſpeak.</hi>

            <head>SERMON I. OF THE Education of Children.</head>

               <bibl>PROV. XXII. 6.</bibl>
               <q>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have on purpoſe choſen this <hi>Text</hi> for the ſubject of a Preparatory Diſcourſe in order to the reviving of that ſo ſhamefully neglected and yet moſt uſeful and neceſſary Duty of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing</hi> children and young perſons: But I ſhall extend it to the conſideration of the <hi>Education</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> in general, as a matter of the greateſt conſequence both to Religion and the Publick wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
            <p>For we who are the Miniſters of God ought not only to inſtruct thoſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34942:38"/>
who are committed to our charge in the common Duties of Chriſtianity, ſuch as belong to all Chriſtians, but likewiſe in all the particular Duties which the ſeveral Relations in which they ſtand to one another do reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require and call for from them.</p>
            <p>And amongſt all theſe I know none that is of greater concernment to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and to the good Order of the World than the careful Education of Children. And there is hardly any thing that is more difficult, and which requires a more prudent and diligent and conſtant application of our beſt care and endeavour.</p>
            <p>It is a known Saying of <hi>Melancthon</hi> that there are three things which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult, <hi>parturire, docere, regere;</hi> to <hi>bear and bring forth Children,</hi> to <hi>inſtruct and bring them up to be Men,</hi> and <hi>to govern them when they arrive at Man's eſtate. The inſtruction</hi> and <hi>good Education of Children</hi> is none of the leaſt difficult of theſe. For to do it to the beſt advantage does not only require great ſagacity to diſcern their particular diſpoſition and temper, but great diſcretion to deal with them and manage them, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe continual care and diligent attendance
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34942:38"/>
to form them by degrees to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Virtue.</p>
            <p>It requires great wiſdom and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to advance a conſiderable Eſtate, much art and contrivance and pains to raiſe a great and regular Building: But the greateſt and nobleſt Work in the World, and an effect of the greateſt prudence and care is to rear and build up a Man, and to form and faſhion him to Piety, and Juſtice, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and all kind of honeſt and worthy actions. Now the Foundations of this great Work are to be carefully laid in the tender years of Children, that it may riſe and grow up with them; according to the advice of the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> here in the <hi>Text, Train up a Child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words are contained theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Duty of Parents and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructers of Children, <hi>Train up a Child,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>Childhood</hi> here I underſtand the Age of Perſons from their Birth, but more eſpecially from their firſt capacity of Inſtruction till they arrive at the State and Age which next ſucceeds <hi>Childhood,</hi> and which we call Youth;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34942:39"/>
and which is the proper Seaſon for <hi>Confirmation.</hi> For when Children have been well <hi>Catechiſed</hi> and inſtructed in Religion, then is the fitteſt Time for them to take upon themſelves and in their own Perſons to confirm that <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vow</hi> which by their <hi>Sureties</hi> they made at their <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Train up a Child in the way he ſhould go,</hi> that is, in the courſe of Life that he ought to lead; inſtruct him carefully in the knowledge and practice of his whole duty to God and Men, which he ought to obſerve and perform all the days of his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is the conſequent fruit and benefit of good Education: <hi>And when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi> This we are to underſtand according to the moral probability of things: Not as if this happy effect did always and infallibly follow upon the good Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Child, but that this very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is, and may probably be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and hoped to be the fruit and effect of a pious and prudent Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Solomon</hi> means that from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature of the thing this is the moſt hopeful and likely way to train up a Child to be a good Man. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:34942:39"/>
truly obſerves, <hi>Moral Sayings</hi> and <hi>Proverbial Speeches</hi> are to be underſtood only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, to be uſually and <hi>for the moſt part</hi> true. And though there may be ſeveral <hi>exceptions</hi> made, and <hi>inſtances</hi> given to the contrary, yet this doth not infringe the general truth of them: But if in frequent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience they be found true, this is all the truth that is expected in them, becauſe it is all that was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them.</p>
            <p>And of this nature is this <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> or <hi>Proverb</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the <hi>Text;</hi> and ſo likewiſe are moſt of the <hi>wiſe Sayings</hi> of this <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaſiſtes:</hi> And we do greatly miſtake the deſign and meaning of them when ever we go about to exact them to a more ſtrict and rigorous truth, and ſhall upon due conſideration find it impoſſible to bring them to it.</p>

In the handling of this Argument I deſign, by God's aſſiſtance, to reduce my Diſcourſe to theſe <hi>Five</hi> Heads.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>In the tender and careful nurſing of Children.</hi> I mention this firſt, becauſe it is the firſt and moſt natural Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon Parents towards their Children: And this is particularly the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34942:41"/>
Duty of Mothers. This affection and tenderneſs, Nature which is our ſureſt guide and director, hath implanted in all living Creatures towards their young ones: And there cannot be a greater reproach to Creatures that are endued with Reaſon, than to neglect a Duty to which Nature directs even the Brute Creatures by a blind and unthinking Inſtinct. So that it is ſuch a Duty as cannot be neglected without a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right affront to Nature, and from which nothing can excuſe but <hi>diſability,</hi> or <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> or the <hi>evident danger</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or the <hi>interpoſition</hi> of the <hi>Father's Authority,</hi> or ſome very <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>publick neceſſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I foreſee will ſeem a very <hi>hard Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to nice and delicate Mothers, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their own eaſe and pleaſure to the fruit of their own Bodies: But whether they will hear, or whether they will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, I think my ſelfobliged to deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this matter, and to be ſo faithful as to tell them that this is a natural Duty; and becauſe it is ſo, of a more neceſſary and indiſpenſable obligation than any <hi>poſitive</hi> Precept of <hi>reveal'd</hi> Religion; and that the general neglect of it is one of the great and crying Sins of this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34942:42"/>
Age and Nation; and which as much as any Sin whatſoever is evidently a puniſhment to it ſelf in the palpable ill effects and conſequences of it: Which I ſhall, as briefly as I can, endeavour to repreſent; that if it be poſſible, we may in this firſt Point of Education, ſo fundamental and neceſſary to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs both of Parents and Children, and conſequently to the Publick Good of Human Society, be brought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the uner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It always expoſeth them to manifeſt inconvenience, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to great danger; even to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as in the conſequence of it is but little better than the laying a Child in the Streets, and leaving it to the care and compaſſion of a Pariſh.

            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> A ſhameful and dangerous ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the Child, eſpecially by ſuch Nurſes as make a Trade of it; of whom there are great numbers in and about this great City: Who after they have made their firſt and main advantage of the Child, by the exceſſive, not to ſay extravagant <hi>vailes,</hi> which uſually here in <hi>England,</hi> above all places in the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> And then by the ſtrait allowances which are commonly made afterwards for the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and keeping of the Child, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tempted, not to ſay worſe, to a great neglect of the Child; which, if it happen to dye for want of due care, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ets the Nurſe at liberty to make a new advantage by taking another Child.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:34942:43"/>
Nor can it well be otherwiſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted than that a Nurſe, who by this courſe is firſt made to be unnatural to her own Child, ſhould have no great care and tenderneſs for a Child which is not her own.</p>
            <p>I have heard a very ſad Obſervation made by thoſe who have had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to know it, that in ſeveral of the <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Villages</hi> about <hi>London,</hi> where this Trade of nurſing Children is chiefly driven, hardly one in five of theſe Children lives out the year: And this ſurely is a danger which natural affection as well as duty does oblige Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to take all poſſible care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This courſe doth moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tend very much to the eſtranging and weakning of natural affection on both ſides; I mean both on the part of the Mother and of the Child. The pains of nurſing as well as of bearing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doth inſenſibly create a ſtrange tenderneſs of affection and care in the Mother. <hi>Can a woman,</hi> ſays God, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb?</hi> Iſa. 49. 15. <hi>Can a Woman?</hi> that is, a <hi>Mother,</hi> not a <hi>Nurſe;</hi> for the <hi>ſucking</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:34942:43"/>
               <hi>child</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>the ſon of her womb.</hi> God ſpeaks of this as a thing next to impoſſible.</p>
            <p>And this likewiſe is a great endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Mother to the Child: Which endearment, when the Child is put out, is transferr'd from the Mother to the Nurſe, and many times continues to be ſo for a great many years after; yea, and often to that degree as if the Nurſe were the true Mother, and the true Mother a meer ſtranger. So that by this means natural affection muſt be extremely weaken'd; which is great pity, becauſe when it is kept up in its full ſtrength it often proves one of the beſt ſecurities of the Duty of a Child.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this ſevere Doctrine will go down but very hardly with a great many, I muſt take the more care to guard it againſt the <hi>Objections</hi> which will be made to it. Thoſe from <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſability,</hi> or <hi>ſickneſs;</hi> from <hi>evident</hi> and apparent <hi>danger</hi> of the <hi>Mother,</hi> or from the <hi>interpoſition</hi> of the <hi>Father's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> or from <hi>plain neceſſity;</hi> or if there be any other that have an equal Reaſon with theſe, I have prevented already by allowing them to be juſt and reaſonable <hi>exceptions</hi> from the general
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34942:44"/>
               <hi>Rule,</hi> when they are real, and not made <hi>Pretences</hi> to ſhake off our <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are beſides theſe, <hi>two</hi> Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which indeed are real, but yet ſeem to have too great a weight with thoſe who would fain decline this Duty, and are by no means ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Mothers, no not thoſe of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rank and Quality, from the natural obligation of it. And they are theſe. The <hi>manifeſt trouble,</hi> and the <hi>manifold reſtraint</hi> which the careful diſcharge of this Duty does unavoidably bring upon thoſe who ſubmit themſelves to it.</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> For the <hi>trouble</hi> of it, I have only this to ſay, and I think that no more need to be ſaid about it; that no body is diſcharged from any Duty by reaſon of the trouble which neceſſarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, and is inſeparable from it; ſince God who made it a Duty foreſaw the trouble of it when he made it ſo.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> As to the <hi>manifold reſtraint</hi> which it lays upon Mothers; this will beſt be anſwer'd by conſidering of what nature theſe <hi>reſtraints</hi> are. And they are chiefly in theſe and the like inſtances. This Duty reſtrains Mothers from ſpending their Morning and their Money in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and coſtly Dreſſing; from miſſpending
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34942:44"/>
the reſt of the Day in formal and for the moſt part impertinent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, and in ſeeing and hearing Plays, many of which are neither fit to be ſeen or heard by modeſt Perſons and thoſe who pretend to Religion and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; as I hope all Chriſtians do, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Perſons of higher Rank and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: And it reſtrains them likewiſe from trifling away a great part of the Night in Gaming, and in Revelling till paſt Midnight, I am loth to ſay how much.</p>
            <p>Theſe are thoſe terrible <hi>reſtraints</hi> which this natural Duty, of Mothers nurſing their Children, lays upon them. Now I cannot but think all theſe to be very happy <hi>reſtraints:</hi> Happy ſurely for the <hi>Child;</hi> and in many reſpects happy for the <hi>Father,</hi> and for the whole <hi>Family,</hi> which by this means will be kept in much better order: But happieſt of all for the Mother, who does herein not only diſcharge a great and neceſſary Duty, but is hereby alſo hinder'd from running into many great Faults, which before they will be forgiven muſt coſt her a deep Contrition, and a very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:34942:45"/>
Perhaps I may have gone further in this unuſual Argument, than will pleaſe the preſent Age: But I hope Poſterity will be ſo wiſe as to conſider it and lay it to heart. For I am greatly afraid that the World will never be much better till this great Fault be mended. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the next <hi>Particular</hi> wherein the good Education of Children doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, namely</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>In bringing them to be Baptized and admitted Members of Chriſt's Church,</hi> at the times appointed or accuſtomed in the National Church of which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are Members. I mean, to bring them to the Church to be there pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly <hi>initiated,</hi> and ſolemnly admitted by <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> And this the Rules of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do ſtrictly enjoyn, unleſs the Child be in danger of death; and in that caſe only it is allow'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Baptiſm privately, and in a ſummary way without performing the whole <hi>Office:</hi> But then if the Child live, it is ordered that it ſhall be brought to the Church, where the remainder of the <hi>Office</hi> is to be ſolemnly perform'd.</p>
            <p>I know that of late years, ſince our unhappy <hi>Confuſions,</hi> this <hi>Sacrament</hi> hath
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34942:45"/>
very frequently been adminiſtred in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: And <hi>Miniſters</hi> have been in a manner, and to avoid the greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of <hi>Separation,</hi> neceſſitated to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the obſtinacy of the greater and more powerful of their <hi>Pariſhioners;</hi> who for their eaſe, or humour, or for the convenience of a pompous <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> will either have their Children bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized at home by their <hi>Miniſter;</hi> or if he refuſe, will get ſome other <hi>Miniſter</hi> to do it; which is very irregular.</p>
            <p>Now I would intreat ſuch perſons calmly to conſider how contrary to Reaſon, and to the plain deſign of the inſtitution of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe cuſtom, and their obſtinate reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in it, is. For is there any <hi>Civil Society</hi> or <hi>Corporation</hi> into which perſons are admitted without ſome kind of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity?</hi> And is the <hi>Privilege</hi> of being admitted <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> and <hi>Heirs</hi> of the great and glorious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> and <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> leſs conſiderable and fit to be conferr'd with leſs Solemnity? I ſpeak to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and they who are ſo in good earneſt, will without my uſing more words about it, conſider what I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y in this Particular.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:34942:46"/>
III. Another and very neceſſary Part of the good Education of Children is, <hi>by degrees to inform and carefully to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the whole compaſs of their Duty to God, their Neighbour,</hi> and <hi>Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> That ſo they may be taught how to behave themſelves in all the ſteps of their Life, from their firſt capacity of Reaſon till they arrive at the more perfect uſe and exerciſe of that Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; when, if at firſt they be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, they will be better able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and govern themſelves afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Duty God does expreſly and very particularly charge upon his own peculiar People, the People of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſpeaking of the</hi> Laws <hi>which he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them:</hi> Duet. <hi>6. 7,</hi> Thou ſhalt, <hi>ſays He,</hi> teach them diligently unto thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way; when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up. <hi>And this God long before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that</hi> Abraham the Father of the faithful, <hi>would do.</hi> Gen. <hi>18. 19.</hi> I know Abraham, <hi>ſays He,</hi> that he will command his Children and his Houſhold after him to keep the way of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:34942:46"/>
               <hi>This Work ought to be begun very early, upon the firſt budding and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Reaſon and Underſtanding in Children. So the</hi> Prophet <hi>directs; Iſa. 28. 9, 10.</hi> Whom ſhall he teach know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Whom ſhall he make to underſtand doctrine? Them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breaſts: For precept muſt be upon precept, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this end we muſt, by ſuch degrees as they are capable, bring them acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God and themſelves. And in the firſt place we muſt inform them, that there is ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> whom we ought to honour and reverence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things? And then, that we are all his Creatures and the work of his hands, that <hi>it is He that hath made us, and not we our ſelves:</hi> That He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually preſerves us, and gives us all the good things that we enjoy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to ask every thing of Him by Prayer, becauſe this is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of our dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him; and to return <hi>thanks</hi> to Him for all that we have and hope for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is a juſt and eaſy Tribute, and all that we can render to Him for his numberleſs favours and benefits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:34942:47"/>
And after this, they are to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more particularly in their Duty to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew more fully afterwards. And becauſe <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are the two <hi>Paſſions</hi> which do chiefly ſway and govern Human Nature, and the main ſprings and Principles of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore Children are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inform'd that there is a Life after Death, wherein men ſhall receive from God a mighty and eternal Reward, or a terrible and endleſs Puniſhment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they have done or neglected their Duty in this Life: That God will love and reward thoſe who do his will and keep his commandments, but will execute a dreadful puniſhment upon the workers of iniquity and the wilful tranſgreſſors of his Laws.</p>
            <p>And, according as they are capable, they are to be made ſenſible of the great degeneracy and corruption of Human Nature, derived to us by the <hi>Fall</hi> and wilful tranſgreſſion of our <hi>firſt Parents;</hi> and of the way of our <hi>Recovery</hi> out of this miſerable ſtate by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> whom God hath ſent in our Nature to purchaſe and accompliſh the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation of Mankind, from the Captivity of Sin and <hi>Satan,</hi> and from the Damnation of Hell.</p>

The good Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren conſiſts not only in informing their Minds in the knowledge of God and their Duty, but more eſpecially <hi>in endeavouring with the greateſt care and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to form their Lives and Manners to Religion and Virtue.</hi> And this muſt be done by training them up to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the following <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To the good government of their <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and of their <hi>Tongue;</hi> and particularly to <hi>ſpeak truth,</hi> and to hate <hi>Lying</hi> as a baſe and vile quality; theſe being as it were the <hi>foundations</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God;</hi> to <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity</hi> with regard to <hi>themſelves;</hi> and to <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> towards all men; as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and eſſential <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:34942:48"/>
1<hi>ſt.</hi> To <hi>Obedience.</hi> Parents muſt take great care to maintain their Authority over their Children; otherwiſe they will neither regard their Commands, nor hearken to and follow their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. If they once get head and grow ſtubborn and diſobedient, there is very little hope left of doing any great good upon them.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> To <hi>Modeſty,</hi> which is a fear of <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Diſgrace.</hi> This <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> which is proper to Children, is a marvellous advantage to all good purpoſes. They are <hi>modeſt,</hi> ſays <hi>Ariſtotle, who are afraid to offend, and they are afraid to offend who are moſt apt to do it;</hi> as Children are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are much under the power of their <hi>Paſſions,</hi> without a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſtrength of <hi>Reaſon</hi> to govern them and keep them under.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Modeſty</hi> is not properly a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> but it is a very good Sign of a tractable and towardly <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> and a great preſervative and ſecurity againſt <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Vice:</hi> And thoſe Children, who are much under the reſtraint of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> we look upon as moſt hopeful and likely to prove good: Whereas <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty</hi> is a vicious temper broke looſe and got free from all reſtraint: So that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34942:48"/>
there is nothing left to keep an <hi>impudent</hi> perſon from Sin, when fear of <hi>Shame</hi> is gone: For <hi>Sin</hi> will ſoon take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that perſon whom <hi>Shame</hi> hath left. He that is once become ſhameleſs hath proſtituted himſelf. Therefore preſerve this <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> in Children as much as is poſſible, as one of the beſt means to preſerve their innocency, and to bring them to goodneſs.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> To <hi>diligence, ſine quâ vir mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus nunquam extitit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> without which,</hi> ſays one, <hi>there never was any great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſon.</hi> When the <hi>Roman Hiſtorians</hi> deſcribe an extraordinary man, this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enters into his Character as an eſſential part of it, that he was <hi>incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili induſtriâ, diligentiâ ſingulari,</hi> of <hi>incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible induſtry, of ſingular diligence;</hi> or ſomething to that purpoſe. And indeed a Perſon can neither be excellently good, nor extremely bad without this quality. The <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf could not be ſo bad and miſchievous as he is, if he were not ſo ſtirring and reſtleſs a Spirit, and did not <hi>compaſs the Earth</hi> and <hi>go to and fro ſeeking whom he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is part of the Character of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> and <hi>Cataline,</hi> thoſe great
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34942:49"/>
Diſturbers of the <hi>Roman</hi> State; as well as of <hi>Ceſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> who were much greater and better men, but yet gave trouble enough to their Countrey, and at laſt diſſolved the <hi>Roman</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, by their Ambition and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Superiority: This, I ſay, enters into all their Characters, that they were of a vigorous and indefatigable ſpirit. So that <hi>Diligence</hi> in it ſelf is neither a <hi>Virtue</hi> nor a <hi>Vice,</hi> but may be applied either way, to good or bad purpoſes; and yet where all other requiſites do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur it is a very proper <hi>Inſtrument</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> for <hi>Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore train up Children to <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> if ever you deſire they ſhould excel in any kind. <hi>The diligent hand,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10. 4. <hi>Rich</hi> in eſtate, <hi>Rich</hi> in knowledge. <hi>Seeſt thou a man diligent in his buſineſs,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> obſerves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 29. <hi>he ſhall ſtand before Princes, he ſhall not ſtand before mean,</hi> or obſcure <hi>men.</hi> And again, Prov. 12. 24. <hi>The hand of the diligent ſhall bear rule, but the ſlothful ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Tribute. Diligence</hi> puts almoſt every thing into our power, and will in time make Children capable of the beſt and greateſt things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:34942:49"/>
Whereas <hi>Idleneſs</hi> is the bane and ruin of Children; it is the unbending of their Spirits, the <hi>Ruſt</hi> of their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and as it were the laying of their Minds <hi>fallow;</hi> not as Husbandmen do their Lands that they may get new heart and ſtrength, but to impair and loſe that which they have. Children that are bred up in lazineſs are almoſt neceſſarily bad, becauſe they cannot take the pains to be good; and they cannot take pains, becauſe they have never been inured and accuſtomed to it; which makes their Spirits <hi>reſtive,</hi> and when you have occaſion to quicken them and ſpur them up to buſineſs they will ſtand ſtock ſtill.</p>
            <p>Therefore never let your Children be without a <hi>Calling,</hi> or without ſome uſeful, or at leaſt innocent employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will take them up; that they may not be put upon a kind of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of being <hi>vicious</hi> for want of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better to do. The <hi>Devil</hi> tempts the active and vigorous into his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, knowing what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

them as <hi>he goes about;</hi> and they do as it were offer themſelves to his ſervice, and having nothing to do they even tempt the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf to tempt <hi>them,</hi> and to take them in his way.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> To <hi>ſincerity;</hi> which is not ſo properly a ſingle Virtue, as the life and ſoul of all other Graces and Virtues; and without which, what ſhew of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſoever a man may make, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ound and rotten at the heart. Cheriſh therefore this diſpoſition in Children, as that which when they come to be men will be the great ſecurity and ornament of their lives, and will render them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable both to God and Men.</p>
            <p>5<hi>thly.</hi> To <hi>tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>pity:</hi> Which, when they come to engage in buſineſs and to have dealings in the World, will be a good bar againſt Injuſtice and Oppreſſion; and will be continually prompting us to Charity, and will fetch powerful Arguments for it from our own bowels.</p>
            <p>To preſerve this goodneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of nature, this ſo very human and uſeful affection, keep Children, as much as is poſſible, out of the way of <hi>bloody Sights</hi> and <hi>Spectacles</hi> of cruelty; and diſcountenance in them all cruel

and barbarous uſage of Creatures under their power: do not allow them to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kill them for their ſport and pleaſure; becauſe this will inſenſibly and by degrees hard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n their hearts, and make them leſs apt to compaſſionate the wants of the poor and the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and afflictions of the miſerable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the main <hi>Foundations</hi> of Religion and Vertue, Children muſt be carefully train'd up to the Government of their <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and of their <hi>Tongues;</hi> and particularly to <hi>ſpeak truth,</hi> and to hate <hi>lying</hi> as a baſe and vile quality.</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> To the good Government of their <hi>Paſſions.</hi> It is the diſorder of theſe, more eſpecially of <hi>Deſire,</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> which betrays us to many evils<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Anger</hi> prompts men to <hi>contention</hi> and <hi>murther:</hi> Inordinate <hi>Deſire,</hi> to <hi>covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion:</hi> And <hi>Fear</hi> many times awes men into Sin, and deters them from their Duty.</p>
            <p>Now if theſe <hi>Paſſions</hi> be cheriſh'd, or even but let alone in Children, they will in a ſhort time grow headſtrong and unruly, and when they come to be men will corrupt the judgment, and turn good nature into humour, and the underſtanding into prejudice and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34942:51"/>
wilfulneſs: But if they be carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and prudently reſtrained, they may by degrees be managed and brought under government; and the inordinacy of them being prun'd away, they may prove excellent Inſtruments<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Virtue.</p>
            <p>Therefore be careful to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in Children any thing that looks like Rage and furious Anger, and to ſhew them the unreaſonableneſs and deformity of it. Check their longing Deſires after things pleaſant, and uſe them to frequent diſappointments in that kind; that when you think fit to gratify them they may take it for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and not challenge every thing they have a mind to as their due; and by degrees may learn to ſubmit to the more prudent choice of their Parents, as being much better able to judge what is good and fit for them.</p>
            <p>And when you ſee them at any time apt out of <hi>Fear</hi> to neglect their Duty, or to fall into any Sin, or to be tempted by telling a Lye to commit one fault to hide and excuſe another, which Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are very apt to do: The beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of this Evil will be to plant a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34942:51"/>
greater Fear againſt a leſs, and to tell them <hi>what</hi> and <hi>whom</hi> they ſhould chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>fear; not him who can hurt and kill the Body, but Him who after He hath kill'd can deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The neglect of Children in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I mean in not teaching them to govern their <hi>Paſſions,</hi> is the true cauſe why many that have proved ſincere <hi>Chriſtians</hi> when they came to be Men, have yet been very imperfect in their converſation, and their Lives have been full of inequalities and breaches, which have not only been matter of great trouble and diſquiet to themſelves, but of great ſcandal to Religion; when their light which ſhould ſhine before men is ſo often darken'd and obſcured by theſe frequent and viſible infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> To the <hi>government of their Tongues.</hi> To this end teach Children <hi>Silence,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the preſence of their <hi>Betters::</hi> And aſſoon as they are capable of ſuch a Leſſon, let them be taught not to ſpeak but upon <hi>conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>deration,</hi> both of <hi>what</hi> they ſay, and before <hi>whom.</hi> And above all, inculcate upon them that moſt neceſſary Duty and Vertue of <hi>ſpeaking truth,</hi> as one of the beſt and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34942:52"/>
ſtrongeſt bands of Human Society and Commerce: And poſſeſs them with the baſeneſs and vileneſs of telling a Lye; for if it be ſo great a provocation to <hi>give</hi> a man the <hi>Lye,</hi> then ſurely to be guilty of that Fault muſt be a mighty Reproach.</p>
            <p>They who write of <hi>Japan</hi> tell us that thoſe People, though mere <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> take ſuch an effectual courſe in the Education of their Children as to render a <hi>Lye</hi> and <hi>breach of Faith</hi> above all things odious to them: Inſomuch that it is a very rare thing for any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among them to be taken in a <hi>Lye,</hi> or found guilty of <hi>breach of Faith.</hi> And cannot the Rules of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as effectual to reſtrain men from theſe Faults which are ſcandalous even to <hi>Nature,</hi> and much more ſo to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion?</p>
            <p>To the Government of the <hi>Tongue</hi> does likewiſe belong the reſtraining of Children from <hi>lewd</hi> and <hi>obſcene</hi> words, from <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>profane</hi> talk; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from horrid <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> From all which they are eaſily kept at firſt, but if they are once accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to them it will be found no ſuch eaſy matter for them to get quit
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34942:52"/>
of theſe evil Habits. It will require great attention and watchfulneſs over themſelves, to keep <hi>Oaths</hi> out of their common diſcourſe; but if they be heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and in paſſion, they throw out <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Curſes</hi> as naturally as men that are highly provoked fling ſtones, or any thing that comes next to hand at one another: So dangerous a thing is it to let any thing that is bad in Children to grow up into a <hi>Habit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the <hi>principal</hi> and <hi>eſſential Parts</hi> of Religion and Virtue, let Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be carefully bred up,</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> To <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to themſelves; under which I comprehend likewiſe <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> The government of the <hi>ſenſual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite</hi> as to all kind of <hi>Bodily</hi> pleaſures is not only a great <hi>part</hi> of Religion, but an excellent <hi>inſtrument</hi> of it, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> For he that cannot govern <hi>himſelf</hi> is not like to diſcharge his Duty either to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Men.</hi> And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts <hi>Sobriety</hi> firſt, as a <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> Virtue in which men are inſtructed by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and which muſt be laid as the foundation both of <hi>Piety</hi> towards God, and of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to

Men. <hi>The Grace of God,</hi> for ſo he calls the <hi>Goſpel, that brings Salvation unto all men, hath appeared; teaching us that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts we ſhould live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> It firſt teacheth us to live <hi>ſoberly;</hi> and unleſs we train up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to this <hi>Vertue</hi> we muſt never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that they will either live <hi>righteouſly</hi> or <hi>godly in this preſent World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eſpecially, Children muſt be bred up to great <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi> in their <hi>Diet,</hi> which will retrench the fewel of other inordinate Appetites. It is a good <hi>Saying</hi> I have met with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Magna pars virtutis eſt bene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus venter, a well manner'd and well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Appetite,</hi> in matter of meats and drinks, <hi>is a great part of Virtue.</hi> I do not mean, that Children ſhould be brought up according to the Rules of a <hi>Leſſian</hi> Diet, which ſets an equal ſtint to all Stomachs, and is as ſenſeleſs a thing as a <hi>Law</hi> would be which ſhould enjoin that <hi>Shooes</hi> for all Mankind ſhould be made upon one and the ſame <hi>Laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> To a ſerious and unaffected <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> ſtill and quiet, real and ſubſtantial, without

            <p>You that are <hi>Parents</hi> and have to do in the World, ought to be juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in all your dealings: In the firſt place for the ſake of your own Souls, and next for the ſake of your Children: Not only that you may entail no Curſe upon the Eſtate you leave them, but likewiſe that you may teach them no Injuſtice by the Example you ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; which in this particular

they will be as apt to imitate as in any one thing; becauſe of the preſent worldly advantage which it ſeems to bring, and becauſe <hi>Juſtice</hi> is in truth a manly Virtue, and leaſt underſtood by Children; and therefore <hi>Injuſtice</hi> is a Vice which they will ſooneſt practiſe and with the leaſt reluctancy, becauſe they have the leaſt knowledge of it in many particular Caſes: And becauſe they have ſo little ſenſe of this great Virtue, they ſhould not be allowed to cheat, no not in play and ſport, even when they play for little or nothing: For if they practice it in that Caſe, and be unjuſt in a little, they will be much more tempted to be ſo when they can gain a great deal by it.</p>

Judge how would you diſpoſe of theſe two Garments? <hi>Cyrus</hi> immediately, and with very good reaſon as he thought, paſſeth this ſudden Sentence, That the taller Boy ſhould have the longer Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he that was of lower ſtature the ſhorter, becauſe this certainly was fitteſt for them both: Upon which his Governor ſharply rebukes him to this purpoſe; telling him, that if he were to make two Coats for them he ſaid well; but he did not put this Caſe to him as a <hi>Tailor</hi> but as a <hi>Judge,</hi> and as ſuch he had given a very wrong Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: For a <hi>Judge,</hi> ſays he, ought not to conſider what is <hi>moſt fit,</hi> but what is <hi>juſt;</hi> not who could make the <hi>beſt uſe</hi> of a thing, but who hath the <hi>moſt right</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>This I bring, partly to ſhew in what familiar ways the Principles of Virtue may be inſtill'd into Children; but chiefly to prove that <hi>Juſtice</hi> is a <hi>manly Virtue,</hi> and that there is nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Children may be more eaſily miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, than in matter of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong:</hi> Therefore Children ſhould be taught the general <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe if we would teach them to <hi>do Juſtice</hi> we muſt teach them to <hi>know</hi> what <hi>Juſtice</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:34942:55"/>
is. For many are unjuſt merely out of Ignorance and for want of knowing better, and cannot help it.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> To <hi>Charity;</hi> I mean chiefly to the poor and deſtitute; becauſe this, as it is an <hi>eſſential</hi> ſo is it a moſt <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Part of Religion. Now to encourage this Diſpoſition in Children we muſt not only give them the Example of it, but muſt frequently inculcate upon them ſuch Paſſages of <hi>Scripture</hi> as theſe, That <hi>pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to viſit the fatherleſs and the widows in their affliction:</hi> That <hi>as we ſow</hi> in this kind, <hi>ſo we ſhall reap:</hi> That <hi>he ſhall have judgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy who hath ſhewed no mercy:</hi> That at the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Great Day</hi> we ſhall in a very particular manner be call'd to an account for the practice or omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Duty, and ſhall then be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved or condemned according as we have exerciſed or neglected this great Virtue of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>

            <p>And let not your Children, as far as is poſſible, have any bad Examples to converſe with, either among your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or their own Companions; leſt <hi>by walking with them they learn their way and get a blot to their Souls.</hi> There is a contagion in Example, and nothing doth more ſlily inſinuate it ſelf and gain upon us than a living and familiar Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern; therefore, as much as in you lies, let Children always have good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before them.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially, let Parents themſelves be exemplary to them in the beſt things, becauſe their Example is of all other the moſt powerful and carries greateſt Authority with it. And without this, Inſtruction will ſignify very little, and the great force and effica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of it will be loſt. We ſhall find it very hard to perſuade our Children to do that which they ſee we do not practiſe our ſelves. For even Children have ſo much ſenſe and ſagacity as to underſtand that actions are more real <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>han words, and a more certain indication of what a man doth truly and inwardly believe.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34942:57"/>
Example is the moſt lively way of teaching, and becauſe Children are much given to imitation, it is likewiſe a very delightful way of inſtruction, and that of which Children are moſt capable; both becauſe it is beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and is apt to make the deepeſt impreſſion upon them.</p>
            <p>So that Parents, above all others, have one Argument to be Religious and good themſelves, for the ſake of their Children. If you deſire to have them good, the beſt way to make them ſo is to give them the Example of it in being good your ſelves. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Parents ſhould take great care to do nothing but what is worthy of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Your Children will follow you in what you do, therefore do not go before them in any thing that is evil. The evil Example of Parents is both a temptation and encouragement to Children to Sin, becauſe it is a kind of Authority for what they do, and looks like a juſtification of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
            <p>With what reaſon canſt thou expect that thy Children ſhould follow thy good Inſtructions, when thou thy ſelf giveſt them an ill Example? Thou doſt

            <p>The Precepts of a good man are apt to raiſe and inflame others to the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them, but when they come from one who is faulty and vicious in that kind himſelf they are languid and faint, and give us no heart and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the exerciſe of thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which we plainly ſee they do not practiſe themſelves.

               </gap>dment ought to be ſufficient in this kind, becauſe the End is always to give meaſure to the Means: And where a mild and gentle Rebuke will do the buſineſs, Reproof may ſtop there without

proceeding further: Or when that will not do, if a ſharp word and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere admonition will be effectual, the Rod may be ſpared.</p>
            <p>Provided always, that our <hi>Lenity</hi> give no encouragement to Sin, and be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged that Children may perceive that you are in good earneſt, and reſolved that if they will not reform they ſhall certainly be puniſh'd. And provided likewiſe, that your <hi>Lenity</hi> bear a due proportion to the nature and quality of the Fault. We muſt not uſe mildneſs in the caſe of a wilful and heinous Sin, eſpecially if it be exemplary and of publick influence. To rebuke gently upon ſuch on Occaſion is rather to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Fault, and ſeems to argue that we are not ſenſible enough of the Enormity of it, and that we have not a due diſlike and deteſtation for it: Such cold Reproofs as thoſe which old <hi>Eli</hi> gave his Sons, 1 <hi>Sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> 2. 23, 24. <hi>Why do you ſuch things? For I hear of your evil dealing by all this People,</hi> that is, their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was ſuch as gave publick Scandal: <hi>Nay, my Sons; for it is not a good Report that I hear, you make the Lord's People to tranſgreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:34942:59"/>
Such a cold Reproof as this, where the Crime was ſo great and notorious, was a kind of allowance of it, and a partaking with them in their Sin; and ſo God interprets it, and therefore calls it <hi>a kicking at his Sacrifice, and a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his Offering,</hi> Chap. 2. 19. And he threatens <hi>Eli</hi> with moſt terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this very account, <hi>becauſe his Sons made themſelves vile, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that our Severity muſt be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the Crime. Where the Fault is great, there greater Severity muſt be uſed; ſo much at leaſt as may be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Reſtraint for the future. Here was <hi>Eli</hi>'s miſcarriage, that in the caſe of ſo great a Fault as his Sons were guilty of, his proceeding was neither proportioned to the Crime, nor to the End of Reproof and Correction, which is Amendment for the future: But he uſed ſuch a mildneſs in his Reproof of them, as was more apt to encourage than reſtrain them in their vile courſes: For ſo the <hi>Text</hi> ſays, that <hi>his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are indeed ſome Diſpoſitions ſo very tender and tractable, that a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reproof will ſuffice. But moſt Children
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34942:60"/>
are of that temper that Correction muſt be ſometimes uſed, and a fond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence in this Caſe is many times their utter ruin and undoing; and in truth not Love but hatred. So the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 24. <hi>He that ſpareth the Rod hateth his Son, but he that loveth him chaſteneth him betimes.</hi> Chap. 19. 18. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten thy Son while there is hope, and let not thy Soul ſpare for his Crying.</hi> And again, Chap. 22. 15. <hi>Fooliſhneſs is bound up in the heart of a Child, and the Rod of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſhall drive it far from him.</hi> Chap. 23. 13, 14. <hi>Withhold not correction from the child, for if thou beateſt him with the rod he ſhall not dye: Thou ſhalt beat him with the Rod, and ſhalt deliver his Soul from Hell.</hi> Again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. 15. <hi>The Rod and Reproof giveth wiſdom, but a Child left to himſelf bringeth his Mother to ſhame:</hi> He menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the <hi>Mother</hi> emphatically, becauſe She many times is moſt faulty in this fond indulgence; and therefore the ſhame and grief of it doth juſtly fall upon Her.</p>
            <p>So that Correction is of great uſe, and often neceſſary; and Parents that forbear it are not only cruel to their Children, but to Themſelves: For God many times puniſheth thoſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34942:60"/>

                  </gap>ople.</hi> I will recite the <hi>Threatning</hi> at large, for an Admonition to <hi>Parents</hi> that they be not guilty in this kind, 1 Sam. 3. 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>The Lord ſaid to Samuel, Behold I will do a thing in Iſrael at which both the ears of every one that beareth it ſhall tingle: In that day I will perform againſt Eli all things which I have ſpoken concerning his Houſe; when I begin I will alſo make an end. For I have told him that I will judge his Houſe for ever for the Iniquity which he knoweth, becauſe his Sons made themſelves vile and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them not: And therefore I have ſworn unto the Houſe of Eli, that the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Eli's Houſe ſhall not be purged with Sacrifice nor Offering for ever.</hi> I know very well that this enormous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons was committed by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34942:61"/>
them after they were grown to be Men, but this Inſtance is nevertheleſs to my preſent purpoſe, there being hardly any doubt to be made but that it was the natural effect of a remiſs and too indulgent an Education.</p>
            <p>Yea very often God doth correct and remarkably puniſh fond Parents by thoſe very Children who have wanted due Reproof and Correction: Of which the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives us a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſtance in <hi>Adonijah,</hi> upon the mention of whoſe Rebellion againſt <hi>David</hi> his Father the <hi>Text</hi> takes parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of his Father's extreme fondneſs of him, as both the procuring and meritorious cauſe of it, <hi>For his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>VII. The next thing I ſhall mention as a part of good Education is,</hi> the bringing of Children to be publickly Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed by the Miniſter, to prepare them for ſolemn Confirmation.</p>
            <p>It was with a particular reſpect to this work of <hi>publick Catechiſing,</hi> and by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34942:61"/>
way of introduction to it, that I at firſt propoſed to treat thus largely of the <hi>good Education of Children,</hi> hoping it might be of good uſe to handle this <hi>Subject</hi> more fully than it hath uſually been done, at leaſt to my knowledge, from the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall ſay ſomething, and that very briefly concerning the <hi>nature,</hi> and concerning the <hi>neceſſity</hi> and great uſefulneſs of <hi>Catechiſing</hi> Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the <hi>nature</hi> of it, it is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way of teaching by <hi>Queſtion</hi> and <hi>Anſwer,</hi> accommodated and fitted for the inſtruction of Children in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion. I do not indeed find, that this particular method is any where enjoined in <hi>Scripture;</hi> but <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in general is: And I doubt not but that upon this general warrant <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> may uſe that way of Inſtruction of Children which is moſt fit and proper to inſtill into them the Principles of Religion. It is true, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from whence our word <hi>Catechiſm</hi> doth come, is uſed in <hi>Scripture</hi> to ſignify <hi>teaching</hi> in general: But it hath ſince by <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters been appropriated to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way of Inſtruction which hath
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34942:62"/>
been long in uſe in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, and is commonly called <hi>Catechiſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the <hi>neceſſity</hi> and great <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> of it; <hi>Catechiſing</hi> hath a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular advantage as to Children: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſubject to forgetfulneſs, and want of attention. Now <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> is a good Remedy againſt both theſe; becauſe by <hi>Queſtions</hi> put to them Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are forced to take notice of what is taught, and muſt give ſome <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the Queſtion that is ask'd: And a <hi>Catechiſm</hi> being ſhort, and containing in a little compaſs the moſt neceſſary Principles of Religion, it is the more eaſily remembred.</p>
            <p>The great <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> and indeed the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it plainly appears by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For it very ſeldom happens, that Children which have not been catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed have any clear and competent knowledge of the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and for want of this are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving any great benefit by <hi>Sermons,</hi> which ſuppoſe perſons to be in ſome meaſure inſtructed before-hand in the main Principles of Religion.</p>

we have had ſad experience of this in our Age; and among many other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal effects of our late Civil Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this is none of the leaſt, that <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Catechiſing</hi> was almoſt wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, and <hi>private</hi> too in moſt Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: For had <hi>Catechiſing</hi> of Children been continued, it is very probable that this Age would have been infeſted with fewer <hi>Errors</hi> and with fewer <hi>Schiſms;</hi> and that there would not have been ſo much <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> from the <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi> of Religion. For it is, I think, a true <hi>Obſervation,</hi> that <hi>Catechiſing,</hi> and the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> have been the <hi>two</hi> great <hi>Pillars</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>There being then ſo great a <hi>neceſſity</hi> and uſefulneſs of this Way of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I would earneſtly recommend the practiſe of it to <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Maſters of Families</hi> with reſpect to their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and <hi>Servants.</hi> For I do not think that this Work ſhould lie wholly upon <hi>Miniſters.</hi> You muſt do your part at home, who by your conſtant reſidence in your Families have better and more eaſy opportunities of inculcating the Principles of Religion upon your <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and <hi>Servants.</hi> There you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for <hi>publick Catechiſing,</hi> that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34942:63"/>
the Work of the <hi>Miniſter</hi> may not be too heavy upon him.</p>
            <p>As to the part which concerns <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> I intend by God's aſſiſtance, ſo ſoon as the buſineſs can be put into a good method, to begin this <hi>Exerciſe.</hi> And I do earneſtly intreat all that have <hi>young Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> to bring ſuch of them as are fit to be publickly Catechiſed and inſtructed in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion: And I ſhall as often as ſhall be thought expedient ſpend ſome time in this Work, between <hi>afternoon Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Catechiſm</hi> to be uſed ſhall be that appointed in our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which is ſhort, and contains in it the <hi>chief Principles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> And I ſhall make a ſhort and plain explication of the Heads of it, ſuitable to the capacity of Children.

largely and fully explain the <hi>chief Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Belief:</hi> A Work which you know I have ſome time ago entred upon.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The <hi>laſt</hi> thing I ſhall mention, and with which the State of <hi>Childhood</hi> ends, is <hi>the bringing of Children to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, to be ſolemnly Confirm'd,</hi> by their taking upon themſelves the <hi>Vow</hi> which by their <hi>Sureties</hi> they entred into at their <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is acknowledged by almoſt all <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be of <hi>Primitive</hi> Antiquity, and of very great <hi>uſe</hi> when it is performed with that due preparation of perſons for it, by the <hi>Miniſters</hi> to whoſe charge they belong, and with that ſeriouſneſs and Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which the nature of the thing doth require.</p>
            <p>And to that end it were very deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Confirmations</hi> ſhould be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and in ſmaller Numbers at a time; that ſo the <hi>Biſhop</hi> may apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more particularly to every Perſon that is to be <hi>Confirmed,</hi> that by this means the thing may make the deeper impreſſion and lay the ſtronger obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:34942:64"/>
One thing more I could wiſh, both to prevent confuſion, and for the eaſe alſo of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> that his work may not be endleſs, that <hi>Miniſters</hi> would take care that none may preſent themſelves to the Biſhop or be preſented by the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to be <hi>Confirmed</hi> a ſecond time: Becauſe a great many are wont to offer themſelves every time there is a <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi> which is both very diſorderly and unreaſonable, there being every whit as little reaſon for a <hi>ſecond Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> as there is for a <hi>ſecond Baptiſm:</hi> And if any perſons need ſo often to be <hi>Confirmed,</hi> it is a ſign that Confirmation hath very little effect upon them.</p>

                  </gap>ret</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> and it is very hard to give a juſt and ſatisfactory account of it.</p>
            <p>It is good therefore to know the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tempers of Children, that we may accordingly apply our care to them and manage them to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: That where we diſcern in them any forward inclinations to good, we may caſt in ſuch Seeds and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as, by their ſuitableneſs to their particular Tempers, we judge moſt likely to take ſooneſt and deepeſt root:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34942:65"/>
And when theſe are grown up, and have taken poſſeſſion of the Soil, they will prepare it for the Seeds of other Virtues.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe when we diſcover in their Nature a more particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and leaning towards any thing which is bad, we muſt with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care apply ſuch Inſtructions and plant ſuch Principles in them, as may be moſt effectual, to alter this evil diſpoſition of their Minds; that whilſt Nature is tender and flexible we may gently bend it the other way: And it is almoſt incredible what ſtrange things by Prudence and Patience may be done towards the rectifying of a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and crooked Diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>So that it is of very great uſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and diſcover the particular Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Children, that in all our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and management of them, we may apply our ſelves to their Nature and hit their peculiar Diſpoſition: By this means we may lead and draw them to their Duty in human ways, and ſuch as are much more agreeable to their Temper than conſtraint and neceſſity, which are harſh and churliſh, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the grain. Whatever is done
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34942:65"/>
with delight goes on cheerfully, but when Nature is compell'd and forc'd, things proceed heavily: Therefore, when we are forming and faſhioning Children to Religion and Virtue, we ſhould make all the advantage we can of their particular Tempers. This will be a good direction and help to us to conduct Nature in the way it will moſt eaſily go. Every Temper gives ſome particular advantage and <hi>handle</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may take hold of them and ſteer them more eaſily: But if we take a contrary courſe we muſt expect to meet with great difficulty and reluctancy.</p>
            <p>Such ways of Education as are pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently fitted to the particular diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Children are like <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Tide</hi> together, which will make the Work go on amain: But thoſe ways and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which are applied croſs to Nature are like <hi>Wind</hi> againſt <hi>Tide,</hi> which make a great ſtir and conflict, but a very ſlow progreſs. Not that I do, or can expect that all <hi>Parents</hi> ſhould be <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> but that they ſhould uſe the beſt wiſdom they have in a matter of ſo great concernment.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34942:66"/>
to their Zeal without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, do take great care to plant little and ill-grounded Opinions in the minds of their Children, and to faſhion them to a <hi>Party,</hi> by infuſing into them the particular Notions and Phraſes of a <hi>Sect,</hi> which when they come to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd have no ſubſtance, nor perhaps ſenſe in them: And by this means, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bringing them up in the true and ſolid Principles of Chriſtianity, they take a great deal of pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in ſome doubtful Doctrines of no great moment in Religion, and perhaps falſe at the bottom; whereby inſtead of teaching them to hate Sin they fix them in Schiſm, and teach them to hate and damn all thoſe who differ from them and are oppoſite to them; who yet are perhaps much more in the right, and far better <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than themſelves.</p>
            <p>And indeed nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and more to be pitied, than to ſee with what a confident contempt and ſcornful pity ſome ill-inſtructed and ignorant people will lament the blindneſs and ignorance of thoſe who have a thouſand times more true knowledge and skill than themſelves,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34942:67"/>
not only in all other things, but even in the practiſe as well as knowledge of the Chriſtian Religion; believing thoſe who do not reliſh their affected Phraſes and uncouth Forms of ſpeech to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and utter ſtrangers to the Life and Power of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>But now what is the effect of this miſtaken way of Education? The <hi>Harveſt</hi> is juſt anſwerable to the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Infoelix lolium &amp; ſteriles dominantur avenae;</l>
               </q>
As they have ſown, ſo they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to reap; and inſtead of good Grain to have Cockle and Tares: <hi>They have ſown the Wind, and they ſhall reap the Whirlwind;</hi> as the expreſſion is in the <hi>Prophet;</hi> inſtead of true Religion, and of a ſober and peaceable Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, there will come up new and wild Opinions, a factious and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpirit, a furious and boiſterous zeal, which will neither ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be quiet, nor any body that is about them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:34942:67"/>
But if you deſire to reap the effects of true Piety and Religion, you muſt take care to plant in Children the main and ſubſtantial Principles of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which may give them a general <hi>byaſs</hi> to holineſs and goodneſs, and not to little particular Opinions, which being once fix'd in them by the ſtrong prejudice of Education will hardly ever be rooted out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Do all that in you lies to check and diſcourage in them the firſt beginnings of Sin and Vice: So ſoon as ever they appear pluck them up by the Roots. This is like the weeding of Corn, which is a neceſſary piece of good Husbandry. Vices like ill weeds grow apace, and if they once take to the Soil it will be hard to extirpate and kill them: But if we watch them and cut them up aſſoon as they appear, this will diſcourage the Root and make it dye.</p>
            <p>Therefore take great heed that your Children be not habituated and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to any evil courſe. A Vice that is of any conſiderable growth and continuance will ſoon grow obſtinate, and having once ſpread its roots it will be a very difficult matter to clear the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34942:68"/>
ground of it. A Child may be ſo long neglected till he be overgrown with Vice to that degree, that it may be out of the power of Parents ever to bring him to good fruit. If it once gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the depraved diſpoſition of Children it will be one of the hardeſt things in the World to give a ſtop to it. It is the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s caution to <hi>take heed of being harden'd by the deceitfulneſs of Sin,</hi> which they who go on in an evil courſe will moſt certainly be. We ſhould obſerve the firſt appearances of evil in Children, and kill thoſe young Serpents aſſoon as they ſtir leſt they bite them to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Bring them, aſſoon as they are capable of it, to the <hi>publick Worſhip</hi> of God, where He hath promiſed his more eſpecial preſence and bleſſing. It is in <hi>Zion,</hi> the place of God's publick Worſhip, where <hi>the Lord hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bleſſing even Life for evermore: There</hi> are the means which God hath appointed for the begetting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of Grace in us: This is the <hi>Pool</hi> where the <hi>Angel</hi> uſeth to come and to <hi>move the Waters:</hi> Bring your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hither, where if they diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they may meet with an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being <hi>healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:34942:68"/>
And when they come from the <hi>Church,</hi> call them frequently to an account of what they have heard and learn'd there: This will make them both to attend more diligently to what they hear, and to lay it up in their Memories with greater care, and will fix it there ſo as to make a deeper and more laſting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon their Minds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Be careful more eſpecially to put them upon the exerciſe and practice of Religion and Virtue, in ſuch Inſtances as their underſtanding and age are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. Teach them ſome ſhort and proper <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> to God, to be ſaid by them devoutly upon their knees in private, at leaſt every Morning and Even<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng. A great many Children ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect this, not from any ill diſpoſition of mind, but becauſe no body takes care to teach them how to do it. And if they were taught and put upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, the habit and cuſtom of any thing will after a little while make that eaſy and delightful enough, which they cannot afterwards be brought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great difficulty and reluctancy.</p>

for <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> is the beſt way to perfect <hi>Knowledge</hi> in any kind. Mere <hi>Speculation</hi> is a very raw and rude thing in compariſon of that true and diſtinct knowledge which is gotten by <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Experience.</hi> The moſt exact skill in <hi>Geography</hi> is nothing compared with the knowledge of that Man who beſides the Speculative part hath travell'd over and carefully view'd the Countries he hath read of. The moſt knowing man in the Art and Rules of <hi>Navigation</hi> is no body in compariſon of an experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Pilot</hi> and <hi>Seaman.</hi> Becauſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge perfected by practice is as much dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erent from mere Speculation as the skill of doing a thing is from being told how a thing is to be done. For men may eaſily miſtake Rules, but frequent Practiſe and Experience are ſeldom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Give me a man that conſtantly does a thing well, and that ſhall ſatisfy me that he knows how to do it. That <hi>Saying</hi> of our <hi>B. Saviour, If any man will do my will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf,</hi> is a clear determination of this matter, namely, That they underſtand the Will of God beſt who are moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do it. And ſo likewiſe the beſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34942:69"/>
way to know what God is, is to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his Perfections in our Lives and Actions; to be <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> as He is.</p>
            <p>Therefore when the minds of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are once thoroughly poſſeſt with the true Principles of Religion, we ſhould bend all our endeavours to put them upon the practice of what they know: Let them rather be taught to do well than to talk well; rather to avoid what is evil, in all its ſhapes and appearances, and to practiſe their Duty in the ſeveral Inſtances of it, than to <hi>ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels: Unto Man He ſaid, Behold! the fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding,</hi> Job 28. 28. <hi>Hereby,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. In matter of <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> Parents do very often mainly miſcarry in not teaching their Children the true <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and the <hi>degrees</hi> of them: As when we teach them any thing is a Sin that really is not, or that any thing is not a Sin which in truth is ſo: Or when we teach them to lay more ſtreſs and weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things than they will bear; making that which perhaps is only <hi>covenient</hi> to be in the higheſt degree <hi>neceſſary,</hi> or that which it may be is only <hi>inconvenient,</hi> or may be an occaſion of <hi>Scandal</hi> to ſome weak Chriſtians, to be a Sin <hi>in its own nature damnable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Parents do likewiſe lay too great a weight upon things, when they are as diligent to inſtruct them in leſſer things, and as ſtrict in enjoining them, and as ſevere in puniſhing the commiſſion or neglect of them, according as they eſteem them <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> as if they were <hi>the weightier things of the Law</hi> and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34942:73"/>
matters of the greateſt moment in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Thus I have known very careful and well-meaning Parents that have with great ſeverity reſtrained their Children in the wearing of their hair: Nay I can remember ſince the wearing of it below their Ears was looked upon as a Sin of the firſt magnitude; and when <hi>Miniſters</hi> generally, whatever their <hi>Text</hi> was, did in every <hi>Sermon</hi> either find or make an occaſion with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to reprove the great Sin of <hi>long hair;</hi> and if they ſaw any one in the <hi>Congregation</hi> guilty in that kind, they would point him out particularly, and let fly at him with great zeal.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe known ſome Parents that have ſtrictly forbidden their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the uſe of ſome ſorts of <hi>Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Games</hi> under the notion of heinous Sins, upon a miſtake that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was in them a mixture of <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Skill</hi> they were therefore unlawful; a Reaſon which I think hath no weight and force in it, tho I do not deny but human Laws may for very prudent reaſons either reſtrain or forbid the uſe of theſe <hi>Games,</hi> becauſe of the boundleſs expence both of <hi>Money</hi> and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34942:74"/>
               <hi>Time</hi> which is many times occaſioned by them.</p>
            <p>I have known others, nay perhaps the ſame Perſons, that would not only allow but even encourage their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to deſpiſe the very <hi>Service of God</hi> under ſome <hi>Forms,</hi> which according to their ſeveral apprehenſions they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>Superſtitious</hi> or <hi>Factious.</hi> But this I have ever thought to be a thing of moſt dangerous conſequence, and have often obſerved it to end either in the neglect or contempt of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>And how many Parents teach their Children <hi>dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tful Opinions,</hi> and lay great ſtreſs upon them as if they were <hi>ſaving</hi> or <hi>damning</hi> Points; and hereby ſet ſuch an edge and keenneſs upon them for or againſt ſome indifferent modes and <hi>circumſtances</hi> of God's Worſhip as if the very <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> were concerned in them?</p>
            <p>Theſe certainly are great <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> and many times have very pernicious effects, thus to confound things which are of ſo wide and vaſt a difference as <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil, lawful</hi> and <hi>unlawful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> and <hi>neceſſary.</hi> For when Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren come to be Men, and to have a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34942:74"/>
freer and larger view of the World, and ſhall find by the contrary practice of very wiſe and ſerious Perſons that they have quite different apprehenſions of theſe matters, and do not think that to be a <hi>Sin</hi> which their Parents have ſo ſtrictly forbidden them under that notion, and many times puniſhed them more ſeverely for the doing of it than if they had told a <hi>Lye,</hi> this may make them apt to queſtion whether any thing be a Sin: And the violence which they offer to their Conſciences, and the <hi>ſtrein</hi> that they give them upon ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by complying wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the general practice of others contrary to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Education, doth many times open a gap for great and real Sins.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that Children which are bred up in high Prejudices <hi>for</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different <hi>Opinions</hi> or <hi>Practices</hi> in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do uſually when they are grown up prove to be Men of narrow and contracted Spirits, peeviſh and froward and uncharitable, and many times great <hi>Bigots</hi> and <hi>Zealots</hi> either in the way of <hi>Superſtition</hi> or <hi>Faction,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Principles</hi> which have been inſtill'd into them to <hi>byaſs</hi> them either
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34942:75"/>
way: And very hardly do they ever quit themſelves ſo clearly of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, as to become wiſe and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſubſtantial Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, if we carefully obſerve it, we ſhall find that when Children have been thus indiſcreetly educated, their Religion differs as much from that of ſober and judicious Chriſtians, as the <hi>Civil</hi> behaviour and converſation of thoſe who have been unskilfully and conceitedly taught how to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, does from the behaviour of thoſe who have had a more free and generous Education.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In matter of <hi>Example.</hi> There are many Parents whoſe Lives are Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in the main, who yet ſeem to uſe too great a freedom before their Children. It is an old Rule, and I think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> very good one,
<q>
                  <l>Maxima debetur pueris reverentia,</l>
               </q>
               <hi>There is a very great reverence due to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> There are many things which are not Sins, and therefore may lawfully be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one, which yet it may not be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and expedient to do before all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34942:75"/>
perſons. There are ſome words and actions ſo trivial and light, that they are not fit to be ſaid or done before thoſe for whom we have a reverence. There is a certain freedom of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation which is only proper among E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals in Age and Quality, which if we uſe before our Superiors and Betters, we ſeem to contemn <hi>them;</hi> if before our Inferiors, <hi>they</hi> will go nigh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn us.</p>
            <p>It ought to be conſider'd, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do not underſtand the exact limits of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> ſo that if in our words or actions we go to the utmoſt bounds of that which is lawful, we ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſhewing them the way to that which is unlawful. Children are not wont to be careful of their ſteps, and therefore we will not venture them to play about a Precipice, or near a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Place, where yet Men that will take care may go ſafely enough. And therefore Parents ſhould be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep their Children from the Confines of Evil, and at as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from it as they can. And to this end their words and actions ſhould ever be temper'd with gravity and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, that Children may not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34942:76"/>
ſee or hear any thing which may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with the approaches to Sin, or carry them to the Borders of Vice; leſt they ſhould not ſtop juſt there, but take a ſtep further than you intended they ſhould go.</p>

            <p>Great Severities do often work an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect quite contrary to that which was intended: And many times thoſe who were bred up in a very ſevere <hi>School,</hi> hate Learning ever after for the ſake of the cruelty that was uſed to force it upon them: And ſo likewiſe an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring Children to Piety and Goodneſs by unreaſonable ſtrictneſs and rigor does often beget in them a laſting diſguſt and Prejudice againſt

And indeed how can it be expected that Children ſhould love their Duty, when they never hear of it but with a handful of <hi>Rods</hi> ſhak'd over them?</p>
            <p>I inſiſt upon this the more, becauſe I do not remember to have obſerved more notorious Inſtances of great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, than in the Children of very ſtrict and ſevere Parents. Of which I can give no other account but this, that Nature when it is thus overcharged recoils the more terribly: It hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it like the <hi>Spring</hi> of an Engine, which being forcibly preſs'd does upon the firſt liberty return back with ſo much the greater violence: In like manner
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34942:77"/>
the vicious diſpoſitions of Children, when reſtrain'd merely by the ſeverity of Parents, do break forth ſtrangely aſſoon as ever they get looſe and from under their Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Miſcarriage in this matter is, when Reproof and Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are accompanied and managed with Paſſion. This is to betray one Fault, and perhaps a greater, in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another. Beſides, that this makes Reproof and Correction to look like Revenge and Hatred, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally does not perſuade and reform but provoke and exaſperate. And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably may be one reaſon of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>'s admonition, <hi>Parents provoke not your Children unto wrath,</hi> becauſe <hi>that</hi> is never likely to have any good effect. <hi>Correction</hi> is a kind of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> which ought never to be adminiſtred in Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but upon counſel and good advice.</p>
            <p>And that Paſſion is incident to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents upon this occaſion, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us when he ſays, that <hi>the Parents of our fleſh chaſten us for their pleaſure, Heb.</hi> 10. 12. that is, they do it many times to gratify their Paſſion; <hi>but God</hi> chaſtens us <hi>for our profit,</hi> not in Anger but with a deſign to do us good: And
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34942:78"/>
can we have a better Patern than our heavenly Father to imitate?</p>
            <p>A <hi>Father</hi> is as it were a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Judge</hi> in his <hi>Family:</hi> There he gives Laws, and inflicts Cenſures and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Offenders. But how miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming a thing would it be to ſee a Judge paſs Sentence upon a man in Choler? It is the ſame thing to ſee a Father in the heat and fury of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on correct his Child. If a Father could but ſee himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf in this <hi>Mood,</hi> and how ill his Paſſion becomes him, inſtead of being Angry with his Child he would be out of Patience with himſelf. I proceed to the next thing I propoſed, namely,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV. To make out the truth of the</hi> Propoſition <hi>contained in the</hi> Text, <hi>by ſhewing how</hi> the good Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren comes to be of ſo great advantage and to have ſo good and laſting an influence upon their whole Lives.</p>
            <p>I confeſs there are ſome wild and ſavage Natures, monſtrous and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Tempers, hard as the Rocks, and barren as the Sand upon the Sea-ſhore; which diſcover ſtrong and early propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to vice, and a violent antipathy
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34942:78"/>
to Goodneſs. Such Tempers are next to deſperate, but yet they are not utterly intractable to the Grace of God and the Religious Care of Parents.</p>
            <p>I hope ſuch Tempers as theſe are very rare, though God is pleaſed they ſhould ſometimes appear in the World, as inſtances of the great corruption and degeneracy of Human Nature, and of the great need of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vine Grace. But ſurely there is no Temper that is abſolutely and irrecoverably prejudiced againſt that which is good. This would be ſo terrible an Objection againſt the Providence of God as would be very hard to be anſwered. God be thanked, moſt Tempers are tractable to good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and there is very great p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the good ſucce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of it, if it be carefully and wiſely managed.</p>
            <p>And for the Confirmation of this <hi>Truth</hi> I ſhall inſtance in <hi>two</hi> very great <hi>Advantages</hi> of a Religious and vir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uous Education of Children.</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> It gives Religion and Virtue the advantage of the firſt Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> The Advantage of Habit and Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Good Education gives Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Virtue the <hi>Advantage</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:34942:79"/>
               <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi> The Mind of Man is an active Principle, and will be employed about ſomething or other. It cannot ſtand idle, and will therefore take up with that which firſt offers it ſelf. So ſoon as Reaſon puts forth it ſelf, and the Underſtanding begins to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Mind of man diſcovers a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thirſt after knowledge, and greedily drinks in that which comes firſt. If it have not the <hi>Waters of Life</hi> and the <hi>pure ſtreams</hi> of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to allay that thirſt, it will ſeek to quench it in the filthy <hi>Puddles</hi> and impure <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of this World.</p>
            <p>Now ſince Children will be buſying their Minds about ſomething, it is good that they ſhould be entertained with the beſt things, and with the beſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Principles of which their Underſtanding and Age are capable. It is a happy thing to be Principled, and, as I may ſay, <hi>Prejudiced</hi> the better way, and that Religion ſhould get the firſt poſſeſſion of their Hearts. For it is certainly a great Advantage to Religion to be planted in a tender and freſh Soil. And if <hi>Parents</hi> be careleſs and neglect this advantage, <hi>the Enemy</hi> will be ſure to <hi>ſow</hi> his <hi>Tares</hi> whilſt the <hi>Husbandman</hi> is aſleep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:34942:79"/>
Therefore we ſhould prevent the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> by giving <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> an early poſſeſſion of our Children, and by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Him into their Hearts betimes. <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> is a great Point, and it is of mighty conſequence to have Nature planted with good Seeds before vicious inclinations ſpring up and grow into ſtrength and Habit.</p>
            <p>I know that there is a ſpiteful <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb</hi> currant in the World, and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> hath taken care to ſpread it to the diſcouragement of an early Piety, <hi>A young Saint and an old Devil;</hi> but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, a young Saint is moſt likely to prove an old one. <hi>Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Good Education gives like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Advantage</hi> of <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is of mighty force. It is, as <hi>Pliny</hi> in one of his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> ſays of it, <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciſſimus omnium rerum Magiſter, the moſt powerful and effectual Maſter in every kind.</hi> It is an acquired and a ſort of <hi>Second</hi> Nature, and next to Nature it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34942:80"/>
ſelf a principle of greateſt power. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom bears a huge ſway in all Human actions. Men love thoſe things and do them with eaſe to which they have been long inured and accuſtomed. And on the contrary men go againſt Cuſtom with great regret and uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>And among all others, <hi>that</hi> Cuſtom is moſt ſtrong which is begun in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: And we ſee in Experience the ſtrange power of Education in forming perſons to Religion and Virtue. Now Education is nothing but certain Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms planted in Childhood, and which have taken deep Root whilſt Nature was tender.</p>
            <p>We ſee likewiſe in common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence how dangerous an evil Habit and Cuſtom is, and how hard to be alter'd. Therefore the <hi>Cretians,</hi> when they would curſe a man to purpoſe, wiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d that the <hi>Gods</hi> would engage him in ſome <hi>bad Cuſtom,</hi> looking upon a man after that to be irrecoverably loſt. So on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Side, to be engaged in a <hi>good Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> is an unſpeakable advantage; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for Children to be habituated to a holy and virtuous courſe, before the Habits of Sin and Vice have taken root and are confirm'd in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:34942:80"/>
We are too natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ally inclined to that which is evil: But yet this ought not to diſcourage us, becauſe it is certain in Experience that a contrary <hi>Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>om</hi> hath done much in many Caſes, even where <hi>Nature</hi> hath been ſtrongly inclined the other way. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> did by great Reſolution and almoſt infinite Pains, and after a long Habit, alter the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral imperfection of his Speech, and even in deſpite of Nature became the moſt eloquent Man perhaps that ever lived. And this amounts even to a <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for <hi>what hath been done may be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it is not univerſally true which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, <hi>That Nature cannot be altered.</hi> It is true indeed in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which he gives of throwing a Stone upward; you cannot, ſays he, by any Cuſtom, nay though you fling it up never ſo often, teach a Stone to aſcend of it ſelf: And ſo it is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Inſtances in which <hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>peremptory:</hi> But Nature is not always ſo; but ſometimes hath a great latitude: As we ſee in young Trees, which though they naturally grow ſtraight up, yet being gently bent may be made to grow any way. But above all, <hi>Moral</hi> inclinations and habits do
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34942:81"/>
admit of great alteration, and are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the power of a contrary Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom.</p>
            <p>Indeed Children when they come to be Men ſhould take great care, that they do not owe their Religion only to <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> but they ſhould upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and due examination of the grounds of it, ſo far as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing it, make it their <hi>Choice.</hi> And yet for all that we muſt not deny the beſt Religion in the World this greateſt advantage of all other. It is certainly a great happineſs for Children to be inclined to that which when they come to underſtand themſelves they would make their Choice, if they were indif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erent: But an indifferency can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſerved in Children: And therefore, ſince they will certainly be <hi>biaſſed</hi> one way or other, there is all the reaſon in the World why we ſhould endeavour to <hi>byaſs</hi> them the better way. Parents may often miſtake about what is beſt, but if they love their Children they cannot but wiſh and endeavour that they may be good and do what is beſt.</p>
            <p>I come now to the <hi>laſt Head.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed which was.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:34942:81"/>
               <hi>V. To endeavour by the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful</hi> Arguments <hi>I can offer,</hi> to ſtir up and perſuade thoſe whoſe Duty this is, to diſcharge it with great Care and Conſcience.</p>
            <p>If the foregoing <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> be true, what can be ſaid to thoſe who are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the higheſt degree of the groſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of this great Duty? Who, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> nor <hi>Example,</hi> nor <hi>Reſtraint</hi> from evil, do endeavour to make their Children good. Some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are ſuch <hi>Monſters,</hi> I had almoſt ſaid <hi>Devils,</hi> as not to know how <hi>to give good things to their Children;</hi> but inſtead of <hi>bread</hi> give them a <hi>ſtone,</hi> inſtead of <hi>fiſh</hi> give them a <hi>ſerpent,</hi> inſtead of an <hi>egg</hi> give them a <hi>ſcorpion,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> expreſſeth it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are <hi>evil</hi> indeed, who train up their Children for ruin and deſtruction; in the ſervice of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and in the Trade and Myſtery of iniquity: Who, inſtead of teaching them the <hi>Fear of the Lord,</hi> infuſe into them the Principles of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> and <hi>Prophaneneſs:</hi> Inſtead of teaching them to love and reverence Religion, they teach them to hate and deſpiſe it, and to <hi>make a mock</hi> both of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Holineſs:</hi> Inſtead of

                  </gap> of God</hi> which they ought to tremble at, by turning it into Jeſt and Raillery: Inſtead of teaching them to <hi>Pray</hi> and to <hi>bleſs</hi> the <hi>Name of God,</hi> they teach them to <hi>Blaſpheme</hi> that <hi>Great and terrible Name,</hi> and to <hi>prophane</hi> it by their continual <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Imprecations:</hi> And inſtead of bringing them to <hi>God's Church,</hi> they carry them to the <hi>Devil's Chappels,</hi> to <hi>Playhouſes</hi> and Places of <hi>debauchery,</hi> thoſe <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of <hi>Lewdneſs</hi> and <hi>Vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they, who ought to be the great <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> are the chief <hi>encouragers</hi> and <hi>Patterns</hi> of <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs</hi> in their Children; and inſtead of <hi>reſtraining</hi> them from evil, they <hi>countenance</hi> them in it, and check all forward inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Goodneſs; till at laſt they make them <hi>ten times more the Children of Wrath,</hi> than they were by that <hi>corrupt Nature</hi> which they derived from them; and hereby <hi>treaſure up,</hi> both for their Children

            </p>
            <p>But I hope there are few or none <hi>ſuch</hi> here. They do not uſe to frequent God's Houſe and Worſhip. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall apply my ſelf to thoſe who are not ſo notoriouſly guilty in this kind, though they are greatly faulty in neglecting the good Education of their Children. And for the greater convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch Parents, I ſhall offer to them the following <hi>Conſiderations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider what a ſad <hi>Inheritance</hi> you have conveyed to your Children. You have tranſmitted to them corrupt and depraved Natures, evil and vicious Inclinations<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> You have begotten them in your own Image and likeneſs, ſo that <hi>by Nature</hi> they are <hi>Children of wrath.</hi> Now methinks Parents that have a due ſenſe of this ſhould be very ſolicitous, by the beſt means they can uſe, to free <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem from that <hi>Curſe;</hi> by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to correct thoſe perverſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and curſed inclinations which they have tranſmitted to them. Surely you ought to do all you can to repair that broken Eſtate which from you is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:34942:83"/>
When a Man hath by <hi>Treaſon tainted</hi> his <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>forfeited</hi> his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> with what grief and regret doth he look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Children, and think of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury which hath been done to them by his Fault? And how ſolicitous is he, before he dye, to petition the <hi>King</hi> for favour to his Children? How earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he charge his Friends to be careful of them and kind to them? That by theſe means he may make the beſt reparation he can of their <hi>Fortune</hi> which hath been ruin'd by his <hi>Fault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And have Parents ſuch a tenderneſs for their Children, in reference to their Eſtate and condition in this World; and have they none for the good eſtate of their Souls and their eternal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in another World? If you are ſenſible that their <hi>Blood</hi> is tainted, and that their beſt <hi>Fortunes</hi> are ruin'd by your ſad <hi>Misfortune;</hi> Why do you not beſtir your ſelves for the repairing of God's Image in them? Why do you not <hi>travel in birth till Chriſt be formed in them?</hi> Why do you not pray earneſtly to <hi>God</hi> and give <hi>Him</hi> no reſt, who hath <hi>reprieved</hi> and it may be pardoned <hi>you,</hi> that He would extend his Grace to <hi>them</hi> alſo, and grant them the Bleſſings of his <hi>New Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:34942:83"/>
All your Children are begotten of the <hi>Bond-woman;</hi> therefore we ſhould pray as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>O that Iſhmael may live in thy ſight:</hi> O that theſe Sons of <hi>Hagar</hi> may be Heirs of a Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider in the next place, that good Education is the very beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance that you can leave to your Children. It is a wiſe <hi>Saying</hi> of <hi>Solom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;</hi> but ſurely an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> without <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> to manage it, is a very pernicious thing. And yet how many Parents are there who omit no Care and Induſtry to get an Eſtate that they may leave it to their Children, but uſe no means to form their Minds and Manners for the right uſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it; without which it had been much happier for them to have been left in great Poverty and ſtraits?</p>
            <p>Doſt thou love thy Child? This is true love to any one, to do the beſt for him we can. Of all your toil and labour for your Children, this may be all the fruit they may reap, and all that they may live to enjoy, the advantage of a good Education. All other things are uncertain. You may raiſe your Children to <hi>Honour,</hi> and ſettle
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34942:84"/>
a Noble <hi>Eſtate</hi> upon them to ſupport it: You may leave them, as you think, to faithful <hi>Guardians,</hi> and by kindneſs and obligation procure them many <hi>Friends:</hi> And when you have done all this, their <hi>Guardians</hi> may prove unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and treacherous, and in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Revolutions of the World their <hi>Honours</hi> may ſlip from under them, and their <hi>Riches may take to themſelves wings and fly away:</hi> And when theſe are gone, and they come to be nipp'd with the Froſts of Adverſity, their <hi>Friends</hi> will fall off like leaves in <hi>Autumn. This is a ſore evil,</hi> which yet <hi>I have ſeen under the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the good Education of your Children hath made them wiſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, you have provided an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for them which is out of the reach of Fortune, and <hi>cannot be taken from them. Crates</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> uſed to ſtand in the higheſt Places of the City, and to cry out to the Inhabitants, O <hi>ye People! why do you toil to get Eſtates for your Children, when you take no care of their Education?</hi> This is, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid, to take care of the <hi>Shooe,</hi> but none of the <hi>foot</hi> that is to wear it; to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider that the ſureſt Foundation of the publick welfare and happineſs is laid in the good Education of Children. <hi>Families</hi> are increaſed by <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> are made up of <hi>Families.</hi> And this is a matter of ſo great concernment both to <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Civil</hi> happineſs of a Nation, that anciently the beſt conſtituted <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths</hi> did commit this care to the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> more than to <hi>Parents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Antipater</hi> demanded of the <hi>Spartans</hi> fifty of their Children for <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages,</hi> they offer'd rather to deliver to Him twice as many Men; ſo much did they value the loſs of their <hi>Country</hi>'s Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But now amongſt us this Work lies chiefly upon <hi>Parents.</hi> There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways of reforming Men; by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> and by the publick <hi>Preaching</hi> of <hi>Miniſters.</hi> But the moſt likely and hopeful Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World muſt begin with <hi>Children.</hi> Wholſome <hi>Laws</hi> and good <hi>Sermons</hi> are but ſlow and late ways: The timely and the moſt compendious way is good Education. This may be an effectual <hi>Prevention</hi> of evil, whereas all after-ways are but <hi>Remedies,</hi> which do always ſuppoſe ſome neglect and omiſſion of timely care.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:34942:86"/>
And becauſe our <hi>Laws</hi> leave ſo much to Parents, our Care ſhould be ſo much the greater; and we ſhould remember that we bring up our Children for the <hi>Publick,</hi> and that if they live to be <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n,</hi> as they come out of our hands they will prove a publick Happineſs or Miſchief to the Age. So that we can no way better deſerve of Mankind and be greater Benefactors to the World, than by Peopling it with a <hi>Righteous Offſpring.</hi> Good Children are the hopes of Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and we cannot leave the World a better <hi>Legacy</hi> than well-diſciplin'd Children. This gives the World the beſt Security that Religion will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated to Poſterity, and that the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come</hi> ſhall know God, and <hi>the Children that are to be born ſhall fear the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the great Glory of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> next to his being <hi>the Friend of God,</hi> that he was the <hi>Father of the Faithful.</hi> And the careful Education of Children, <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> is ſo honourable to Parents, that God himſelf would not paſs it by in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> without ſpecial mention of it to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>his children and his Houſhold after him to keep the way of the Lord, and to do Juſtice and Judgment,</hi> Gen 18. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Conſider yet further, the great Evils conſequent upon this neglect. And they are manifold. But not to enlarge particularly upon them, they all end in <hi>this,</hi> the final miſcarriage and ruin of Children. Do but leave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved corrupt Nature to its ſelf, and it will take its own courſe, and the end of it in all probability will be miſerable.</p>
            <p>If the generous Seeds of Religion and Virtue be not carefully ſown in the tender Minds of Children, and thoſe Seeds be not cultivated by good Education, there will certainly ſpring up <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns,</hi> of which Parents will not only feel the inconvenience, but every body elſe that comes near them.

We are naturally inclined to Evil, and the neglect of Education puts Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren upon a kind of neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming what they are naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to be. Do but let them alone, and they will ſoon be habituated to Sin and Vice. And when they are once accuſtomed to do evil, they have loſt their Liberty and Choice: They are then hardly capable of good counſel and inſtruction: Or if they be patient to hear it, they have no power to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, being bound in the chains of their Sins, and <hi>led captive by Satan at his pleaſure.</hi> And when they have brought themſelves into this condition, their <hi>Ruin</hi> ſeems to be <hi>ſealed,</hi> and without a Miracle of God's Grace they are never to be reclaimed.</p>
            <p>Nor doth the miſchief of this neglect end here, but it extends it ſelf to the <hi>Publick,</hi> and to <hi>Poſterity.</hi> If we neglect the good Education of our Children, they will in all probability prove bad Men; and <hi>theſe</hi> will neglect their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and ſo the Foundation of an endleſs Miſchief is laid; and our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity will be bad Members both of Church and Commonwealth.</p>

do indeed concern thoſe that are <hi>young,</hi> but yet will afford uſeful matter of Meditation to perſons of all Ages and Conditions whatſoever: Of great thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to Almighty God from thoſe who by the Grace of God, and his Bleſſing upon a pious Education, have entred upon a Religious courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: And of a deep ſorrow and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to thoſe who have neglected and let ſlip this beſt Opportunity of their Lives; and of taking up a firm Reſolution of redeeming that loſs, as much as is poſſible, by their future care and diligence: And to them more eſpecially, who are grown old and have not yet begun this great and neceſſary Work, it will miniſter occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon a ſpeedy retreat, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further delay to return to God and their Duty; le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>thy Creator in the days of thy Youth,</hi> that is, more eſpecially in this Age of thy Life: To intimate to us, both that this is the fitteſt Seaſon, and that we cannot begin this Work too ſoon.</p>
            <p>And this is further illuſtrated by the oppoſition of it to <hi>Old Age: When the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh of which thou ſhalt ſay I have no pleaſure in them:</hi> This is a Deſcription of <hi>Old Age,</hi> the evils whereof are continually grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and which in reſpect of the cares and griefs, the diſtempers and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which uſually attend it, is rather a burthen than a pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In the handling of theſe <hi>Words,</hi> I ſhall do theſe <hi>three</hi> things,</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall conſider the <hi>Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this Duty more eſpecially to this particular Age of our Lives, <hi>the days of our youth:</hi> Why we ſhould begin this Work then, and not put it off to the Time of Old Age.</p>

I. I ſhall conſider the nature of the <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> here enjoin'd, which is to <hi>remember our Creator.</hi> For the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of which <hi>Expreſſion</hi> and others of the like nature in <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is to be conſider'd that it is very uſual in <hi>Scripture</hi> to expreſs <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>whole Duty</hi> of Man by ſome eminent <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Principle,</hi> or <hi>Part</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> Sometimes by the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God, and by <hi>Faith</hi> in Him; and very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by the <hi>Fear</hi> and by the <hi>Love</hi> of God; becauſe theſe are the great <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, though not ſo frequently, <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is expreſs'd by the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of God: Now <hi>Remembrance</hi> is the actual thought of what we do habitually know. To remember God is to have him actually in our minds, and upon all proper occaſions to revive the thoughts of Him, and as <hi>David</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, to <hi>ſet him always before us: I ſet the Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>always before me,</hi> that is, God was continually preſent to his mind and thoughts.</p>
            <p>And in oppoſition to this we find wicked men in <hi>Scripture</hi> deſcribed by the contrary quality, <hi>forgetfulneſs</hi> of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> So they are deſcribed in <hi>Job;</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:34942:93"/>
Job 8. 13. <hi>Such are the paths of them that forget God,</hi> that is, of the wicked: And the ſame deſcription <hi>David</hi> gives of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>The wicked,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that forget God:</hi> And elſewhere he gives the ſame character of a wicked man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 4. that <hi>God is not in all his thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the courſe of a Religious Life is not unfitly expreſs'd by our <hi>Remembrance of God.</hi> For to <hi>remember</hi> a Perſon or Thing is to call them to mind upon all proper and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itting Occaſions; to think actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of them, ſo as to do that which the remembrance of them does require, or prompt us to. To remember a Friend, is to be ready upon occaſion to do him all good offices: To remember a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benefit, is to be ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quite it when there is an opportunity: To remember an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, is to be ready to revenge it: And in a word to remember any thing is to be mindful to do that which the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſuch a thing doth naturally ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to us.</p>
            <p>So that to <hi>remember God,</hi> is frequently and in our moſt ſerious and retired thoughts to conſider that there is ſuch a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34942:93"/>
               <hi>Being</hi> as <hi>God</hi> is; of all <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> who made us and all other things, and hath given us Laws to liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is to revive often in our minds the thoughts of God and of his infinite Perfections, and to live continually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and awe of theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, that He is infinitely wiſe and good, holy and juſt; that He is always preſent with us, and obſerves what we do, and is intimate to our moſt ſecret thoughts, and <hi>will bring eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work into Judgment, and every ſecret thing whether it be good, or whether it be evil;</hi> as the <hi>Preacher</hi> tells us in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this <hi>Sermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duty then here required of us, is ſo ſoon as we arrive at the uſe of Reaſon and the exerciſe of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, to take God into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to begin a Religious Courſe of Life betimes; to conſecrate the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our Days and the flower and ſtrength of them to his Service:

Whilſt our Mind is yet ſoft and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ender, and in a great meaſure free from all other impreſſions, to be mindful of the <hi>Being</hi> that is above us; and in all our deſigns and actions to take God into conſideration, and to do every thing in his Fear, and with an eye to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Remember thy Creator,</hi> that is, honour fear, love, obey and ſerve Him; and in a word, do every thing as becomes one that is mindful of God, and hath Him continually in his thoughts.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall in the next place conſider, what there is in the Notion of God as our <hi>Creat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r</hi> that is more particularly apt to awaken and oblige men to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God. The <hi>Text</hi> does not barely require us to <hi>remember</hi> God, but to remember Him as the Author and Founder of our Beings: <hi>Remember thy Creator.</hi> And there is certainly ſome particular <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in it, ſo that God conſidered under the Notion of our <hi>Creator</hi> is apt to ſtrike us with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular regard and awe of Him. And that upon a <hi>threefold</hi> account; as <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is a ſenſible demonſtration to us 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Of the <hi>Being.</hi> 2<hi>dly.</hi> Of the <hi>Power,</hi> and 3<hi>dly.</hi> Of the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:34942:94"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of His <hi>Being.</hi> The <hi>Creation</hi> is of all other the moſt ſenſible and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Argument of a Deity. Other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations may work upon our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Underſtanding, but this doth as it were bring God down to our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. So often as we look up to Heaven, or down upon the Earth; upon our Selves, or into our ſelves; upon the things without us, and round about us: Which way ſoever we turn our eyes, we are encounter'd with plain eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a <hi>Superior Being,</hi> which made us and all other things: Every thing which we behold with our eyes doth in ſome way or other repreſent God to us and bring him to our minds, ſo as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid the ſight of Him if we would. So the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 1. <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſhews the work of his hands.</hi> And ſo likewiſe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 1. 20. <hi>The inviſible things of Him, from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, are clearly ſeen being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the things which are made; even his ete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>al Power and Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the <hi>Creation</hi> is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of God's infinite <hi>Power.</hi> And this Conſideration is apt to work upon our <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar,</hi> the moſt wakeful Paſſion of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34942:95"/>
all other in the Soul of Man: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> would fain aſcribe the Original apprehenſion and belief of a Deity to the natural Fears of Men; <hi>Primus in orbe Deos f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>it timor, Fear firſt made Gods;</hi> and by this means would fain perſuade us that it is ſo far from being true that God is our <hi>Creator,</hi> that He is merely the <hi>Creature</hi> of our own vain <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Imagination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſurely this is very unreaſonable. For if there be a God that made us, there is infinite reaſon why we ſhould ſtand in awe of Him, and have him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in our mind and thoughts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He who made us and all other things, if we neglect Him and forget ſo great a Benefactor, can as eaſily make us miſerable, or turn us out of Being. Therefore <hi>Remember thy Creator,</hi> and deſpiſe or forget Him at thy utmoſt peril.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the <hi>Creation</hi> is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God to his Creatures. This Conſideration of God as our <hi>Creator</hi> doth naturally ſuggeſt to our minds, that his Goodneſs brought us into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing; and that if Being be a Benefit, God is the Fountain and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, that his Goodneſs called us
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34942:95"/>
out of nothing, and made us to be what we are; for <hi>of his good pleaſure we are and were created.</hi> He was under no neceſſity of doing it; for He was from eternal Ages happy in himſelf before we were, and would have been ſo to all eternity though we had never been; nor was it poſſible He could be under any obligation to us before we were.</p>
            <p>And He is not only our <hi>Creator</hi> as He gave us our Beings at firſt, but likewiſe as we are preſerved and continued in Life by the ſame Goodneſs which firſt gave us Life and Breath; for <hi>of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we ARE</hi> as well as <hi>were created.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And can we forget ſo great a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and be <hi>unmindful of the God that formed us?</hi> Can we chuſe but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Founder of our Beings, the great Patron and Preſerver of our Lives? And ſo ſoon as we arrive at the uſe of Reaſon, and diſcover this great Benefactor to whom we owe our Lives and all the Bleſſings of them, can we forbear to do homage to him, and to ſay with <hi>David, O come, let us worſhip and fall down and kneel before the Lord our Maker: For He is the Lord our God, it is He that hath made us and not we our ſelves; we are his People, and the Sheep</hi>

            <p>And how much reaſon there is to preſs both theſe Conſiderations upon young perſons I ſhall endeavour to ſhew in the following Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe in this Age of our Lives we have the greateſt and moſt ſenſible obligation to <hi>remember</hi> God <hi>our Creat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r: In the days of our youth,</hi> when the Bleſſing and benefit of Life is new, and the memory of it freſh upon our minds. It ought not indeed to be ſo, but we find it true which <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>Nihil citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs ſeneſcit quàm gratia, Nothing ſooner grows old and out of date than obligation;</hi> and we are but too apt to forget what we have the greateſt reaſon to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>In this Age of our Life, when we begin to come to the free uſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our Reaſon, the firſt thing we
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34942:97"/>
are inſtructed in, and if we were not taught it we ſhould, though perhaps more ſlowly, diſcover and find it out of our ſelves: I ſay, the firſt thing we are inſtructed in and inquiſitive about is the <hi>Author</hi> of our Beings, and how we came into the World: And when God firſt appears to our Minds, and we come by degrees clearly to underſtand by whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounty and Bleſſing it is that we are and have been preſerved thus long, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our own care; principally by the Providence of God, and under Him by thoſe inſtruments which He hath raiſed and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſerved for that purpoſe: When we conſider this, we cannot but be ſtrangely ſurprized both with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enefit and the Greatneſs of it.</p>
            <p>And when we have well viewed our Selves, and look'd about us, upon the Creatures below us, all of them ſubject to our Dominion and uſe: And when we conſider ſeriouſly in what a noble Rank and order of Creatures we are placed; and how fearfully and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully we are made, not groveling upon the earth or bowed down to it, but of a beautiful and upright ſhape of Body, and ſuch a Majeſty of Countenance
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34942:97"/>
as if we were all Kings of the Creation: And which is much more excellent than this, that we are endued with Minds and Underſtandings, with Reaſon and Speech, whereby we are capable not only of converſing with and benefiting one another, but alſo of the knowledge and friendſhip and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Beſt and moſt Perfect of Beings, God himſelf: I ſay when we firſt conſider this and meditate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly upon it, can we poſſibly ever after forget God? Shall we not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally break out into that enquiry which <hi>Elihu</hi> thinks ſo proper for Man that he wonders it is not in every Man's mouth, <hi>Where is God my Maker, who teacheth me more than the Beaſts of the Earth, and maketh me wiſer than the Fowls of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> Job 35. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>So that there is a very ſpecial obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon us to be mindful of God in this Age of our Lives, when we firſt come to the knowledge of Him, and when the ſenſe of his Favours is freſh and new to us; and not only ſo, but when the Bleſſing of Life is at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beſt and in its verdure and flower; when our Health is in its ſtrength and vigor, and the pleaſures and enjoyments
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34942:98"/>
of Life have their full taſte and perfect reliſh. So <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes the days of his youth, <hi>Job</hi> 29. 2, 3, 4. <hi>O that I were as in months paſt, as in the days when God preſerved me; when his Candle ſhined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkneſs, as I was in the days of my youth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed when the <hi>evil days</hi> are once <hi>come,</hi> and thou art enter'd upon <hi>the years</hi> in which thou thy ſelf <hi>haſt no pleaſure,</hi> there might be ſome ſort of pretence <hi>then</hi> to forget God; becauſe <hi>then</hi> Life begins to wither and decay, and not only the gloſs and beauty but even the comfort and ſweetneſs of it is gone, and it becomes an inſipid and taſtleſs thing: <hi>But thou art inexcuſable, O Man, whoever thou art,</hi> if thou art unmindful of God in the beſt Age of thy Life, and when the ſenſe of his Benefits ought upon all accounts to make the ſtrongeſt and deepeſt impreſſions upon thy Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Reaſon will be yet ſtronger to put us upon this, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that notwithſtanding the great obligation which lies upon us to <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Creator in the days of our youth,</hi> we are moſt apt at that time of all other to forget Him. For that which is the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34942:98"/>
great Bleſſing of Youth is alſo the great Danger of it, I mean the Health and Proſperity of it; and though men have <hi>then</hi> leaſt reaſon, yet are they moſt apt to forget God in the height of pleaſure and in the abundance of all things.</p>
            <p>Youth is extremely addicted to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, becauſe it is moſt capable and moſt ſenſible of it; and where we are moſt apt to be tranſported, there we are moſt apt to tranſgreſs. Nothing does ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſot the Mind and extinguiſh in it all ſenſe of Divine things as ſenſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. If we fall in love with them, they will take off our thoughts from Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and ſteal away our hearts from God. For <hi>no man can ſerve two Maſters<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>the carnal mind is enmity againſt God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides that Youth is raſh and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, becauſe unexperienced; and conſequently not apt to be cautious and prudent, no not as to the future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of this temporal Life; much leſs of that which ſeems to be at ſo much a greater diſtance, and for that reaſon is ſo very ſeldom in our thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe this Age is of all other the fitteſt and beſt to begin a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious courſe of Life. And this does not contradict the former Argument, tho it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34942:99"/>
ſeems to do ſo. For as it is true of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they are moſt prone to be idle and yet fitteſt to learn; ſo in the caſe we are ſpeaking of both are true, that youth is an Age wherein we are too apt, if left to our ſelves, to forget God and Religion, and yet at the ſame time fitteſt to receive the impreſſions of it.</p>
            <p>Youth is <hi>aetas Diſciplinae,</hi> the proper <hi>Age of Diſcipline;</hi> very obſequious and tractable, fit to receive any kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and to imbibe any tincture: Now we ſhould lay hold of this golden Opportunity. This Age of ſuppleneſs, and obedience, and patience for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſhould be plyed by Parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that rigor and ſtiffneſs which grows with years come on too faſt. Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Youth are choice Seaſons for the planting of Religion and Virtue, and if Parents and Teachers ſleep in this Seed time they are ill Husbandmen; for this is <hi>the time of plowing and ſowing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Age is certainly the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Inſtruction, according to that of the</hi> Prophet, <hi>Iſa. 28. 9.</hi> Whom ſhall he teach knowledge? Whom ſhall he make to underſtand Doctrine? Them that are wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the milk and drawn from the breaſt.

            <p>It is a noted Saying of <hi>Ariſtotle, That young Perſons are not fit to hear Lectures of Moral Philoſophy;</hi> becauſe at that Age Paſſion is ſo predominant and unruly: By which, I think, he only means that the Minds of young Perſons are leaſt prepared to receive the Precepts of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and to ſubmit to them; but that he does not hereby intend, that ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that if the Seeds of Religion and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue be not planted in our younger years, what is to be expected in old Age? according to that of the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> Eccluſ. 25. 13. <hi>If thou haſt g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered nothing in thy Youth, how canſt thou expect to find any thing in thine Age?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Young years are tender and eaſily wrought upon, apt to be moulded into any faſhion, they are <hi>udum &amp; molle lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> like <hi>moiſt and ſoft clay</hi> which is pliable to any form; but ſoon grows hard, and then nothing is to be made of it. It is a very difficult thing to make impreſſions upon Age, and to deface the Evil which hath been deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon young and tender minds. When good inſtruction hath been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected at firſt, a conceited Ignorance doth commonly take poſſeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on, and obſtruct all the paſſages through which Knowledge and Wiſdom ſhould enter into us.</p>
            <p>Upon this Conſideration the Work of Religion ſhould be begun betimes, becauſe it is a mighty advantage to any thing to be planted in a ground that is newly broken up. It is juſt the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing for young perſons to be enter'd
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:34942:100"/>
into a Religious courſe and to have their Minds habituated to Virtue before vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Cuſtoms have got place and ſtrength in us: For whoever ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt this afterwards will meet with infinite difficulty and oppoſition, and muſt diſpute his ground by inches.</p>
            <p>It is good therefore to do that which muſt be done one time or other, when it is eaſieſt to be done; when we may do it with the greateſt advantage, and are likely to meet with the leaſt and weakeſt oppoſition. We ſhould antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate Vice, and prevent the Devil and the World by letting God into our hearts betimes and giving Religion the firſt <hi>ſeiſine</hi> and poſſeſſion of our Souls<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> This is the time of ſowing our Seed, which muſt by no means be neglected. For the Soul will not lye fallow; good or evil will come up. If our minds be not cultivated by Religion, Sin and Vice will get the poſſeſſion of them: But if our tender years be ſeaſoned with the knowledge and fear of God, this in all probability will have a good influence upon the following courſe of our Lives.</p>
            <p>In a word, this Age of our Lives is proper for Labour and Conflict; becauſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34942:101"/>
Youth is full of heat and vigor, of courage and reſolution to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and effect difficult things. This heat indeed renders young perſons ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unfit to adviſe and direct themſelves, and therefore they have need to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and directed by thoſe who are wiſer and more experienced: But yet this heat makes them very fit for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and action; for though they are bad at counſel, they are admirable at execution, when their heat is well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; they have a great deal of viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and quickneſs, of courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the way wherein they are ſet.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that Youth hath a great ſenſe of Honour and Virtue, of Praiſe and Commendation, which are of great force to engage young perſons to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt worthy and excellent things: For hope and confidence, ſtrength and courage, with which ſenſe of Honour and deſire of Praiſe are apt to inſpire them, are admirable inſtruments of Victory and Maſtery in any kind; and theſe are proper and moſt peculiar to Youth, <hi>I write unto you young men,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith St. <hi>John, becauſe ye are ſtrong, and have overcome the evil One.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:34942:101"/>
And, beſides the ſpirit and vigor of Youth, young perſons have ſeveral other qualities which make them very capable of learning any thing that is good. They are apt to believe, becauſe they have not been often deceived; and this is a very good quality in a Learner. And they are full of hopes, which will encourage them to attempt things even beyond their ſtrength; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Hope is always of the future, and the Life of young perſons is in a great meaſure before them and yet to come. And, which is a good Bridle to reſtrain them from that which is evil, they are commonly very modeſt and baſhful: And, which is alſo a ſingular advantage, they are more apt to do that which is honeſt and commendable than that which is gainful and profitable, being in a great meaſure free from the <hi>love of Money,</hi> which <hi>Experience,</hi> as well as the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> tells us <hi>is the root of all Evil.</hi> Children are very ſeldom cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, becauſe they have ſeldom been bitten by want.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This is the moſt acceptable Time of all other, becauſe it is the firſt of our Age. Under the <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> and the <hi>firſt-born</hi> were God's. In
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34942:102"/>
like manner we ſhould devote the <hi>firſt</hi> of our <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> to <hi>Him.</hi> God is the firſt and moſt excellent of Beings, and therefore it is fit that the prime of our Age and the excellency of our ſtrength ſhould be dedicated to Him and his Service.</p>
            <p>An early Piety muſt needs be very acceptable and pleaſing to God. Our <hi>Bleſſed Lord</hi> took great pleaſure to ſee <hi>little Children come unto Him;</hi> an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem</hi> of the pleaſure he takes that men ſhould liſt themſelves betimes in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. St. <hi>John</hi> was the youngeſt of all the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi> had a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kindneſs and affection for him; for he is ſaid to be <hi>the Diſciple whom Jeſus loved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a good ſign that we value God as we ought, and have a true eſteem for his ſervice, when we can find in our hearts to give him our <hi>good Days,</hi> and <hi>the years</hi> which we our ſelves <hi>have pleaſure in:</hi> And that we have a grateful ſenſe of his benefits and of our mighty obligation to him, when we make the quickeſt and beſt returns we can, and think nothing too good to render to <hi>Him</hi> from whom we have received all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:34942:102"/>
It is likewiſe an argument of great Sincerity, which is the Soul of all R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Virtue, when a man devotes himſelf to God betimes: becauſe it is a good evidence that he is not drawn by thoſe forcible conſtraints, nor driven to God by that preſſing neceſſity which lies upon men in time of <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>old Age.</hi> And on the contrary, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be very diſpleaſing to God to be neglected by us when we are in the flower and vigor of our Age: When our Blood is warm, and our Spirits quick, and our Parts are at the beſt, <hi>then</hi> to think our ſelves too good to ſerve God; what an affront is this to Him who hath deſerved ſo infinitely well of us, and beyond the beſt and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As there is Joy in Heaven at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a great and old Sinner, ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a very delightful Spectacle to God and Angels, and to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, to ſee a Young Perſon beſieged by powerful Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on every ſide, to acquit himſelf gloriouſly, and reſolutely to hold out againſt the moſt violent Aſſaults: To behold one, in the pride and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Age, that is courted by Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Honours, by the Devil and all the bewitching Vanities of this World, to reject all theſe and to cleave ſtedfaſtly to God: Nay, to frown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all theſe Temptations and to look down upon them with indignation and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Image of God. This work ſhall take up my whole Life, there ſhall be no void or empty Space in it; I will endeavour, as much as poſſibly I can, that there may be no gap or breach in it for the Devil and his Temptations to enter in: Lord, I will be thine, I have choſen thee for my happineſs and <hi>my portion for ever: Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee. Lo! they that are far from thee ſhall periſh: But it is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> to begin and end my Days in his fear and to his glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly</hi> and Laſtly, This Age of our Life may, for any thing we know, be the only Time we may have for this purpoſe; and if we caſt off the thoughts of God and defer the buſineſs of Religion to old Age, intending, as we pretend, to ſet about it at that Time, we may be cut off before that Time comes, and <hi>turned into Hell with the People that forget God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Work of Religion is the moſt neceſſary of all other, and muſt be done one time or other, or we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly undone for ever. We cannot begin it too ſoon, but we eaſily delay

it too long; and then we are miſerable paſt all recovery. He that would not venture his immortal Soul, and put his everlaſting Happineſs upon the greateſt hazard and uncertainty, muſt make Religion his firſt buſineſs and care, muſt think of God betimes and <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Creator in the days of his Youth.</hi>

               </gap>times, and to engage early in the ways of Religion and Virtue. Do not ſuffer your ſelves to be cheated and bewitched
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34942:104"/>
by ſenſual ſatisfactions, and to be deſtroyed by eaſe and proſperity. Let not a perpetual tenor of Health and Pleaſure ſoften and diſſolve your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and baniſh all wiſe and ſerious thoughts out of your Minds. Be not ſo fooliſh and unworthy, as to think that you have a privilege to forget God when he is moſt mindful of you; <hi>when the Candle of the Lord ſhines about your Tabernacle,</hi> and you are enjoying the health, and ſtrength, and ſweetneſs of Life.</p>
            <p>No man knows what he does, and what an invaluable Treaſure he prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally waſtes, when he lets ſlip this golden Seaſon and Opportunity of his Life; whilſt he is yet innocent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted with Sin and Vice, and his Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Conſider, that the ways of Religion and Virtue are nothing ſo difficult and unpleaſant now, as they will be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: And that the longer you forget God, and the more you are eſtranged from Him, the more unwilling you will be to think of him and to return to him: That your Luſts will every day
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34942:105"/>
gain more ſtrength, and your hearts by degrees will contract ſuch a ſtiffneſs and hardneſs that it will be no eaſy matter to work upon them.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>remember your Creator in the days of your youth: To day, whilſt it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of Sin.</hi> When will you think of beginning a good courſe, if not now? You have a great Work before you which cannot be done in a little time, which cannot be begun and finiſh'd at once. Your whole Life is no more than ſufficient for it; to do it to the beſt advantage, and as it ought to be done. Do not then think of crowding it into a corner of your Life, much leſs of putting it off to the very end of it: When <hi>that night comes, no man can work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider further; If we will deny God the hearty and vigorous ſervice of our beſt days, how can we expect that he will accept the faint and flattering Devotions of old Age? Wiſe men are wont to forecaſt and provide ſome ſtay and comfort for themſelves againſt the evils and infirmities of that Time; that they may have ſomething to lean upon in their weakneſs, ſomething to mitigate
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34942:105"/>
and allay the troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that dark and gloomy Evening: That what they cannot enjoy of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pleaſure and ſatisfaction may in ſome meaſure be made up to them in comfortable reflections upon the paſt actions of a holy and innocent, an uſeful and well ſpent Life.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, if we have neglected Religion, and forgotten God days without number; if we have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an ungodly and vicious Life, we have treaſured up ſo much guilt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, ſo many aggravations of our ſorrow and anguiſh againſt an evil Day; and have fooliſhly contrived to make our burthen then heavieſt, when we are leaſt able to ſtand under it; and have provided and laid in infinite mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Repentance, when there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any ſpace and opportunity left for the exerciſe of it; and when we ſhall be utterly diſhearten'd from ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſo vaſt a Work, of which we can ſee no end; and yet have ſo very little time for it, that if we do any thing at all in it we ſhall be forc'd to huddle it up in ſo much haſte and confuſion, as will, I doubt, ſignify but very little ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our preſent comfort, or our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs.</p>

Conſider this in time, all ye that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God in the Day of your proſperity and in the beſt Age of your Life, and yet when the Day of affliction and the infirmities of Age come upon you would be glad then to have God mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of you, and merci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ul to you. But if thou wouldſt not have Him <hi>caſt thee off in thine old Age and forſake thee when thy ſtrength fails,</hi> do thou <hi>remember Him in the days of thy youth,</hi> in the prime and vigor of thine Age: For <hi>this is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Time, this is the Day of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore acquaint thy ſelf with Him, and <hi>remember him NOW; in the days of thy Youth;</hi> defer not ſo neceſſary a work, no not for one moment: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it juſt <hi>now,</hi> that ſo thou mayeſt have made ſome good progreſs in it before <hi>the evil days come;</hi> before <hi>the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,</hi> and all the comforts and joys of Life be fled and gone.</p>
            <p>Be not deceived, O man, whoſoever thou art; for <hi>God is not mock'd.</hi> He will not be put off by us <hi>with the Days in which we our ſelves have no pleaſure.</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up thy ſelf <hi>a living Sacrifice</hi> and not a <hi>Carkaſs,</hi> if thou wouldſt be accepted. Do not provoke and affront the Living

God by offering up to him faint ſpirits, and feeble hands, and dim eyes, and a dead heart. He hath been bountiful to us in giving us the beſt Bleſſings of Life, and all things richly to enjoy; and do we grudge Him the moſt valuable part of our Lives, and <hi>the years which we</hi> our ſelves <hi>have pleaſure in? Do we thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the Lord? fooliſh people and unwiſe!</hi> Is the Giver of all good things unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receive from us any thing that is good? <hi>If we offer up the lame in Sacrifice, is it not evil? and if we offer up the blind, is it not evil? Offer it now to thy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and try if he will be pleaſed with thee and accept thy perſon.</hi> Hath God deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo ill at our hands, that we ſhould forget and neglect Him? And hath the Devil deſerved ſo well of us, that we ſhould be contented to ſpend the beſt part of our Lives in his Service, which is perfect Slavery? Was he our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or can he make us happy? Nay, does he not carry on a moſt malicious deſign to make us for ever miſerable?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let me urge thoſe who have neglected this firſt and beſt Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Lives to repent quickly and return to a better mind, leſt all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing it be loſt for ever,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34942:107"/>
and their caſe become deſperate and paſt remedy. Reſolve to redeem, if it be poſſible, the Time which you ſhould have improved: you have ſquander'd away too much already, waſte no more of this precious Opportunity of Life: you have deferr'd a neceſſary Work too long, delay it no longer. Do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude your ſelves with vain hopes that this Work may be done at any time, and in an inſtant; and that if you can but faſhion your laſt breath into <hi>Lord have mercy upon me,</hi> this will prevail with God and make atonement for the long courſe of a wicked and ſinful Life. What ſtrange thoughts have men of God and Heaven, what extravagant conceits of the little evil of Sin and the great eaſineſs of Repentance, that can impoſe upon themſelves at this rate?</p>
            <p>Bethink your ſelves better in time, <hi>conſider and ſhew your ſelves men.</hi> What will you do in the day of your diſtreſs, who have neglected God in your moſt flouriſhing and proſperous condition? What will you ſay to Him in a dying hour, who ſcarce ever had one ſerious thought of him all your Life? Can you have the face at that time to beſpeak him in this manner? Lord, now the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34942:107"/>
World and my Luſts have left me, and I feel my ſelf ready to ſink into eternal perdition, I lay hold upon thy Mercy to deliver my Soul from going down into the Pit. I have heard ſtrange things of thy Goodneſs and that thou art mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful even to a miracle. This is that which I always truſted to, that after a long Life of Sin and Vanity thou wouldſt at laſt be pacified with a few penitent words and ſighs at the hour of Death. Let me not, I pray thee, be diſappointed of this hope and put to confuſion.</p>
            <p>Is this an addreſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it to be made to a wiſe man, much leſs to the all-wiſe and juſt Judge of the World? and yet this ſeems to be the plain interpretation of the late and forc'd application of a great and habitual Sinner to Almighty God in his laſt extremity, and when he is juſt giving up the ghoſt and going to appear before his dreadful Tribunal.</p>
            <p>I ſay again, let no man deceive you with vain words, or with vain hopes, or with falſe notions of a ſlight and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den repentance: As if Heaven were an Hoſpital founded on purpoſe to receive all ſick and maimed perſons, that when they can live no longer to the Luſts of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34942:108"/>
the ſinfulPleaſures of this World can but put up a cold and formal Petition to be admitted there.</p>
            <p>No, No, as ſure as God is true, they ſhall never ſee the Kingdom of God, who inſtead of ſeeking it in the firſt place make it their laſt Refuge and Retreat: And when they find themſelves under the Sentence of Death and Damnation, only to avoid preſent Execution, and ſince there is no other remedy, do at laſt bethink themſelves of getting to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and fall upon their knees to petition the <hi>Great Judge of the World</hi> that they may be <hi>tranſported</hi> thither.</p>
            <p>Can any man in reaſon expect that ſuch a Petition will be granted? I tell you Nay; but except you repent ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and at a fitter time, and after a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faſhion, you ſhall certainly periſh. As much as God deſires the Salvation of Men, he will not proſtitute Heaven, and ſet the Gates of it wide open to thoſe who only fly to it in extremity, but never ſought it in good earneſt, nor indeed do now care for it or deſire it for any other reaſon, but to excuſe them from going to Hell. They have no value for Heaven, becauſe they are in no wiſe fit for it, but yet they think
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34942:108"/>
Hell to be the worſe Place of the two.</p>
            <p>The ever Bleſſed God is Himſelf abundantly ſufficient for his own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and does not need our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to make any addition to it: Nor yet is Heaven ſo deſolate a Place, or ſo utterly void of Inhabitants, that like ſome newly diſcovered <hi>Plantation</hi> it ſhould be glad to receive the moſt vile and profligate perſons, the Scum and refuſe of Mankind. There are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Company of glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, much nobler Creatures than the beſt of Men, to people thoſe bleſſed Regions. <hi>Thouſands of thouſands</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>ſtand before God, and ten thouſand times ten thouſands miniſter unto Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do abſolutely ſtand in need of God to make us happy, but He hath no need of us to help Him to be ſo. God indeed is ſo good, as to deſire our Happineſs as earneſtly as if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his own: But he is happy in and from Himſelf, and without Him it is impoſſible we ſhould be happy, nay we muſt of neceſſity be for ever miſerable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To conclude; if we would have God to accept us in a dying hour, and our</hi> B. Saviour to rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
