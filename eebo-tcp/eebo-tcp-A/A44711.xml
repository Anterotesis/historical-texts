            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Discours of DUNKIRK.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T can hardly be parallelld in Story, That any place of such Defence, as <hi>Dunkirk</hi> pretends to be, had more various turns of Fortune, and change of <hi>Masters</hi> in so short a revolution of time; For this is the Fift <hi>New-Master</hi> that <hi>Dunkirk</hi> hath had in less then the compass of XX yeers, wherof fower of them got Her by <hi>Force;</hi> Which makes the World much question the strength and <hi>tenableness</hi> therof.</p>
            <p>The late Surrender that <hi>England</hi> made of this Town to the <hi>French,</hi> though it was a pure <hi>Act of State,</hi> (therfore not disputable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49796:3"/>
by any) yet being a business of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concernment, and so open to the Eye of the world, it hath ministred matter of much Talk, and banding of Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Critiques</hi> of the Times, as well Forreners as Others.</p>
            <p>The dessein of this small Tract is to set down the Arguments <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Contra,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to this great Action: For according to the Rule of the Schools, <hi>Contraria juxta se posita magis elucescunt;</hi> Contraries put cross grow more cleer. And as out of the Collision of Flint and Steel, ther issues forth <hi>Fire,</hi> so by confrontation, and clash of Argument, <hi>Truth</hi> comes to appear more perspicuous.</p>

               <head>The Affirmatif Arguments for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>
               </head>
               <item>1. <hi>IT stood convenient to invade</hi> Flanders, France, <hi>and some Territories of the</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>It might have served for a Nursery of training up Soldiers.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>It had secured Navigation, and the Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic of his Majesties Subjects.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>It might have bin brought to have bin a</hi> Porto Franco, <hi>a Free Port, and so have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancd Trade.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. <hi>It had bin a Repute for</hi> England <hi>to have kept it, And a Disparagement to part with it.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>This I beleeve is all that can be said for the <hi>Affirmatif</hi> part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49796:4"/>
BEfore Arguments be producd to the contrary, tis expedient that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction should precede, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That there are</hi> Forren <hi>Possessions or Places of two sorts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Ther are some that are got by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Marchant, where finding the Clime temperat, the Soyle healthful, and proper, by the help of <hi>Industry,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some Staple Commodities that may feed Trade, and be fit for <hi>Sale</hi> or <hi>Barter,</hi> He takes firm footing, puts in his Spade, and Plants. Such Transmarin Possessions car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many advantages with them; They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease Shipping and Seamen; They dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden the Kingdome of superfluous Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; They nourish and improve Mutual Commerce, and all this while consume no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Publique Tresure, but are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to subsist of themselfs, The Souverain Prince giving only his Royal Protection, encouragement and countenance, with fit Governors therunto: <hi>Virginia, Maryland,</hi> the <hi>Bermudas, Barbados,</hi> with others of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbe</hi> 
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49796:4"/>
Islands, and divers more in the Indies, are places of this nature, as <hi>Jamayca,</hi> &amp;c. And ther are great hopes that in <hi>Afric Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> will prove so, with other extraordinary advantages besides.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But there are other <hi>Forren</hi> Possessions which cannot support themselfs either by benefit of Trade, or Contributions of the adjacent Country, but are meerly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Praesidial Forces or Garison, and by the exported tresure of the possessing Prince. <hi>England</hi> in Ages passd hath had divers <hi>Forren</hi> places of this quality, But twas dayly found, That they still Exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted her Tresure and Armories; They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasd her cares and trouble; They begot Jelousies in her Neighbours; They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbd her repose and quietude at home, <hi>England</hi> slept best when she was without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such. And in the procedure of this Discourse, I beleeve <hi>Dunkirk</hi> will appeer to be a place of that nature.</p>
            <p>This Distinction going before, we will now take the <hi>Affirmatif</hi> Arguments for keeping of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> in their order.</p>
            <p>Touching the first three, Tis tru that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49796:5"/>
               <hi>Dunkirk</hi> by the site therof, stands for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Inlet into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries annexd; But for <hi>France</hi> and the United Provinces, ther is another Prince's Country interposd before an Army can enter any of them, but may be interrupted, unless leave be granted; And to <hi>force</hi> a passage would be an infringement of the peace by the one party; And to <hi>permit</hi> a passage may be a breach of Article by the other part, being in friendship with both.</p>
            <p>But touching the foresaid Nations, ther be choice of other places, and bold coasts far cheaper for <hi>England,</hi> and more <hi>accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and easie to be made use of for an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in case of a war, without keeping such a costly Key as <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> yet not knowing when we shold have occasion to make use of it, In regard His Majesty is at present in good terms with the said Nations, and like to continue so for the future, His Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations propending naturally rather to Peace then War, according to the Genius of his two blessed Immediat Predecessors. Now the keeping still of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> wold have inevitably drawn a War upon us, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance from all the three. And let this surlice for an answer <hi>in part</hi> to the first
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49796:5"/>
three Arguments, till we proceed further.</p>
            <p>Touching the other Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Dunkirk</hi> might have served for a Seminary of Soldiers which <hi>England</hi> might have made use of in time of need; To this tis answerd, That the hundred and thirty thousand Pounds Sterling that went yeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maintain those Soldiers in <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> (and towards the fortifying therof) which exported mony may be said to be like the Soul of <hi>Judas,</hi> which never came back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as the <hi>Italian</hi> hath it; I say, that huge sum wold be far better spent at home within the Land to maintain a Military a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual strength for security of Prince and Peeple against any Civil Insurrection, by constant Regiments of Horse and Foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore, and a Squadron of Iusty men of War at Sea, both which the Moneys that were transported weekly to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> will be able to keep in constant pay.</p>
            <p>Touching the fift Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That the keeping of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> wold have securd Navigation and Traffic; Tis answered, That the next yeer after that <hi>England</hi> had a Garison and Governour in <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the town of <hi>Ostend</hi> &amp; those of <hi>Biscay</hi> did us more mischief far then <hi>Dunkirk</hi> ever had done in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49796:6"/>
so short a time: for the <hi>Dunkirk-</hi>Men of War going to those places, ther were ships of ours of greater bulks, and richer bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens taken then before; the strength and soule of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> passing as it were by a kind of <hi>transmigration</hi> into those places. Moreover, observable it is, That when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was advisd by the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to take <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the matter being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrd to her Privy Council, after much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation it was resolved, That <hi>England</hi> was better without <hi>Dunkirk</hi> then <hi>with</hi> it, and that for divers reasons of State; One whereof was, That it wold be a means that <hi>English</hi> Ships of a greater burden wold be built, and cause her Marchant-men to go better armd abroad, and with stouter Vessels, which in case of necessity might serve the Public.</p>
            <p>Touching security of Trade; Tis well known that <hi>England</hi> hath Ports and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of her own, to make her Seas narrow enough for Her, to check and give Law to any that shall sayle in her Channels, and consequently to defend her Marchants and others without the help of <hi>Dunkirk:</hi> But touching <hi>Trade</hi> it self, Now that <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is in Other hands, it will be much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49796:6"/>
unto <hi>England</hi> in point of Trade; for while we kept it, ther was scarce any Commerce at all in that Town, or the Country about it; And far less now since the <hi>French</hi> have had it.</p>
            <p>Touching the making of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> a Free-Port (or a kind of <hi>Sound</hi> as that in the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tik)</hi> tis but a <hi>sandy</hi> Conceit, For the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about being but ill inclind unto us in this particular, we shold not have bin able to have beaten any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Trade into the Inland Countries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we had <hi>forcd</hi> it, which could not have bin done without a violation of the Peace.</p>
            <p>Besides, how much this wold have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicd our so long settled Staples in <hi>Dort,</hi> and <hi>Hamborough,</hi> let any man judge: But the truth is, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is not a place proper for a <hi>Free Port,</hi> because tis made a Port ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Chance</hi> then by <hi>Nature;</hi> for tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servd that the Harbour which goes from <hi>Mardike</hi> to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> together with the <hi>Splinter,</hi> is accidentally causd by the great Scowre that proceeds from the check, or reverberations and Eadies which the stream receaves that runs from the West twixt <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Callis,</hi> by the Cliffs which jett out from the English shore; And the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49796:7"/>
shore on that side being all sand, was easily in tract of time worn into a Harbour. But such Harbours have bin known to alter as the points of the Cliffs did wear out and vary, or as the sands did fill, or were washd away: wherof divers Examples may be producd, as the Port of <hi>Stavere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> in <hi>Frise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was once a Town of much Traffik, but now is become a poor place, the Haven being choakd up with sand. Adde hereunto, that scarce any Boat can come to <hi>Dunkirk</hi> upon low water, but the Keele will be grating upon the sands all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; nor can any ship of any great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den come near her but upon a Spring-tyde. Tis also a wild kind of Harbor lying open to the Sea, without any windings or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land shelter: so that let the wind blow from what point of the Compass it will, the ships riding there are exposd to the fury of it, and upon the dragging of an Anchor, <hi>wrecks</hi> do commonly follow upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning strand.</p>
            <p>Touching the punctilios of <hi>honor</hi> that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> may hazard in parting with <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> tis answerd, That twas nothing dishonorable for <hi>England</hi> to give away that which she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver got: for indeed twas the <hi>French King</hi> who

            <p>The first Forren thing that <hi>England</hi> ever had, was <hi>Normandy,</hi> which came to be her Inheritance; a rich and copious Country, yet we could never make that Country sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of it self, but our Mony, Men, and Arms went still over to secure it. <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, though her Native Duke, did (as an authentique Historian hath it) <hi>Angliam deglubere,</hi> He did shear <hi>England</hi> to keep it; <hi>Rufus</hi> his son did <hi>Angliam Exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riare,</hi> He did fley <hi>England</hi> to preserve it; His Granchild did <hi>Angliam emulgere us<expan>

            <p>The next <hi>Forren</hi> Country that came to truckle under <hi>England,</hi> was <hi>Aquitane, Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> and <hi>Gascony,</hi> the most exuberant and fertillst Provinces of all <hi>France,</hi> yet they could never countervail the cost, but they still draind moneys, and multitudes of men out of <hi>England,</hi> who at their returns in steed of spoils and wealth, brought nothing but poverty, and so increasd the number of Beggers and <hi>Thiefs.</hi>

            <p>The town of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> her self, though a rich Mercantile City, did hardly defray the Salary of the <hi>English</hi> Praesidiary forces that were in it; and <hi>Fronsack</hi> Castle alone did cost 1000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi> as the Record hath it; As also, that it was deliverd in Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 7 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. that <hi>Gascony</hi> with other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we held then in <hi>France,</hi> stood <hi>England</hi> in above the Revenues therof, 24000 <hi>l.</hi> a yeer.</p>

Concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> which comes in the rank of <hi>Forren</hi> Acquests, though it be a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>felf-sufficient</hi> Country, and as one said, a good fat Goose to pluck, yet the Revenues therof never counter-balancd the charge till the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Staffords</hi> time, who maybe said to be the first which made <hi>Ireland</hi> a <hi>Nown Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantif</hi> to stand by it self, without any sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of tresure from <hi>England.</hi> Nor could Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> though cryed up for a great Housewife, bring it to subsist of it self, no not in time of Peace, but still Moneys were sent over from the Exchequer in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> which may be seen upon exact record: But in time of <hi>War,</hi> the example of Sir <hi>John Perrot</hi> may serve for all, who in his two years Government there, spent <hi>England</hi> 116368 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last <hi>Forren</hi> places which <hi>England</hi> had, were the Cautionary Towns of <hi>Flush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Brill,</hi> and the <hi>Ramakins;</hi> But when the 80000 <hi>l.</hi> for which they were hypothequd or pawnd was paid King <hi>James,</hi> twas found that almost the whole sum had bin drunk up in paying the English Garisons all the while.</p>
            <p>From these Premises this Conclusion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49796:11"/>
may be deducd, That no Outlandish or Transmarin Possessions (except those late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Indies</hi> pointed at before, which are supported by the Merchant) did ever make <hi>England</hi> thrive, but they were a cause of perpetual issues of <hi>tresure,</hi> which is the great Artery of any Country, wherby <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> may be said to have spent her very blood and Vital Spirits upon them from time to time.</p>
            <p>Now, the Reason may well be, that such <hi>Excentrique</hi> Possessions did not prosper with <hi>England,</hi> in regard that by the Primitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of God and Nature, the Ile of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is a compleat distinct Mass of Earth, and an Empire of it self; She may be said to be as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> saith of Her, <hi>Comola Tortuga en su concha,</hi> like a Tortoise in her shell, who is so prodigiously armd, (but for <hi>Defence</hi> only) and the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence accordingly hath made <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> more apposit and proper to <hi>Defend,</hi> then to <hi>Extend</hi> her self further. And to that Defensive end she hath those two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties which the Philosopher requires in a strong self-preserving Country, <hi>viz.</hi> An easie Egress for the Natives who know her shallows and shelfs of sands, her Flats and 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49796:11"/>
Rocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a hard Ingress for the <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> who knows them not.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of having the best shipping of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for her own <hi>Defence;</hi> For no Country hath such tough Oke as she hath for <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee-Timber,</hi> and for other Naval uses: Her Peeple also have a Natural Dexterity and Aptitude to <hi>Navigation,</hi> with a courage extraordinary that way.</p>
            <p>Adde herunto, that the Position of her Seas, with the straightness therof in point of distance from her Neighbours, is such, and her Ports upon those Seas are so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiously situated, that none can pass or repass through her <hi>Sleeve</hi> or <hi>Channels,</hi> but she may controul them without the help of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> or any other coadjuvant place on her opposit Coasts, specially at such a monstrous rate: For according to the cautious old saying, <hi>A man may buy Gold too dear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude: Wheras some do insist much on point of Honor by parting with <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> in the judgment of the most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well-weighd men, it had bin taken rather as a Dishonor for a King of <hi>Great</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49796:12"/>
               <hi>Britain</hi> to distrust his <hi>strength</hi> so much, as not to be able to gard his own Seas and Subjects as his Royal Progenitors did, without the adventitious help of a <hi>Forren</hi> place got by so notorious a Regicide, with an aim &amp; intent to enable him the more to have still kept him out. And it may be well remembred, that his present Majesty of <hi>England</hi> appeerd then against the taking of it; to which purpose the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Glocester</hi> were actually in Arms in the field for opposing it; and it was the Duke of <hi>York</hi> who gave the first charge, and did notable execution.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It may well stand with the reach of tru Policy, and the interest of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to leave the town of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> like a bone twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> as very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably tis like to prove in time. Moreover, this so neer approach of the <hi>French</hi> begins alredy to make some Impressions of Jelou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> being awakend by the old Proverb, <hi>Ayez le Francois pour ton Amy, non pas pour ton Voisin;</hi> Have the French for thy <hi>Frend,</hi> not for thy <hi>Neighbor</hi> if thou canst chuse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49796:12"/>
Thus have we twisted this great Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon a small bottome, for the <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of evry true Childe of Reason, and <hi>confutation</hi> of those who, being transported by Aery Conceits, cry it down for an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politik Act of State.</p>

            <head>Nevv Additions Concerning the HARBOUR AT DUNKIRK.</head>
            <p>THe Sea retreats upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ebb and low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the least one English Mile back from the Harbour, so that the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is all dry, and a man may go along the deepest part of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49796:14"/>
said Harbour with his shooes dry a Mile towards the Sea.</p>
            <p>And at the highest Spring-tyde there is no deeper water at the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, or at the going out of the Habour at the utmost, but 15 Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish foot.</p>
            <p>Insomuch, That no Ships or Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels can go out, or come into the said Harbour, which go deeper then 11 or 12 foot; and when the Ships or Vessels which go deep 11 or 12 foot, that must be just at the highest Spring-tyde, within an hours time before the water begins to ebb or fall, and that the weather and Sea be smooth and calm, otherwise if the Sea be rough and tumbling, the Ships or Vessels by the cappling of the Sea will strike to the ground, and break themselves in an hundred pieces, as very often is seen, if they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49796:14"/>
take not great heed. The Ground within and without the Harbour is hard all over, and the Ships or Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels within must lie at every ebb of the water upon the hard ground, in danger to crack and break them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by their own weight, with that of their Ordnance and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>And every Frigat, Ship or Vessel of about 180 or 200 Tun in bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, with their Cargos, and Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and Provision in it, goes at the least 12 or 13 foot deep: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is onely a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for small Vessels and Boats, such as their first and former Trade of <hi>Fishing</hi> and drying of Herrings was; and nothing at all fit for any men of War, or Ships of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Splinter</hi> or <hi>Schourtien</hi> of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike,</hi> 
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49796:15"/>
which is a Creek along the Sea there, about an English Mile in length, accidentally occasioned by the current of the Sea all along the shore, or coast, is of a much deeper water, and of more consequence then the Harbour of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> but it lies so open to the Sea, that by hard winds and stress of weather no ships can possibly ride there in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but are in danger to break their Cables, and be cast upon the shore by any Westerly Winds.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Splinter</hi> or <hi>Schourtien</hi> goes not to the Harbour of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> but is by one Mile or more short of the Harbour: but if any Ships will go from thence to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> they must pass over a hard s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndy Bank, where no Ships can go over which goe deeper then 8 or 9 foot at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Spring-tyde; and that must be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49796:15"/>
with a calm water, or smooth Sea.</p>
            <p>And for to gain two foot deeper, all Ships that are of any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable burthen, must go round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and backwards by the Sea to come into <hi>Dunkirk</hi> at the highest Spring-tyde, over the sand-banks, which are a great many, all about, two or three Leagues broad near the said Harbour and Sea-shore, and very moveable, and altering upon every stress of weather, so that most great Ships or Men of War going from thence are put to the trouble to provide themselves with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Pilot, or <hi>Costerer,</hi> as they call him, by reason of the said shelfs and banks of sands, between which the <hi>Hollands</hi> Men of War were used to lie at Anchor, but in Summer only.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Cadde</hi> and others have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49796:16"/>
made several Sea-Maps of the said sandy Banks for their better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which are printed, and may be had for 6 or 8 <hi>d.</hi> apiece.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is not worth the tenth part of the Charges which a Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must needs cost to keep the said Town, if the King of <hi>England,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> or the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> should possess it.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is not fitting for any to hold, excepting it be for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose Country lies round about it, being a fit Port for his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, &amp; their in ward Commerce, and commodity of Trading, because the King of <hi>Spain</hi> needs not have any greater Garison therein then two, three or four Companies of Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>souldiers to keep the Inhabitants in obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49796:16"/>
Moreover, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is inclosed, bounded and confined between <hi>Graveling, Bourborgh, Linken, Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox-Bergen, Honscatey, Furne</hi> and <hi>Newport:</hi> so that the Garisons in <hi>Dunkirk</hi> can go no further, nor have any Contribution beyond it out of any Friends or Enemies Country; being so narrowly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed, that it is not possible to maintain and nourish the tenth part of the Garison with Victuals, if they be not supplyed from abroad ever and anon.</p>
            <p>Now, if <hi>Dunkirk</hi> should have a bold and ventrous Enemy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from or along the Sea-shore, the said Enemy may lodge himself the first night between the <hi>Fort rouge</hi> and the Harbour, and be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the said Harbour the first
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49796:17"/>
night, so that no Vessel can go out, nor come in, or subsist in the said Harbour, but may be be battered in pieces: whereby 'tis no hard matter to destroy also the Brick-wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Town and the Harbour level to the ground, and so take the Town that way by a Ship-bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the said Harbour, or at low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in spight of all their fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons round about it.</p>
            <p>But to think to make there a kind of <hi>Sound,</hi> as that in the <hi>Baltik</hi> Sea between <hi>Elsenore</hi> and <hi>Elsenborg,</hi> which are but one League distance the one from the other, is but a shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low imagination: for <hi>England</hi> could not do it when she had <hi>Calis</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great distance the one from the other, which is seven Leagues from <hi>Dover;</hi> and much less likely is such a thing to be

done between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> being twelve Leagues distant the one from the other: besides, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of the many shallows, and ill-favoured banks under water in the Sea, &amp; the contrary courses of the streams, occasioned by the said banks, make commonly the passage more confused and incertain by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours difference in sayling.</p>
