            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Wept he; nor did perceive his Brother gone.</l>

               <hi>childs praerogative,</hi> griefe not to know.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:51675:4"/>
But when thy body was put in the ground,</l>
            <l>And from our eyes quite hid, O then he found</l>
            <l>A loss so manifest, from his young yeeres</l>
            <l>His Brother to be seen no more drew teares.</l>
            <l>Nor did, about the grave, the company</l>
            <l>There standing round their teares and sighs deny,</l>
            <l>When a childs cheeks were wet: the force was such,</l>
            <l>It did even strangers hearts with pitty touch.</l>
            <p>At this funerall, I say, I with our little <hi>William</hi> was
chiefe mourner. And who, then I, had better right?
For if in mourning we weigh the losse of friendship, my
parents degree of inequality, my sisters sex; my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
tender age kept them at a greater distance from the
deceased. But I joyn'd unto him in an equall familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of kindred, how little wanted I of being a twin with
him! The same studies too gave occasion of mutuall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
And hee might even in this respect bee no lesse
deare unto me, then in that he was a brother. I say thus
least, when I comfort you, you may think, a sound man
gives counsell to a sick. You have one a partner with
you in sorrow; yea who contends in mourning, and ye<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
is bold not only to comfort himselfe, but to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
unto others the experiment of that, which hee hath
found to be good against his own griefe. First therefore
let me see, whether I ought not to fear, least I may rub
wound too fresh, and as yet not clos'd up with a scarre
whilest I run to apply over-hasty remedies. I suppose
not. For I speake both unto a man, and a father, whom
the very custome of our Country forbids to prolong hi<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
mourning beyond the buriall. Surely parents have no<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
so great cause, as the common people thinke, to grieve
as not to grieve; and even in this, that they have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:51675:4"/>
Children, finde comfort. It was much, but it
came from nature, of him, who said: <hi>I knew I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
a mortall.</hi> Wee deceive our selves, if wee doe not
daily thinke, that they shall not alwaies be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us had never been. See how great the perversness
of mans disposition is. To lacke children is not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
but to those who have had them. And yet Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelors
are no lesse childlesse then others; but they
mourne not. Why then should wee not loſe without
teares what without teares wee could have wanted?
Many are the pleas for vice; and not only covetousness,
and ambition, and luxury come under this name,
but also excessive and unreasonable griefe: I could have
wish'd he had surviv'd me according to the course of
Nature; I grieve that having had proofe of his piety, I
might no longer use and enjoy it: I have lost him,
whose helpe might have bin both to the service of his
Countrey, and comfort of my selfe. These are the
words of them that favour their own misery, this is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
calamity.</p>
            <l>Apples downfall, and the surviving Tree</l>
            <l>Doth her dead fruit, but with a dry bark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> see.</l>
            <l>Nor is unhappy call'd, that she lives then.</l>
            <l>False arguments of griefe please wretched men.</l>
            <l>Whose eyes in teares, at his sons death, shall swim,</l>
            <l>He weeps because his son weepes not for him.</l>
            <p>You have lost a good sonne: It is better then to have
had an ill. You have lost your paines in his education:
I may object unto you a recompence of joy, which you
tooke in his towardnesse. But this also is now gone,
and it troubles you. If you be wise, account it gaine
<pb facs="tcp:51675:5"/>
that you have had it, rather then dammage that you have
lost it. You are sure of the fruit of a past good: this can
neither be taken away, nor cease at any time; and is
onely beyond the envy of fate. It is not the part of the
same man, to grieve that it hath not befalne him long,
yet not to rejoyce, that it hath happen'd at all. See there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
how much happier you are then those who never
had a sonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet they mourne not. But if wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
children goods, and certainely they are the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
it is better not to have had them long, then never.
For, even when they are taken from us, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of them remaines still; a great delight to a
gratefull minde. You see then, parents have very little
cause to grieve, if wee weigh griefe not according to
the vulgar opinion, but right reason: Besides, that
the majesty of a parents authority, and that sacred do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of nature unbecommingly stoopes so low, as to
bewaile him dead, of whose life your selfe were the
author; and to submit your passions to him, whose pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
you are commanded to rule over. Have a care,
you do nothing misbeseeming the high dignity of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
name, in which God and Nature have plac'd you;
and yet upon her wee list to lay the fault of our impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency:
neither is any defence so ready, even of woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
lamentation, as that it proceeds from Nature.
But we are guilty of manifest calumny, in imputing our
crime to her. We all give way to griefe, yea most of us
enforce it; so pleasing it is, then which yet nothing is
more unpleasing. No man is more miserable then hee
thinks himself; and griefe no lesse, then other things, is
upheld by opinion. We deserve therefore to be oppress'd
with griefe, if we will not suppresse it.</p>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:51675:5"/>
The lowing dam her lost calfe to lament</l>
            <l>Is heard; yet her dumbe griefe's in one day spent.</l>

            <l>Tossing her main, is seen by next daies sun,</l>
            <l>Though of her foal bereav'd. When the wild Bear</l>
            <l>Rob'd of her whelps goes ranging every where</l>
            <l>Through pathlesse desarts; oft comes back again,</l>
            <l>And her forsaken den sees oft in vain,</l>
            <l>Her griefe and rage with the first night is gone.</l>
            <l>About her empty nest a bird make moan</l>
            <l>I have beheld, and oft her young brood call,</l>
            <l>Yet to her wonted flights again soon fall.</l>
            <l>Only man huggs his woe, his sorrow he</l>
            <l>Provokes by favouring: our selves wretched we</l>
            <l>By thinking make: yet griefe not all men finds</l>
            <l>Alike, nor equall sway holds in our minds.</l>
            <l>In them, who know least, it takes up most room:</l>
            <l>The barbarous Queen with a stupendious Tomb</l>
            <l>Fondly to honour her dead spouse contrives,</l>
            <l>Whilest of her selfe a maim'd part she survives.</l>
            <l>Not so those Nations by right reason taught,</l>
            <l>Whose hearts with truth are and Religion fraught.</l>
            <l>Women their bosomes beat with their weak armes:</l>
            <l>And with their fists give sorrow fresh alarms:</l>
            <l>Mothers their bare breasts tear, in showres their eies</l>
            <l>Dissolve; they tremble with astonisht cries.</l>
            <l>Griefe is more staid in men: this difference</l>
            <l>The sex makes, take at Nature no offence,</l>
            <l>Who under the same law all people keeps.</l>
            <l>Then length of Time dries up the eye that weeps,</l>
            <l>Nature yeelds not to Time. If longer day</l>
            <l>Can make a quiet mind, scorn thou delay:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:51675:6"/>
A wise man's his owne Time; shall griefe be quell'd</l>
            <l>Against my will, and I to joy compell'd?</l>
            <p>Among those reasons which disswade from lamenting
for the dead, this is even a chiefe, that wee must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
a griefe which is in vaine, which may adde us to
them, cannot bring back them to us. Let that sorrow
cease, which if it cease not, nothing availes. Wee shall
sooner want teares then matter for teares, which this
Universe continually suggests: and whereas therefore
nothing ought to be more precious, nor are they rashly
to be shed, of which there is so much use: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
we are of nothing so prodigall; and indeed,
when wee have least cause. Many are the evills which
surprize a man unawares. But, then the death of him
and his, nothing is more certain. We must not weep for
that done, which, that it would come to passe, we were
not ignorant of. What do the so frequent sounds of
passing bels signifie, but that no body is Natures favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite?
Others mischances daily admonish us, that they
are common: and yet when so many funeralls passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes, when we follow so many to buriall, we
dare begin hopes of long life; as if priviledg'd from that
aeternall law, and not plac'd in the same slippery condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the whole world. And hence it is, that
these stroakes more hurt us, because they are lesse fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen.
Why cease we not then to complaine of the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of sate, who know well enough that some are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stricken, but that all are aim'd at? If, as wee ought,
we did often think on what we alwaies see, the force of
present evils would be abated, whilest wee consider fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
What marvaile is it that he is dead, whom so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have gone before, and all shall follow? I could here
<pb facs="tcp:51675:6"/>
bring in many examples of them, and indeed of great
personages, who have lost their Children: but in this
empire of fortune it would bee a much harder taske to
find out a House or Family not remarkable for some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
or that hath stood entire and unshaken to the
end. I find also that the Ancients have used this kind
of consolation; that wee go the way of all the world,
and of the Nature of things: That nothing is aeternall.
That all things are born on this condition, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
had a beginning, must have an ending: and that
one family cannot without impotent arrogancy thinke
to escape from that ruine which the whole world ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.
That whatsoever we call miracles, even most
famous Cities which yet are longer liv'd then men, have
perished. This indeed is something, not to bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to challenge privately to himselfe a griefe, whose
cause is publique; and to submit his sorrow to common
mortality: but we have far greater comforts given us
in the <hi>Souls immortality,</hi> which we attaine by an assured
faith. He is not taken away from us, but taken againe
by God, whom he had granted us during his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and did but lend him. Your son had one, whose
he was more then yours. God gave you him to bring up,
not a free-hold in him. Restore what was committed
to your trust: you know how the bargaine was: there
was a condition, that, when it seem'd good unto him,
you should surrender him: nor were you to have the
use of him, untill you were satisfied, but during his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
determination. A good Housholder hath that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
alwaies ready, for the payment of which no certain
day was set. What debtor is so ingratefull as to raile
on his creditor, and take it ill he may have no longer use
of what was lent upon courtesie, and on no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb facs="tcp:51675:7"/>
then that it should at length returne, whence it
came? Which I say also, least your griefe find this star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
hole, that he is not at a more mature age demanded
of you. He requires him not too soon, who might have
not given him at all: and if we look upon him you mourn
for, it skils not how long he liv'd, but how well. Now
of that matter we are witnesses. Hee must needs have
liv'd well, who dies so. He must needs die well, who
liv'd so. We all count others yeares, whereas we should
take thankfully what are given us, and not looke upon
those, which appertaine not to us. Hee might have
liv'd longer. No, he could not. This was his old age.
Onely so many yeeres he had: More hee receiv'd not:
Why complaine wee? It is our fault, who are never
content with time past, and reckon but upon the present,
that is, a moment. It is all one at this day, to have
liv'd your yeeres about fifty and his of eighteen. If we
regard the swiftnesse of time, no man lives long, if the
misery, none but lives too long. That this life is a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
even the Philosophers have taught; Let us
gratulate him, who hath been shew'd a shorter way to
his journies end.</p>

            <l>Will think himselfe. It would great wisdome be,</l>
            <l>What others have, as not our own, to see.</l>
            <p>Who knowes from what evill that provident Parent
hath withdrawne your sonne? How quite contrary to
the hopes, which they had rais'd, hath the disposition
of many been perverted! how many vices are abroad at
this day, what corruptions! Although God forbid I
should make this augury of him, yet we may bee glad,
that he is not onely past danger, but beyond fear. Hee
had his, almost daily, tormentor, the Collicke; which
not content alwaies to torture, would at length
have kil'd him. If he had gone with the army, what
hazards had he been liable to! A wise saying was that of
<hi>Syrus: What may happen to one man, may happen to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one.</hi> Imagine before your eyes maym'd men and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
already in a part of them; the butchery of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
who picke the bones of the living: all which
who would not abhor worse then death? But let us
suppose the least. Yet he had dyed far from the sight of
his most deare mother. We should neither have heard
<pb facs="tcp:51675:8"/>
of his sicknesse, nor of his death: wee could not have
prepar'd our hearts for the losse: nor have bin a helpe
or a comfort to him. We should have doubted still, with
what minde he took his death, which I suppose to bee
a chiefe matter. These are the evills, which our first
thoughts suggest to us: But we are sottishly ignorant,
if not yet taught even by our own example, how many,
and much more grievous those evils be, which come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us so much as dreaming on them. Many, Father,
many discommodities is he delivered from by a timely
death; and if from no other, certainly from old age. See
this also, how many comforts his very death may afford
you: He died in a slippery age; and not of a sudden,
but slow disease, so, that for a long while hee might
perceive himselfe to die: Which you perhaps may
think a part of his misery, I, of his felicity: Especially
whereas the pain was not extreme. For so it comes to
passe, that not only the body it selfe is tam'd, but also by
how much it decayes, so much the soul improves; there
follows a loathing of life, and a desire of eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Would to God you indeed had seen him, and heard,
with how great a fortitude he did challenge death. The
despairing of that health, which we wish'd him, made
him to be assur'd of a better. I will say more: God hath
call'd him to himselfe not without a miracle. Hee was
taken with a frenzy, and the contagion of his sick bodie
had also infected his minde. Yet as often as hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish'd
of death, salvation, God, as if this only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
him, hee so answer'd, as that in every word hee
shew'd a good understanding. But of the things of this
present life he was nothing at all sensible. O unhappy
we if good health had in this case surpriz'd him! Yet
once there did appeare I know not what hope thereof;
<pb facs="tcp:51675:8"/>
which, as you confesse, doth the more trouble you.
Surely God made made an experiment in him, whether
so indeed he would still be out of love with life. But the
pious youth submitted himselfe wholy to his will, being
prepar'd on either side. How great a benefit is it, that
God hath called us to be witnesse the<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eof! that we saw
him blaming the delay of death, and with an unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
breast proclaming as it were this very Verse:
<q>I've liv'd, and run the race, which God me gave.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But death it selfe, you will say, is grievous; and that
of the Antients not altogether true: That it is naturall,
and therefore not painefull. First, whatsoever it is, it is
now past. Hee seeks for sorrow where it is not, who
grieves that <hi>his</hi> have bin miserable: Nothing is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
unto Nature, then to rejoyce at the end of evill.
But what? What if to die be indeed no evill? And this
hath been believ'd even by the Philosophers. We Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
go further, and dare with <hi>Paul</hi> to say: <hi>I desire to be
dissolved and to be with Christ.</hi> This is the onely gate to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life: This is that, over which He the first fruits of
the dead hath triumphed; we therefore hear the Apostle
to contemn his sting. For our healths sake wee take poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in potions, and what soever else is loathsome to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
what should we not undergo to enjoy a perpetuall
and unchangeable health? Valiantly then, valiantly let
us endure, both death and the losse of our friends! Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
have no colour for mourning, unlesse that wee
mourne for our selves, who have lost, yea rather who
have but sent them before us. And how foule and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becomming
is this very sorrow! Who is he, that is so
much a selfe-seeker, and so envious of his friends happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="tcp:51675:9"/>
as to call back them, who are blessed, to take part
with him in misery? If you would do any thing for your
sons sake, if there be any respect to bee had to his ghost,
do what you think hee would have you doe, if hee hath
any care at all of humane affaires. Surely hee would take
it ill, you should bee afflicted for his sake, who being
plac'd above the mockeries of fortune, looks down from
aloft on the businesse of mortals.</p>
            <l>Him wondring at his glorious house of Rest,</l>
            <l>Heaven holds for ever: no more now opprest</l>
            <l>With publique, nor with private sorrow, he</l>
            <l>From hopes and fears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from sin and pain is free.</l>
            <l>Who fil'd with true light smiles at mists below,</l>
            <l>And that but empty names of things we know.</l>
            <p>And thus much indeed I have said in generall, There
are also very many other reasons you may suggest unto
your selfe in private. See <hi>Sulpitius</hi> writing to <hi>Tully:</hi>
               <q>Thinke in what manner hitherto fortune hath dealt
with us: that those things are taken away from us,
which ought unto men to be no less dear then children.</q>
Adde but this one evil, and how can griefe bee raised
higher? or what mind exercis'd in these calamities
ought not to grow insensible, and to esteem more lightly
of all things?</p>
            <l>So many miseries are lost, if we</l>
            <l>Are not by suffering hardned, nor to be</l>
            <l>Wretched yet learn. Hence also comes reliefe,</l>
