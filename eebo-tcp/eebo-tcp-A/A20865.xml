            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The cauſe of this Peſtilence, the<note place="margin">Galen in the ſecond boke of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</note> more parte of learned writers aſcribe vnto the ayre, but not all one waye: for ſome are of opinion that the poyſoning infection is ſent down from the ſtarres and planets, and ſo diſperſed through the ayre: other ſay that the ayre it ſelfe is putrified, the cauſe of which putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they aſcribe vnto the coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and oppoſitions of the planets, the Eclips of the Sunne, and Moone, and the coniunction of <hi>Saturnus,</hi> with other euell planets, by meanes whereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue

ſundry tempeſtes, &amp; great chaunge of the ayre, and conſequently thereof commeth diuers rottennes, and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions. For the ayre hath manifeſt cauſes of alteracion, as namelye the mingling of other ſtraunge ayre with it, or of ſome kinde of ſubſtaunce elſe, which is moſt contrary vnto vs, as are rotten vapors: and thereof it putrifieth and waxeth peſtilent, and is chaunged into the nature of poiſon. Whereby it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, this plague rageth ſumtime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, ſumtime amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g beaſts, and ſumtime among graſſe, fruite, &amp; corne. And there be many thinges very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that are good for cattel, &amp; wyl hurt men: and contrariwiſe wyll ſlay cattel, that wyll doo men good. Like as many doo perceiue, that the feeding on naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie meates engendreth the plague, as if a man ſhould fall into the plague, by vſing ſuch euill diet, as is commonlye ſéene in the dearth of corne and other victuals: then immediatly ſhall he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect others, and when that diſeaſe by going from one to other hath gathered

ſtrength, and hath inuaded many of all ages and ſexes: it is called the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Againe, they ſuppoſe that ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the ayre is infected by lower cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of thinges rotten and putrified, as of carcaſies vnburied, wythred and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified hearbes and weedes, priuies, dunghils and ſuch lyke: which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde being drawne into our bodyes breedeth the plague, as ſome doo write of the <hi>Putauian</hi> pyt.

                  <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the colledge of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians,</hi> that the principall partes haue theyr voiding places, iſſues, or, as they terme them Emunctories, into which they clenſe and rid away what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is noyſom vnto them, ſpeciallye if thoſe partes be ſtrong, and thereby, as they ſaye, is coniecture made of the part affected: as for example, if the botch appeare in the grine, it is a ſigne
<pb facs="tcp:8620:9"/>
that the diſeaſe is in the Liuer, or in the partes beneath the midriffe: but if the ſore breake foorth in the arme pits, they ſay that the heart and the partes aboue the midriffe are infected: as they lykewiſe gather that the infection is in the braine, if the poyſoned ſwelling ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther behinde the eares, or in places thereabout: although many times there chaunceth inflamation of the kernels about the eares, called <hi>Parotides,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a more vehement heat hath lifted the matter vp higher, as ſayth <hi>Galen</hi> in the fourth booke of commentaries vppon the Aphoriſmes, the. 75.

ſometime they procéede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the braine, &amp; ſometime depend vpon other partes, according to the diuerſe temperature of the ayre, and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly hath ſet downe in the thyrd boke of his Aphoriſmes, in his booke of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies,</hi> and of the ayre, places, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>But the auctoritye of D. <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Pareus,</hi> whome poſterity acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth for the thyrd ſun of <hi>Aeſculapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> doeth much lighten and confyrme this opinion: who opening the bed wherein one laye ſicke of the Plague, felt a moſt filthye and peſtilent ſauour, ryſing from the plaguie botch and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, which ſo ſtrooke his Braine, that preſentlie he fell in a ſowne to the ground, without feeling any paine at the heart, or other accident that might declare that the heart, or ſtomacke, or any other part of the body were affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: at length, recouering ſtrength he aroſe, and his braine began to expulſe that contagious ayre, with ſo forcible ſneeſing, that the blood therewith guſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of his noſe: and vnleſſe, ſayde

hée, the expulſiue facultie of my braine had bene ſtrong, doubtleſſe I had died, for the Animall or lyuing facultie had bene therewith vtterlye oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſée, louing Reader, by the example and iudgement of ſo notable a man, that this poyſon may firſt infect the braine, no other part being hurt.</p>
               <p>For there is a perpetuall drawing of<note place="margin">Gal. in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment. vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hippocr. of humours.</note> ayre into the braine, in euerye brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing creature, in at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noſtrels through the bones called <hi>Iſtmoidea</hi> into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte ventricle or ſell of the braine, where the ſmelling vertue remaineth, whereby it commeth that it imparteth moſt readelye vnto the braine that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which it receyueth, before that it conuey it vnto the heart.

as <hi>Guido de Cauliaco</hi> hath noted in the ſame plague which beginning firſt at <hi>Auenion.</hi> was diſperſed ouer all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Lykewiſe the painfull Cathar with ſhortneſſe of breath, which the Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> termed <hi>Coqueluche,</hi> which awhile agoe raged ouer all Europe, was cauſed by the ayre, declaring it ſelfe to bée peſtilent euen by the verye force thereof, and going from man to man which was the kinde of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection do to: and notwithſtanding, all<note place="margin">Gale. in his comment.</note> the accidents and tokens declared that by ſimilitude of paſſion, the braine was likewiſe affected, as were heauines and paine in the head with deſyre to ſléepe, the mur, ſtuffing in the head, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillacion into the Lungues &amp; ſtomacke. The lyke vnto this, is to bée founde in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the thyrd booke of <hi>Epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies,</hi> where he deſcribeth a peſtilent ſtate: For many were diſeaſed in the Iawes, had impedimentes in theyr ſpeache, theyr bellyes were troubled with laſkes, many wared rotten, and fell into conſumptions, ſo that the next wynter following, wee were much

               <p>HEtherto we haue intreated of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſignes, it followeth now that we come to the cure, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in two pointes, in preuenting and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing away the ſicknes. The peſtilent ayre is auoided many wayes.

                  </gap>eth when thoſe windes do blowe. So lykewiſe it is neceſſarie to chaunge place, as from lowe places to goe vnto higher, when the plague is ingendred by corruption of the ayre: but if the winde bring the plague out of one cuntreye into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then were it keſt to deſcend from a high dwelling to a lower, where the ground is watriſhe, and the ayre thick, which wyll hardlye receyue the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the ſupernall bodies. And when we haue choſen an houſe, then the peſtilent ayre is to be corrected, by burning of ſuch thinges as eyther by ſecrete or manifeſt qualitie are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to the infection, as are the Trochiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which followe. Take Styrax cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, Benioin, of eche one dram: red Roſes, Lauender, Cypres, of eche halfe

exulcerate not the ſkin, and therefore in the morning you muſt diligentlye wipe the place, or at what tyme ſo euer elſe the pacient ſweateth, for which cauſe it were good to put a fayre linnen cloath betwéene: The Arſnicke being<note place="margin">The. 8 boke chap of the hardnes of the Splene.</note> applyed, ſtrengthneth as wel the heart as the Mylt, as <hi>Trallianus</hi> writeth, but it worketh not that effect of cuſtome, as <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſayth.

               <p>But to the intent that the pacient maye vomite with more eaſe and leſſe trouble vnto him, it were good for him to ſup the broath of a Chick, an hower or twaine after hee haue receyued the vomite, and to doo ſo as often as hée

perceiueth him ſelfe mooued to vomite. For the corrupt humours which the <hi>Antimonie</hi> hath drawne into the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of the ſtomack, wyl be without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble caſt foorth with the breath. For vomiting vpon an empty ſtomack is painful.
