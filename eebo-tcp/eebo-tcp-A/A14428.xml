            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap> bee lesse hoped for by so strickt an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and from so many reiterated promises by the mouth of a great Prince, but effects truly Royall, and sorting to his Greatnesse? But so farre failes it therein, that his Maiestie in so many promises and so straite obligation of friendship, hath found meanes to obtaine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and surety for the Churches, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store peace to <hi>France</hi> by the reconciliation of those, whose breath vtters nothing else but all manner of obedience to their King, vnder the liberty of the Edicts: That contrariwise they haue preuailed by the interest which he had in those of the Religion to deceiue them, and by this meanes not onely to vnty him from them, but also to make him (if not odious vnto
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19750:3"/>
them) at the least suspected in peruerting the meanes which he had ordained for good to a quite contrary end. Witnesse the English Ships not designed for the extirpation of those of the Religion, (but to the contrary, expresse promise was made, that they should not bee vsed against them) which notwithstanding were brought before <hi>Rochel,</hi> and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed against them in the last Sea fight. What then may be expected from so puissant a King as the King my Master so openly eluded, but a thorough feeling equall and proportioned to the iniuries receiued, but his patience hath gone beyond patience, and as long as he had hope that hee could benefit the Churches by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes, hee had had no recourse by way of Armes: so farre that hauing beene made an instrument and worker of the last peace, vpon conditions, disaduantagious enough, and which would neuer haue been accepted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Maiesties interuention; who interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his credite and interest to the Churches to receiue them (euen with threatnings) to the end to shelter the Honour of the most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King, vnder assurance of his part, not onely
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19750:4"/>
for the accomplishment, but also for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the said conditions, for which hee stands caution to the Churches.</p>
            <p>But what hath been the issue of all this, but only an abuse of his goodnesse, and that which his Maiestie thought a soueraine remedy for all their sores: hath it not brought almost the last blowe to the ruine of the Churches? It wanted but a little by the continuing of the Fort before <hi>Rochel,</hi> (the demolishing whereof was promised) by the violences of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Garisons of the said Fort and Isles, as well vpon the Inhabitants of the said Towne, as vpon Strangers, in lieu whereas they should wholly haue retired, haue dayly beene aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and other Forts built, and by the stay of the Commissioners in the said Towne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the terme agreed on, to the end to make broyles, and by the meanes of the deuision which they made to slide among the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, to open the gates to the neighbouring Troupes, and by other withstandings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions of Peace, little I say failed it, that the said Towne, and in it all the Churches had not drawne their last breath. And in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19750:4"/>
meane while his Maiestie hath yet continued, &amp; not opposed so many iniuries, so many faith-breakings, but by plaints and treatings: vntill he had receiued certaine aduice (confirmed by intercepted Letters) of the great preparation that the most Christian King made to showre vpon <hi>Rochel.</hi> And then what could his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie doe lesse but to vindicate his Honour by a quicke Arming against those who had made him a party in their deceit; and to giue testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of his integrity &amp; zeale, which hee hath alwayes had for the re-establishing of the Churches, an establishing which shall be deare and precious to him aboue any other thing. And that is the sole end of this Arming, and not any particular interest; whosoeuer would yet call this in doubt, let him consider the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the times, and disposition of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. For who will beleeue that the King, my Master, hath any Designe vpon <hi>France,</hi> or to haue proiected Conquests here in a time so disaduantagious, hauing for an Enemie one of the most puissant Princes of the world: and if he had such a Designe, that of so many troupes that he hath on foote (which he entertaines at
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19750:5"/>
the same cost he should doe here) and that they were ready to passe the Sea if the Churches haue need of them, he should but send a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in regard of what shold be behouefull for the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of so high an enterprise, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering the great succours that he sends into <hi>Germany.</hi> Who will not rather iudge as the truth is, that these Troupes here are but auxiliaries, and that the intent of these Armes is no other but onely for the good of the Churches, which for so many important reasons and considerations he findes himselfe obliged before God &amp; men to protect and succour. But put the case it be alledged that the King my Master hath bin mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to take Armes for other considerations, as the detention and seasure of all the Shipps and Goods of his Subiects at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and other places of this Kingdome, to the breaking and manifest contrauention of the Treaties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Crownes, which in this point are expresly to the irreperable preiudice, yea to the totall ruine of commerce (in the rupture of which the poore people of this Realme, being not able to vent their Marchandises, groanes, not onely vnder the burthen of so many taxes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19750:5"/>
and impositions, but of the necessities for life it selfe. That the apprehension of the King my Master for the powerfull encreasing of the most Christian King by Sea, hath forced him to take Armes, to hinder the growth of it, and in the end that hee hath beene constrained to put himselfe in Armes, because he can no more hope of any accommodating of businesse. The answere to all that is, that whosoeuer will search the Arrests, Seasings and Prises which haue been made of the one side and the other, he shall finde that the King my Master and his Subiects haue hitherto profited most by this breach, and that it turned to their vtility.</p>
            <p>In the second place it is so farre off, that he is iealous of the encrease of this pretended po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer by Sea, and that he would hinder it: that there needes nothing (when the King my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster shall see time) but letters of Marke to his Subiects to dissipate all these vaine and feeble forces, without imploying a Royall power for it. And finally, that there hath bin a necessity for thus Arming, because there is no hope of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modating, the contrary is most manifest to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19750:6"/>
whosoeuer will consider the researches which haue bin made at seueral times, as wel by their owne Ministers, as by the Ministers of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Princes to the King my Master, to treate an accommodating at their instigation. All aboue-said witnesseth for the King my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that he hath not beene constrained to take Armes for any particular interest, but for the defence of the Churches onely, for the surety and liberty whereof he stood answerable. And in the meane while there be some persons that dare insinuate into mindes, that his Maiestie hath a particular designe in it, and that he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Religion for a pretext to make a partie; by the meanes and adioyning of which, with his owne Forces, hee pretends to thrust for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his disignes to the end that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. No, no, our Religion teacheth vs otherwise, and the pietie of the King my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, in which he giues place to no man liuing, will neuer permit him. His Designes is the establishing of the Churches, his interest is their good, and his ayme their contentment. That being done, these Drummes beating,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19750:6"/>
these displayed Ensignes shalbe shut vp again, and all this noyse of Warre shall remaine in night and silence, because they appeare for no other cause but theirs, nor aduanced but for their occasion.</p>
