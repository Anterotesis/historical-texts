            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere were Eight Prieſts in all brought down and Arraigned this day; but the firſt, called <hi>David Joſeph Kemiſh,</hi> being a very aged man, and appearing extream weak and ill, the Court upon his requeſt was pleaſed; after he had pleaded Not Guilty, to remit his Tryal to another opportunity, when he might be better able to make his defence.</p>
            <p>The other Seven were Tryed ſingly and ſucceſſively one after the other, by one Jury, conſiſting of perſons of good worth, againſt whom none of them made any Challenge or Exceptions. <hi>Corker</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100597:2"/>
before they pleaded, inſiſted on their former Tryal, pretending they were then acquitted of all Treaſons: but the Court (many of the Judges, and particularly the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> being preſent.) anſwered, <hi>That this was another ſort of Treaſon, for which they were not then queſtioned,</hi> ſo that this vain ſuggeſtion was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled. They were Indicted upon the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: That being born in the Kings Dominions, they had received Ordination from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and after that came into and abided in the Kingdom, contrary to that Law which had made that Offence High-Treaſon.</p>
            <p>The Kings Council opened the Indictments learnedly, and ſet forth the neceſſity and juſt reaſon for making this Law, becauſe of the many Treaſons practiſed and promoted by Jeſuits and Popiſh Prieſts againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and ſhewed, that whoever does take Orders from <hi>Rome,</hi> does in effect renounce his Allegiance to the King, for he thereby owns another Supream Power, <hi>viz.</hi> the Popes; which is ſuch, according to the Doctrine of that damnable Church, that he can excommunicate and depoſe the King, and abſolve all Subjects from Obedience to him.</p>
            <p>The Evidence that appeared and were made uſe of, were Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dangerfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt that came upon his Tryal, was <hi>Lionel Anderſon, alias Munſon,</hi> an antient man, and ſeeming to be ſick; againſt him Three Witneſſes ſwore, that they had ſeen him officiate as a Prieſt, receive Confeſſion, ſay Maſs, Conſecrate and Adminiſter the Euchariſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and particularly Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> depoſed, that while he was in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for Debt, and this <hi>Anderſon</hi> there likewiſe a Priſoner, he told the Witneſs he had a Letter from the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> ſhould <hi>skower his Kettle,</hi> by which phraſe; they mean, Confeſs his ſins; and that acordingly he did go to Confeſſion with the now Priſoner, and received the Sacrament, after which the Priſoner put him upon Drinking hard with another perſon, to pump out ſome things for the invalidating Mr. <hi>Bedloes</hi> Evidence; and Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield</hi> being ſcrupulous ſo to do, leſt he ſhould be drunk on the ſame day that he had received, this precious Father told him, 'twas all one for that, he would give him leave to be drunk, ſince 'twas for the good of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Next <hi>Corker</hi> was brought on, againſt whom two of the Evidence teſtified, That he had likewiſe officiated in the ſame manner at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and ſeen him in his Preaching Habit. 'Twas alſo proved that he had a Patent to be Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> there was only Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> that could ſwear that he had heard him ſay Maſs; yet Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> had ſeen him in his Habit, and when he put it off, was told he was going abroad to receive Confeſſions: but to put the matter out of doubt, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Two Witneſſes, that when he was Tryed for the Plot, he owned himſelf in open Court to be a Prieſt; which though he now denyed, yet ſeveral of the Court well remembred it. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100597:2"/>
as he had a voluble Tongue, and affected Eloquence, took up much time with his Rhetorical Harangues, and urged much his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal by the former Jury; whence he would infer, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> were Perjured, in ſwearing they were concerned in the Plot, when yet they were found Not Guilty; and that thence they were never more to be counted credible Witneſſes. But Mr. Juſtice <hi>Pemberton</hi> took him up roundly for that ſawcy Reflection, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, A Witneſs might give a juſt and true Evidence, and yet it might happen, a Jury not to believe it; but God forbid thence the Witneſs ſhould be cenſured as Perjur'd or Invalid. The Priſoner likewiſe call'd their old Voucher <hi>Ellen Rigby,</hi> who ſaid ſhe never ſaw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in the <hi>Savoy</hi> at the times he mentioned; which ſeemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little to the purpoſe, for he might be there and ſhe not ſee him: beſides, they made a mighty ſtir, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> could not ſee them there at Maſs, becauſe he was then but newly reconciled to their Church, and ſo it was not likely they ſhould truſt him: but to that they were told, That in 1677. and 1678. they were not ſo very ſhy of ſaying Maſs, or cautious who heard, eſpecially being a new Convert.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Ruſſel</hi> was uſed to harbour in <hi>Wildhouſe,</hi> where 'twas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he had ſaid Maſs, and at other places. His Veſtments were likewiſe taken with him, which at that time he owned to be his, as was ſworn by the Honourable Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> though now his Fatherhood thought fit to tell a Lye, and diſown it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Parry</hi> was well known by ſeveral of the Witneſſes to be a Prieſt, who had been at Maſs with him ſundry times; and Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> was ſo well acquainted with him, that he ſeized him long ſince the Diſcovery of the Plot in the ſtreet; and he had indeed reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him, for that he had dealt with him in his Trade, bought ſilver boxes for Hallowed Oyl, and other knacks of him; and once ſold him a Conſecrated Chalice, by the ſame token he would not let the Witneſs touch it, till he had broken off a piece of it, leſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Veſſel ſhould be prophaned whilſt it was intire, by a Lay-mans handling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry Starkey</hi> was a luſty ancient Gentleman, with but one Leg, the other being loſt, as he alleadged, in the Kings ſervice in the late Civil Wars. Though the Witneſſes named ſeveral places where they had heard him ſay Maſs, he ſtiffly denyed it, and made ſolemn Imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he was never at ſuch places in his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander Lumſdell</hi> was a Fryar, and Predicator-General of his Order. He was proved as plain as the reſt, to be a Prieſt; but by his voice and affirmation it appearing probable that he was a <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and born, as he ſaid, at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> it ſeemed a point of difficulty to the Court, whether he ſhould come within thoſe words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, <hi>Born within the Queens Dominions,</hi> ſince at that time <hi>Scotland</hi> was under another Monarch: and therefore it was thought fit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Jury to a Special Verdict. So that without Sentence, he muſt remain ſo Convict till the Judges ſhall have determined the matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100597:3"/>
Their Defence in general appeared rather crafty than ſolid, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves a liberty of denying the moſt apparent Truths; the main Plea of them All being, That they were not proved <hi>Prieſts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none of the Evidence were <hi>by</hi> when they received <hi>Orders;</hi> but as to that the Court reſolved them, that it was enough that they had exerciſed thoſe pretended ſacred Offices, which none but Prieſts in their Church are allowed to perform: For otherwiſe the <hi>Statute</hi> were vain, and its Force wholly eluded; beſides, ſome had confeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Prieſts, and the Orders of one had been ſeen by one of the Witneſſes. Then they all lay at <hi>catch</hi> about circumſtances of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> wherein it was morally impoſſible that the Evidence ſhould be poſitive; or if they could have been ſo, the Priſoners would have had ſome of their own <hi>Gang</hi> that, to ſerve their turns, ſhould have alleadged they were then at other places. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one of them produced two young Lads that affirmed very round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Priſoner was from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 1677, till <hi>Hollantide</hi> next, at ſuch a place in the Country; that they ſaw him every day, becauſe he conſtantly dined at their houſe: Yet one of theſe ill-tutor'd Youths that could name the year of our Lord ſo readily, being askt how many years ago this was, could not tell; ſo that the Juggling was apparent. Being further askt, whether they were ſure they dined every day, and particularly on <hi>Aſh-wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Good-friday,</hi> they anſwered affirmatively, though 'tis well known no ſuch thing is uſual with Papiſts. They were very frequent in Appeals to Heaven, and pawning their Salvation at random, on trivial Circumſtances, and things no way credible, their main deſigne being to ſcandalize the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>The Jury, after about a Quarter of an Hours Withdrawment, brought them in <hi>Guilty:</hi> And thereupon the Six before-mentioned being ſeverally asked, What they had to offer why Sentence ſhould not paſs; <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Starkey</hi> pleaded their former Loyalty and Services to the King, which Mr. Recorder promiſed to relate to his Majeſty. <hi>Marſhal</hi> with a multitude of words cited the Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> to prove Prieſthood in itſelf no Crime; but was ſhewn by the Court the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency of that Argument. He likewiſe inſiſted on the Kings Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> but was anſwered, That of whatever force the ſame was, yet it was never meant to extend to Popiſh Prieſts.</p>
            <p>Thus after a full and fair hearing, Mr. Recorder in a grave and excellent Diſcourſe proceeded to paſs the Sentence, uſual in Caſes of High-Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Heads of this Days Tranſaction; which for the preſent may ſatisfie people of the juſt and equal Proceedings of the Court. But for all Particulars, we underſtand the whole Tryals, exactly taken, will be made Publicque by Authority, to which the more Curious are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
