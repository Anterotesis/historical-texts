         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

daily ſee, many brave ſpirited Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, ſo beſotted with ſome, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps but Imaginary beauty, and ſo tormented with this folly of Love, as that both their Imagination is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, and their Iudgement alſo ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly corrupted; who, with this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Philoſopher, are ſo farre from ſeeking a cure for this their Malady, as that they will not be perſwaded, that it is one: and therefore employ their whole ſtudy &amp; care, in chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth Loves Encomiums, and the praiſes of their Miſtreſſes, the ſole cauſe of their Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>That therefore I might let theſe men ſee the groſſeneſſe of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, &amp; withall diſcover the vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Stoicall Opinion of theirs: (Although I profeſſe my ſelfe to be rather <hi>Philologus</hi> then <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gophilus;</hi> and account him eloquent enough, that can but cloath his own

conceptions with a bare naturall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion:) I have adventured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you with this litle Treatiſe, which is devoid of all Elegancy or Queintneſſe of expreſſion, as being compoſed by one that is a Profeſſor of that Faculty, that the Prince of Latine Poets called a Mute one. Wherein you ſhall finde variety of Remedies of all ſorts, for the cure of this the moſt frequent, and moſt dangerous Diſeaſe that both ſexes are ſubject to; collected out of all kinds of Authors, both Phyſitians, Poëts, and Philoſophers: that ſo you might have variety to delight you.</p>
            <q>Omne tulit punctum, qui miſcuit utile dulci.</q>
            <p>The Reaſons that moved me to write of this ſubject, after ſo many,
<pb facs="tcp:2212:4"/>
and ſo learned Phyſitians that have done ſo before me, are chiefly Two. The firſt is, that being my ſelfe a Practitioner in Phyſicke, I found that moſt of them handled this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of Love-Melancholy, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, as the other kindes of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholies and Madneſſes; never ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preciſely the cauſe and ſeat of this Malady: and that, both to the great prejudice of the Parties affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and alſo their own no ſmall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement and confuſion, not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe effects, that they promiſe themſelves, of their Phyſicall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon that moved me to attempt this diſcourſe, was, to confute the erroneous and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion of ſome Phyſitians, hereafter mentioned, who although they are Chriſtians, the moſt of them, doe notwithſtanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb facs="tcp:2212:4"/>
for the cure of this diſeaſe, Luſt, and Fornication. But I doubt not, I ſhall ſufficiently refute theſe men, in this enſuing diſcourſe; and that by ſtrong and evident reaſons, both Naturall and Morall: and the reſt I ſhall leave to Divines.</p>

Intimating by this Poeticall fiction, that Pleaſure many times puniſheth Lovers with ſcourges, ſignified by his purple wings, which, according to <hi>Guitton d' Arezzo,</hi> are the Hieroglyphicks of griefe, and cruell torment. And <hi>Petrarch,</hi> in his 4. <hi>cap. del Triomfo d' Amore,</hi> feignes him to be lodged in a palace of Hopes; which makes all perſons, of what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſexe ſoever, deſire to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there: But the more they labour to aſcend, the lower ſtill they fall, becauſe the ſtaires that lead up to this palace are of

a very ſlippery ſubſtance. The three firſt ſteps are, the immodeſt caſt of the eyes, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of words, &amp; the violence of the hands: the upper chambers are adorned with Idleneſſe, dreames, vaine deſires, and inconſtancy: the chimney of the great hall, is the breaſt of the Lover; that of the chamber is his heart; and his liver, that of the Kitchen. The ſeats of thoſe that come thither, and are entertained there, are falſe contents, on which they are no ſooner ſetled, but they break under them. Which to repaire, they preſently ſend for their engineeres, envy, torment, and deceit. Suſpence, and feare, are the ſureſt guardians of this palace, the gates whereof are ſhut up at night by falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Diſtruſt ſtands ſentinell, &amp;c.

               <p>Yet I grant that love is the ground and Principall cauſe of all our Affections, and the Abſtract of all the Paſſions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of the mind. For when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to enjoy what we affect, whether it be really good, or but ſo in appearance; this we call covetouſneſſe, and Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. And being not able to compaſſe our deſires, this we call Griefe, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2212:27"/>
when we enjoy the thing we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Love then takes upon it the name of Pleaſure &amp; Delight. When we think we are able to effect our deſires, 'tis then Hope: and fearing to looſe it, either who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in part only; this we call Iealouſie.</p>

Now <hi>Porus</hi> being well warm'd with Nectar, went forth into <hi>Jupiters</hi> Garden; where being overtaken with a deep ſleep, <hi>Penia</hi> comes and lyes downe by him; and by this deviſe was got with child by him, and ſo brought forth <hi>Love:</hi> who ſtill retaining the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Mother, is alwaies poore, leane, ſordid, goes bare-foot, wandring about the world without any dwelling, without covering, ſleeping in Porches, and in the ſtreets: But taking alſo after his Father, he oftimes brings to paſſe great and worthy matters, is manly, couragious, eager, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous, alwaies contriving ſome ſtrange ſtratagems, crafty, ingenious, a great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, Inchanter, Sorcerer, &amp; a ſubtile Sophiſter.

that Book of his, where hee labours to prove, that the Manners of the Minde, follow the Temperature of the Body: In which, as alſo in his other writings he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly diſputeth, at leaſt erroneouſly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Soule: as alſo many other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers beſides him have done.</p>
               <p>The Aſtrologers, for the moſt part, are not content to allow, with the Phyſitians, that theſe effects are produced oftimes, and indirectly, by the manifeſt Qualities of the Aire, cauſed by the Influence of the Coeleſtiall bodies: but are bold to attribute this power to the Planets alſo: ſaying, that the Soule holds its judgement of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne;</hi> Actions, of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Magnanimity, Senſes, of the <hi>Sun;</hi> Life, of the <hi>Moone;</hi> and laſtly of <hi>

Their figure was round, having foure Hands, and as many Feet, with all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther members in proportion doubled. But conſpiring, as the Giants before had done againſt the Gods, <hi>Iupiter</hi> cauſed them to be divided in the midſt, as wee uſe to cut

Egges in two to ſowſe, or divide them in the midſt with haires: and then gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Apollo</hi> to turne their faces toward that part where the Diſſection was made; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> could not be; they preſently periſhed for hunger, becauſe they would not doe any thing the one without the other. And when the one halfe failed, and the other remained behinde; that which was left, ſought for ſome other halfe, whether it were the Female halfe, or the Male: yet thus they came to ruine ſtill. But at length <hi>Iupiter</hi> being moved to compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, found out a meanes to help them, by tranſpoſing their Genitalls, which till then were behinde, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them, as now they are, before: and ſo contrived it, that they ſhould engender, the Male and Female together: for before
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2212:59"/>
they conceaved and engendred as Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers doe, by caſting their ſeed on the ground. And ſo by this meanes was <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Love</hi> begotten, as a Reconciler of their Ancient Nature, deſiring to maked Two, One, and a Remedy againſt Humane Frailty; which ſeemes to be nothing elſe but a ſtrong Deſire to be reunited &amp; made one againe.</p>
               <p>And it is not improbable that <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> alſo, and after him, (as <hi>Iul. Scaliger</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de gen. anim. c. 1.</note> thinks) <hi>Theophraſtus in his ſecond Booke of Plants, and firſt Chapter,</hi> favours this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> where hee ſaies, that the Male was divided from the Female, to the end he might the better apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the ſtudy of knowledge, &amp; other more noble Actions, then that of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which thing could not bee done, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then by cutting of the privy Members belonging to the Female Sexe.</p>
               <p>It ſeemes that <hi>Plato,</hi> in his voyage that <note place="margin">Euſeb. de Praep. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. c. 7.</note> he made to Aegypt, ſucked this fabulous Opinion out of the miſinterpretation of ſome paſſages that he had met withall i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſeemes to ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Male and Female; and that afterward, the woman was taken out of his body, that ſo he might not be alone. From hence the <hi>Rabbins, Abraham, Hieremias,</hi> and <hi>Abraham Aben Eſra,</hi> would inferre, that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in two Perſons joyned together; the one part being Male, &amp; the other Female; which were afterward ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by the Divine Power. But this Opinion of theirs hath been already ſo ſtrongly confuted by diverſe Learned Men, that have been very skilfull in the Hebrew tongue, that it would bee great Preſumption here in me to interpoſe.

Yet without any diſparagement to <hi>Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or his Interpretation; I muſt be bold to affirme, that <hi>Plato</hi> by this fabulous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe would have us underſtand the Force of Love, which he before had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bee the moſt Powerfull of all the Gods: who, as a Mediator and Vmpire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two that are divided, ſets them at one againe, by the tye of Marriage, and by the Conformity of their Wils, which in Lovers are united.</p>

In like manner doth the diverſity of Regions and Climes much conduce to the diſtinguiſhing of the ſeverall kindes of Love. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Hip. l. de aëre loc. &amp; aq.</note> it is obſerved, that the Eaſterne Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple purſue their deſires, without either Moderation, or Diſcretion; yet in a kinde of baſe ſervile way. Thoſe that inhabit the more Southerne parts, love with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2212:67"/>
Rage, and Fury: thoſe that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the Weſterne Countries are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in their Love: and the Northern are very ſlowly moved or touched with Love.</p>
               <p>The wily Italian in courting his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, cunningly diſſembles his Love, and <note place="margin">Equic. l. 4. de amor. c. 7.</note> inſinuates himſelfe into her Favour by Pleaſant Diſcourſes, Sonnets, and Verſes, compoſed in her Praiſe: and if hee be ſo happy as to enjoy her, he is preſently jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her, and like a Priſoner, keeps her up under Lock and Key: but if he faile in his ſuit, hee then begins to hate her, as much, as before he loved her; and will not ſtick to doe her any miſchiefe that lies in his power.</p>
               <p>The eager and Impatient Spaniard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once enflamed with theſe Deſires, runnes headlong on in his Love, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Intermiſſion followes his ſuit; and with moſt pitifull Lamentations Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the Fire that conſumes him, Invocates and adores his Miſtreſſe. But when at length by any the moſt unlawful meanes he hath compaſſed his Deſires; he either growes jealous of her, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2212:67"/>
cuts her throat; or elſe baſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes her for mony: But if hee cannot effect his purpoſe, he is then ready to run mad, or kill himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Effeminate Frenchman endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to win his Miſtreſſes affection by faire honeſt meanes, entertaining her with Songs, and Pleaſant Diſcourſes. If hee chance to be jealous of her, hee tortures himſelfe extreamely, and weeps and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments his own unhappineſſe: But if ſhee chance to put a trick upon him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave him at laſt; he then begins to brave it, and caſts opprobrious and injurious termes upon her, and ſometimes too falls to downe-right violence. And if he have once compaſſed his Deſires, and enjoyed her, he preſently neglects her, and begins to look after a new one.</p>
               <p>The German is of a Diſpoſition quite contrary to that of the Spaniard: for hee comes on in his Love by degrees, &amp; takes fire by litle and litle: And when hee is once Inflamed, he proceeds with Art and Iudgement, and endeavours to winne his Miſtreſſes favour by Gifts. If hee be once jealous of her, he with-drawes his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2212:68"/>
if ſhe deceave him, he makes litle ſtirre about it; and if he ſpeeds in his ſuit, his love growes as ſoone cold againe.</p>
               <p>The French is given to flatter, and counterfeit Love: the German hides it: the Spaniard is apt to perſwade himſelfe that his Miſtreſſe loves him: and the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is continually tormented with Iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
               <p>The French affects one that is witty &amp; pleaſant, though ſhe be not very faire: The Spaniard cares not how dull or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſhe is, ſo ſhe be faire: the Italian would have her Modeſt and Fearefull: and the German, likes one that is ſomewhat har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe in the purſuit of their Loves, the Frenchman, of a Wiſe-man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Foole: the German, after his ſlow onſet, having been held longin ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence, of a Foole, becomes a Wiſe-man: the Spaniard hazards all for the enjoying of his Deſires: and the Italian deſpiſes all danger whatſoever.</p>
               <p>In Breife, the moſt certaine Differences of Love, are taken from the variety of the Complexions of thoſe that are affected

with this Malady. If a Sanguine man love <note place="margin">Ficin in con. Plat. c. 9. orat. 7.</note> one of the ſame complexion, this Love proves happy and full of delight.

               <p>By the greater part of theſe Signes, when I firſt began to practiſe in this Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at <hi>Agen,</hi> the place of my birth, in the yeare 1604.

When I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his relation, and withall ſaw him to be a young Man, and affected with theſe Griefes and Diſcontents without any Cauſe, whom but a litle before I had
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2212:83"/>
knowne Ioviall and merry: and percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved withall his Countenance to be grown pale, yellowiſh, and of a ſad decaied co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; his eyes hollow; and all the reſt of Body in reaſonable good plight: I began to ſuſpect it was ſome Paſſion of the Minde that thus tormented him: &amp; then conſidering his Age, and his Complexion, which was ſanguine, and his Profeſſion; I certainely concluded that his Diſeaſe was Love. And as I was urgent upon him to let me knowe the Externall cauſe of his Malady, there comes by chance a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſervant-maid of the Houſe about ſome buſineſſe or other into the Roome where we were, and was the meanes of diſcovering the true ground of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.

The laſt of which kinds is cauſed by reaſon of the weakeneſſe of the Retentive Facultie in the Braine, which hath been debilitated either by ſome Diſeaſe, or by the great Abundance of moiſture, contracted within the Head: or elſe becauſe the expulſive Faculty of the Braine is provoked by the ſharpneſſe of the Humours in the Braine, or by the vapours that are exhaled from the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or parts; as it is often ſeen in thoſe that are ſick of an Ague: or laſtly by reaſon of ſome particular diſtemper of the eyes, as Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration, Fiſtula, Opthalmy, Running of the eyes, or the like, as alſo by Smoake,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2212:88"/>
Duſt, or other like externall cauſes.</p>
               <p>As concerning voluntary Teares, it was the Opinion of <hi>Empedocles</hi> long ſince, that when any one was ſurcharged with any ſtrong paſſion of the Mind, the Blood was troubled, and from thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Teares, in like manner as whey comes from Milke. <hi>Alexander Aphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaeus</hi> is of opinion, that the Melancholy Humour having ſhut up and encompaſſed the Heart; the Humidity endeavours to ſhew it ſelfe, where it findes the freeſt paſſage.</p>
               <p>But we ſay, that the materiall cauſe of Teares, is the ſame with that of Spittle; which is, the Abundance of ſeroſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Braine, after the third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction: by reaſon whereof old men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and young children, are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to weeping, then any other.</p>
               <p>Now this moyſture flowes from the eyes, either by reaſon of the compreſſion of the Braine, during the time of ſadneſſe: or elſe by the Dilatation of it; as we often ſee it comes to paſſe in thoſe that are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſome ſuddaine great joy, or elſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>augh extreamely. For as much then as
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2212:89"/>
Lovers are ſubject to all theſe paſſions, <note place="margin">Avic. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald.</note> of Ioy, Laughter and Sadneſſe: it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they are not Involuntary Teares that fall from Lovers eyes, which, as we have already ſhewed, are generally dry and void of Teares, but only the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, as when they either doubt, or elſe deſpaire of their Miſtreſſes favour. And hence it is that we ſhall obſerve Poëts ſo often repreſenting unto us Lovers weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lamenting: Becauſe that Love is alſo delighted in Teares, according to the Poet.</p>

               <p>Are, the diverſe Imaginations and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that ſteale into the Braine, and never ſuffer them to take any quiet repoſe: whence the Braine becomes Dry and Cold; Beſides that from the naturall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, which is naturally Cold, and as dry as duſt, there cannot be exhaled any ſweet and gentle vapours, which by their moiſture ſhould looſen the nerves, and diſcharging them of their office, may ſo

               <p>And if by chance they be ſurpriſed by any light ſlumber, which is the proviſion Nature hath made for the repairing of the Animall ſpirits, which in them are waſted and much impaired, by the violence of their Imagination, and exceſſive wakings: that ſlumber is attended on by a thouſand Phantaſmes, and fearefull dreames; ſo that they awake oftimes more diſcontented, ſad, penſive, melancholy, and fearefull, then before; and for the moſt part they find themſelves more tormented ſleeping, then waking.</p>
               <p>Sighing is cauſed in Melancholy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, by reaſon that they many times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to draw their breath, being wholy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with the ſtrong Imaginations that they have, either in beholding the beauty of their Loves, or elſe, in their Abſence, contemplating on their rare perfections, and contriving the meanes how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe their Deſires.

                  </gap>. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines therefore that we examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, a man is not ſubject to this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady of Love, without the compaſſe of theſe yeares.</p>
               <p>Love being, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaies, a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of generation: of neceſſity, ſo long as a man is able to performe the Act of Generation, ſo long he is alſo ſubject to Love, and (if he reſtraine not his deſires within the bounds of Reaſon,) to Love. Melancholy alſo. Now ſome Authours affirme, that a man is able to engender at nine, or ten yeares of age: and they goe about to confirme this their Aſſertion, by the examples of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Achaz,</hi> who had children, when they were but ten, or eleaven yeares old, at the moſt: which S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Roſarius</hi> affirme that themſelves have knowne by experience in ſome others. And, (which ſeemes a thing incredible,) <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, that among the Indians, the <note place="margin">Plin. l. 7. c. 2</note> 
                  <hi>Mandri</hi> and <hi>Calingi</hi> have children at five, or ſix yeares of age.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, ſome againe there
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2212:91"/>
are, that would deprive men of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo long as they are under the age of <note place="margin">Caeſ. 6 de Bel. Gal.</note> twenty: and for this cauſe the Germans forbid carnall copulation to young folke, before they have attained unto the age of twenty yeares.</p>
               <p>But the moſt received opinion is, that men and women are ſubject to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of Love-Melancholy, as ſoone as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are entred into thoſe yeares, in which they begin <hi>Pubeſcere,</hi> to come to their Puberty: which appeares in men chiefly by their voice, which at that time growes greater and harſh withall, and in women it may be knowne by obſerving their breaſts, which about this time begin to ſwell and grow bigger, and that for the moſt part, about the age of twelve, or Fourteene: And this is now the generall Rule, by which their Puberty is knowne, <hi>Jndagatione corporis inhonestâ ceſſante;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And as concerning thoſe Inſtances of K. <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Achaz,</hi> above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we anſwer, that though perhaps it be granted that they are true; yet are they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2212:92"/>
very rare, and ſcarcely to be paralleld: and that ſuch perſons being for the moſt part, very ſhort-lived, (for <hi>Solomon</hi> lived not above fifty yeares:) it ſeemes in a manner neceſſary, that their Puberty ſhould be earlier in them, then in other men: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iuſtice of Nature, that thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that muſt ſoone meet their Period, ſhould as ſuddenly arrive to their Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Maturity: as we may obſerve in women, who, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi>

               <p>Now as youth, or Puberty opens the way to Love; ſo in like manner doth old age ſhut it up. Which <hi>Solon</hi> finding in himſelfe, be gave the Gods great thankes for ſending him ſo great a bleſſing as old age was; wherein he enjoyed more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and pleaſure, by being freed from his former youthfull Amorous heats, then he felt diſcommodity or trouble in <note place="margin">Pol. l. 4. c. 16. &amp; l. 5. de Hiſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies, that it is about the age of threeſcore and ten, that old men begin to be out of <hi>Cupids</hi> reach, and bid Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2212:92"/>
to <hi>Venus.</hi> And therefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Tiberius</hi> thought thoſe men worthy to be puniſhed that at theſe yeares were not able to governe their deſires, but ſuffered themſelves to bee overcome by this youthfull Paſſion of Love: and to this purpoſe enacted the Law called <hi>Papia Poppaea,</hi> for the reſtraining of this Abuſe.

The Habit of the mind being altered, cauſeth an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo in the Body: and ſo the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For, as the ſame Authour elſewhere concludes, if the manners of the mind did not all depend on the Temperature of the Body; in vaine ſhould the Phyſitian attempt, with all his Medicines and Helleboriſmes, the cure of thoſe that are ſicke of Love, or any the like Paſſions. Not that I would have you thinke, that theſe Phyſiognomicall ſignes doe alwaies neceſſarily diſcover the Paſſions and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the mind, but only for the moſt part, and Probably.</p>
               <p>Beſides, all Phyſiognomiſts affirme, that we ought not peremptorily to conclude any thing, from the diſpoſition or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of any one part alone: but wee muſt compare diverſe ſignes together, &amp; ſo give judgement accordingly: yet ſtill with this Proviſo, that we extend not the Iuriſdiction of this Science any farther, then to thoſe Paſſions that are Naturall to Men, as Anger, Luſt, &amp;c. and not to ſuch
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2212:110"/>
things as are of Free Election, as to be an Aſtrologer, Phyſitian, Lawyer, or the like.</p>
               <p>We conclude then, that a man may know by Phyſiognomy, not onely thoſe that are actually poſſeſt with this Malady of Love, or Erotique Melancholy; but alſo thoſe that are Inclined, or ſubject unto it. For if I ſee a man that is Hot, Hairy, high-coloured, with a black thick curled head of haire, great veines, &amp; a big voice: I dare be bold to ſay, that that man hath a hot and dry Liver, and his Generative parts are alſo of the ſame Temper; &amp; that <note place="margin">Gal. in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crot.

               <p>Naturall Dreames are ſuch as are cauſed by the Diſpoſition and Temper of the Body.

apprehends the Diſpoſition and State of the Body, and enjoyes all things that the can deſire, whether Poſſible things, or impoſſible, as though they were preſent, and in her power.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of theſe Dreames, is, by the generall conſent of all writers, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary in Phyſick, for the knowledge of the Humour that doth predominate, &amp; to finde out the diſpoſition of the Body. For commonly thoſe that are full of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, dreame that they carry ſome great burthen upon their back: whereas on the contrary thoſe, that are free from all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, dreame that they are either run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Race, or leaping, or perhaps Flying in the Aire. The Cholericke Dreame of Quarrelling, and Fighting; the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Funerals, Darkneſſe, and Mourning. The Phlegmaticke and Rheumaticke dreame that they are fallen into Rivers, Wels, Raine and Snow: Thoſe that are Hungry dreame of good cheere, &amp; Feaſts; and the Amoriſt of his Wenches, Sports, Plaies and Maſques.</p>
               <p>And here by the way you are to take notice, that in Dreames all things ſeeme

               <p>MAny have been of opinion that this diſeaſe was altogether incurable; and that it was wholy Supernaturall, and inflicted upon men as a puniſhment, or revenge for ſome evill committed by them, from a kind of litle <hi>Daemon</hi> of the ſame name; to whom the <hi>Pagans</hi> attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the command of Love; as they alſo did of Feavers, to the Goddeſſe <hi>Febris;</hi> the Night Mare to <hi>Hecate,</hi> or the <hi>Demy-Gods;</hi> the Terrors and affrights in the Night, to <hi>Pan:</hi> the Falling ſickneſſe, to <hi>Hercules:</hi> ſo likewiſe making <hi>Cupid</hi> the God of Love; <hi>Venus,</hi> of Luſt; <hi>Mercury,</hi> of Theeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and <hi>Mars</hi> of Choler and Anger: that ſo by this meanes they might find the juſter excuſe of thoſe outrages, which, when they were tranſported with their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2212:121"/>
they did commit. <hi>Quaſi de Caelo tibi ſit Inevitabilis cauſa peccandi; &amp; Venus hoc fecerit, aut Saturnus, aut Mars: ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet ut homo ſine culpâ ſit; culpandus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Caeli ac Syderum Creator &amp; Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> As if, (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> the heavens had impoſed an inevitable neceſſity upon men of doing ill: and that the cauſe of this, or that ill action was either <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi> or <hi>Mars:</hi> that ſo man, forſooth, ſhould ſtill be innocent; and all the blame be caſt on God, the great Creator and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the Heavens and Starres.</p>
               <p>It is the cuſtome of ignorant fooles, ſaith <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> preſently to ſay, that a diſeaſe, and the cauſes of it are Divine, when they doe but find ſome new extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary matter in it. So that by this rule we muſt conclude, that all new diſeaſes, as the <hi>Coqueluchoe,</hi> a diſeaſe that the French not many yeares ſince were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with, the ſweating ſickneſſe, ſmall Pockes, and the like, ſhould be Divine, and therefore held incurable, becauſe perhaps they cannot be cured by the idle Preſcriptions of <hi>Empericks, Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks,</hi> and cooſening Impoſtors, nor by

               <p>His owne credulity ſtill makes him hope; and this hope keeps him alive, in

expectation ſtill of the accompliſhment of his deſires: which when he hath once attained unto, he then conceives himſelfe to have reached the higheſt degree of happineſſe; and perſwades himſelfe that theſe his joyes and pleaſures ſhall never faile: till at the laſt, his owne experience convincing him, leaves him more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then before.</p>
               <p>This Hope, blowing with it's gentle gales the fond deſires of Lovers, kindles in their minds a fire, full of thicke ſmoake, which darkens their underſtanding; and carrying away with it their thoughts, caſts a miſt over them, takes away their judgement, ſubverts their reaſon, and makes them, as it were, dreame waking. As long as theſe hopes laſt, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver relinquiſh their deſires. And here ye ſhall have one, that doubts not, (how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome ſoever he be) to mollify the Adamantine heart of his Miſtreſſe, by the force of his beauty and comely ſhape: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by his faire carriage and winning behaviour: a third preſumes upon his greatneſſe of birth, and the Nobility of his Progenitors: a fourth hopes to winne
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2212:123"/>
her by his witty and eloquent diſcourſe: however if all theſe faile, there is great hope that at length ſhe may be moved to compaſſion by ſighes and pittifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: which is indeed the Lovers laſt refuge.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore eaſily grant to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries of this opinion, concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curableneſſe of this diſeaſe, that it is no ſmall taske to cure a ſicke man of a diſeaſe, that he is unwilling to part with: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the cure of any diſeaſe depends as much upon the Patient, as on the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. For as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: for the curing of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, it is required of the Patient alſo, as well as of the Phyſitian, that he make what reſiſtance he can againſt it, and by no meanes yield to it in the leaſt degree. But yet is it not a thing utterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to work ſuch a cure as this: for there may be meanes found out of times to bring the Patient to deſire and ſeeke out for cure of his Malady: as we ſhall ſhew you hereafter, in the 32. Chapter of this Tract.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſome learned Authours have
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2212:124"/>
ſaid, that this diſeaſe was incurable, not ſo much through the fault of the Patient, as the inſufficiency and defect of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; which is, the remedies that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in this caſe. This made the Deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Oenone,</hi> more skilfull farre in love, then Phyſicke, cry out in this manner.</p>

               </q>
               <p>And even <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelfe, the Author and firſt Inventor of Phyſick, is jeered by the Poet, for not knowing any remedy for the cure of this diſeaſe of Love; when he brings him in thus complaining, that he was not able to releive himſelfe with all his skill.</p>

But thoſe men that maintaine this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, doe not only offer great injury to the faculty of Phyſick, which, as <hi>Democritus</hi> ſaies, is the ſiſter and companion of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: but ſeem alſo fooliſhly to accuſe the Almighty Creator, who, being the <hi>Prototype</hi> of all goodneſſe, (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith) hath not denied us any thing, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us. So that if God hath given us any remedies for this diſeaſe; it cannot poſſibly be imagined, but that they ſhould have beene diſcovered in the ſpace of ſixe or ſeven thouſand yeares, either by reaſon, or experience; which are the only meanes by which Phyſitians have found out cures for all diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to any purpoſe to fly to this refuge, and ſay, that Love is a diſeaſe of the mind; &amp; that therefore the cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be left to Moraliſts, and Divines: conſidering that the wiſe <hi>Apollonius Thyaneus</hi> refuſed to undertake the cure of a great <hi>Cilician</hi> Nobleman, that was deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately gone with this diſeaſe, &amp; could not be moved, neither by his large promiſes, nor threats. For all the Ancient Phyſitians have handled the cure of this diſeaſe, not
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2212:125"/>
ſimply as Phyſitians, but as Philoſophers alſo, which is an inſeparable quality from a good Phyſitian: as <hi>Galen,</hi> following the doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> hath proved at large, in an entire Tract concerning this particular.</p>
               <p>And if the mind bee afflicted at all in Love; it is by reaſon of the mutuall Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that there is betwixt it, and the body: as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proves plainly in his Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and in many other places, which I ſhall not here trouble you withall; only concluding with that of <hi>Democritus,</hi> who affirmes that the diſeaſes of the body doe infatuate and dull the mind, and draw the underſtanding alſo to Sympathize with it: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Anaxandrides,</hi> being ſicke; his friends reproved him, and told him, that they obſerved in him other ſtrange hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and fancies, then they were wont to doe: To whom he made this reply; that they ought not to blame him for this: For neither ſaith he; am I the ſame man, now I am ſicke, that I was before: being then changed from what I was, no marvaile, if
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2212:125"/>
my humours and fancies be changed alſo. If an Apoplexy can lay aſleepe, and, as it were, quite put out the eye of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: then queſtionleſſe Melancholy, and Love will caſt a miſt at leaſt before it; and ſo by this meanes there will hardly be found one houre in our whole life, when our judgement will bee found in due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, our body being ſubject to ſo many mutations, and incompaſſed with ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of actions, that it is a great chance if it meet not at all times with ſome one or other, that will draw it out of the way; although perhaps a man cannot at all times take notice of it, without being obnoxious to a Perpetuity of Paſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations moved the ſame Philoſopher to wiſh, that all men were skilfull in Phyſick: that ſo by rectifying the ſtate of their Body, they might alſo preſerve their mind in perfect health.

               <p>The Aſtrologers ſay, that there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a great deale both of Time, care, and diligence, for the cure of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that are firſt taken with this diſeaſe, under the Influence of <hi>Saturne;</hi> eſpecially if at that time he were either Retrograde, or in Conjunction with <hi>Mars,</hi> or in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with the Sun.

               <p>SOme Divines have been of opinion, that Irregular and Melancholy Love, extends its power and Iuriſdiction, as farre as to the very Angells, and Divels alſo: and that this is the reaſon, why the women are commanded by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to have their heads covered in the Church. But, by this word Angell, ſome others will have the Miniſters of the Church to be underſtood; who in their Sanctity of Life ſhould be like unto the Angels: or elſe perhaps the Apoſtle meant, by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2212:130"/>
all good Chriſtians, who by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of their life, and purity of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doe differ as much from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prophaner ſort of men, as Angels doe from men. But thoſe that hold the other opinion, urge for themſelves that paſſage in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaies, that, the ſonnes of God, ſeeing the daughters of Men, that they were faire, they fell in love with them. In the explication of which place, <hi>Ioſephus, Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus, Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and others, by the Sonnes of God, underſtand the Angels. Notwithſtanding <hi>R. Abraham Aben Ezra</hi> interprets this place of Vertuous Men, or elſe the ſonnes of Righteous <hi>Seth:</hi> and by the Daughters of Men, he will have the daughters of wicked <hi>Cain</hi> to be meant. <hi>Rabbi Kimchi</hi> thinks that, by the Sonnes of God, men of great ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were meant: and that, according to the Idiotiſme and uſuall manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Hebrews, who are wont to call thoſe men that are very tall, the Mountaines of God. And this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his ſeems alſo to be confirmed by that which followes; where it is ſaid, that to

               <p>For mine owne part, I ſhall be ready; as in this, ſo in all other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſubmit my ſelfe to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divines. But I ſhall hardly even aſſent to that ridiculous conceit of the Rabbins, who are of Opinion, that the <hi>Incubi</hi> and <hi>Succubi</hi> are ſprung from the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> during the ſpace of thoſe 135. years; that he abſtained from the knowledge of his wife, after the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the juſt <hi>Abel,</hi> committed by his accurſed brother <hi>Cain.</hi> A more incredible thing yet then this is, if I miſtake not, is that which is commonly reported by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, of women that have been gotten with Child by Divells, and <hi>Jncubi:</hi> and of ſuch copulations, they ſay, were begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Hercules, Romulus, Servius Tullus, Merlin,</hi> and many others. I grant it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Divell may delude the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Fancy of ſuch lewd women, and cauſe their belly to ſwell, as if they had had carnall copulation really with a Man: and perhaps in their travaile make them
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:2212:131"/>
ſeeme to be delivered of a dead Child. <hi>Iacobus Rucſſius</hi> relates a ſtory of one <hi>Magdalen,</hi> that lived in the Citty of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> who having given way to a Divell or <hi>Incubus,</hi> that haunted her, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of her Confeſſor, was at the time of her travaile delivered of a thouſand Trumperies, as pieces of broken glaſſes, Nailes, pieces of wood, haire, pitch, tow, ſtones, bones, and ſuch like ſtuffe, but with extreame paine. And ſometimes alſo the Divell aſſumes a dead body, and by this meanes enticeth wicked minded perſons to couple with him. <hi>Vincentius</hi> reports a ſtory to this purpoſe, of a certaine young man, who one evening going out to a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to ſwimme and waſh himſelfe, as he was in the water, he caught a woman by the haire of the head: whom preſently he carried home along with him to his houſe, without ſpeaking a word; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward had a ſonne by her. But the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man never ſpeaking one word all this while, made the young man very much wonder at the ſtrangeneſſe of it: and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to try if he could make her breake of this her long ſilence, which made both

               <p>And for this cauſe the Ancient Poets fained, that Beauty was the daughter of <hi>Iris</hi> and <hi>Admiration:</hi> becauſe that as the Sun, reflecting upon a watry Cloud, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaves our Eyes, making us beleeve we ſee diverſe various colours, which are not

there, but only in Appearance: In like manner is Beauty, nothing elſe, but a falſe flaſh of Raies, which dazle our eyes, when it appeares from among the cloudes of ſo great variety of Allurements. Whence we may conclude, that the rareſt and moſt excellent Beauties that are, are not ſuch indeed, as they ſeeme to be; but onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be ſo, through the ſole defect of the beholders, and through the weakneſſe of their Eyes; who commonly judge that woman to be Beautifull, which is of a white complexion, and ſoft and tender: cleane contrary to the judgement of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> who ſaies, that thoſe are the ſignes of a Falſe and Counterfeit Beauty; and that true and Native Beauty conſiſts in the juſt compoſure, and Symmetry of the Parts of the Body, a due proportion of fleſh, &amp; the goodneſſe of the Colour. Now he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to know whether a body be Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, or no, he muſt, according to our Anatomiſts, lay him all along, and cauſe him to extend his armes and legs equally as farre as he is able: and then taking the Navill for the Center, and meaſuring him round about, that part that either goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

If the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be will ſet, and ſtrong; it is ſeven times as long as the Head; &amp; eight or nine times as long, if the body be ſlender and delicate. The eye-browes joyned together, make up the circle of both the eyes: and ſo is there a certaine proportion in all the reſt of the parts of the Body: as you may read in <hi>Equicola,</hi> and <hi>le ſieur de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eyries,</hi> in his <hi>Genealogy of Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, the <hi>Indians</hi> love thoſe that have thicke lips: the <hi>Peruvians</hi> judge thoſe the moſt beautifull that have great rolling eyes; and the <hi>Mexicans</hi> thoſe that have litle fore-heads.</p>
               <p>If you cannot perſwade the Lover, and make him confeſſe, that his Miſtreſſe wants theſe Conditions, that are required to an Abſolute Beauty: then muſt you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deprive her of that Moving beauty, which is called, a Good Grace; and conſiſts in the due Compoſure of the

Members and parts of the whole Body: or elſe of the beauty of the Mind; without which, according to <hi>Plato, Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> that of the body is nothing worth. And then you may prove to him both by examples, and Authority of good writers, that for the moſt part, thoſe women that are faire, are alſo as Common: as likewiſe thoſe that are unhandſome and deformed, are altogether as troubleſome, and not to be endured: according to that of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micke Poet.</p>

               <p>We muſt then, as <hi>P. Aegineta,</hi> and <hi>Avicen</hi> adviſe us, watch for a fit oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give them ſome gentle admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For in time, ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi> Paſſions may weare away: but not alwaies, whenſoever

a man pleaſeth.

But if they take their courſe downe ſome Precipice or ſteep hill; they cannot then ſtop themſelves from falling, when they pleaſe, the weight of their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſtill forcing them on farther. So in like manner, when as Reaſon is the cauſe of the motions of the mind; it is an eaſy matter to rule and order them as we liſt: But when either Luſt, or Anger, (Paſſions which are very intractable and unruly, and may therefore be fitly reſembled to the heavineſſe of the body falling downe a Precipice,) joyne their forces together; they cannot ſo eaſily be check't on the ſuddaine, and at pleaſure, but muſt bee gently dealt withall, and corrected by degrees.</p>
               <p>We muſt then watch our opportunity for to fit our ſelyes with this, and all other remedies. For opportunity is the very ſoule and perfection of Phyſique. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I could be content to give a Poet free leave to maintaine ſo licentious a Poſition as this is: But that a Platonick Philoſopher, <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> by name, ſhould adviſe, for the cure of this Malady, to be Drunke now and then, that ſo there may be new blood and ſpirits bred, for to ſupply the defects of the blood and ſpirits that are Infected by this diſeaſe of Love; and ſo by this meanes to cure one vice by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

And therefore ye muſt give him in his broaths, and ſalads, Purſlane, Sorrell, Endive, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory, and Lettuce, which is ſo ſoveraigne a Remedy againſt this Malady, that <hi>Venus,</hi> deſiring to forget all her unchaſt deſires, buried her deare <hi>Adonis,</hi> under a bed of Lettuce.

                  </gap>, that is, to conſume by diſſolving, or melting. But the Poets doe fabulouſly referre this vertue, that is found to be in Mints, to a certaine Nymph forſooth, called <hi>Mentha,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Cocytus,</hi> one of the Infernall Rivers, and beloved of <hi>Pluto:</hi> who comming to the knowledge that <hi>Pluto</hi> was fallen in Love with <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Ceres,</hi> the Goddeſſe of Plants and Corne; ſhee made her boaſts, that ſhee her ſelfe farre ſurpaſſed <hi>Proſerpine</hi> for beauty, and withall threatned to raiſe rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Pluto,</hi> if he offered to bring her into his Subterranean Dominions.

               <p>Yet <hi>Avicen</hi> holds the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> affirming that it is of a nature contrary to the Prevention and Cure of Love: which is alſo the opinion of <hi>Paulus Aegineta, Aetius, Dioſcorides,</hi> and many others.

But theſe contrarieties of opinion in theſe learned Authors, may, as I conceive, be eaſily reconciled, if we ſay, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> Mints are contrary to the motions of Love, when it is cauſed by Humid Repletion: for in this caſe, dry meats and Medicines are very hurtfull, as we may collect out of <hi>Avicen, cap.</hi> 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Fen.</hi> 20. <hi>tr.</hi> 1.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2212:157"/> other moderne Phyſitians, are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the beſt way to preſerve one, that is but newly fallen in Love, from this diſeaſe of Erotique Melancholy, is, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by all meanes poſſible to divert his thoughts from his Former Miſtreſſe, by making him fall in Love with another: whom when he once beginnes to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with; they muſt then make him hate this, and fall in love with a third: follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this courſe with him ſtill, till at length he begins of his own accord to bee weary of being in Love. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies, he that hath many Friends, hath never a one: in like manner doe I ſay, that he that is in Love with many women at once, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver run mad for any of them.

               <p>For the Minde being thus divided, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are the leſſe violent; and ſo one love takes away the force of the other.</p>
               <p>But this opinion of theirs, (under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ſo learned men) I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of: conſidering that it is to bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that either we ſhall not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his Love at our pleaſure: (which <hi>Avicen</hi> alſo ſeems to grant, when he ſaies that if we cannot bring it to paſſe our ſelves, we muſt employ ſome old woman about the effecting of it:) or if wee doe take him off from his firſt Love, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a ſecond to him, he may happily fix there too firmely, and be as much perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed with this, as with the firſt Love. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I my ſelfe have known diverſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who by this meanes have gotten ſo ill a Habit, as they could not chooſe but fall in love with all women Indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that would but ſeeme to entertaine their Love: and as often as they came in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:2212:158"/>
company where women were, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour was ſo ridiculous, that a man would have taken them to bee arrant Fooles, notwithſtanding all their other Actions were very diſcreet, and ſuch as might become the wiſeſt Men. For all Paſſions, that are of any long continuance, doe imprint ill Habits in the Mind; which by length of time growing ſtronger, are very hard to be removed, and are apt to be ſtirred up at every the leaſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of this you may have in cowards, who oftimes are afraid even of thoſe that come for their reſcue and protection: and in Cholerick men, who many times fall out with their friends. So likewiſe thoſe Men, that are prone to unchaſt Love, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not content themſelves with the Love of any one, but apply themſelves to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently. For Cuſtome, which is, as it were, another Nature, being once growne up into a Habit, hath a wonderfull power in diſpoſing the minde to that which is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar unto it. And as a ſtumbling horſe is apt to trip at every ſtone that lies in his way; So he that hath contracted ſuch an Amorous Diſpoſition, is in love with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2212:159"/>
one he ſees. And when he is once thus affected, he doth not then what he would, but what his Paſſion prompts him to: luſt as a bowle, when it is once ſet a going, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily turnes round, and cannot ſtay it ſelfe, by reaſon of it's circular figure, ſo apt to Motion. <hi>Dum ſervitur Libidini, facta eſt Conſuetudo: &amp; dum Conſuetudini non reſiſtitur, facta eſt Neceſſitas:</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine;</hi> while a Man indulgeth his owne Iuſtfull deſires, it growes at length into a Cuſtome: and this Cuſtome meeting no reſiſtance, becomes at laſt a kind of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>

And if the party be of a good Conſtitution, Sanguine, and well in fleſh, you may take the greater quantity from him; becauſe that their ſtrength will bee able to beare the loſſe of the greater ſtore of Blood. And you may reiterate it, two or three times in a yeare, ſo long as there is any danger of this Diſeaſe remaining: eſpecially if you finde that this courſe would have been good to have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Patientat the firſt. After the Liver Veine hath been opened, I would adviſe to take ſome quantity of Blood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2212:160"/>
as the Age and ſtrength of the Patient would beare it, from the Hamme Veine: eſpecially if the party be troubled with the <hi>Satyriaſis,</hi> and the Phyſitian find himſelfe able enough to doe this. Or in ſtead of this, I would open the <hi>Saphena,</hi> or Ankle Veine: or elſe apply Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping glaſſes upon his thigh neere to the privy parts, having firſt made ſufficient Scarification. But he muſt not come to theſe particular Evacuations, unleſſe the Veine in the Arme were firſt opened: which in caſe of the <hi>Satyriaſis,</hi> or Vte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Fury, I would have to bee done the firſt day. For otherwiſe this would bee a meanes rather to attract and draw down more Blood to thoſe parts, which are both the cauſe and ſeat of the diſeaſe, then to draw it away. Some uſe Cauteriſmes on the Legs: but I doe not approve of this courſe, but rather take it to be vaine, and of litle or no force at all. The <hi>Scythians,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports, were wont to cut the Veines behind their Eares, and ſo by this meanes made them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Impotent, and weake: and having brought downe themſelves to this baſe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2212:160"/>
dejected ſtate, they took upon them the habit of Women, and ſpun with them too: as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> relates: for as the ſame Author affirmes, <hi>lib. de Aëre, Loc. &amp; Aqu.</hi> the cutting of thoſe Veines or Arteries that joyne cloſe to the Eares, makes the perſons ſo cut, Impotent, and unapt for Generation. Notwithſtanding <hi>Veſalius,</hi> and ſome other Anatomiſts will have this defect to proceed rather from the cutting of the Nerves of the Sixth Conjugation, which paſſing along by the eares, are terminated in the Genitals, and Spermaticall Veſſels.</p>
               <p>This remedy being ſo eaſie, might alſo ſeeme very uſefull for all thoſe that have taken upon them the Vow of Perpetuall Chaſtity: but that there ſeemes to bee ſome danger in it of hurting the Memory and Iudgement: as may be collected out of <hi>Avicen,</hi> and is confirmed alſo by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Scythians before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; who, by this Chirurgicall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made upon themſelves, became ſtarke Fooles and Idiots.</p>

               <p>THE firſt Medicinall remedy ſhall be a Clyſter, compoſed of cooling and moyſtening Ingredients: among which it will doe well to mixe Hemp ſeed, <hi>Agnus Castus,</hi> and the like.

For all violent Medicaments doe heat the Humours, and inrage the Blood, driving downe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements toward the Inferiour parts, and

Spermaticall Veſſels. And for this reaſon <hi>Arnaldus de Villa Nova, cap. de Regim. Caſt. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ivent.</hi> preferres Vomits, in this caſe, before Purging.</p>
               <p>Then let the party take every morning a litle milke, or elſe ſome broath, or Iulip that may refreſh the blood: uſing alſo ſome Medicinall drinke, which is of a contrary nature to the generation of ſeed: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the party be of a moyſt complexion: for, for ſuch perſons, theſe kinde of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are very good, as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith.</p>

               <p>And ſometimes alſo a bare dreame doth the like: as may appeare by that ſtory of a certaine young <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely in love with one <hi>Theognis,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Plutarch.</hi> This young <hi>Inamorato</hi> prevailed ſo farre with this wench, that at the laſt ſhe conſented to ſatisfy his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2212:166"/>
upon condition that hee would give her a certaine ſumme of Money: which he very readily condeſcended unto. It for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned in the meane time, that as this luſty youth one night lay aſleep in his bed, hee dream't that he embrac'd in his armes his beloved <hi>Theognis:</hi> and his Fancy was ſo ſtrong upon him, that hee conceived himſelfe to enjoy her really, in the height of Amorous dalliance: and was indeed by this meanes cured of his Malady. Which the Damſell coming to have notice of, ſhe demands her ſalary of him: and upon his refuſall to pay it, ſhe ſues him in the court of Iuſtice, alleadging for the reaſon of this her proceeding, that ſhe had performed the conditions on her part required, in that ſhe had cured him of his diſeaſe. Which when the Iudge heard, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the young man, that hee ſhould bring into the Court the ſumme of mony agreed upon betwixt them, and there powre it out into a Baſon: and withall decreed, that as the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelfe with a bare Imaginary Pleaſure, conceived in the enjoyment of Her body: in like manner ſhould ſhe bee
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2212:167"/>
ſatisfyed with the ſound and colour of his gold. This ſentence of the Iudge was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by all, ſave only the Damſell: who objected againſt it, that the dreame had quenched the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> deſire: but on the contrary, the ſound and colour of the gold had encreaſed Hers the more; and that therefore this ſentence was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
               <p>And here before wee either approve, or reject this Remedy, we muſt diſtinguiſh this enjoyment into two kindes, either Lawfull, or Vnlawfull.

               <p>IT is often ſeen, that Married perſons, whether they have been joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their own good liking and choice, and without any conſtraint on either ſide; or elſe perhaps againſt the conſent of the one or the other; doe at length conceave a ſecret hate againſt one another, which occaſioneth betwixt them ſuch diſcord, malice, and neglect, that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the company of one another: but preſently yeeld up themſelves to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of ſome new Loves, whom they entertaine with all fervency and ſtrength of deſire, notwithſtanding the unlawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

Sometimes it is cauſed by ſome Charme, or Inchant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment; or elſe perhaps a Iealouſy, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that they have, that their Love is not requited with mutuall Love againe. And ſometimes alſo it is cauſed through the want of that Pleaſure that Nature hath in great meaſure beſtowed on the Genitall parts in the Act of Copulation, by the means of thoſe Nerves which are placed in them, and the Serous ſharpe pricking Humour that is reſerved within certaine Kernels in the neck of the bladder.</p>
               <p>For the cure of this Naturall defect, I ſhall deſire you to have recourſe to <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello de Vigo, Avicen,</hi> and others, &amp; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Liebault</hi> in his firſt book of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of Women, and 35 chapter: where he ſets downe the meanes that muſt be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for the reconcilement and bringing together againe of new married perſons,

that hate and fly the company of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And here by the way you are to take notice, that as there are ſome Men that are Cold and Impotent: ſo are there likewiſe ſome Women too, that feele no motions of the fleſh at all. <hi>Platerus</hi> in his Obſervations makes mention of two in this kind, who were for this reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies Barren. Of this conſtitution was <hi>Amaſis,</hi> King of Egypt; as <hi>Herodotus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: and <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> King of France, is reported by <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> to have been Impotent toward his Wife, but not toward his Concubines. The ſame is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded alſo in the Annals of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and by <hi>Dupreau,</hi> in the yeare 1196. of <hi>Peter</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Aragon:</hi> which the Quen being advertiſed of, ſhe went one night, and lay in one of the Kings concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines beds, and was got with child that night, and afterward delivered of <hi>Iames,</hi> who was afterwards King: and ſo by this meanes and ſubtle device of the Queenes, the King was brought to ſee his errour, and ever after abſtained from his unchaſt Loves.</p>

As one day <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus,</hi> having perceaved that her ſonne <hi>Cupid</hi> did not thrive at all, went to conſult with the Goddeſſe <hi>Themis</hi> concerning the reaſon of it; ſhe receaved this anſwere: that <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi> could not recover a perfect ſtate, and ſtrength of body, unleſſe he had a Brother, which muſt be called <hi>Anteros,</hi> or Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall Love, for the mutuall aſſiſtance of each other. <hi>Anteros</hi> was no ſooner borne,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2212:173"/>
but preſently <hi>Cupid</hi> began to grow, and ſpread forth his wings; and ſo long as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teros</hi> was in preſence, he appeared both greater, and much more beautifull: but in his Abſence he ſeemed alwaies to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and abate both in ſtrength and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that by this fiction is intimated of how great force and vertue, honeſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, kind words, and courteous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainements are, for the continuance and encreaſing of mutuall Love.

Theſe Charmes are commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Latine, <hi>Nodi, ſive Ligamina Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria:</hi> of which many of our Moderne Phyſitians have written, and particularly <hi>Arnaldus de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illa Nova,</hi> in his Tract <hi>de Ligaturis Phyſicis.</hi> And it is the opinion alſo of many both Divines and Phyſitians that it is probable, that the Divell, who is the Author of all Miſchiefe, hath power to quench lawfull Loves, and to kindle new and unlawfull deſires in men: as firſt, by making the Husband Impotent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his owne wife, by the application of ſome naturall things that may have that vertue; which he can at his pleaſure remove againe, when the ſame man comes to meddle with any other woman. Secondly, by raiſing diſſentions, and Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies betwixt them. Thirdly by cauſing ſome loathſome diſeaſe or other, in either of the Parties: as it is reported of <hi>Medea,</hi> who by the power of her Charmes is ſaid to have made all the Lemnian women to have ſtinking breaths, in ſo much that their Husbands could not endure to come neare them. Fourthly, by troubling their
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2212:176"/>
Imagination, and making either the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or the wife ſeeme miſhapen and deformed to the others eye; and all other both Men and Women to appeare faire and beautifull. Or laſtly, by working ſome ſecret Antipathy betwixt them. For it is reported by <hi>Egnatius,</hi> that one <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alaſca,</hi> a Bohemian wench, by her charmes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Women of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to kill all the men in that place where ſhe was, all in one night. Or elſe the Divell may doe this, by working ſome ſtrange Alteration in the Temperature of the Genitall parts either of the Man, or of the Woman: for by this meanes ſome men have become Impotent, and unapt for Copulation: and on the contrary, ſome Women have been as ſalt as Bitches: as <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> reports.</p>
               <p>But we muſt take heed that we doe not Ignorantly impute theſe effects to Magicke, Charmes, or Sorcery, when as indeed they are produced by Naturall cauſes: As did of old the Scythians, who, having made themſelves Impotent, by cutting the veines, Arteries, or Nerves that joyne cloſe to the Eares, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:2212:176"/>
thought that it was a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted upon them, by the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania,</hi> in revenge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury their Anceſtors had done unto her, in pulling downe and rifling a Temple that was dedicated to her Honour in <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calon,</hi> a famous Citty of <hi>Paleſtina.</hi>
               </p>

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this defect is incident both to Widowes, and to Married women al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if their Husbands chance to be a long time abſent from them: as <hi>Iean Liebault</hi> affirmes that himſelfe hath knowne it happen to two women that were neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his. And I am much inclined to ſuſpect, that <hi>Namyſia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Phaethuſa,</hi> two

women whom <hi>Hippocrates</hi> reports to have been Metamorphoſed into Men, were only troubled with this diſeaſe: which is indeed more rarely, and ſeldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeen in Women, then the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſeaſe to this is, which many times proves the Occaſion of quenching Loves deſires in Married perſons. But I ſhall not here ſet downe the manner of curing theſe two oppoſite diſeaſes: but ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther referre you to <hi>Avicen, Aetius, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineta,</hi> and all moderne writers that have ſpoken any thing of Barrenneſſe, or of the Diſeaſes of Women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arnaldus de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illa Nova,</hi> in his tract that he hath writren concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies that muſt be uſed againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and his ſorceries, counſels us to cauſe the party affected to carry about him a quill of Quickſilver, or elſe a piece of Corall, the hearbe Motherwort, or Squills. <hi>Ioannes de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>igo</hi> adviſeth to beſprinkle the houſe of the party that is enchanted or bewitched, with the blood of a black dog.

               <p>But my opinion ſhall ever be, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments and Sorceries, are to be cured rather by Prayer and Faſting, and not by Phyſicall or Naturall remedies.</p>

               <p>THe Ancient Greeks in this caſe, had in great account the <hi>Copaean</hi> Lake, wherein <hi>Agamemnon</hi> is reported by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> to have bathed himſelfe, when hee deſired to quit the Love of the faire <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeis.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2212:185"/>
to make experiment of it, is ſaid to be <hi>Sapho.</hi>

The faire <hi>Calyce</hi> alſo, ſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Poet <hi>Steſichorus</hi> for her beauty, was ſo miſerably enamoured of <hi>Evanthlus,</hi> that ſeeing her ſelfe refuſed by him, ſhe adventured to runne that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate courſe that <hi>Sapho</hi> had done before her.</p>
               <p>But the harſhneſſe and unpleaſantneſſe of this Remedy, gave occaſion to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſubſtitute inſtead thereof <hi>Cupids</hi> fountaine in <hi>Cyzicus,</hi> the vertue whereof, as <hi>Mutianus</hi> reports, was ſuch, as that it would utterly extinguiſh and allay the heats of doating Lovers. Of the like ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue alſo was the river <hi>Selemnus,</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Pauſanias;</hi> who notwithſtanding ſeems to give litle or no credit at all unto it. For if this were ſo, ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: the water of this river would be far more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious then gold. Notwithſtanding for my owne part, I find no ſuch great Abſurdity, or Improbability in the ſtory of this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For it is moſt certaine, that a Bath of cold water is a very ſoveraigne Remedy for the cure of the Vterine Fury, which is a <hi>Species</hi> of Love-Melancholy; and alſo of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2212:186"/>
the Dropſy: eſpecially if the water be any whit Minerall, as it is probable the waters of thoſe fountaines were. And this ſeems alſo to be very much confirmed by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curialis,</hi> who aſſures us that he hath cured diverſe women of this diſeaſe of Love, meerely by making them drinke a good quantity of cold water, and bathing them in the like.</p>
               <p>The Doricke Muſicke is alſo reported to have been of ſo great force in appeaſing and compoſing the perturbations of the Mind, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, as that <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> the Generall of the Grecian forces in the Expedition againſt <hi>Troy,</hi> left no other Guardian of his Wives Chaſtity in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſave only a Muſitian, that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well skilled in the Doricke Tone; who by the power of his Harmony reſtrained <hi>Clytemneſtra</hi> from all unchaſt and Illicite Loves, ſo long as he lived. But the Adulterous <hi>Aegiſtus,</hi> perceiving that ſo long as the Muſitian lived, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to compaſſe his deſignes; he cauſed him to be murdered, and by this meanes at length obtained the love of the faire <hi>Clytemneſtra, Boëthius</hi> tels a ſtory of

                  <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> how that meeting a company of mad Youngſters, who being well hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with wine, were going about to offer violence to ſome that detained a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart of theirs from them, threatning to ſet the houſe afire about their eares: <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> preſently cauſed the Muſitian that played to them to change the Tone: and ſo by a heavy, grave, Spondaicall Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, hee preſently appeaſed their fury, and made them give over their violence and inſolent attempt.</p>

And the reaſon is, becauſe that the Lover is alwaies longing for the preſence
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:2212:190"/>
of his Miſtreſſe, and contemplating on her vertues, and Perfection, which ſeeme, by this her abſence, to be the more encreaſed. For, as the Poet ſaith,</p>

But this change of place is a very ſure remedy for the prevention of this diſeaſe; and alſo not altogether Vnprofitable, for one that is actually in Love, if ſo be that he hath fully reſolved to endeavour to quit his deſires.

much at his ſtrangeneſſe, and that he tooke no more notice of her: which made her ſuſpect that happily he might, by reaſon of his long abſence, forget her: ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prove the truth of it, told him who ſhe was, in theſe words; <hi>Ego ſum ego:</hi> I am the ſame you left me.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2212:193"/>
for then it is to be feared, that if he be left alone, he will either make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with himſelfe, as diverſe in this caſe have done; or elſe he will runne mad: as <hi>Avicen</hi> advertiſeth, about the end of his Chapter <hi>de Amant.</hi> Notwithſtanding I doe greatly approve of Solitarineſſe, for the Prevention of this diſeaſe: provided alwaies, that we joyne with it Faſting, Watching and Prayer: as many Religious and holy men have done, who have reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into Caves and Deſerts, for this very purpoſe.</p>

For Hunting ſeems to be very uſefull in this caſe, not only becauſe it diverts the Louers mind from entertaining its owne unbridled Paſſions: But alſo becauſe that it excites and quickens the Appetite of the poore decaied <hi>Melancholico;</hi> and by wearineſſe, provokes in him a kind of pleaſant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Drowſineſſe, and diſpoſition to ſleepe, which gives him not leaſure to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:2212:193"/>

               <p>Thoſe that delight not in hunting, may uſe in ſtead thereof diverſe other exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes either of the Body, or of the Mind, (<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The exerciſes I would eſpecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, ſhould be Walking, diſcourſing, honeſt paſtimes, Banqueting, Muſicke, and ſuch exerciſes of Recreation: from which I would baniſh all young Men, if ſo be the party thus affected be a Maid, or Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: and ſo on the contrary, if it be a Man, you muſt by no means admit the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Women: (although I confeſſe, <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leriola</hi>

               <p>IF the Patient be in good plight of body, fat and corpulent, the firſt thing wee doe, we muſt let him bleed, in the <hi>Hepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica</hi> in the right arme, ſuch a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable quantity of blood, as ſhal be thought convenient both for his diſeaſe, complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion;

                  <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> makes thoſe that are ſad, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: appeaſeth thoſe that are Angry: and keepes Lovers from running Mad.</p>
               <p>But if the diſeaſe bee growne to that ripeneſſe, as that the party affected hath his Iudgement and Fancy perverted, I would then adviſe to open the <hi>Median,</hi> or Common veine, (which <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſor</hi> call, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ena Matrix, ſeu Cardiaca;</hi> as <hi>Valleriola</hi> alſo counſelleth: alwaies obſerving this rule, that if the blood runne black, groſſe, and very thick, we may then take away a good quantity of it: but if it be of a good colour, thin, and cleare; wee muſt then preſently ſtop the Veine; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſcriptions of <hi>Galen, Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen,</hi> and their Sectaries.</p>
               <p>After this generall Evacuation of blood hath been performed, for the correcting
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:2212:198"/>
of the Intemperature of the Liver, &amp; the ſpending of ſome part of the Melancholy blood: I come next of all to the opening of the <hi>Saphena,</hi> or Ankle Veine, eſpecially in Women, who in this diſeaſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly troubled alſo with the <hi>Suffocation of the Matrix,</hi> or the Vterine Fury: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by this meanes there will bee the greater and more eaſy Revulſion of the Humours. For it is <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) &amp; Correſpondence with the Veines of the Hamme, or Ankle, then they have with thoſe of the Arme.</p>
               <p>Some Phyſitians will have ſome blood to be taken from the Veines in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, either with an Inſtrument, or elſe with Horſeleeches. But I ſhould rather preferre the opening of the <hi>Salvatella</hi> in the left Arme: which I have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to have beene very good for the Cure of any diſeaſe, proceeding from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
               <p>Or elſe I would provoke the Fluxe of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:2212:198"/>
the <hi>Haemorrhoids,</hi> as being a very ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and very neceſſary alſo in the cure of all Hypochondriacall Melancholy: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by this Fluxe, the Spleen, and Meſentery diſcharge themſelves of all groſſe, and earthy Humours, that cauſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in thoſe parts.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The opening of the Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids is the ſureſt remedy both for the Cure, and the Prevention of any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Varices</hi> have almoſt the ſame ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that the <hi>Haemoroids</hi> have, if they chance to happen in this diſeaſe of Love-Melancholy; by reaſon that the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flatuoſities are conveighed away from the Privy parts, where they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe provoke a deſire to Venery; and are derived to the Veines in the Thighs, and other Varicall Veines: according to the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:2212:199"/>
opinion both of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and all our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>But I muſt needs confeſſe, for my own part, that I have found the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arices</hi> to bee of very litle, or no force at all in this caſe. And therefore I ſhould rather ſubſtitute inſtead thereof, as <hi>Arnaldus</hi> alſo adviſeth, Couping-glaſſes, applyed on the Legs, or Thighs, with ſufficient ſcarification: or elſe apply to the ſame parts, one, or two Potentiall Cauteries. But if the <hi>Clitoris,</hi> by reaſon of its length, be the cauſe of this Furious Deſire, as it very often happens ſo to be, it muſt then be taken ſhorter, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner preſcribed by <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio,</hi> and <hi>Albucaſis:</hi> unto whom I muſt referre you, becauſe I deſire to avoid Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>And in caſe theſe Remedies availe not, and the diſeaſe ſtill growes ſtronger, in ſo much that it may be feared, that without ſome ſpeedy redreſſe, the Patient will grow Wolfe-mad: you muſt then open the Arme Veines, and let them bleed, till the party is ready to fall downe for faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and loſſe of blood: and you muſt alſo apply an Actuall Cautery, if the party can
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:2212:199"/>
endure it: otherwiſe you muſt be content with a Potentiall Cautery applyed to the Forehead; as both <hi>Aegineta, Oribafius, Avicen,</hi> and other Authors of good note informe us, in their ſeverall Tracts <hi>de Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthropia, Lycaone, Lycano, Alchatrab,</hi> and <hi>Alcutubut,</hi> into which diſeaſe this of Love-Melancholy doth many times dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate: as <hi>Avicen</hi> affirmes, in his Chapter <hi>de Iliſco, ſive de Amore.</hi>

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:2212:200"/>
wont to ſay, <hi>per Epicraſin,</hi> purging out the bad Humours by degrees, and ſupplying good Humours inſtead of them: (<gap reason="foreign">

For Nature abhorres whatſoever is too much; but is pleaſed with a Mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all things. (Which Aphoriſme, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeeme to be pronounced of all diſeaſes in generall; yet is it proved more particularly to be true, in the Scab, and Itch, which alwaies are obſerved to grow worſe, by the raſh and unadviſed applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Oyntments and Purges.) So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt wee take the ſame courſe and order of proceeding in the cure of Love-Melancholy, or Erotique Madneſſe; which diſeaſe requires a great deale of time for the curing of it, as well for thoſe reaſons before alleaged in the 21. <hi>Chapter,</hi> as alſo, becauſe that the Humour Peccant is the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:2212:200"/>
more head-ſtrong and Intractable, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its extreame Drineſſe: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: that which is Dry, is very hard to bee removed or wrought upon.</p>
               <p>And that this diſeaſe is not ſuddenly cured, but requires ſome good ſpace of time for the effecting of it, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alſo aſſures us, in his booke <hi>de Natura Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For Melancholy, ſaith hee, being the moſt Viſcous and clammie Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that is in the body, is therefore the hardeſt to be purged forth, &amp; requireth the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt time to be removed. Which ſeems alſo to be confirmed by the cure that <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leriola</hi> wrought upon the Merchant of <hi>Arles,</hi> which he could not perfect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpace of ſix, or ſeven Moneths.</p>
               <p>But for our more orderly and Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall proceeding in the cure of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, we will divide it into two Principall parts; namely the <hi>Humectation,</hi> or moyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Body, or of the Peccant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: and the <hi>Evacuation,</hi> and purging of the ſame: according as we are inſtructed
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:2212:201"/>
by <hi>Avicen</hi> alſo in this caſe. <hi>Canon curati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis Melancholiae eſt, ut pervenias ad ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum in</hi> Humectatione: <hi>&amp; cum hoc, non ſis diminutus in</hi> Evacuatione <hi>Cholerae Nigrae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Humectation</hi> muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Meats, Alterative Medicines, Baths, &amp; Topicall Plaiſters. And the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> is to be done with all convenient ſpeed, but very gently, and with intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for feare of over-heating the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. And yet the Humour is many times ſo ſtubborne, as that gentle and eaſie Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines worke not at all upon it. And therefore it was not unfitly compared, by one, to a troubleſome Garriſon of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that are billetted in ſome poore town or other, where they may live as they pleaſe themſelves, no man daring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trowle them. For though they entreat them never ſo kindly, yet ſhall they very hardly be rid of them, without much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe: But if they give them the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſt, they will then ſtay there the longer; if it be but to vexe and torment them the more.</p>
               <p>We ſhall doe well then to begin our Purgation with a gentle Clyſter, for to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:2212:201"/>
evacuate the Excrements of the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Body: and we muſt compoſe it of ſome mollifying and Refreſhing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, adding thereto ſome <hi>Catholicon, Diaprum. Simp.</hi> or the like. The next day we may give our patient a convenient quantity of <hi>Caſſia,</hi> with a litle <hi>Sena Orient,</hi> well prepared: or elſe a dramme of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Hamech,</hi> or <hi>Diaſenna:</hi> or, if he pleaſe, he may take a gentler purge, of <hi>Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, Tryphera Perſ.</hi> and <hi>Syrup. Roſar.</hi> to which you may adde a quantity of <hi>Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbe,</hi> and <hi>Agaric.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this Minorative, it will then be time to fall to the preparing of the Humour by Iuleps, or Decoctions: as for example.</p>

               <p>Briefly, you may find a thouſand ſuch like medicines as theſe, in the writings of Phyſitians that have ſpoken of the cure of this diſeaſe; with which I ſhall not here trouble you. Only thus much for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:2212:207"/>
I ſhall advertiſe you of, that <hi>Nicolaus Monardus,</hi> a Phyſitian of <hi>Sevill,</hi> and <hi>Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> ſpeaking of Medicaments that have been lately found out in the Weſtern parts of the world, doe highly magnify, for a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne remedy, and Antidote againſt Vnchaſt Love, and Philters, the Powder of a certaine Hearbe called <hi>Contra-Yer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> brought not long ſince from <hi>Charcys,</hi> a Province of <hi>Peru,</hi> being in ſhape like <hi>Corne-flag,</hi> and having leaves like Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree leaves. Which relation of theirs if it be true, we may ſay of this Plant, as <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi> did of the fountaine <hi>Selemnus,</hi> that it would be more worth then all the gold in the world. The like Iudgement doe we give of the ſtone called by the Greekes <hi>Selenites,</hi> or <hi>Aphroſelenum,</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Dioſcorides:</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Amiantus,</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtone found in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls, <hi>Linum vivum;</hi> Strabo, <hi>Carystium;</hi> Zoroaſter, <hi>Boſtrychitem;</hi> Solinus, <hi>Carba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum;</hi> ſome others, <hi>Corſoidem, Spoliam, &amp; Spartospoliam;</hi> and the vulgar call it, though improperly, <hi>Stone-Allum:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in old time they were wont to make Table-cloathes, that would be made

white only in the fire, and yet never burne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercurialis,</hi> in his 4. book <hi>de Morbis Mulier.</hi> affirmes, that himſelfe hath cured diverſe both Maids, and married Women of the Vterine Fury, or Love-Madneſſe, by the uſe of cold Minerall waters; ſuch as are thoſe waters in Italy, which they call, <hi>The waters of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgins,</hi> or <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illa.</hi> But this ſeemes to me a thing incredible, conſidering that (as we have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,) it is moſt certaine, that the cure of Love Melancholy, as of all other diſeaſes proceeding from this Humour, conſiſts principally in the <hi>Humectation</hi> &amp; moyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Humour: as <hi>Galen</hi> alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes. Now all thoſe Authors that have written of Minerall Waters, doe general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree, that they are of a <hi>Deſiccative,</hi> or Drying Nature, and therefore ſeeme to be directly contrary to the cure of Love-Melancholy. Yet thus much we may ſay, in the behalfe of <hi>Mercurialis,</hi> that Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall waters, notwithſtanding their Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are wholſome in Melancholy diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in regard they doe very much coole the Liver, which is the ſeat of this diſeaſe,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:2212:208"/>
opening all Obſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries; and alſo comfort the ſtomack, and purge the blood, excerning all the Seroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and wateriſh parts of it by Vrine and Stoole: as <hi>Iohannes Baptiſta Sylvaticus</hi> proves at large. Neither yet are all Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicaments to be rejected in the cure of Melancholy diſeaſes: ſeeing that <hi>Alexander Trallianus, P. Aegineta, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſius, Avicen,</hi> and <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> preſcribe <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymum, Hiera,</hi> and <hi>Hartwort</hi> in theſe diſeaſes; and <hi>Aetius</hi> Vineger alſo: which notwithſtanding, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies, doth both ſettle, and increaſe the Melancholy Humour, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Phyſitians of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> doe attribute the ſame vertue to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Spa.</hi> And thoſe of <hi>Encauſſe</hi> in <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> notwithſtanding they be of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Hot and Dry, are not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for the cure of Melancholy diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which proceed from the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries: as I my ſelfe have found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
