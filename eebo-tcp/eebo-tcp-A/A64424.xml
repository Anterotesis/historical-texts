            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Apologie or Defence is the Work of an excellent Orator, diſplaying all the forces of his wit, to uphold a moſt deplored cauſe in the opinion of the Gentiles, and yet the juſteſt that ever was expoſed to the judgement of men. Its Reader will eaſily comprehend the merit of this peece, ſo ſoon as know <hi>Tertullian</hi> the Author ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and its ſubject the defenſe of truth. 'Twas treated as criminall, with them who ſhut their eyes
<pb facs="tcp:59934:6"/>
to the lights therein, and would not thereby bee informed; Error ſeemed venerable to them for its antiquity: they preferred the darknesse which blinded them for ſo many Ages, before the most excellent Sun-ſhine of divine light: although the accuſed made mention of in this Treatiſe were without ſpots, yet their accuſers endeavoured to find ſome, and obſcured their luſtre, whom they falſly accuſed with ſuch impurity, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary men illuminated with the beams of divine ſplendor, ſhould employ the graces they received from heaven, to dissipate the darknesse of error, and diſcover to the world a truth which till then they were utterly ignorant of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> was one of thoſe, God made uſe of to lay open or unfold ſo glorious a miniſtry; and certainly it was a labour worthy of him; Hee had enriched his mind with all the choice ornaments of humane Learning; was ignorant of nothing that was taught by any kind of Philoſophers, compleat he was in the knowledge of the Civill Lawes, had read the hiſtories of all Ages, made to himſelfe a treaſure of what every ſcience had moſt precious
<pb facs="tcp:59934:6"/>
in it, knew all the myſteries of idolatry, and was fully informed of the beginning and progresse of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, having an underſtanding which made him capable of very great things: His Diſcourſe was ſo powerfull, that one could not heare him without being perſwaded by him; every of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments rendring him victorious, at leaſt over ſome of his Auditors. Hee was equally ſubtill and ſolid in his reaſonings; he had united to thoſe his ſublime qualifications, a perfect underſtanding of the holy Scriptures: great piety and a marvellous zeale in the Religion of the true God. It apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a man ſuch as hee was, to defend the Chriſtians aginſt the calumntes of the Goutiles, to overthrow the Altars of the falſe Gods which Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy (as he ſaith himſelfe) had ſet up to juſtifie the worſhip given by us to the Creator of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal.</p>
            <p>Hee was an <hi>Affrican,</hi> drawing his originall from a Noble Family of the City of <hi>Carthage</hi>: his Father was an Heathen, and commanded a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Souldiers, under the charge of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Province. As himſelfe tooke birth
<pb facs="tcp:59934:7"/>
from an idolatrous houſe, ſo brought up hee was in Error, but God giving him an inquiſitive ſoule, he contented not himſelfe with the knowledge of this world only, but alſo ſoared, and even penetrated into heaven, to get knowledge of divine truth. This ſaving well ſpring carefully laid up in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Church, was the water of life hee chiefly thirſted after, which having once taſted of, he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily plunged himſelfe therein, and took aful draught of the graces of God, ſwallowed up at the ſame time this precious liquor. Since when he ever after ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the fond blindnesse of fooliſh men, who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to miſerable creatures the glory due to God.</p>
            <p>Charity, the moſt excellent of Chriſtian vertues, ſo lively inflamed his heart, that it made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to inſtruct Infidels, to communicate his lights unto them, to confirme them therein by the Authority of holy Scriptures, and by the ſtrength of reaſon to ranke themſelves with him, in the faith of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Heerupon it was he ſo powerfully reſisted the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Philoſophy, which he formerly ſo delighted in, and knew to be the principall ground of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
<pb facs="tcp:59934:7"/>
So that the ſame things hee heertofore ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to adorn his mind withall, and bring it to the knowledge of falſe Gods, whileſt hee lived under the ſervitude of Idolatry, by an admirable work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divine providence, ſerved him ſince his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion as ſtrong inſtruments to deſtroy the worſhip of Idols.</p>
            <p>Now it is very reaſonable that hee, who ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired the ſalvation of his enemies, ſhould have a particular care of his brethren, groaning under the weight of perſecutions, which Pagans made them ſuffer: As therefore he piouſly laboured to open the eyes of the Gentiles, and make them worſhip his Maſter, ſo he happily imployed himſelf likewiſe to repreſent to him the holineſſe of thoſe who moſt unjuſtly were charged with ſuch ſtrange crimes.</p>
            <p>Two principall things hee equally endeavoured to ſet forth, namely the falſenesse of the Gods of the Gentiles, and the truth of one only God, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together the defence of doctrine and manners, proved by one ſame work, the faith and innocence of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59934:8"/>Hee came into the Church neer the end of the ſecond Age, about the time when <hi>Severus</hi> came to the Empire. The faithfull then enjoyed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found peace after a furious war. The Hmp rour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> a wiſe Prince for the world, but too much addicted to the opinions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, ſuffered the fourth Perſecution to bee kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which being ſtirred up in the year of our Lord 164. by the fury of the people, and injuſtice of the Magiſtrates, who governed the Provinces, ſwept away an infinite number of the ſervants of GOD: Nevertheleſſe, although ſome reſt they had, in the year of our ſalvation 176. by the authority of that Prince his forbidding upon pain of death, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Chriſtians, for their Religion by a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the ſervice hee had of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, When by the prayers of Chriſtian ſouldiers, which were in his troops, heaven poured down a favourable ſhowr, that refreſht in extream necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Army bee commanded in <hi>Germany.</hi> Yet this calm laſted not long, the quiet of this uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſea brought in with it an horrible tempest, eſpecially on this ſide the Alps, where the City of
<pb facs="tcp:59934:8"/>
               <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Lions</hi> ſaw the Rhoſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> dyed with the firſt bloud the members of Ieſus Chriſt ſpilt in <hi>Gaule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people that durſt not directly reſist the will of the Emperour, tranſported with extreame rage againſt ſo many good people, began againe to trouble their reſt, in the year 179, on othre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences than that of Religion: They accuſed them of ſuppoſed crimes, the borror whereof, made their names odious, and by this deteſtable ſubtiloy dragd them unjuſtly before the Courts of Iuſtice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they cluded the puniſhment eſtabliſhed by the Emperour, againſt thoſe who accuſed the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and boldly glutted their cruelty on theſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, whom they expoſed to all kind of tortures, and in the end, in humanely put them to death, for confessing the name of God only. This Perſecution ended with the life of <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The faithfull after ſo many ſuffering, had reſt under the Emperour <hi>Commodus,</hi> who tranſported with a bloudy outrage againſt all Orders of his State, by a ſecret judgement of <hi>God</hi> ſpared none but Chriſtians.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:59934:9"/>And certainly it was by a viſible miracle that this Prince an enemy of all honeſty was not alſo an enemy of thoſe in like maner that made professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of godlinesse, that this Prince who ſhed with ſo much tyranny, the bloud of his people, ſhould cloſe the wounds by which came out that of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and that theſe Idolaters who before had no ſpectacle ſo agreeable to their madneſſe as the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments of the Faithfull, ſhould ceaſe to afflict them, in a time when heir hands were ſo accuſtomed to ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt acknowledge God, who inſpires ſuch motions as pleaſe him in the hearts of men, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this ſo ſtrange wonder. Hee procured this peace to the Church, to the end hee might fortifie it againſt the aſſaults it was to endure ſoon after. Its certaine, during this tranquility it was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: the Gentiles moved to ſee ſuch excellency in the Chriſtians, the innocent carriage of their lives, could not conſider therof without aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They admired the purity they ſaw ſhine in their actions. From thence ſprang deſire in them of diſcovering the cauſe of ſuch perfection, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb facs="tcp:59934:9"/>
were they in the ſearch of its originall, which is truth. And after they had broken downe the vail, which hindred them from knowing the ſame, they embraced it with as much affection, as ever they ſtrove againſt it.</p>
            <p>So not only the people, but thoſe alſo, whoſe birth and merit rayſed them to great dignities, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. They renounced their Idols, to conſecraete themſelves to the ſervice of the true God, and abandoned the Temples of the falſe Gods, that they might ſerve no other but that one God that created them. By this means Towns wrer peopled with Chriſtians, Armies made up of them, and the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Governours of all the World, filled with them every day. Theſe are the fruits which peace had produced, which the Church injoied ſince the Empire of <hi>Commodus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Severus</hi> having found the Empire in this happy condition, left it not ſo. The Sovereigne power fell in his hands in the yeare of our Lord 195. At the beginning hee ſhewed no ſign of any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion againſt the Chriſtians, but contrarily made
<pb facs="tcp:59934:10"/>
great eſteem of them; witneſſed their probity, and openly oppoſed the violence of the people when hee ſaw them moſt incenſed to the Chriſtians deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He had ſtill before his eyes the benefit wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was obliged to a Chriſtian named <hi>Proculus Torpacion,</hi> who heertofore reſtored him to his health, and by the remembrance of ſuch a recovery, was ſo dear to him, that he alwayes kept this man neer him, ſo long as he lived; he durſt not uſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Religion of him to whom he owed his life, ſo long as he was in the world, and his preſence ready to reproove him of ſuch ingratitude. The death of this Chriſtian, time, and the revolution of affairs changed his mind unhappily to indignation.</p>
            <p>Hee had two Competitors in the Empire, <hi>Piſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Niger</hi> (who held <hi>Syria,</hi> and declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe Emperour in the City of <hi>Antioch</hi>) and <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Albinius</hi> (who was Maſter of <hi>Gaule</hi> and <hi>Britain,) Severus</hi> accommodated himſelfe to this man, and aſſociated him with himſelfe in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, to defeat the other, and after overcomming <hi>Niger</hi> (who died of akurt hee received in fighting) turned his thoughts unto procuring the ruin of <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59934:10"/>
whom he had honored for no other purpoſe then to deſtroy him. <hi>Albinius</hi> being dead, he came back from <hi>Gaule</hi> victorious, and entring <hi>Rome,</hi> he was there received with publick acclamations, rejoycings, and ſuch ſolemnities as Superſtition had brought in, and which thwarted the holineſſe of the Chriſtians, thought they ſhould offend God, if in ſhewing their affection to the Emperour, they mingled themſelves in theſe diſſolutions; but their piety paſſing with the Infidels for a crime, their enemies tooke occaſion thereby to exclame againſt them, as againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Emperour. Some think that <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> after hee had cauſed many Noble perſons to bee put to death, of <hi>Niger</hi> or <hi>Albinius</hi> party, went to make War againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and leaving the Government of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Plautianus,</hi> this man naturally cruell, and continuing the ſearch after all thoſe who had favoured the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two parties, filling <hi>Rome</hi> with Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls and mourning, began alſo the fifth Perſecution againſt the Chriſtians, not as complices of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which now began to be extinguiſhed, but as guilty of high Treaſon, in neglecting to render to
<pb facs="tcp:59934:11"/>
the Emperour at his return from <hi>Gaule,</hi> their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in like maner as his other people did.</p>
            <p>They that writ this fifth Perſecution were ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up at <hi>Rome</hi> on this ſubject, on the only autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Plautianus,</hi> have alſo writ it was in this time that <hi>Tertullian</hi> made this Apologie or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to make known to the Gentiles the injustice of the uſage the Chriſtians had; And upon their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this Peece was publiſhed the ſeventh yeare of the Empire of <hi>Severus,</hi> which fell in the year of our Lord 201. But others more probably ſay, it was in the year of our Salvation 204. the tenth year of the Empire of <hi>Severus,</hi> when this Prince after he had overcome the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and eſtabliſhed peace in the Empire, willing to ſmother the ſeed of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, wher with it had beene ſo violently agitated, for bad unlawfull aſſemblies, and factious meetings; upon this occaſion, pretence is taken to perſecute the Chriſtians with authority as if in meeting to prayſe GOD, they had violated the prohibition of the Emperour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologie or Defence, affirms, this laſt opinion to be the trueſt, ſhewing Chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:59934:11"/>
meetings not to be factious meetings: Concluding it was not for this cauſe, that the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Inhibition was put forth. Neither is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, but this Apologie or Defence, that juſtifies Chriſtian Religion from the guilt of faction, practiſe and conſpiracie againſt the State, was after the Edict of <hi>Severus,</hi> who commanding the Judges to puniſh all ſeditious confederacies, had kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the fire of Perſecution againſt the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>
            <p>Howſoever it was, certaine it is; <hi>Tertullian</hi> compoſed this Apologie or Defence in the reigne of <hi>Severus,</hi> during the greateſt heat of puniſhing the Chriſtians: he was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and publiſhed this Book, without putting his name to it, that bee might not expoſe himſelfe to inevitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>Sparing the name of <hi>Severus</hi> for the reſpect born to his dignity, he addreſt this Book to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who ſate every day in judgement upon the faithfull, and condemned the true Religion without knowing it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59934:12"/>Its impoſſible ſeriouſly to conſider this Peece without being raviſht therewith. Riches it hath that puts it into the rank of great Workes, and of force to make us conſeſſe, that if it be to bee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the reputation of its Author, it is alſo of more eſteem for its own merit. We may ſee therin rare vivacity of wit, incredible ſtore of high thoughts and a mervaillous power of perſwading. Wee may receive there the light of an eminent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. We meet there with an infinite number of choice things. The conduct of it is admirable: Art hath nothing excellent, which is not judicially there obſerved. All the parts therof are agreeable with the whole. In fine, its a perfect body to which the Learned have given this commendation, that of all the Works of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> there is none to bee compared to this. All the following Ages have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the Church hath nothing more accompliſhed; and that Religion could not bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defended, nor better perſwaded then it is in this Divine Peece.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the ſtile is not ſo glorious, the phraſe rude and obſcure, and it ſeems as if every
<pb facs="tcp:59934:12"/>
one of its periods contayned a myſtery, the ſenſe therof is ſo hid, But we muſt pardon an Affrican, if it be not expreſſed with all the grace of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Tongue: the fault is not ſo much in him, as in his Countrey. If his ſpeech hath not much Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it hath much vigor; His diſcourſe flatters not the ears, but works with vehemence, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth powerfully on the mind of the Readers that which will perſwade him</p>
            <p>Now although <hi>Terrullian</hi> hath not loftineſſe of ſpeech, yet we may ſay, hee hath written purely and not uſed tearms, which were not fit to declare vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly what he conceived, and which are not found in the Authors of Humane Learning, and of civill right; all his words are Latin, but his phraſe ſtrange, and relliſheth of the stile of the Greeks, to which he was accuſtomed by his ordinary reading of their Books. Its this mixture that makes it obſcure, that the moſt able men meet with difficulties in his Workes; and the reaſon his Apologie or Defence ſhewes not its beauty, to all thoſe that makes uſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59934:13"/>There have crept in ſome opinions not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and which in that time were not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. He writes, Divels were ingendred by the conjunction of revolted Angels, with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men: he ſpeaks of the birth of the ſoule, as well as of that of the body, beleeving the child takes both his ſoul and his body from the ſubſtance of his father: he ſayes the ſoul cannot ſuffer alone (but he is not conſtant in his opinion) and teaches, that the ſouls of the wicked ſuffer in hell, although ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the matter, and their bodies reſt in the grave, which is the doctrine of the Catholicke Church. Hee mentions Paradiſe, as a place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, different from that in heaven, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the world, by the interpoſition of a Zone of fire, where he beleeves the juſt goe after death, to remain till the day of the Lord. And in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, lets ſlip ſomething from his pen of the age of a thouſand years interpoſed between the end of this world, and eternity: He is of opinion alſo, that during the courſe of theſe thouſand yeares, Ieſus Chriſt ſhall raign on the earth with his elect, that in the mean time, the juſt being rayſed out of their
<pb facs="tcp:59934:13"/>
graves, ſhall live with abundance of ſpirituall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and that this age being come to its period, the Son of God ſhall then make his univerſall judgement. It is enough wee have taken notice of theſe opinions, which were not yet errors in the time of <hi>Tertullian</hi>; the Church then not having pronounced any thing to the contrary, they con<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves then to preach the truth of one God in three Perſons, the myſtery of the Birth, Life, and Death of Ieſus Chriſt, the inſtitution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the judgement of the Lord, the glory of the bleſſed in heaven, and eternall puniſhments prepared for the wicked in hell.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath ſo wel1 eſtabliſht this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſo perfectly repreſented the innocence of Chriſtians, by this Apologie or Defence, that all the Church had this Book in ſingular reversace: they eſteemedit as a pretions Cabinet, where the evidences of its faith are kept the proofs of its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient diſcipline, and marks of the holineſſe of its firſt children</p>
            <p>It ſeemes to me that <hi>England</hi> deſerves to have this Peece in its Language, that Learned men owe
<pb facs="tcp:59934:14"/>
to this Nation ſo rich a Preſent; for although Tranſlations are not much eſteemed in this Age, where every one adores his own inventions, yet this, (how meanly ſoever tranſlated) may bee well received, becauſe of the dignity of the matter. I have undertaken it for thoſe, who not knowing the language of the Miſtreſſe of the World, cannot know the perfection of ſo excellent a production of wit, if it appear not to their eyes with its graces in the Mother tongue of their native Country. This Work might have met with a better Pen then mine, but not a faithfuller; I aſpire not to the glory of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting well, but only, of being an Interpreter of an Author, who, in the judgement of the Learned, hath no fewer thorns, then flowers.</p>

She demands no favour of you; becauſe her condition permits her not to hope for a uſage eaſier then that ſhe hath formerly received; ſhe knowes her ſelfe a ſtranger on earth, and doubts not to meet with enemies in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey thats not her owne; as ſhee derives her originall from Heaven, ſo there makes ſhe her principal reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where ſhee hath moſt hope, where her beſt credit is, and where her dignity Chines in its greateſt luſtre. That which ſhee deſires of you whileſt ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines heer below, is only you would not condemne her unknown. The Lawes of the State will loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their Authority, if you Permit her but to defend her ſelfe; their power on the contrary will be ſeen with more luſter if you condemne her after you have heard her: but if you judge her without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her cauſe, you will not only ſtand charged with reproach of manifeſt injuſtice; but be juſtly ſuſpected your conſciences check you with ſome ſecret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that make you refuſe to heare the thing you could not condemne if you heard it. Wee ſay then ignorance is the firſt cauſe that makes the hatred

unjuſt you have conceived againſt the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; indeed wee are unholy in your opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are not informed of the holines of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But take heed what ſeems to ſerve you for an excuſe, be not that which renders your judgement of us faulty. For is there any thing more unjuſt then to hate that you know not, although it were otherwiſe even a thing to bee hated? As bad as any thing is it begins not to deſerve hatred, till it be known to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; while you know not what it is, how is it poſſible you ſhould rightly hate it? To make the hatred of any thing juſt, it ſufficeth not the thing it ſelfe be evill, but that the party who hates the ſame knows it to be evill in like maner; ſeeing therefore you hate us without knowing wherefore, how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears it you hate us not without a cauſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently moſt unjuſtly? in regard whereof wee have good reaſon to reprehend you, becauſe you know us not (to wit) in our condition when you hate us, and therefore hate us moſt unjuſtly. Certainly you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue us with ſo much animoſity, that it well appears you know not in what manner wee live; and affect an ignorance that condemnes rather then excuſeth you of injuſtice. For we ſee a great many whoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is grounded on the want of knowledge onely, who ſo ſoone as they ceaſe from being ignorant of our diſcipline, ceaſe at the ſame time to bear hatred againſt us. It is of theſe fort of men that Chriſtians are made; they embrace our religion after informed in the Piety thereof, when hating what they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were, they make publick profeſſion of that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59934:17"/>
they hated before; the number of theſe men is ſo great, that it will aſtoniſh you when but hear them reckoned up. And from thence it comes the people complain highly that the City of Rome is invironed on all ſides with the enemies of the worſhip of the Gods, that Chriſtians are ſpred over all the Empire, that the provinces are full of them; they be wail it as a ſignall miſchiefe and as a conſiderable loſſe, becauſe perſons of all qualities and ages, men of all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even thoſe who have attained to great digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, run promiſcuouſly on this ſide. The progreſſe Christianity hath made cannot make them judge well of us, and the examples before their eyes puts not this thought in their mindes, that a religion that drawes all the world after it muſt have ſomething excellent and divine that they know not of. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy wherewith wee ſuffer their perſecutions is not able to move them, to better opinions of us then thoſe they have formerly conceived: they will not perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly be informed of our Doctrine, wherin only they care not for, being over curious, and take as much delight to bee ignorant of this, as others to know all things. O how would <hi>Anacharſis</hi> have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe rather imprudent for giving their judgement upon men wiſer then themſelves, then formerly hee taxed thoſe of folly, who themſelves being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immuſicall, gave their judgement touching Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke. Seemed it not the policy of the Athenians ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to him, when hee ſaw among them the learned expoſed to the judgement of ignorant men? Truly the blindeneſſe of our enemies far ſurpaſſeth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59934:17"/>
this, in regard they are ſo hardned in the hatred they beare towards us, that becauſe not being oblieged to relinquiſh it, they care not for being made acquainted with our condition: much doubting what they are ignorant of, is of ſuch quality, that it will not be in tneir power to hate it, if once acquainted but with the merit therof. Now if hatred have not a lawfull cauſe, we cannot too ſoon extinguish it, and it juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindled, it imports that the ſubject which hath given it a being bee examined; becauſe if it be found it hath juſtice on its ſide? not onely this reſtimony takes nothing away from its force, but ſeemes to take new forces, authoriſing it the more. You ſay, to prove the holineſſe of our doctrine, we ſhould not boaſt in that which ſhee inſinuateth into the mind, and that ſhe gaineth ſo much people; for wee ſee very many change their good cuſtomes into bad, that it is not a new thing ſouldiers revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from their owne party quit their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, to caſt themſelves into the troops of their enemies. Wee agree with you in this; but experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo teacheth us, that even they that ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſurpriſed with unruly affections, are not aſſured of defending the diſorders of their life, and dare not undertake to make them paſſe for good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; Nature hath tied to evill, fear or ſhame, the wicked ſeeke for darkeneſſe, tremble when they are ſurpriſed, and deny ail when accuſed: One can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw the truth from their mouthes no not in the middeſt of tortures, and when their ſentence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, they have recourſe to teares and ſighs.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59934:18"/>
They examine their conſciences, and remembring the number of their crimes, they impute it to deſtiny &amp; the ſtars, and wil not acknowledge they have been carried to it by their conſent, becauſe they know they are wicked and puniſhable things. Do the Chriſtians any ſuch thing? They are not aſhamed when diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered what they are, they repent not, unleſſe it bee that they had not ſooner followed the Law of Jeſus Chriſt, they eſteeme it a glory to bee put into the hands of Juſtice, if accuſed they defend not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when interrogated they confeſſe willingly, and when condemned they declare themſelves thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their Judges. What is that evill that hath not the quality of evill? which is neither accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with feare nor ſhame? who know not the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices the accuſed make uſe of to gaine time, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr judgement? Who are not affected with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, or complaints wherwith Criminalls uſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to deplore the ſadneſs of their conditio? was there ever an evill of this nature? Did any ever ſee Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalls rejoyce in the torments they endure? Who deſire to bee accuſed? Who make much of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and of their pain make their felicity? Doe not ſay the conſtancy wee ſhew is rather a mark of deſpair then of vertue, for you cannot judge ſafeiy of our actions, ſeeing you cannot know the motions they produce.</p>

               <p>IF notwithſtanding you cannot part with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion you have conceived, but beleeve us indeed guilty, why are wee handled otherwiſe then they who, being like us, are in like maner guilty? Seeing by the rules of juſtice the ſame fault ought to have the ſame maner of puniſhment. When men, not of our Religion are accuſed of the ſame crimes they impute to us, it is permitted them to have their innocency made knowne, to defend themſelves by word of mouth, to take counſell of an Advocate; they are ſuffered to give an anſwer unto what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt them, and to make good their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for the Laws do not allow thoſe to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned whoſe offences have not been heard. It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Chriſtians they take the liberty to ſpeak in their juſtification, to uphold the truth, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the Judges the things they ought neceſſarily to know, that their judgements might not bee ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of injuſtice. They require for the condemning of us, but only the confeſſion of the name Chriſtian, they ſtay not till the crimes wherewith they charge us be examined, and it is the confeſſion only that expoſeth us to publick hatred. When you put up a proceſſe againſt a Criminall, you doe not pronounce his condemnation ſo ſoon as confeſt hee is a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, ſacrilegious, inceſtuous, an enemy of the State, which are the titles they give us: But you examine

the circumſtances, you conſider the qualities of the fact, in what place, in what maner, and at what time the crime was committed, then you informe your ſelves againſt the complices; you do not keep theſe forms when you proceed againſt us, and yet you will condemne us without ſhew of juſtice; you muſt make us appear guilty of the things which are falſly imputed to us; for example, how many children a Chriſtian denounced after inhumanely cut their throats, how many times darkneſs give him the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſatiating his incontineney with inceſtuous imbraces, who the Cooks dreſſed the fleſh of theſe bodies ſo cruelly murthered, &amp; of what ſort the dogs (as you ſuppoſe) brought into our aſſemblies, to ſerve to put out the lights. Oh what great glory to a Judge to have convinced by due proof a Chriſtian to have caten the fieaſh of an hundred children? ſeeing we read it hath otherwiſe beene hecretofore forbid even ſo much as to make any maner of inquiry after us. <hi>Pliny</hi> the ſecond, whileſt Governor of Aſia, after ſentencing to death many Chriſtians, &amp; depriving others of their dignities, wondred his ſeverity did not diminiſh their number, and conſutred with the Emperour <hi>Trajan</hi> to know in what maner hee ſhould governe for the time to come, in the behalf of Chriſtians that ſhould bee preſented to him. Hee wrot to him that beſides their firm reſolution of not ſacrificing to the Gods, he could learn no other thing touching their Religion, but of their aſſembling together before day to ſing prayſes to Jeſus Chriſt, and to God, and to unite their wills to the conſervation of the diſcipline eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59934:19"/>
amongſt them: forbidding expreſly murder, adultery, fraud, perſidiouſneſſe, and other crimes. <hi>Trajan</hi> by way of anſwer, returnes him a command not to make inquiry after them, but being brought before him to puniſh them. O judgement wrapt up in a neceſſary and inexplicable ambiguity.! How is it poſſible to accord things ſo oppoſite? Hec for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids to ſeek after Chriſtians, as being innocent, and commands to punuſh them as criminalls. He is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and cruell, pardons, and puniſheth at the ſame time. How comes it you are contrary to your ſelves, that your owne judgement beares witneſſe of your own Injuſtice? If you think wee deſerve puniſhment, why forbid to enquire after us? If thought fitting not to enquire after us, why then not acquit us? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſts are eſtabliſhed in all Provinces, to diſcover and take theeves. Arms are lawfull in the hands of all men to be employed againſt traytors, and againſt the enemies of the State. When once made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a villany committed, wee apprehend in the purſuit all wee ſuſpect to bee Pertakers with them that commit it. They are only Chriſtians are forbid to be ſought after, and yet permitted at the ſame time to bee dragd before the Tribunals of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as if the enquiry made to no other end then to preſent men before the Judges. So you condemn a Chriſtian when once found out, although according to the deſign of your Lawes, hee ſhould bee aſſured againſt all ſearches; and when you condemn them, I doe not beleeve you judge them worthy of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment you ordain them, becauſe guilty, but onely
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59934:20"/>
becauſe diſcovered; and that there are people found bold enough to enquire of their life againſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ordinances. But when a Chriſtian is in your hands, you doe not act againſt him as you are uſed to act when you would purſue the vengeance of a crime, for when the other accuſed boldly maintaine they are not guilty, you ordayn they ſhould bee put to the rack, to the end that torture may force them to confeſſe, and contrarily you apply it to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians only to force them to deny. If our Religion were evill, without doubt wee ſhould flie to deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the ſame maner as criminalls doe, and you would be forced to draw confeſſions from us by the force of torments; you ſay you doe not think your ſelves obliged to ſeek by tortures the proofe of the evill we doe, becauſe you certainly beleeve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the name Chriſtian carries enough with it of all crimes. But this pretence is not lawfull: for if a man be accuſed of murder, although you know well enough of what nature his crime is, yet you doe not content your ſelves with the confiſſion, but you force him to declare the order hee took to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; you doe not deal ſo with us, and the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your proceeding diſcovers viſibly your inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. You hold that to confeſſe the name Chriſtian makes us guilty, and you make uſe of violence to force us to retract it, in diſavowing the name of Chriſtian, we diſcharge our ſelves, at the ſame time of the crimes you impute to us becauſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. But I think you do ſo, becauſe you will not have us deſtroy our ſelves, wee whom you take for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59934:20"/>
execrable perſons: It may be you are wont to bid a murtherer deny the murther he is accuſed of, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne a ſacrilegious perſon to ſuffer more torments if he perſevers inconfeſſing his impiety. Now ſeeing you proceede not againſt us as againſt Criminals, its a figne you thinke us very innocent; Then ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is without doubt you will not have us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in this confeiſſion, whereas you know very well that condemnation is grounded on the neceſſity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on you to obey the lawes of the ſtate, and not on the rules of juſtice. A man cryes out in the midſt of his torments, and ſaith, I am a Chriſtian, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares openly what he is; you would heare from his mouth what he is not. You are reſolved, purpoſed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to draw the proofe of the truth by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the accuſed, and of all other men, but there are none but we of whom you ſtrive to heare lies. You ask me (ſaith one of us) if I be a Chriſtian, and I anſwer, I am. Why endeavour you to corrupt me by force of tortures? I confeſſe and you torment mee. What would you doe if I ſhould deny? when thoſe that are guilty proteſt they are innocent, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not the truth from their words; and you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us ſo ſoone as wee ſay wee are not Chriſtians. Certainely this unjuſt affection which ſo unhapplly troubles your reaſon, is to be ſuſpected, and ought to make you thinke ther's ſome ſecret violence that workes in your minds, and makes you proceed in our cauſe againſt the order and nature of judgement, and alſo againſt the Laws. If I bee not deceived the laws command us to diſcover, and not conceale of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenders
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59934:21"/>
in withdrawing them from puniſhment, it or daines that thoſe who confeſs themſelves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be condemned, and not abſolved.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the rules eſtabliſhed by the authority of your Senate, and cuſtome of your Princes: theſe are the maximes which are in uſe in the exerciſe of the power whereof you are miniſters; for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your magiſtracy is lawfull, and not Tyrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Tyrants are accuſtomed to add tortures to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary puniſhments to render them more cruell: but as your pollicy is full of humanity, you make no uſe of it, but force the accuſed 10 confeſſe. Keepe this Law in its vigour, and ſtretch it not further then its bounds; its neceſſary to draw confeſſion from the mouth of criminalls, but if they prevent its rigour men muſt not uſe it, there remaines nothing in this caſe but to judge and puniſh it. Puniſhment eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the laws is a debt which they are bound to acquit, and whereof its unjuſt to diſcharge it after it is confeſt. Indeed wee ſee nojudge that ſtrives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to ſave a wicked perſon. Neither is he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have a will to it; and from thence it comes in order of judgement wee doe not force men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. You believe a man cannot make profeſſion of Chriſtianity without being tainted with all ſorts of crimes; without being an enemy to the Gods, to Princes, to the lawes, to good manners, and to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that a Chriſtian cannot be acquitted unleſs he denyes himſelfe to be a Chriſtian; you force him to deny that you may acquit him, which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly tobetraye the juſtice of the lawes. What
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59934:21"/>
would you have him deny he is guiltie that you may make him innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, even againſt his wil, &amp; that a man cannnot after impute to him what is paſt to render him criminall? tell us what motion inſpires you with an affection ſo, unreaſonable? and from whence comes it you reſolve not to believe him that volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily confeſſeth rather then the party that denyes what hee is accuſed of by conſtraint: This laſt being forced in his judgement mayſpeake againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and keeping in his heart the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, after hee is abſolved, deride you at the ſame time you come to judge him, becauſe of the partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity you ſhew in maintaining your opinions at the charge of juſtice. Now ſeeing you treat us in every thing otherwiſe then criminalls, and your onely end is to make us foregoe the name wee beare,(and wee undoubtedly relinquiſh the ſame if wee doe what they doe who are not Chriſtians) you may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend we are not guiltie of any wickedneſſe: that our being named Chriſtians is our onely crime, that his appellation is unjuſtly proſecuted by the motions of a raſh and blinde hatred, whereof the firſt effect is to take from men the deſire of knowing certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the things which they know they have no aſſured knowledge of at all. So they believe all that is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt us, although they ſee no proofes, and they will not let our lives be enquired after, for feare a lawfull proceeding diſcover onely the things they will not have to bee believed to bee true, and they take occaſion to condemne this name, which is the object of their hatred, on the onely confeſſion wee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59934:22"/>
make as if the confeſſion of the name were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the conviction of thoſe crimes, they attribute to it without any other ground then their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. Then as our contention is but a contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a name, they torment us when wee confeſſe it, they puniſh our conſtancy, and acquit us when wee denie it. But after all, when you pronounce ſentence againſt a Chriſtian, why doe you not declare ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of his condemnation then that hee is a Chriſtian? Why ſay you not hee is guilty of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of inceſt? that he hath committed all other crimes imputed to us by your ſelves. It ſeemes there are none but wee againſt whom you are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to pronounce judgement under the notion of theſe execrable actions. If the name of Chriſtian bee not a name of naughtineſſe, then what you attribute to it is nothing pertinent, it being the name onely, and not any wickedneſs that name importeth, Which you finde fault with.</p>

               <p>BUt is it not a ſtrange thing, that the hatred, wherewith this name is purſued, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner blinds the minds of moſt men, that when witneſſ the probity of a Chriſtian, they mixe in their diſcourſe as a reproach that he hath embraced this Religion? One ſaith, truly he of whom you ſpeake is an honeſt man, if hee were not a Chriſtian, and his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59934:22"/>
life would bee free from blame. Another, doe you know ſuch a one who had the reputation of a wiſe and diſcreet man, he is lately turned Chriſtian? and there is no body reproves and ſhewes them it is more to the purpoſe to reaſon thus: Therefore ſuch a one is an honeſt man, or this who is ſo wiſe and modeſt hath got theſe rare qualities ſince making profeſſion of Chriſtianity: or elſe, ſuch like men make it appeare viſibly they are Chriſtians, becauſe they are wiſe and vertuous, they prayſe the thing they know, and blame what they know not, and corrupt the purity of handſome actions, whereof eye-witneſſes, by the oppoſition of a quality whoſe merit is unknowne to them, although it is more juſt to judge of things that appeare not, by thoſe that appeare; then to ground on hidden things the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of thoſe which are apparent. There are others found that keeping company with thoſe they knew before they were Chriſtians to bee vagabonds, infamous, and wicked, now prayſe them, who obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the irregularity of their life paſt. Theſe people by an extreame blindeneſſe of hatred, ſpeak to the advantage of the name Chriſtian when they ſtrive to render it odious. For ſay they, how pleaſant and of what a good humour was that woman? How ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and joviall was that man? Its pity they ſhould bee Chriſtians. So they impute the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their lives to the profeſſion of Chriſtianity. Some of them alſo purchaſe the averſion they carry againſt the name Chriſtian which wee beare, with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59934:23"/>
the price of what is moſt precious to them, rather deſiring to loſe the ſweetneſs of life, tranquility of minde, and all ſorts of Commodities, then to ſee in their houſes that which they hate.</p>
               <p>A man who heretofore had his minde full of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, can no longer endure the company of his Wife, what aſſurance ſoever he hath of her Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, after once he perceives her to bee turned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and parts from her now when her actions (full of modeſty) have extinguiſhed all ſuſpitions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was heretofore moved.</p>
               <p>A Father, who of a long time endur'd the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his heatheniſh Son, reſolves to take from him the hope of ſucceeding him in his inheritance, for turning Chriſtian, when at the ſame time exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his commandements without murmuring.</p>
               <p>A Maſter that us'd his Slave gently, when his carriage gave him ſome cauſe of diſtruſt, now puts him farre from him, for that a Chriſtian, when hee hath moſt aſſurance of his fidelity. It's committing of a crime to correct the diſorders of a mans life, by the motions of a holy converſion to the Chriſtian faith; and the good which is produced by ſo happy a change, workes not ſo powerfully on the mindes of men, as the hatred they have conceived againſt us. Indeed this hatred is ſtrange; and when I conſider that the name of Chriſtian onely makes it to bee ſo, I would willingly know how a name can bee crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and how a ſimple word can bee accuſed? Me thinks a word cannot be condemned, unleſs it be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, or expreſſeth ſome evill ſpeaking, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59934:23"/>
ſome unchaſt thing, and of ill report. The word Chriſtian drawes its, originall from that of Unction; it is the name that the ſon of God our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter tooke, to ſhew he was the King of the faithfull, and the high Prieſt of the new law. And when by an ill pronuntiation you change the ſignification of this name, (for one need but heare you ſpeake it, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover you know it not) it is a name compoſed of ſweetneſſe and goodneſſe; ſo you hate men whoſe actions are full of integrity, and a name that hath nothing of evil in it, did one ever ſee an opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned becauſe of the name of its author? What wonder were it if they that give themſelves to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline take the name of him that taught it? Are not Philoſophers by the reaſon of the name of their Sects called Platonicks, Epicurians, and Pithagori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? and in conſideration of the places of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies Stoicks and Academicks? and doe wee not ſee Phyſitians borrow that of <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi>? the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians that qf Ariſtarchus? and the Cookes alſo that of famous Apicius? Let none thinke it ſtrange that both the one and the other beare the name of their Author, ſeeing they glory in following their Doctrine, and in embracing their diſcipline which was left them. Indeed the name of a Sect cannot bee condemned, if it be not vicious, and it muſt be made knowne that a Doctrine is evill, and alſo that the Author is wicked, to make the name of them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous which make profeſſion of it: for it cannot bee, unleſſe it bee becauſe of the vices of the Sect, and of him that made it. Therefore before you hate our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59934:24"/>
name, you muſt know the worthineſſe of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the knowledge of our Author, which is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: or elſe inquire of the conditions of our maſter, by a holy ſearch of the things hee taught us. But you will know neither the Religion which you perſecute, nor the excellent quality of its Author: You are content to inveigh againſt the name, and to contend with it: a ſimple word is all the ground of the injuſtice you doe to a Religion, and the Author Of a Doctrine you know not; and there is ſo much prejudice in your mindes, that you condemne this law and its Author, onely becauſe of the name, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being convinc't by the force of a lawful convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>I Have hitherto inſiſted in oppoſing the injuſtice of the publicke hatred wherewith wee are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: I am now to treat of the point of our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; and therefore will not onely refute the things they object againſt us; but returne the ſame upon themſelves who caſt them upon us, that thereby they may know Chiriſtians defile not themſelvs with crimes ſo impudently laid to their charge, by thoſe who cannot bee ignorant that Chriſtians are guiltleſs therof. In regard wherof, I wonder they bluſh not (wicked people as they are) at the raſh accuſations they charge us withall; I will not ſpeak
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59934:24"/>
againſt: good men, but only ſuch as themſelves, who aſperſe us for criminals.</p>
               <p>I will touch in particular all they ſay wee doe in private, and from whence they take occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us as wicked, ſuperſtitious perſons, worthy the infamy of puniſhment, and in concluſion objects of laughter and contempt, and make it appeare our Enemies commit the ſame publickly every day. But becauſe your laſt refuge, when you ſee truth on our ſide diſcovers all theſe impoſtures, is to make uſe of the authority of the Lawes againſt us; and have ordinarily in your mouths, either that it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted you to examine anew what they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, or your oath injoynes the neceſſity of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame; that is, whether you will or no, and by conſtraint you preferre what they will have you, before the knowledge of the truth; I am firſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſeeing the Lawes are under your protection, to ſpeake to you of the obedience due unto them. I ſay then, when you pronounce theſe words with too much rigour unto us, <hi>your Religion is forbid by the Laws,</hi> and by an inclination contrary to humanity condemn us with an unlimitted power, without ſuffering us to juſtifie ourſelves: you act with violence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a power full of tyranny. Certainly you abuſe your authority, when you determine the Chriſtian Religion ought not to be ſuffered, not indeed becauſe it ought not to be ſuffered, but becauſe you will not ſuffer it.</p>
               <p>If Juſtice bee the Rule of your Judgements, and if reaſon makes you condemne a thing which ought
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59934:25"/>
not to bee condemned; without doubt that onely ſhould be forbid which is wicked, from whence it follows, what is good ſhould bee left to the free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of all men. If I finde that to be juſt your Laws forbid, is it not true, this forbidding of yours obligeth me not at all, and contrarily, that I am bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it, if condemning that which is evil? And won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not if I accuſe your Lawes of errour: it is man hath conceived them, they that made them failed not a little: your Laws have not been eſtabliſhed by the infinite Wiſedome of God.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder to take notice that men may bee deceived in making a Law, and therefore upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſideration with themſelves, they have confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their errour, in condemning that they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved? Know wee not that the <hi>Lacedemoniaus</hi> ſweetned the ſeverity of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> Lawes, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate them to civill ſociety: at which the great Law-giver was ſo diſpleaſed, that hee voluntarily quitted his Countrey, condemned himſelfe to dye, and to advance his death, deprived himſelfe of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment for life? and falls it not out every day, that the experience you have got in doing juſtice, ſerves you for a Candle, and glittering light to diſſipate the darkneſs of antiquity, to beat downe before you this thorny Wood of the ancient Lawes? I might ſay, you clear the confuſion that would inſue thereupon, by the authority of the new conſtitutions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours?</p>
               <p>A little while ſince have wee not ſeen <hi>Severus,</hi> a Prince indued with comely gravity and rare wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59934:25"/>
to have changed certaine things of the Papic Lawes, although their old age was never ſo vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? Lawes that forc'd the People to put their children into the world, before the Age ordained by the <hi>Julian</hi> Lawes to contract mariage, and which ſhewed them ridiculous, in taking thought with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary care for the birth of men.</p>
               <p>There were alſo Lawes that permitted Creditors to cut in pieces the bodies of their Debtors, when deſtitute of meanes to pay what was due to them. But theſe Lawes are aboliſhed, and the following Ages by a more feeling humanity, have univerſally condemned this cruelty as too barbarous. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted the poor from capital puniſhment, but not to leave them without chaſtiſement imprinted ſhame in their foreheads, by ordaining their goods to bee publikly ſold, that their infamy might be publick in like manner, chooſing thereby rather to make bloud aſcend into their faces, then to let it out of the bodies of ſuch poore men.</p>
               <p>How many other crimes doe you thinke there are in your State, whereof you know not the injuſtice, and which deſerve to be corrected? Surely, ſeeing equity is the onely object all Laws ought to propoſe; Laws themſelves are neither for the number of years or dignity of their Authour, but for the only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the equity and juſtice that is in them for to bee commended. So that when once wee know they are deſtitute of this ſo neceſſary a condition, we have reaſon to neglect them though they have ſuch authority, and condemn thoſe which accuſe them of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59934:26"/>
injuſtice. But it is not enough to ſay your Laws are unjuſt, we muſt adde they are impertinent, and raſh when they puniſh men for their Names ſake onely, as thoſe are that are publiſhed againſt Chriſtians; if it bee true, Lawes ought to puniſh actions, if in reſpect of all other perſons they will have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to be grounded on the proofe of the fact, and not on the name of the accuſed: Is it not a ſtrange thing that in our Cauſe they take onely the name we beare to puniſh us for the crimes they impute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us? I have committed inceſt, why require they not my life for the ſame? I have kill'd a Childe, how comes it to paſſe, they extort not from mee the confeſſion of theſe crimes by racks, and tortures? I have offended the Majeſtie of the gods, and the Prince (ſay they) why is not my, defence heard to know if I have where with all to juſtifie my ſelfe with reſpect to thoſe crimes they accuſe me of? There is no law forbids mee to examine that which is liable to condemnation, neither doth a judge juſtly inflict puniſhment, unleſſe he findes the accuſed to have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt the publicke ordinances. Neither can a Citizen give the obedience that hee ought to the law, unleſſe hee know of what nature the action is which, it puniſheth. It ſufficeth not the law bee good in it ſelfe: but ſo it muſt be knowne alſo from thoſe from whom it expecteth obedience. For that is to be ſuſpected which will not let us trie whether or no it be juſt: but without all apparent proofe of its equity will abſolutely have what it condemneth to be executed. Such a Law cannot but be wicked.</p>

               <p>But (to ſay ſomething of the originall of the Lawes you oppoſe againſt us) there was an ancient Law that forbad introducing new ceremonies into Religion, as worshipping ſtrange Deities, unleſs approved by the Senate: this was an inviolable and unalterable Law to which the Prince or Emperour himſelfe was ſubject. <hi>Marcus AEmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> knew what his power was, when he would have had divine honours rendred to his Idol called the god <hi>Alburnus,</hi> but he could not obtaine the ſame. A ſtrange thing, and advantagious for our part againſt you I that the gods with you muſt depend upon the approbation of men: if men like not God, hee ſhall no longer be a God; and man muſt now be propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to God. It was by vertue of this Law the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Tiberius</hi> (under whom the name Chriſtian began to be made famous) propounded to the Senate to receive among the number of their gods, Jeſus Chriſt, of whom he heard great miracles had been done, from the intelligence given him by thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders under him <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> the place where Chriſt our Maſter firſt Preached the myſtery of his Divinity.</p>
               <p>This Prince witneſſed at firſt, that he enclined to ordaine for him the honour he rendred to his other gods: the Senate rejected the propoſition, and would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59934:27"/>
not approve of a God they did not know. <hi>Tiberius</hi> remained firme in his reſolution, and threatned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to thoſe that went about to accuſe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>Read your ancient Records: you ſhall finde there <hi>Nero</hi> the firſt of all the Emperours that perſecuted our Religion, when it was in its birth: which much redounded to our glory, that this Monſter ſhould be the firſt of all others that condemned us; for whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew his life, muſt needs judge it could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, but what he condemned was moſt highly to be eſteemed.</p>

                  <hi>Domitian</hi> (whoſe cruelty made up that of <hi>Nero's</hi>) did ſometimes reſolve alſo to moleſt us: but as his thoughts and reſolutions were contrary to humane condition, his minde of it ſelfe turned to render, us the peace he had taken from us, and to recall thoſe Chriſtians he had baniſhed. In briefe, we were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perſecuted, but by Prince, whoſe actions were full of injuſtice, whoſe minds of impiety, and whoſe manners of ſhame and infamy, never perſecuted of any but of thoſe whoſe lives your owne ſelves are wont to condemn, and whoſe odious governments oblige you to revoke their judgements, in re-eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing innocents which have beene ſo miſerable as to be the unhappy objects of their fury. Princes who by their vertue got the love of the people, have not been our enemies; and of all the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding this State till now, and that had any ſenſe of Piety and Religion towards your gods, or whoſe conduct was animated by the ſpirit of humane wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59934:27"/>
you cannot name one that perſecuted the Chriſtians. On the contrary, it will bee found, the Emperour <hi>Marke Aurelius,</hi> a very wiſe Prince, was our Protector; if you ſee the Letters hee writ tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the extreame incommodity his Army ſuffered whilſt he made war in <hi>Germany,</hi> you ſhall finde hee there witneſſeth, that the prayers of the Chriſtian Souldiers in his Troops, obtained from Heaven that favourable raine which quenched the thirſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>This Prince reſolving to make acknowledgement of their affection, and the good will they bore him; and yet not purpoſing to infringe the authority of his Predeceſſors, did not publickly diſcharge the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from the puniſhments enacted againſt them, but rendred their power uſeleſs in the ſight of all the world, another way, by ordaining their Accuſers to be inflicted alſo with the extreameſt puniſhment. Conſider then a little what force theſe Lawes ought to have, where none made uſe of them againſt us, but theſe Emperours that are defamed with all manner of impietie, injuſtice, villany, cruelty, lightneſs, and folly: which <hi>Trajan</hi> fruſtrated in part, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to inquire after Chriſtians which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver confirmed by an <hi>Adrian,</hi> a Prince curious of all rare and excellent things, by a <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Judea,</hi> by an <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> nor by a <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>: If our lives were wicked, as is ſuppoſed, we ſhould not feare affliction from wicked Princes, becauſe Companions of their Vices, but rather pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to bee inflicted upon us from them who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59934:28"/>
make profeſſion of honeſty, whom being vertuous we might ſooner feare to become our enemies and ready upon all occaſions to ſeeke meanes to diſturbe us.</p>

               <p>BUT I could wiſh theſe men that appeare ſo religiouſly, and ſo zealouſly obſervant of their owne Lawes, and ſo ſevere defenders of things inſtituted by their Anceſtors, would anſwer to the demands I ſhall make them; namely, whether they have kept their Faith inviolable? whether rendred the honour and obedience they ought to the good Rules left them by their fore-Fathers? whether there are not ſome Laws that have loſt their power and authority among them? whether they have not paſſed beyond the bounds preſcribed by ancient ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity? or rather not baniſhed from their policy all that their Fathers judged neceſſary and convenient to eſtabliſh a good government? what are become of the Laws which cut off Luxury, ſuperfluous and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious expences? which commanded what we ſpent at a Feaſt ſhould not exceed five ſhillings? that would have us ſerve up but one Hen at a meale, and that not a fat one neither? which forbad a Senator entrance into the Senate, who had in his houſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty markes of ſilver; (as if in that alone one might juſtly ſuſpect he would ſeeme too magnificent) that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59934:28"/>
would over throw the Theatres after newly ſet up, ſuppoſing the uſe of ſhewes would not ſerve but to corrupt manners? which would not ſuffer any man raſhly and without puniſhment to uſurp the emblems of great dignities, belonging to perſons of noble birth?</p>
               <p>But now I ſee ſuperfluity gives names to Feaſts, they call them <hi>Hundreds,</hi> becauſe of s;o many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crownesſpent at ſuch Feaſts. They alſo draw out of the Mines ſilver to make Baſins, not onely for Senators but Free-men, and thoſe that not yet come to obtaine their freedome, yea that ſcarce exempt from the miſeries of ſervitude: I ſee it is not enough in open Theatres to content the eyes of the People, but by drawing vaſt Covertures over, they arme themſelves againſt the injuries of the Ayre, to fulfill their pleaſures by the objects of thoſe infamous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations. For they imitate the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who were the firſt that tooke care to ſee publique Playes at their eaſe, and covered themſelves with large and heavy Gownes for feare leſt during the winter, they ſhould catch cold, in injoying their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt and unchaſte pleaſures. I ſee no difference between the women of honour, and thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous and lewd; they obſerve not any longer thoſe holy inſtitutions of former times, that injoyned wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to have ſpeciall care of modeſty and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. When a woman wore no more gold then that on the finger ſhe put the Ring her Husband gave her the day ſhee was married, to bee the gage of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall Faith. When it was ſo abſolutely forbidden
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59934:29"/>
women to drink Wine, that there was one that her neare Kinſman cauſed to be ſtarved, becauſe ſhe had broke the ſeales wherewith his Cellars were ſhut up; and under the reigne of <hi>Romulus</hi> one <hi>Mecenius</hi> killed his Wife for the ſame cauſe, and was abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for it.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was eſtabliſhed that they ſhould kiſs their Parents, that they might judge by their breath, if they had offended againſt this Law. Where are now thoſe happy Mariages, and good maners, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ſuch a perfect harmony, that we have ſeen neare ſix hundred years ſince the foundation of this City paſs, without hearing ſo much as a divorce once ſpoke of in any one family onely?</p>
               <p>Women now a dayes have never a part of their bodies which bows not under the weight of the gold they weare: a man cannot kiſs them without ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Wine they drinke; and wee are fallen into thoſe times, it ſeems, that people marry onely to be repudiated, and divorce is the fruit of marriage: But this is not all, for as religious as you will appear in the obſervation of the ancient inſtitutions of your Fathers, you have revoked what they ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſerious deliberation concerning the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of your gods. The Conſuls with the Authority of the Senate, baniſhed, not only from the City, but alſo from all <hi>Italy</hi>; Father <hi>Bacchus,</hi> with all ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies done in his honour; <hi>Piſo</hi> and <hi>Gabinius</hi> were not Chriſtians, and yet during their Conſulſhip, they forbad to place in the Capitoll, <hi>Serapis, Iſis, Harpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erates,</hi> and that Image which had the head of a dog,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59934:29"/>
that is to ſay, they put them away from the Palace of the gods. They tooke from them their divine honours, and cauſed their Altars to be beat down, that the diſorder of vaine and diſhoneſt ſuperſtitions might be reſtrained.</p>
               <p>You have re-eſtabliſhed all theſe gods in the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they had taken from them, and make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of honours due to the higheſt Majeſty knowne by mortals. Tell me where is your Religion? where the reverence you owe to your fore-Fathers? you render your ſelves unlike them, in your habits, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of living, manners, opinions, and laſtly in your very words &amp; language? you always praiſe antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and every day, receive new things: ſo that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from you as much as is poſſible, the laudable inſtitutions of your Anceſtors, and as for the things that are eſtabliſhed, you keep none of them, but what deſerve not to be kept. There is moreover, this in it, for I will ſhew preſently that by a negligence, that injureth the authority of your fore-Fathers, although you have ſet up againe the Altars of <hi>Serapis,</hi> that by your means this god might be no more a ſtranger at <hi>Rome,</hi> and have preſented your ſacrifices to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whom you cauſe to be worſhipped in <hi>Italy,</hi> you have no more this great affection to the worſhip of the gods, which antiquity held ſo unfortunate an error, and ſo ſtrange a blindneſs; you your ſelves deſtroy the Religion your Fathers taught you, whileſt paſs for its faithfull protectors, and accuſe Chriſtians principally of being guilty of impiety towards them; yet notwithſtanding I muſt juſtifie our profeſſion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59934:30"/>
from the infamy of the hidden crimes which they object againſt it, that I may prepare a way, to arrive at the point which concernes the actions we doe in the ſight of all the world.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <p>I Say then, the crimes pretended againſt us, the horror whereof makes us paſs for wicked in the opinion of the people, are, that wee meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſacrifice a childe; after we have taken away his life by a barbarous ſuperſtition, we devoure his body, and when devoured the fleſh of this Innocent, we commit inceſts. They adde, we have Dogs who ſerve to overthrow the Candles, and doing the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of theſe infamous Merchants of modeſty, make us loſe all ſhame in taking the lights from us, and covering our actions under the vaile of darkneſs, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens us to ſeek the uſe of ungodly and ſacrilegious pleaſures.</p>
               <p>But ſo it is, we are not guilty, ſave in the diſcourſe you make concerning us. It's a long time ſince you imputed to us all theſe things, and though you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us of them everyday, yet you make not much inquiry to know the truth thereof. If you take us to be faulty, why make you not proceſs againſt us as criminals? but ſeeing you have not as yer convicted us by a lawfull proceeding, you ſhould not have ſuch an evill opinion of us; and certainely that which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59934:30"/>
moves you to uſe diſſimulation in what concerns us, tells you wee are unjuſtly accuſed. Therefore is it you dare not undertake to informe againſt us, and when you give the Executioners the order they are to obſerve in tormenting Chriſtians; you command them to draw from their mouthes; not the confeſſion of what they are, but the diſavowing the Religion they profeſs.</p>
               <p>Now (as wee have already ſaid) the doctrine which we follow, began from the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Tiberius</hi>; from its beginning it hath drawne on it the hatreds of men: it hath met with as many enemies, as it hath found people in the darkneſs of Idolatry; even thoſe who ought to have received it: The Jewes, to whom it was revealed, are ſet againſt it, by a ſpirit of jealouſie , becauſe it would deſtroy their Law. Soldiers in their uſual perſecuting us are accuſtomed to be againſt it, &amp; our domeſticks becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our adverſaries by an evill inclination of nature, have beene the firſt that made war againſt it. From thece it coms, that every day we ſee our ſelvs beſieg'd, we are betrayed at every inſtant, and very often they take us in our Aſſemblies. This being ſo, I ask when did it fall out, that ever any one ſurprized us at the ſame time, when a Childe having the knife ſet to his throat, gave forth his laſt crye before we cut his winde-pipe aſunder? was there any that finding a Chriſtians mouth bleeding, as of the Cyclops, and the Cyrenes after ſuch a deed done by us, preſented it to the Judges? Who among you ever diſcerned in his Wite any ſymptome or token of unchaſtity, after
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59934:31"/>
our Religion at any time ſincerely imbraced by her? Is it poſſible our Enemies ſhould hide ſuch ſtrange crimes as laid to our charge, after once diſcovering us to be faulty therein? or that they that take ſuch a pride in perſecuting and dragging us before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of juſtice, ſhould be corrupted in our behalfe? you ſay we doe nothing but in obſcurity: if it bee as you ſay, tell us, when knew you wee did what you accuſe us of, and in whose power it was to give you the certaine knowledge of it? it's not likely you had it from the mouthes of them you judge guiltie: for all Myſteries are to be kept ſecret; and to partake of them as we ought, the Law of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is faithfully to be obſerved by us. Men uſually ſay nothing of the myſteries of <hi>Samothracia</hi> or <hi>Eleuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>: How much rather ought they to bee carefull, not to reveale thoſe which would excite againſt them, were they knowne the rigour both of humane and divine juſtice.</p>
               <p>They are not Chriſtians it ſeems then, that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves unto you; and if not Chriſtians, then muſt they be people of different profeſſion, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of their actions. But how ſhould ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples knowledge bee informed in thoſe myſteries to be laid open by them, ſeeing even the ceremonies where piety preſides puts away the profane, and ſuffers no ſtrange witneſſes, unleſs they will have it ſaid, Chriſtians are impious, and the wicked feare leſſe to be ſeen then the good. So you muſt confeſs you know nothing of our doings, but by common bruit, uncertain proofe, of the weakeneſs whereof
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59934:31"/>
there is no man ignorant? Is there any who knows not the nature of it? One of your Authours ſaid, ſame is the ſwifteſt of all evils? why thinke you call they it an evill? is it becauſe of its ſwiftneſs? or becauſe its principall office is to diſcover hidden things? or that it often declareth lies; indeed it hath this evill quality, even when reporting ſomething of truth it cannot forbeare to mingle the ſame with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or falſhood. Truth never paſſeth purely through fames mouth, either ſhe adds ſomething to, or takes ſomething from, or makes ſome notable change in it: beſides, ſhe hath alſo this fault, her credit laſts no longer then ſhe lies: ſhe hath no life, but ſo long as ſhe certainly proves nothing: ſo ſoon as make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident her proofe, ſhe ceaſeth to be any longer Fame, whoſe property is to make relation of nothing but what's not certainly knowne: ſo ſoone <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s delivered for certaine, the aſſurance of the thing delivered ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds immediatly into its place, as being no longer a bruit, but a knowne and profeſs'd truth. At what time and when ſuch a thing is known, we ſay not it's ſo reported, or ſo the bruit goes, but ſo or ſo it is without doubt.</p>
               <p>For example, we uſe to ſay, ſuch a man hath got ſuch a government, in ſuch a Province, when wee know certainly hee hath got the ſame: and when not, it is ſo famed, or ſo reported. After we are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a thing, we make no more reekoning of Fame, which is an expreſſion of doubt and uncertainty. So there are none but fools ground themſelves upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; wiſe men believe nothing but what is certain,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59934:32"/>
and what time alſo hath verified on her behalfe. And certainly, as generall and diffuſed as ſame may bee, what beliefe ſoever ſhe hath got with men, and with what aſſurance ſoever they eſteeme her, wee muſt alwayes conſider ſhe had a beginning ſince ſhe hath paſſed through divers tongues and eares, which have given her the vogue ſhee hath in the world. Her originall is ordinarily weake and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but together with all her faults ſhe authoriſeth and covers all that is added to her from her birth, because no body mounts up to the ſourſe, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himſelfe to know whether or no the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the relation thereof began with a lie: which falls out often, either through hatred to them ſame teares in peeces, or liberty uſurped to make evill judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon ſimple ſuſpitions, or the pleaſure ſome take in lying, a pleaſure not new among men, and to which many are ſo naturally inclined. But God be thanked, time reveals the truth of all things; it is a ſentence wee have from you, and whereof wee make uſe againſt you, the eſtabliſhed order of nature cannot ſuffer any thing long to remaine hid: but in the end makes that appear which fame had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Judge then if it be as reaſonable you ſhould ſtill perſecute us ſeeing after ſo long time ther's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bare report to informe you in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the crimes we are ſuppoſed to commit, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proved againſt us by you, but her reſtimony which is ſo much the more evill, becauſe ſhee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet prove what ſhe bath heeretofore invented to make us appeare odious, and which for ſo many
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59934:32"/>
yeares ſhee hath affirmed upon the opinion onely of certaine men.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>IT is not enough to ſhew you the weakeneſſe of the proofes you imploy againſt us, I will make knowne our innocence by your own judgement, to overthrow the opinion you have conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our life: I demand but the teſtimony of nature, who is your mother as well as ours. Suppoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians promiſe Eternall life, as a recompence for all theſe crimes ſo full of horrour: You may believe it if you liſt, but I would alſo know, if after perſwaded by ſuch blacke actions a man might merit Heaven, you would bee ſo barbarous as to deſire it at ſuch a rate. Can it be imagined one ſhould ſay theſe words or the like unto you? come on hither, die your ſword in the bloud of a Child, I ſay in a Childs bloud whoſe tender age ought to have no enemy, who cannot be guilty of injuring any body, and whom every one with a fatherly Love ought to cheriſh.</p>
               <p>Or if the charge of ſhedding a Childs bloud bee committed to another, can it be ſuppoſed we ſhould uſe this diſcourſe unto you? Be preſent at the bloody death of an infant who meets with the end of his life in the beginning of his dayes, ſee a ſoule depart out of a body ſo ſoone as it came in, take this blood
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59934:33"/>
newly animated, dip your bread in it, and fill your ſelfe with the ſubſtance thereof. Againe, while at Table, marke well where your Mother, and Siſter, are ſeated, that you may not faile to find them out, after they are left in the darke, by dogs overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Candles, conſequently extinguiſhing the lignt. For you muſt know, you cannot but be faulty if you commit not inceſt. If profiting by theſe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, you ſquare your Faith by the practiſe of ſuch actions, aſſure your ſelfe you ſhall receive ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. Anſwer me now, would you to get this never fading ſelicity do things ſo contrary to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity? If nature it ſelfe be of force ſufficient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert your owne minds from acting ſuch irregular courſes, you cannot I perſwade my ſelfe, be induced to believe that other men would bee faulty therein: Yea though yee certainly believe this the onely way to eternall happineſſe. I dare ſay you would not by ſuch meanes ſo barberouſly difile your ſelves; no neither if you had any ſuch deſire, have the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to performe the ſame. Judge then of us by your ſelves, and know wee can no more commit theſe crimes then you, or if wee can, your ſelves as liable thereunto as we.</p>
               <p>But what do you thinke our judgements different form yours? that Chriſtians of another race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind then you are? do you take us for the <hi>Cynocephales,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sciapodes,</hi> Monſters of <hi>India</hi> &amp; <hi>Lybia</hi>? do you believe we are made otherwiſe then other men, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of our bodies otherwiſe diſpoſed and by a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageneſſe more then the moſt brutiſh of all people,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59934:33"/>
us onely to feed on blood, and violate the Lawes of nature, in the uſe embracements which it forbids? Certainly if believe theſe things of Chriſtians ther's ſom what in it that you ſhould doe ſo, we are men as well as you: And therefore if your ſouls abhor ſuch like actions, you ought not imagine us in regard men as well as Chriſtians, to commit them. You ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge theſe crimes contrary to nature: but you ſay we deceive them who know us not; as if the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies you invented againſt the Chriſtians were not publicke or any could be ignorant thereof. That which all the world knowes cannot be diſſembled, and thoſe who have embraced the Law of Jeſus Chriſt, take not this reſolution, without well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it: but after all things exactly pondered they finde we are innocent of the crimes wherewith they accuſe us. Beſides, its a common uſe, that thoſe who will be inſtructed in a Religion, adreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the cheiſe Prieſts, to learne of them what they ought to prepare that pertake of his myſteries. Then if it be true, Chriſtians are guilty of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, there's no doubt but the Prieſt, whoſe charge is to receive him who would bee inſtructed, ſpeakes to him in this manner: Friend, you muſt be carefull to provide a childe that is yet in the innocence of his firſt age, who knowes not what death means, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth at the ſight of the knife that muſt cut his throat.</p>
               <p>You muſt have a loafe to put under the wound to receive the bloud which runnes from it. You muſt make proviſion of Candleſticks and Lamps: You
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59934:34"/>
muſt bring Dogs; which when you throw meat to them to eat out of the reach of the ſtring where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with tied, the deſire of filling themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with may excite them to make ſuch a leape, that they overthrow the Candleſticks to which they are tied, and by this means put out the lights: but firſt it is neceſſary you cauſe your Mother and Siſter to be preſent. Yea, but how if they wil not conſent to it? If he hath neither Mother nor Siſter? If no kindred that would be a Chriſtian, can he not be received? and theſe relations of Brother or Son, are they eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the qualitie of Chriſtians? I ſay more, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they have all theſe things ready, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing thoſe who have no knowledge thereof: one cannot denie but they learne preſently what is done in their Aſſemblies; and yet they remain firme, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turning unto Chriſtianity they complaine not of being deceived: but you ſay they feare to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, if they diſcover the evill they have done. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, if any be found that call for the publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt Chriſtians as againſt impoſtors, there would be none but would ſpeake in their behalfe. Moreover, if the actions of Chriſtians were ſo dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable as you make the, thoſe whom they ſhould ſo abuſe, would rather expoſe themſelves to death then live with the remorſe of ſo criminall a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But after all, ſuppoſe they feare to accuſe themſelves, how comes it they perſervere ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and keep their religion in the midſt of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions? for men are not wont to tie themſelves with ſuch conſtancy to a profeſſion, which they had

               <p>A juſt puniſhment, and which theſe miſerable creatures ſuffered in the view of the Souldiers, in the Countrey of my Nativity, who ſerved the Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Emperour in the execution of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.

Ever ſince men made him a god, he continually receiveth the offering up of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents unto him from the hands of their owne Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who by an unlucky ſuperſtition, making ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to their gods, take away the lives of them to whom they had given the ſame; who voluntarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged themſelves to this impiety; and who in this action where their owne Children were the victims ſacrificed by them, entertained them with flatteries, not without any feeling of compaſſion, fearing the myſtery might be interrupted, it they ſuffer not their throats to be cut without ſhedding teares. Tell us a little, whether the crime of murther you impute to us, be not farre beneath that of Paricide, which your People are guilty of? The Gauls offred on the Altars of <hi>Mercury,</hi> men which had attained to their full ſtrength or age of perfection.</p>
               <p>I Paſſe by the fables of the horrible ſacrifices that were offered up in the Temple of <hi>Diana Taurica,</hi> as matter fitter to be repreſented on Theatres. There is alſo in this ſo religious a City, and Temples of the Pious off-ſpring of <hi>AEneas,</hi> a <hi>Jupiter</hi> in honour of whom they make playes, where they ſhed humane
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59934:35"/>
bloud, by Combates with men and wild Beaſts. You tell me, you expoſe none but thoſe that are already condemned to dye. Alas, what then? Is it not the ſhedding of humane bloud, to ſhed the bloud of theſe miſerable creatures? But this ſacrifice, is it not much more deteſtable, then the bloud of the wicked which is preſented to a God? whatſoever excuſe you may ſeek for, this truth remaines alwayes certaine, that this bloud which you offer, is the bloud of a man, whom you have cauſed to be cut in pieces, and you cannot accompliſh your vowes without committing murther.</p>
               <p>Certainly, your <hi>Jupiter</hi> much reſembles <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: for he thirſts as much for bloud, as you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Maſter loves to ſee it ſhed, and as he is the onely Son of his Father; which you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge could never bee, had not <hi>Saturne</hi> a cruell heart.</p>
               <p>Let us paſſe now form murthering children in ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, to other kinde of wilfull murthering by their Parents; (for in what manner ſoever they take away their childrens lives, it is alwayes murthering them, although not alwayes alike hainous:) I will then addreſs my ſpeech to all Idolaters: how many are there among you, O ye people, that are this way greedy of the bloud of Chriſtians? and alſo among you, O ye Magiſtrates, that after you appeare ſuch great Juſticiers by the ſeverity you treat us with, whoſe conſciences I would ſtrike with true reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of having procured the death of your own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? yet if you did but ſimply put them to death,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59934:36"/>
it were ſomewhat; but by a ſtrange exceſs of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you throw them into the water, you expoſe them to the rigour of cold and hunger, and the rage of dogs: you will not take their lives away with the ſword, becauſe too gentle a death, and which men of the age of diſcretion had rather ſuffer, then any other that hath violence in it.</p>
               <p>As for us that are Chriſtians, homicide is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly forbidden us, by vertue whereof, it's likewiſe inhibited us to deſtroy that which the Mother hath conceived in her womb, though yet but bloud, and deliberating (as I may ſo ſpeake) in the preſence of nature, whether or no it take the forme of man: It's a committing murther before hand, to deſtroy that which is to be born; and as much evill in hindring the birth of a ſoule, as in plucking it out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy when it is borne: that which ſhould come into the world being a man, and the fruit already in the ſeed which produceth it.</p>
               <p>As for that cuſtome, ſo full of inhumanity, to drinke bloud, and to feed on ſuch tragick meats, you may read further in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> it being he, as I think, who reports, that certaine Nations aſſembling to ſweare Treaties, were accuſtomed to draw bloud from their Armes, which preſenting one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they drank ſolemnly.</p>
               <p>There paſſed ſome ſuch thing in the conjuration of <hi>Cateline.</hi> They ſay alſo among the <hi>Scythians,</hi> in certaine Families they that are neare alli'd uſe to devoure the bodies of their dead kindred: but wee need not goe ſo far; we have among us the uſe of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59934:36"/>
theſe barbarous ceremonies. The Prieſts of <hi>Bellona,</hi> ſhedding their owne bloud, and conſecrating it to their Goddeſs, after putting it in the palme of their hand, give it to thoſe who participate with them in their myſteries. In the publick ſpectacles of the combats of the Gladiators, they that are ſubject to the falling ſickneſs, ſeek their cure by the practice of a Remedy worſe then the Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeeing the bloud of theſe wretched creatures newly ſlaine; they receive the ſame while running from their wounds, and to obtaine their healths, fill themſelves in ſuch a bruitiſh greedineſs, with the ſubſtance of theſe poore people, who are men as well them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>What ſhall wee ſay of theſe that make whole meals meats of theſe poor creatures (before key-cold) kill'd upon the place of combate, and aske at the ſame time for a piece of the wild Boare, and of the Stag lying dead alſo upon the place? a piece of that wild Boare, which having torn in pieces his aſſailant, whilſt they were yet in the encounter, licked up the bloud flowing from his wounds; againe a piece of that Stag, even yet ſweltring in the gore of the Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator whom he pierced with his horne: The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo aske for the intrails of Beares, which are full of the bodies of men they have devoured; ſo men fill themſelves with fleſh nouriſhed by that of men. As for you that cat theſe meats, how much are your meales different from the meales of Chriſtians? But what judgement ſhall all one give of theſe who by a bruitiſh concupiſcenſe make impure meat for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59934:37"/>
of that which contributeth to the birth of men? are they leſſe guilty then others, becauſe they devour the ſubſtance of the living? can one ſay in the filth to which they abandon themſolves, there is no humane bloud, becauſe the matter they ſuck in is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with bloud is made? Theſe people eat not onely children, but men, old enough to put other men into the world.</p>
               <p>Certainly it muſt needs bee, theſe diſorders with you, ſhould make you bluſh before Chriſtians, who as you know, eat not the blood of any creature, and for that reaſon feed not on the meat of any creatures ſtifled, and abſtaine from that of beaſts which have not been ſlaine, for feare they ſhould have the leaſt bloud that is, even that dri'd up or yet remaining in the fleſh of the ſtrangled beaſt to defile themſelves with.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon alſo, you offer them puddings made with the bloud of beaſts when you trie them, being well informed, that what you ſuppoſe they ſin moſt in, if they accepted thereof, is moſt ſtraitly interdicted them. Is it poſſible, think you, we thirſt after the bloud of men, when you know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we abhorre the bloud even of beaſts? This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot enter into your mindes, unleſs having taſted of the one and the other both, humane bloud ſeems to you the moſt pleaſing.</p>
               <p>But if perſwaded Chriſtians inhumanly devoure this bloud, how comes it to paſs you make not uſe thereof to trie them? you ſhould offer them mans bloud, as uſually you offer them incenſe-fire: They'l
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59934:37"/>
ſoon diſcover themſelves in not taking this drinke from your hands, as when refuſe to ſacrifice Incenſe; and thereby you may have this advantage of two ſeverall proofes to condemne them with; namely, their refuſing to taſte mans bloud, and their not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up Incenſe to your gods.</p>
               <p>The criminall juſtice you execute upon ſuppoſed offenders will furniſh you this way with bloud e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to convince all manner of Chriſtians brought before you. But to ſpeak of the crime of Inceſt, who ſhould a man ſooner ſuſpect to be guilty of this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, then thoſe to whom the greateſt of their gods (to wit, <hi>Jupiter</hi>) hath given an example? The <hi>Perſians</hi> (as <hi>Creſias</hi> reports) mingle themſelves inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly with their owne Mothers. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> it ſeems are not exempt from this ſin, in regard the mocking complaints <hi>Oedipus</hi> makes in the Tragedy of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> becauſe of the Inceſt he had committed with <hi>Jocaſte,</hi> in laughing to ſee him ſo afflicted, they ſaid, goe fight generouſly, and overcome your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As for you, if open but your owne eyes, you cannot but take notice, that Incontinence, whoſe ſlaves you are, nouriſheth you with diſorders, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately precipitating you into this ſoule crime: for you expoſe your children to the open aire by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them from you, that paſſengers having more compaſſion of their hard deſtiny then your ſelves, might bring them up, or elſe make them over to be adopted by other Fathers of a better diſpoſition then your ſelves: Now it cannot be, but in time you loſe the knowledge of your bloud, which you aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59934:38"/>
to ſtrangers, and when once for want of this knowledge, begin to offend the errour in which you ſo imprudently ingage your ſelves, increaſing by courſe of yeares, your care will perpetuate it ſelfe with the vice of its inceſtuous beginning. And truly your luſt accompanies you in all places where you goe: it remains with you in your houſes: it leaves you not when you travell; it paſſeth Sea with you, from whence it falls out you loſe no opportunity ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling your concupiſcence, it's very difficult not to meet in ſome places of the World with perſons that know not your birth, and theirs have the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and that deſcended of the ſame kinred and lineage that you are. It's alſo very hard, leaving your ſeed all the world over, it produceth not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto you which by the commerce men have one with another, are joyned to you, or yours, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous conjunction, and thereby mingling your bloud with that of your neer kinred, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame.</p>
               <p>As for us, the chaſtity whereof wee make exact profeſſion, and which wee keep with greateſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, will warrant us from theſe accidents, and as inable us againſt incontinency, by living purely in the eſtate of marriage, preſerve us from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſin of Inceſt.</p>
               <p>Yea, there are many among us, who to avoid theſe diſorders, with greater prevention, vow to God their virginity, which they happily keep till the extremity of old age, that (as it were) renders and renewes unto them the innocency of their firſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59934:38"/>
yeares. Certainly, if conſider you your ſelves guilty of theſe crimes imputed by you to Chriſtians, you would preſently confeſſe that they are innocent. The light of your owne underſtanding could not butcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your ſelves and acquit them at one and the ſame inſtant. But it falls out ordinarily, by the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of a double blindneſs, that they who ſee not that which is, imagine they ſee that which is nor. I will ſhew you by and by the truth of this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all things, but ſpeake firſt of thoſe which are more manifeſt.</p>

               <p>YOU ſay we doe not worſhip the gods, nor for the welfare of the Emperours offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices unto them. The one of theſe two crimes whereof you accuſe us, muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon the neck, or in conſequence of the other: for being reſolved to render no manner of worſhip to your deities, wee muſt neceſſarily bee reſolved in like manner, not to ſacrifice to their Altars, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our ſelves, or for what perſon ſoever it be. Hereupon you conclude us guiltie of ſacriledge and high treaſon, which is the upſhot of what you charge us withall : and the argument moſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of all other, whereof you accuſe us. And truly it well deſerves to be examined, becauſe the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our innocence wholly depends, thereon: the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59934:39"/>
judgment I ſay of our guilt or innocence in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that neither prejudice nor injuſtice pronounce the ſentence: not prejudice which upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons refuſeth to heare, nor injuſtice which by all means refuſeth to allow of truth when ready to bee alleaged in our defence: We ſay then, we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted from honouring your gods, ſince the firſt time we knew them to bee no gods. That which to bee expected by you from us, is, wee prove thoſe you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore as gods, to bee no gods, and therefore unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the worſhip you render them: for it is true, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhould be due unto them, if they were true dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and Chriſtians were puniſhable, if this title of a god appertained unto tnoſe whom they refuſe to adore, for the opinion onely they conceive they are no gods. But you adde, they are your gods: in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereunto, we appeale from your words to your Conſciences: We are willing they both judge and condemn us, if it can be maintained your gods have not been men as well as your ſelves; if it be denied, we will convince it of falſhood, by the teſtimony of antiquitie, which ſhewes us the Cities where they were born, the Countries where they left Monuments of their actions, and places where they were buried.</p>
               <p>I will not ſtay to ſpeake to you of all particularly: there is too great a number of them, new, old, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, Greeks, Romans, Strangers, Captives, gods that are particularly adored in each Province, thoſe that are knowne in <hi>Greece</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> males, and females, gods of Countries, and gods of Cities, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring and Warfaring gods. It were to loſe time
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59934:39"/>
to repeat what may bee ſaid of every one of them, I will onely ſpeake of them in groſſe, not to make you know them, but to recall your knowledge by remembring their beginning, which it ſeemes you have forgot.</p>
               <p>You have never a god ancienter then <hi>Saturn</hi>: from him begins all that Deity to which you addreſs your Vows, at leaſt the principall and the moſt known: That which you ſay touching his originall, may fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough be applyed to thoſe deſcended from him. If believe written Books, we ſhal find that neither <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus Siculus</hi> nor <hi>Tallus,</hi> nor <hi>Craſſus Severus,</hi> nor <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Nepos,</hi> nor any other ancient Hiſtorian, have ſpoke of <hi>Saturne</hi> otherwiſe then of a man. If ſeeke for proofes drawn out of publick Records or monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we cannot meet with faithfuller, or more certaine then thoſe we have in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelfe, where we learn, that <hi>Saturn</hi> after many Voya ges landed in this Province, while comming from <hi>greece,</hi> and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there by <hi>Janus</hi> or <hi>Janes</hi> (as the <hi>Saliens</hi> will have it.) The Mountaine where he dwelt was called <hi>Saturnien</hi>: the Citie hee founded carries even untill now, the ſame appellation, and in concluſion all <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> after that of <hi>Oenotirian</hi> was called by his name. It was hee who firſt found out the invention of Tables and ſigning or marking money with the Image of Princes, from whence it comes, that the publique Treaſure is placed by you in his Temple: Now if <hi>Saturn</hi> were a man, hee was the Son of another man; and being his Father was a man, you cannot ſay he was the Son of Heaven, and Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59934:40"/>It is an errour proceeding from hence when <hi>Saurn,</hi> ſo cal'd, that his original was not known, and becauſe they knew not of what race hee was, they eaſily fell to this beliefe, that he had for his Parents Heaven and Earth, the which a man juſtly may ſtile the parents of all Mankinde: for who is he that for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence or honours ſake, calls not Heaven and Earth the Father and Mother of us all? or elſe they had this thought of <hi>Saturn,</hi> namely, that as men are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſay of thoſe they never ſaw; till comming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them on a ſudden, they are come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Saturne</hi> in perſon thus ſurpriſing the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the places where he firſt landed, paſſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a Divine perſon, the vulgar calling them Children of the Earth, alſo whoſe originall is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uncertaine to them. I could tell you people in theſe times were ſo groſſe, that if a man not wont formerly to bee among them, ſhewed himſelfe to them, they were moved with it in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if they had ſeene a god. Which ought not ſeem ſtrange, leeing now adaies, the wits of men are ſo refined, that at preſent put them in the number of the living gods, who a little before by the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a funerall pomp, you knew to bee onely dead men. Enough of <hi>Saturn,</hi> although but a little ſpoken of him. Wee will ſhew now that as <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Son of a Man, hee was Man alſo, as well as his Father, and all the diſcent of your gods mortall, and of the ſame condition with thoſe, of whom taking their Birth they are deſcended.</p>

               <p>BUT becauſe you dare not deny your gods have lived as men, to the end you may juſtifie the worſhip given by you unto them; you ſay, their deities were eſtabliſhed unto them after death: let us then examine the cauſes that ſhould raiſe men up into this glory.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you muſt grant a greater God then them, a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer upon which the power of your gods depends, as of their Soveraign, a god who made thoſe your gods of mé, by endowing them with a divine nature; for of themſelves they could never attaine this qualitie which was not in them, neither is there any but hee who had it of his owne nature, that could give a part thereof to them to whom it did not appertaine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally: That if there were not a God, who gave this divinitie to men: if not, acknowledge this principle Author; it would be but in vaine to think they were made gods after they ceaſed to live here on the Earth as men. Briefly, had they had the power of making themſelves gods, they would never have been born men, and ſubjected themſelves to mortality, while injoy they might the poſſeſſion of a far more excellent condition.</p>
               <p>Then if there bee a chiefe God that makes gods, I returne to the ſearch of the cauſes which ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him, being the chiefeſt, to communicate to men
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59934:41"/>
this high Majeſtie: and I finde none unleſs wee ſay this chiefe God had need of their miniſtry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to exerciſe his functions more perfectly: But it's an injuring the Authour of all things, to thinke he needed the help of any one living, much leſſe ſhould imploy to ſo excellent an end the miniſtry of dead men. This wiſe providence could not but well foreſee ſuch an aſſiſtance would be neceſſary to him for the time to come, and in this foreknowledge it had been more convenient for him to make gods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant to himſelfe from the very beginning, then ſtay the end of theſe mens lives ſubjected to mortalitie, whom he purpoſed to make his fellow gods.</p>
               <p>But I ſee no need God Almighty had to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gods; for what manner of thought ſoever wee have of this world, whether it bad no beginning and was never made, (according to the opinion of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>) or that there was a time when it had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; was made, (according to the opinion of <hi>plato</hi>) the eternall Wiſdome at the ſame inſtant doubtleſs when he formed it, foreſaw by an abſolute &amp; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable exquiſiteneſs all that was neceſſary for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof; he who gives perfection to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, could not be imperfect to himſelfe, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting help from <hi>Saturn,</hi> or any other of <hi>Saturns</hi> race to adde ro his perfection.</p>
               <p>Men would be thought to be very ſimple if from the beginning of time they believed not both raine to have fallen from the Clouds, ſtarrs to have darted out their beames from Heaven, light to have ſhone, Thunder to have made a noiſe, and <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelfe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59934:41"/>
to have trembled (as it were) at the terrible roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Thunderbolts put by God into his hands. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Earth produced all ſorts of fruits before <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Ceres</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> lived, yea before thoſe whom you make your greateſt Gods raigned upon the Earth. That which ſerves to entertaine the life of man is as ancient as himſelfe, providence giving him a being, I gave him at the ſame time all things whereof hee ſtood in need; and men could not have invented any thing more for their preſervation, then what was before: let them not ſay therefore they are the Authors; but onely after finding out the ſame, when created before by God that taught others how they ſhould make uſe thereof, which preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſuch things were before ſuch, as they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their uſe. And from thence followes the glory or honour thereof is not to be attributed to men, but to him to whom they themſelves owe their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. If <hi>Bacchus</hi> were put in the number of the Gods, becauſe hee firſt taught men to plant the Vine, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they have ill treated <hi>Lucullus</hi> in not making him a god alſo, he being the firſt who planted Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-trees in <hi>Italy,</hi> brought by him from the Kingdom of <hi>Pontus</hi>; for they ought alſo to have made him a god, as Author of a new fruit, becauſe he firſt gave them knowledge of it. Wherefore ſeeing from the beginning all wee ſee dono in the Univerſe, hath beene done before, as likewiſe all things ordayned to certaine functions of their nature, this firſt reaſon, for which ſuppoſe God communicated his deity to men is rendred of no force becauſe the ſame facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59934:42"/>
you give to each of your Gods inventing, were from the beginning of the world created by God, and ſhould never have ſeaſed to bee, or to produce their excellent effects, though you had never eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed thoſe your gods. Seeke yee therefore ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon for mons being ſacrificed unto, as unto gods, by ſaying that deifying them is the reward of their eminent vertues. From whence I ſuppoſe you muſt grant that this God that makes other Gods, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns by the rules of exact juſtice, and diſtributes not ſo noble a recompence raſhly, without meaſuring his liberallity, and conſidering the merit of thoſe whom he calls to his glory. I will therefore examine theſe mens actions whom you now adore as gods, to ſee if they be of a condition that render them worthy to bee liſted up to Heaven, or not rather (which as a man would thinke) ſhould have caſt them headlong into the bottome of Hell, a Priſon (as you ſay ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) wherein the wicked are ſhut up, to receive the puniſhment of their crimes. A place where (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your opinion) thoſe are impriſoned who have baniſhed from their hearts the naturall Piety that Children ought to ſhew towards their Parents; a place whither thoſe are confined who commit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſts with their ſiſters, who corrupt married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, raviſh Mayds, defile themſelves with boyes, uſe all manner of violence or outrage, kill, ſteale, and deceive their neighboures, and who (to ſhut up all in a word) by their vices, are like ſome of your gods; for you cannot make appeare one of them was ever exempted from all manner of faults, unleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59934:42"/>
him to bee at any time man. But you muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, your gods have been of the condition of men, becauſe the actions you attribute to them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth they were ſubject to ſuch diſorders, as are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the weakneſs of our nature, and tokens I ſay which permit not, wee can be perſwaded that after death they ſhould be ſtiled gods.</p>
               <p>In a word, if wont to puniſh thoſe who ſuffer themſelves to be carried away with theſe diſorders; if as many of you as are people any good manners, avoid the commerce, converſation, and ſocietie of vicious and infamous perſons, thinke you, God hath called you to poſſeſſion of his Deitie thoſe whom they reſemble? or if any ſuch matter believed by you, how comes it to paſs you condemn criminals? you that adore the companions of their crimes? the juſtice you ſeem to exereiſe in this world, ſerves not in heaven but for a ſubject of mockery, and deriſion. If render your ſelves conformable to your gods, you muſt aſcribe divine honours to the wickedſt of all men, it being an honour to thoſe gods you adore, to make gods of men moſt like unto them in all maner of abhominable filthineſs.</p>
               <p>But to omit ſpeaking any further of things ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of divine worſhip, I could wiſh ſo long as they lived here below, they had been of better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, had paſſed their dayes here in perfect integrity. How many nevertheleſs of better reputation then theſe whom you worſhip for gods, have you left in Hell? have you not there put <hi>Socrates</hi> ſo renowned for his wiſdome?

all poſteritie for his juſtice? <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> who was ſo excellent a Souldier? <hi>Alexander,</hi> who by his high, enterprizes made himſelf ſo great and terrible? <hi>Policrates,</hi> who was ſo happy? <hi>Craeſus</hi> who poſſeſſed ſo much riches? and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> whoſe eloquence was ſo admirable?

Certainly, God who knowes perfectly the merit of men, being to have his divine nature, communicated to mortall men, would have thought his graces with more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie diſtributed if hee had ſtayed for the death of theſe perſons to make gods of them.</p>
               <p>But it may be he made too much haſte, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon after he had taken the men whom you adore, to be partakers with him of his divine Majeſty, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Heavens doores, could not call thither any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe faire ſouls in the mean while going down to Hell; where murmuring againſt his injuſtice, by their complaint, from thence they make him ſtill bluſh with ſhame enough unto this day.</p>

               <p>NOT inſiſting on theſe things any longer, I will ſhew you the true condition of your gods, and thereby demonſtratively make it appeare that indeed they were never gods. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

whom to ſay what I have heard and read, I find nothing at all but the names of certaine men long ſince dead, fabulous reports of what they did in their life time, and thereof compoſed myſteries made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to mock the common-people withall. As for the Images you adore, that which ſeems to me moſt ridiculous, is, they are made of the ſame matter that other Veſſels, wherewith you are ordinarily ſerved: or rather of your moveable goods you make gods, by your conſecrating them, and thereby chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the uſes whereunto at firſt ordained by the help of Art; alſo you give them another form, then what they had, and of the matter thereof compoſe figures which you call gods: which workes cannot without much abuſe and wronging the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be done by you.</p>
               <p>From whence nevertheleſſe we that are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may take occaſion of comforting our ſelves with reſpect to thoſe evills your gods cauſe us to ſuffer, ſeeing the ſame you make them endure before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from you the titles of gods. So wheras you tye Chriſtians to Croſſes and peeces of wood; have you any image that in making thereof hath not been firſt fixed to ſuch like ſtakes before compleated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a ſhape, as thought fit by you to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in? you hang us up as publick ſpectacles unto all men upon Gibbets. Is it not on a Gibbet that the Maſſe or body of thoſe things you call gods is ſet up before worſhipped by you? You pearce our bodies with irons, and when forming your gods of wood, uſe you not the like violence with Sawes, Chiſſels,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59934:44"/>
and ſuch like iron inſtruments upon each member of them alſo? You cut off our heads, and your gods have no heads till after faſtened by you to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with Soder, Ciment, and Iron Cramps.</p>
               <p>You expoſe us to the rage of wild beaſts, and are they not ſuch beaſts you make to keepe company with, <hi>Bacchus, Cybele</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> men carving or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them therewith? You throw us into the flames, and have not your gods beene tryed therewith when of a ſhapeleſſe matter, the Smiths hand formed them into a Comelier figure out of the fire? you condemn us to worke in mines, and is it not from thence your Gods made of ſilver and gold fetch their originall? you confine us to Iſlands, and have not ſome of your gods taken their birth, and others their death there? If any divinity in theſe things, it will follow, men conſecrate theſe they puniſh, and that puniſhments are imbraced inſtead of gods. But in truth your gods neither know the outrages men do unto them, when they work upon their Statues, nor the honours they render them when adore and preſent ſacrifices to them.</p>
               <p>Moſt vile and prophane Wretches, that ſpeak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort, that dare utter ſuch blaſphemous words (ſay you of us) in reproach of our gods, bee as angry and fume with rage as long as you liſt, whatever ſay, you are they that have approved the workes of <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> though inveighing more eagerly though penn'd with much more vehemence againſt this your ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.

and whereof the beaſts know their inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; our reſolution that proceeds but from the light of truth, which coming to inlighten our minds, makes us renounce your errour. Is it not worthy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of praiſes, then of the torments wee ſuffer? Is it poſſible we can offend them whom wee know very well that they are not?

            <div n="13" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <p>BUT you ſay the gods we offend are your gods; if it be ſo, from whence comes it, that by your actions you ſhew your ſelves impious and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious towards them. I will maintaine it you undervalue thoſe whom you take to bee your gods, you overthrow their Altars at the ſame time you are thought to reverence them, and detract from the glory thereof when you would appeare to be ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Examine what follows, and ſee whether I ſay the truth.</p>
               <p>Is it not ſo that ſome among you adore certaine gods which others adore not? you cannot deny but you wrong thoſe gods whom you render no honour to: the preferring of ſome gods neceſſarily implieth the neglect of others, becauſe when of two things we chuſe one, it's certaine we reject that we chuſe not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59934:45"/>
and conſequently neglect the ſame. So you deſpiſe the gods you know not, and teſtifie you feare not to offend them, in denying them the worſhip where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you honour other Deities.</p>
               <p>But (as we have touched upon before) the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each of your gods, depends upon the appro bation of men. Hee is not a god whom your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, while not approving of, refuſeth to owne as God.</p>
               <p>As for your domeſtick gods (ſtiled of you by the names of Lares) you diſpoſe of them even as of your other houſhold or domeſtick goods, pawning, ſelling, and changing them upon all occaſions, as your ſelvs liſt: of a <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> you make goods for your Kitchin, when theſe Images are ſpoyled and broke with old age, in having too long time recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved divine honors: or elſe if you find your ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated in your affaires, you make money of them to help the neceſſity wherwith you are preſſed, in which you finde more holineſs, then in your gods, ſeeing you preferre it before the worſhip you render them.</p>
               <p>You uſe the gods of the publick no better, then thoſe private Lares made uſe of. You imploy the authority of juſtice to proſtitute them; you put them into the Book of the publique revenew, and let them out to thoſe that offer moſt for them, even as you are wont to farme thoſe incomes that are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Capitol and Market. A Crier publiſheth the prices of a Deitie, and in pronouncing what you judge it to bee worth doth it ſolemnly, and in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59934:45"/>
ſame forme as all other things prized by you; a Treaſurer keeps Regiſters of the price of the Farme of a god, as of the price of all other farmes. It ſeems Land charged with tribute is of leſſe value, then Land not ſubject to any duty; a man that is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a perſonall tax, is not noble, as a man that is exempted from it; for theſe charges are markes of ſervitude.</p>
               <p>Contrarily, among the gods thoſe which pay a greater tribute are not moſt to be adored, but rather thoſe to whom men have the moſt devotion, render a greater tribute then others. They make a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full commerce of the Majeſty of the gods: they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Images even into Ale-houſes, that Religion may began Alms there: they take money for their entrance into the Temple, &amp; for the place they occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py there: one cannot make uſe of the gods freely, and their myſteries are not exempted from ſale alſo. But what doe you in honouring them, you doe not alſo practice in celebrating the memory of dead men? you erect Temples and Altars both to the one, and the other, their Statues have the ſame Ornaments; You dreſs up thoſe for men according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of their age and condition: you obſerve the ſame thing of the gods.</p>
               <p>What difference is there between the Feaſt made in honour of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and Feaſts of the Funerals of the dead? between the Veſſels out of which they powre Wine in ſacrifices, and thoſe they uſually offer to the ſhades of the dead? between the <hi>Augure,</hi> and he that hath the charge of the Graves? For hee doth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59934:46"/>
the Office of an <hi>Augure,</hi> in Funerall Ceremonies, yet we muſt acknowledge you juſtly place your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours after dead in the number of the gods, ſeeing whileſt they lived you conferred this honour upon them. Your gods are obliged to you, and they ought to thank you, becauſe of their Maſters you make them their equalls: But whereas you attribute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour unto <hi>Larentina</hi> a Common Whore, I Would rather adviſe you to worſhip among your <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no's, Ceres, and Diana's: Lais</hi> or <hi>phryne</hi> after the ſame manner. You erect a Statue to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> with this Inſcription, This is the Statue of a Deity. You make a Deity of I know not whom, of one that hath been bred with infamous education, and proſtrated to the lewdeſt pleaſures, even thoſe which Nature her ſelfe abhorres; albeit your gods of old (being of the ſame ſtamp) were no better then ſuch, yet they take themſelves nevertheleſs to be fouly reproached by you when uſing libertie to worſhip the aforeſaid men and women with what ever divine rites your ſelves liſt, you give the ſame honour to others of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter edition, which was wont anciently to be aſcribed onely unto themſelves.</p>

               <p>I Will now ſay ſomthing of the rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of your Religion; not inſiſting much on the condition of your ſacrifices, where the beaſts you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59934:46"/>
offer are the oldeſt and worſt you can find: when your ſacrifices are fat and well fed you keep the beſt of them; and offer to your gods, onely unprofitable peeces cut off from ſeverall parts, and accuſtomed to be given by you in your houſes, to ſervants or dogs. Even as of the tenth part of your goods vowed by you to <hi>Hercules,</hi> you preſent him but with a third on his Alters.</p>
               <p>Imagine not that I blame you at all for this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily its an action of wiſdome mee thinkes to keep part of what would be intirely loſt. But that which I thinke ſtrange is this, the Bookes wherein inſtructed in worldly prudence, and from whence you draw the knowledge of all duties touching a civill life, are they not filled with impertinent and ridiculous tales concerning your Gods. In thoſe bookes its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the gods have ſought one with another, as the <hi>Gladiators</hi> in favour of the <hi>Trojans</hi> or <hi>Greekes</hi>: that <hi>Venus</hi> was hurt with the ſhaft of an Arrow, drawne by the hand of a man, when ſhe would have pulled her ſon <hi>AEneas</hi> from <hi>Diomedes</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt kil'd her. That <hi>Mars</hi> remained thirty months in irons wherewith chained. That <hi>Jupiter</hi> by the help of a certaine monſter was ſaved from the ſame violence the other gods would have made him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they preſent him ſhedding teares for the death of <hi>sarpedon,</hi> ſometimes they figure him in the infamous embraces ot his ſiſter, telling him of his adventures and aſſuring him that the love hee bore towards his miſtreſſes was not comparable to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59934:47"/>
that of theirs to him. After all, who is hee among your Poets, to flatter ſome Prince, invents not ſome unworthy thing of your gods? One will have <hi>Apollo</hi> employed in feeding the cattle of King <hi>Admetus</hi>? Another ſpeakes of <hi>Neptune</hi> as of a Mercenary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to <hi>Laomedon</hi> to build the City of <hi>Troy.</hi> There is a Lyrike Poet (<hi>pindarus</hi> by name) who writes that <hi>AEſculapius</hi> was ſtrucke with thunder, for abuſing his knowledge of Phyſicke, by covetouſly making uſe thereof, to hurt rather then reſtore men unto their healths; wherein <hi>Jupiter</hi> was too blame, if <hi>Jupiter</hi> it be that hath command of the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts, for ſhewing ſuch cruelty towards his granchild, ſuch envy towards the Author of ſo excellent and uſefull a ſcience But truly theſe things are of ſuch a condition that men who would bee thought Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhould neither relate them if they were not true, nor invent them if they were falſe. <hi>Tragicke</hi> and <hi>Comicke</hi> Poets are not more reſpectfull of your gods: in regard that uſually, when making mention of them in their interludes they ſpare not to ſpeake of their diſorders. I will ſay nothing of your Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. <hi>Socrates</hi> may ſuffice for all, who in deriſion to your falſe Gods, calls an Oak, a Buck, and a Dog, for witneſſes of the oathes hee made. But <hi>Socrates</hi> ſay you was condemned, becauſe hee undervallued, and conſequently put a blurre upon the worſhip of your gods. I anſwer, truth hath beene in all times the object of the hatred of men. Yet the <hi>Athenians</hi> repented of the judgement they gave againſt him: they puniſhed thoſe that accuſed him, and placed in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59934:47"/>
their Temples his Statues made of the moſt precious of all their mettals. Now ſeeing they revoked his condemnation, without doubt they gave Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his innocence, and approved the opinion hee had of the gods. But your <hi>Diogenes</hi> hath he not ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed ſufficiently at <hi>Hercules</hi>? and <hi>Varro</hi> the Cynique of the Romans, bringeth he not in three hundred gods without a head under the name of <hi>Jupiter</hi>?</p>

               <p>ALL theſe Libertines who labour ſo much to delight you, draw their ſubject from diſhoneſt action attributed to your gods. When you ſee them play the Baffoones with ridiculous conceits out of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>Hoſtilius,</hi> tell me whether they be your jeſters, or your gods that ſtir up laughter: there you heare an immodeſt <hi>Anubis</hi> ſpoken of, a maſculine Moone, and a <hi>Diana</hi> that was whipt, there the will of a dead <hi>Jupiter,</hi> is recited there jeſts made of three hundred ſtarved <hi>Hercules's.</hi> Beſides all this, Comedies Tragedies expreſs all that is ſhamefull in the Hiſtory of your gods.</p>
               <p>There With delight you may heare the Sum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the misfortun of his off ſpring thrown down from Heaven. You may ſee there without bluſhing <hi>Cybele</hi> ſighing for a Shepheard that undervalued her: there you ſuffer to be repeated in ſongs before you, all the Encomions wherewith <hi>Jupiter</hi> is extolled for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59934:48"/>
his jewd pranks, and how <hi>Paris</hi> decided the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene <hi>Juno, Minerva,</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> But are they not certaine infamous perſons that are diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed With the viſages of your gods? Is it not ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fellow that appears on the Stage with a forced poſture, and an effeminate voice to repreſent a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> or <hi>Hercules</hi> unto you?</p>
               <p>Tell me, if in approving theſe ſacrilegious perſons by the commendations and applaudings you give them, you violate not the Majeſty of your gods, and prophane their Deities? But it may be whats repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Amphitheatre hath more modeſty and piety in it. It is there where your gods play their parts in the bloud of men, and horrour of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Their Hiſtories ſerve for an argument to the ſubjects which the guilty preſent there; and very often alſo theſe poore people doe truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the perſonages of your gods, by the paines they indure. Wee have ſometimes ſeen the ſecret parts of a miſcrable creature cut off for your god. <hi>Athis</hi> of the City of <hi>Poſſena</hi>; and ſometimes he that wore the habit of <hi>Hercules</hi> loſt his life for him in the flames. We have taken occaſion to laugh, to ſee <hi>Mercury</hi> in the midſt of the bloudy Spectacles, of the combats of the Gladiators, which are acted at Noone, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the dead bodies with his hot iron rod, to try if they be ſtill living. And <hi>Pluto</hi> conducts them with a hammer in his hand, to diſpatch them, if not already dead.</p>
               <p>If all theſe actions and many ſuch like, which one might finde out, bee injurious to the honour of your
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59934:48"/>
gods, and throws all their Majeſty to the ground, they muſt take it from the neglect which they have of their Deities, and of thoſe that commit it, and are the cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe all this is but jeſting: There are other things which your conſciences cannot diſavow, no more then that I have already ſaid; you make bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains for Adulteries in the Temples: you corrupt the chaſtitie of women before the Altars: you ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill your concupiſceces for the moſt part even in thoſe houſes which ordained for the Prieſts, and for the laying up of other holy things therin, having before your eyes the Pontificall habits, and the Incenſe ſtill fuming with the fire of the Sacrifices. This being ſo, I know not why your gods doe not more complaine of you, then of Chriſtians: Indeed, all that are found guiltie of ſacriledge are of your Religion: for (as you know) Chriſtians never enter, in the day time, into your Temples; it may be they would ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack them as well as you, if they offered ſacrifices, as you doe.</p>
               <p>But if you aske what Deity the Chriſtians adore? I anſwer, it is not hard to conceive, that they who render no worſhip to falſe gods, honour the true, they will not fall any more into the errours from whence they are delivered, when as they have received the light of the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and known the wickedneſs of Idolatry. Now I will begin to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the myſteries of our Religion, yet it ſhall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have refuted the falſe opinions you have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it.</p>

               <p>SOme among you have fancied the god we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath the ſhape of an Aſſe. It importeth that I diſcover the originall ſource of this fable: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that raiſed this ſuſpition of us, is in the fifth Booke of the Hiſtory of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mention of the warre that <hi>Titus</hi> had with the Jewes under the Empire of <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> he takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to relate the Hiſtory of this Nation, ſpeaking as he thinks good, of its originall, name, and Religion; and reports that the Jewes comming out of AEgypt, where they were baniſhed, as he believes, received great incommodities in paſſing the vaſt Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> becauſe they found no water, and as they were extreamly preſs'd with thirſt, they were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the rencounter which they had with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of wild Aſſes, who ſhewed them the Fountains where they went to drink, lying not farre from their Paſtures. And in acknowledgement of this benefit, they are reported to conſecrate the image of one of theſe Aſſes that then ſuccoured them in that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>I thinke this, tale makes it preſumed that the Chriſtians whoſe Religion is drawne from that of the Jews, and hath ſucceeded it, worſhip the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of an aſſe. Yet the ſame Author, who faith hee lies not, writes nevertheleſſe that <hi>Pompey</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59934:49"/>
the City of Jeruſalem, and entring into the Temple to ſee the myſteries of the Jewiſh Religion, ſaw there no image at all. It is likely, had they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any image to the Deity adored by them, they had repoſed it in the Sanctuary, where if ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to bee thought Idolaters, they could not bee diſcovered by ſtrangers, becauſe none but their own high Prieſt permitted to enter in, a vaile alſo being drawn before it, to hinder all others from prying thereinto.</p>
               <p>As for your ſelves its a thing you cannot deny you worſhip with ridiculous ceremonie, all beaſts of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then with their goddeſſe <hi>Hyppone.</hi> But peradventure it may not bee ſo well taken, that among ſo many worſhippers of all forts of creatures, we onely ſhould be thought to adore nothing elſe but aſſes. I come therefore to thoſe who are of opinion wee worſhip a croſſe alſo, and do not they the ſame thing they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve of us when they conſecrate their woodden ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. It imports not though it bee another figure, ſo it bee of the ſame matter: though the forme bee not the ſame, ſo it be the body of a God.</p>
               <p>What difference is there betweene the wood of the croſſe, and an Athenian Pallace, or a <hi>pharien Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> which are nothing but rough pieces of wood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapt, whereof the hand of the workman hath not formed an image? All images ſet upon their feet by you repreſent a part of the croſſe; and do not we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then you when wee worſhip the whole Godhead in Chriſt without a Croſſe? Moreover, thoſe taken by you for go<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s have beene in the begining caſt, as we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59934:50"/>
ſaid before in moulds made after the forme in ſom part or ſimilitude of a croſſe: beſides you conſecrate ſpoyles taken by you from your enemies: you rayſe up Trophies in honour of victory: and thoſe Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies what are they within but onely trees made by you into croſſes? The Roman ſouldiers in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is all martiall, adore the enſignes of their Emperour, they ſweare by their ſtandard, and make Deities of them, which they prefer before the majeſty of their other gods. Which Enſignes and ſtandards of theirs, however richly ſet forth, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cover'd over with cloth of gold, perhaps, or tiſſue, and the like, are all for the moſt part repreſented to the eyes under the forme or figure of a Croſſe. So that all the difference I finde between the Croſſe we honour, and you, conſiſts, it ſhould ſeem, in the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſneſs wherewith yours beyond ours is adorn'd. Wherein I applaud you for it, that you conſecrate not bare croſſes without all other manner of ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them.</p>
               <p>There are, that with more apparent reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Sun to be our god, theſe ſend us to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Perſians</hi>: But wee worſhip not the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Sun, as theſe people doe, who in a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſuperſtition carry it ordinarily painted on their Bucklers. Yet herein they ſuſpect us for ſo doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hearing when we pray, wee turne our ſelves to the Eaſt: Is it not true, there are many among you that doe the ſame, when making Oriſons to ſome other gods then thoſe Images of yours repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, proſtrate themſelves to the Sun-riſing, and in

               <p>The calumnies invented to cry down our Religion, ariſe to ſuch exceſſe of impiety, that not long agoe in this City, a Picture of our God was ſhewed by a certain infamous perſon that got his living by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the ſight of the people, wilde beaſts: who, by a ſtrange faculty gotten by him to avoid their bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, making uſe of his craft, ſhewed alſo the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Picture openly to all commers, with this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereon, <hi>This is</hi> Onochoetes <hi>the god of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>

We laugh at the barbarouſneſs of this name, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy of this figure. But they me thinks, ſhould rather worſhip ſuch a Monſter as this for a god, who for the preſent adore with divine honour ſuch like things: for example, an Image compoſed of two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent formes at the ſame time, having the head of a Dog, and Lion, joyned together; hornes reſembling

               <p>THe God whom we worſhip, is one only God, who created of nothing this great maſſe of the world, together with every thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Elements, bodies, and ſpirits therein are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and by the authority of his word, by the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable order which his wiſdom hath eſtabliſhed, and the vertue of his infinite power, hath produced this excellent worke to bee a worthy image of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: from whence it comes the Greekes have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a name which ſignifies ornament. This God though dayly to be ſeene, is nevertheleſſe inviſible; though graciouſly repreſented every where, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible; enough expoſ'd to humane ſence, yet indiſcernable. Becauſe ſuch a God, therefore is hee the true God. Ordinarily that which fals under the object of the ſight, which may bee handled, which the mind can underſtand, is leſſe then the eyes that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59934:51"/>
ſee it, the hands that touch it, the mind which maks it be known. Which things cannot be ſaid of God whoſe infiniteneſſe is onely indiſcoverable ſave to himſelfe. In regard whereof though not ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of men, yet is he nevertheleſſe not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the unknowne to them. Somthing of him men conceave, when conceave him to be beyond the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt reach of all human reaſonings; his immenſity at the ſame time diſcovering, when concealing. But heerein you miſtake principally in that you will not know him at all, becauſe you cannot know him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, or you will not worſhip him becauſe you will not know him, when at the inſtant you ſeem to a vow as much, you cannot be wholly ignorant of him.</p>
               <p>Well then, will you have us prove him by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſſe of his marvellous workes wherewith wee are encompaſſed, wherewith wee are preſerved, wherwith we are delighted, wherwith we are terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? Wil you have us convince you of your infidelity by the witneſs of your owne ſoule? you know in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite of the conſtraint ſhee ſuffers in the Priſon of her body, in the midſt of evill habits wherwith beſieged, with reſpect to the diſorders of vicious inclinations, and unchaſt deſires impairing her vigor, in this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of her condition, where ſhe ſees her ſelfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to falſe deities, when retire into her ſelfe, and takes up her ſpirits, as it falls out after ſhee comes from being cropſick (as it were) out of ſleep, or what ever diſtempers if retaining ſtil the uſe of reaſon, ſhe thanks God. This inward motion that maks you call on God, doth it not ſhow you that there is but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59934:52"/>
one God to whom truly this high title belongs? Is it not true that you all ſay God is great, God is good? and when you ſpeake of the good you receive from Heaven that God hath given, do you not alſo make this, God your judge, when you ſay God ſees all things, recommending your ſelves to God, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that hee will help you? in effect, theſe words which you have ordinarily in your mouth ſhew, that your ſouls are naturally carried to acknowledge a God, and conſequently that you are Chriſtians. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he that ſpeaks thus of God, lookes up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not to the Capitoll; for hee knows Heaven is the reſidence of the living God, as he knowes him to bee the Author of his life, and from thence to have deſcended.</p>

               <p>NOw as God is full of goodneſſe, hee would leave a means, whereby men might acquire a full and intire knowledge of the truth of his being, his lawes, and his commandements. He hath given the Holy Scriptures to inſtruct thoſe who will bee enlightened with the light of the true Religion, who deſire to finde it when they ſeeke it, who have intentions to believe in the word of one God, after they have found him; and to ſerve him faithfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have received the ſame. Therefore he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men to bee ſent upon the earth from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

of times, who by holineſſe of manners, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of their lives, have rendred themſelves capable of knowing and ſhewing his greatneſſe to others. He hath abundantly ſhed upon them the graces of his divine ſpirit, that they might preach, there is but one God who created this Univerſe; who is the true <hi>Prometheus</hi> that tooke man from the earth, who hath ordained in the world the change of ſeaſons, by which it ſubſiſts; who hath given tokens of the dreadfull rigor of his judgements by water, and fire, who hath publiſhed his Lawes wherein all hee would have men doe to pleaſe him are ſet downe, Lawes that you are ignorant of, or neglect; who hath ordained great recompences to thoſe that keepe them, who, at the end of the world, will rayſe all the dead, that ever lived from the Creation of the World, commanding them to reaſſume their bodies, to examine their good or evill actions, that thereupon gives to the faithfull a felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that hath no end, and condemne Idolaters and ſuch like, to eternal flames. We have heertofore been of your opinion, and then mockt at this doctrine, for men are not borne Chriſtians; they embrace this Religion after they know it. Wee ſay then, thoſe to whom God hath given this charge to preach, are called Prophets, becauſe they publiſh the things which ſhould come to paſſe: the oracles which they have declared, concerning the myſteries of that God which we worſhip, have been layd up in bookes, as in the publicke treaſury, where they have been kept till now.</p>

Wee called them heeretofore Hebrews, whom you now call Jews, and therefore their language was called the Hebrew tongue. The Jews to make knowne to ſtrangers the law of the true God, granted <hi>Ptolemy</hi> that which he deſired of them, and ſent him ſeventy two learned men to interpret thoſe holy bookes. Will you have witneſſes? the Philoſopher <hi>Menede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> who was a powerfull Protector of the opinion of divine providence, admired at what recorded in them, and in that point was of the ſame opinion with them. <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi> hath left a publicke monument of this hiſtory, in a booke hee compoſed in Greeke: Theſe Hebrew volumes are found at this day in the liberary of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> and the Jews read them openly,

               <p>THeſe holy Writings take their principall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from their antiquity. You are wont to make uſe of this proofe, and will have it to be lawfull in upholding your Idolatry, you ground the reverence you carry to your gods, on long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of years, but wee have more reaſon to make uſe of it then you; for the books of one of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets onely, to wit, <hi>Moſes,</hi> (wherein, it ſeemes, God hath incloſed, as in a treaſure, all the Religion of the Jewes, and conſequently all the Chriſtian Religion, preceding for many ages together) reacheth beyond the ancienteſt you have, even all your publick Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the antiquity of your originals, the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your eſtate, the birth of moſt part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the foundation of many great Cities, all that moſt advanced by you in all ages of Hiſtory, and memory of times, the invention of Characters, which are interpreters of Sciences, and the Guardians of all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59934:54"/>
excellent things: I thinke wee may ſay more, even your gods, Temples, Oracles, and Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>Have you heard mention made of that great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Moſes</hi>? He was contemporary with <hi>Inachus,</hi> he preceded <hi>Danaus</hi> three hundred fourſcore and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, the ancienteſt of all that have a name in your Hiſtories: He lived about a thouſand years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ruine of the City of <hi>Troy</hi>; I could alſo ſay, fifteen hundred and more before <hi>Homer</hi>: for it is not without ground, neither will I relate it, but as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have reported it before me. Every of the other Prophets ſucceeded <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet the laſt of them all, is of the ſame age as your firſt Wiſe-men, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers, and Hiſtorians were.</p>
               <p>The proof of theſe things are not ſo difficult, as it would be troubleſome, ſo hard as long to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent: wee muſt examine a great number of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, and Papers, put our ſelves to calculate the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell of times; open the Records of the ancienteſt of all people, namely, of <hi>AEgyptians, Caldeans,</hi> and <hi>phaenitians</hi>: make uſe of the teſtimonies of their Writets, who have left to poſterity the knowledge of things paſt; of <hi>Manethon</hi> an <hi>AEgyptian, Beroſus</hi> a <hi>Chaldean, Hierome</hi> a <hi>Phaenician</hi> King of <hi>Tire,</hi> and of them that followed after, <hi>Menedeſius</hi> a <hi>Ptolomean, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander</hi> an <hi>Epheſian, Demetrius</hi> a <hi>Phalerian,</hi> King <hi>Juba, Appion, Thallus,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the genuine and true Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the antiquity of the Jews, whoſe Writings either approve that which others have ſaid, or make known their errours.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt examine the publick Regiſters of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59934:54"/>
Greeks, ſee what actions they report, conſider when ſuch actions done, that the order of times may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and cleare the Hiſtories of the paſt ages, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them according to the ſequell of years; in concluſion, we muſt turne over the leaves and Notes of all the earth.</p>
               <p>But me thinks I have already made half the proof, in ſhewing from whence it ought to be taken. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is better to defer the ſpinning out this point any further; for feare that touching it in half, I ſay not all that importance thereof requires, or that in reſting here, I ſtay too long from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple meanes of our Defence.</p>

               <p>IF defer to ſhew the antiquity of holy Scriptures, I will ſhew you at perſent ſomething more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant in lieu thereof: for I diſcover to you their Majeſty, I tell you, they are divine, if you doubt ſtill they are ancient. There's no need of any long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion to let you know it, neither will we go to ſeek the proof without us. The World Hiſtory of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; the event of things do furniſh us; all don in our dayes was foretold here to fore, what our. Fathers heard ſpoken of arrived not till after them; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets whom the providence of God inſtructed touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time to come, have foreſeen &amp; left in writing that which paſſed every moment to the view of mor;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59934:55"/>
they have knowne what wee ſee, that Earthquakes ſwallow up great Cities; that the Sea covers Iſlands, and takes them from our ſight; that the people are afflicted with ſtrange, and inteſtine warres; that one kingdome deſtroyes another; that famine and the Plague, cauſe mortallities; that every countrey hath its perticular calamities; that wild beaſts inhabiting the mountaines, doe hurt in the plaines; that the little become great, and contrarily, that the lofty by a miſerable change fall into a low fortune; that there is little juſtice among men, and very much ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; that the thought of all good things is loſt; that the functions of the ſeaſons and elements are in diſorder; that the order of nature is troubled by Monſters, and prodigies, all theſe misfortunes are found in our bookes, whileſt wee endure, and try them, our judgement obliegeth us to believe thoſe who have foretold them: I thinke the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a prophecy is a good teſtimony of its holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and one may conclude it is divine, when find it true.</p>
               <p>Now as we believe things that have been prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, and are come to paſſe, ſo we belive things that have been told us, &amp; not as yet come to paſſe; becauſe they have been al foretold us by the ſame Scriptures, as wel thoſe that are verifi'd every day as thoſe whoſe ſucceſſe us ſtil expected; they are the ſame words which wee heare; the ſame letters that inſtruct us, it is the ſame ſpirit which hath inſpired the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets both the one, and the other. Hee that by the grace of God, hath the gift of penetrating into the

               <head>CHAP. XXI.</head>
               <p>I Have told you our Religion is grounded on very ancient monuments; that is to ſay, on the Books of the Religion of the Jews: yet becauſe there are many among you know it to be much newer then this, &amp; that it began under the Empire of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> &amp; we acknowledge it ourſelves. It imports that I explain my ſelfe more particularly on this ſubject, that wee may not be accuſed of covering our owne opinions under the vaile of a moſt famous Religion, and whereof the publick exerciſe is permitted. We muſt take away the ſcruple that may ariſe, not onely in that we are diſtinguiſhed from the Jews by the times, and novelty of our inſtitution, but alſo for that there is a difference betweene their ceremonies and ours, that wee forbid not as they doe the uſe of certaine meats, nor ſolemnize their tea feaſts, nor uſe circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the end, carry not the ſame name: which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59934:56"/>
are arguments you hold infallible, to prove you doe not ſerve one God.</p>
               <p>But that which helps to confirm you in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you have of us, is, that you all know, even unto the meaneſt of the people, that Jeſus Chriſt was Man, that as ſo hee was condemned by the Jewes, which carries you eaſily to this perſwaſion, that we worſhip a Man, and not the God of the Jewes. But the behaviour this ungratefull people have uſed to our Maſter, doth not make us aſhamed; contrarily it is a glory to us to paſſe for his children, and to bee perſecuted for his name, and the honour we beare to him derogateth not from that wee owe to God, neither have wee any other opinion of the Godhead then the Jewes.</p>
               <p>I am therefore obliged to ſpeake a few things of Jeſus Chriſt, and to ſhew hee is the true God. The Jewiſh Nation of all others had the happineſs to be the onely beloved people of God. They received this favour becauſe of the wonderfull piety, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable faith of their ancient Patriarks, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was their race ſtill raiſed to that admirable greatneſs, their condition came to a power that made it ſo flouriſhing, and their felicity ſo perfect, that God communicated himſelfe to them, and with his own mouth taught them to honour him alwayes, and not to offend him. But they had too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the merit of their Anceſtors; that which ſhould have tied them ſtraitly to the ſervice of the Divine Majeſty, made them forget their duty: they finned againſt God, and by a ſtrange blindneſs, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59934:56"/>
his Commandments, and changed his Lawes into a prophane worſhip. If the Jewes will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their crimes, the condition they are now in, will be a ſufficient proofe thereof. They are ſpread over all the Univerſe, they wander from all parts, are baniſhed from their Countrey, cannot injoy the aire they breathed at their birth; and run over all the world, without having either man, or God for their King; in concluſion, their condition is ſo miſerable, that it is not permitted them to ſet ſo much as their foot, or caſt their eyes on their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Countrey, or to paſſe thither as ſtrangers. The holy Scriptures that threatned them with theſe evils, are full of Propheſies, that foretold them that in the laſt times God would chuſe ſervants faithfuller then they, whom hee would take to himſelfe in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Countreys of the World; and on whom he would powre graces much perfecter, then thoſe they had received, proportioned to the merit of the Meſſiah, which ſhould come to publiſh the Law which he would give them.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Meſpſiah which God had ordained to ſend on the earth, to change the Law of the Jewes, to diſcover the truth of theſe figures, and to accompliſh the Prophecies; this juſt Diſpenſator of Divine graces, this excellent Maſter of this heavenly Doctrine, the true light that inlightens, and Doctor that teacheth men, and to ſay all, this Son of God was promiſed us. But do not think this Son is aſhamed of his birth; hee hath beene begotton, but know, that neither the ſeed of his Father, not the name of Son,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59934:57"/>
which he beares makes him aſhamed: His genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not defiled with the inceſt of Brother, or Siſter, neither of a gods unchaſt imbraces with a Maid or married woman: His Father not a god diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed under the forme of a Serpent, Bull, Bird, or golden ſhowre, as of your feigned god <hi>Jupiter</hi> it is reported.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Son of God whom wee worſhip, it's true hath a Mother; but not a Mother defiled with the leaſt impurity, ſhe to whom the birth of this Son hath given the name of Mother, being ſtill a Virgin without carnall knowledge of any man. But to make you comprehend how the Son of God is born, I muſt diſcover to you what his ſubſtance is. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy declared, that God created the Univerſe by the power of his word, the operation of his wiſedome, and the vertue of his power.</p>
               <p>The ancient Wiſe-men alſo were of this opinion, that the word and wiſedome, which they named of one onely word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is to ſay, the word, did make the World. <hi>Zenon</hi> ſaith, this word is the Authour of that order, and admirable diſpoſition we ſee in nature; alſo that the ſame that is called De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny is God, the mind of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and neceſſity of all things. <hi>Cleanthes</hi> makes a ſpirit that goes into all the parts of this Univerſe. As for us, as wee ſay God hath made all things by his word, wiſedome, and vertue, wee attribute to the word, wiſedome, and vertue of God, a Spirit that is their proper ſubſtance, and which is the word to command, the wiſdom to diſpoſe, and the vertue to give perfection to his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59934:57"/>
workes. Wee have learnt that God hath produced this ſpirit which we call the word, that God in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it hath begot it, and therefore it is the Sonne of God, and alſo God in regard the ſubſtance of God and his owne Son, are but one ſelfe ſame ſubſtance, becauſe God is alſo a Spirit; it is even as of a beame comming from the body of the Sun; this Planet in producing the ſame, gives it a portion of its light, which notwithſtanding it cannot loſe; for it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in its beame, becauſe the beame is alwayes a beame of the Sun; the ſubſtance of the light is not ſeparated, but ſpreads forth. So in the internall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the word, the ſpirit derives from the ſpirit, and God derives from God, as the light of a Candle is taken from another Candle which hath comunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it its light: the light remains all intire in the Candle from whence it is taken, and ſuffers not any diminution, although men borrow the quality to diſtribute it to many Candles.</p>
               <p>It is even ſo of God, that which comes from him is God, the Son of God, and both together, God, and his Sonne, are one and the ſelfe ſame God. From whence it follows that this diſtinction of ſpirit to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of God to God, is not in the ſubſtance, but perſon, makes not a diviſion in God, but only a diſtribution of the qualities of Father and Son; not a diverſity of conditions between Father and Son, but onely an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of God the Father to God the Son: and finally that God the Son ſpringeth, and is not ſeparated from the ſubſtance of God: wherefore the beame of God being come downe into the body of a Virgin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59934:58"/>
in her womb; is come likewiſe into the world Man and God together. This marvellous compoſure of mortal fleſh, &amp; the ſpirit of God, hath been nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, brought up, grown in years, ſpoken, taught, &amp; wrought, &amp; is this Man Jeſus Chriſt. Take if you wil, this truth for a fable, you may receive it in the mean time, till we bring further proofs of our Maſter, as wee receive many tales made touching thoſe, gods you confeſs. This wonder was knowne to them of whom you hold all the follies you believe of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>They have invented them by a ſacrilegious emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to deſtroy the eternall truth of a God-man, in expoſing to them the lies which have ſome relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them. If then you will have witneſſes of the incarnation of the Son of God, we tell you the Jews knew it from the mouths of the Prophets, that hee was to be borne among men, and they expect him ſtill, and the greateſt difference between them and us, is, that they doe not believe he is already come. The holy Scriptures make mention of two commings of the Son of God: the firſt, when he appeared in the weakneſs of humane nature, and condition of a very low humility. The ſecond, which to bring with it the end of all times, and wherein he will ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with all the ſplendor of his God-head. The Jewes have not heard of the firſt, and they, hope for the ſecond, which hath been ſo clearly declared, perſwading themſelves that the Son of God ſhould come this onely time on the earth: Their ſins are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59934:58"/>
the juſt cauſe of their blindneſs, they have deſerved by their crimes committed againſt God, not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this firſt comming; yet without doubt, they would have believed this glorious Myſtery, if they had uhderſtood it, and if they Would have believed it, he had acquired for them eternall ſalvation.</p>
               <p>This puniſhment was foretold them, and they may read in the holy Scripture, that God hath threatned, they ſhould not know his ſecrets, that their underſtanding ſhould not comprehend them; that they ſhould have eyes, and not ſee his light, eares, and not heare his word. Now, as they could not imagine him whom they ſaw in this low humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to be a God, ſo they took him only for a man; whom when reflecting upon them the effects of his power, they gave out, that he uſed Magick, and by the helpe thereof caſt Divels out the bodies of men, reſtored ſight to the blinde; cleanſed the Lepers; healed them that were ſicke of the Palſey; raiſed the dead; made the Elements obey him; appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Tempeſts; went upon the waters; all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by which hee ſhewed himſelfe to be the ancient Word, the firſt born, accompliſhed with vertue and wiſdome, as alſo informed with the ſpirit of God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Doctors, of the Law, and the greateſt among the Jewes, who ſaw when he preached, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded their errours, and that an infinite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people followed him, were ſo incenſed againſt him, that, in concluſion, they accuſed him before <hi>Pontius Pilat,</hi> the then Governour of <hi>Judea,</hi> under the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59934:59"/>
authoritie of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi>; and by viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting juſtice, forced him to deliver them Jeſus to bee nailed on the Croſſe. Hee foretold they ſhould thus unworthily uſe him; but, it may be, 'twould not be enough if the Prophets had not declared it a long time before: yet Jeſus being on the croſſe gave many ſignes, by which he ſhewed hee was truly the Son of God; for after making that great exclamation, when a dying, he rendered, of his own accord, his ſpirit to God his Father preventing therby the Executioners, accuſtomed to breake the thighs of thoſe that were crucified, to haſten the end of their lives, and deliver them from the pains of a longer puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in that very moment wherein Jeſus expired, which was at noone, the Sun loſt his light, and the Earth was covered with darkneſſ even they who knew not this prodigy ſhould happen at his death, and that revealed before to the Prophets did take it for a miracle, and becauſe unwilling to diſcover the reaſon thereof, they denied it that came to paſſ: But you cannot make this wonder ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſeeing your owne Calenders have remarked it, and your ſelves retaine the teſtimonies thereof in your owne regiſters.</p>
               <p>The Jews having took Jeſus from the Croſſe, and put him into the ſepulchre, encompaſs'd it with a great number of Souldiers, to whom they gave charge to keep him carefully: This ſuſpicious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, feared his Diſciples ſhould come and take away his body, and having committed this theft, perſwade them hee was riſen, becauſe hee had ſaid, that in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59934:59"/>
three dayes hee would riſe from the grave, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over death.</p>
               <p>But the third day being come, the earth ſhooke on a ſudden, the ſtone that ſhut the mouth of the Sepulchre was overturned, the Souldiers aſtoniſhed, and troubled with fear, and not one of his Diſciples durſt appeare, that they might be accuſed of taking away his body, which not being found, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nothing in the grave, but the linnen wherewith he was wrapt. Yet notwithſtanding the High Prieſts divulged this bruit, that the body of Jeſus was taken away by his Diſoiples. They had reaſon to publiſh this falſe theft, that they might turne away the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from embracing this Doctrine, otherwiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould loſe the authority they had over the People, and the profits they drew from them, if they had knowne that hee whom they had crucified was truly the ſon of God.</p>
               <p>Their mindes being thus abuſed by the ambition and avarice of the Prieſts, they remained in the darkneſſe of errour; for Jeſus Chriſt ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not to the People, becauſe hee would not doe this favour to the wicked, to make them become faithfull, in preſenting before their eyes his glorious body, and it muſt be that the faith that promis'd ſuch great recompences, ſhould bee wrapt up with ſome difficulties.</p>
               <p>After his reſurrection he ſtayes with ſome of his Diſciples ſorty dayes in Galile, one of the Provinces in Judea, where hee taught them what they ſhould preach to men; and having given them to declare his Doctrine throughout all the Earth, a cloud invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59934:60"/>
him, where with received up to Heaven, a truth far more certain then any humane teſtimonies, given of your <hi>Proculus</hi> touching his ſeeing a <hi>Romulus,</hi> or other of your <hi>Princes</hi> mounting up into the ſame place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate,</hi> who in his heart believed in Jeſus Chriſt, at the ſame time wrote all this Hiſtory to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Ceſars</hi> themſelves had worſhipped our Maſter, if their government in ſo doing had been conſiſtent with the men of this world, and Chriſtians permitted to have beene ſaluted <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars.</hi> The Diſciples of Jeſus, following the order hee had given them, went over all parts of the knowne world to publiſh the Law of the Goſpel: But the Jewes, their declared Enemies, made them indure many puniſhments, which they ſuffered generouſly, becauſe they knew they were hated only for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth. In the end, theſe Inſidels taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the cruelty of <hi>Nero,</hi> cauſed the bloud of the Chriſtians inhumanly to be ſhed.</p>
               <p>But remember when wee told you of the gods you worſhip, we ſaid we would produce them as ſit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt. Is it not ſtrange we ſhould imploy them whom you withold from being Chriſtians, to make you believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſtians? yet you ſhall ſee by and by, that your gods beare witneſs, in favour of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, againſt your Idolatry. This wee ſhall tell you, when come to declare to you, wherin conſiſts all the myſtery of our inſtirution; then you ſhall know both the originall of out Religion, the name, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59934:60"/>
the Author thereof. Let none therefore object to us any more theſe crimes ſo full of infamy; let none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more conceive theſe ſtrange opinions of our lives, you muſt needs belleve what wee declare to you touching the worſhip we render to God.</p>
               <p>Religion is a ſacred thing, where it is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſeigne, and where lies are counted ſacrilegious. Every man that ſaith he worſhips other God then whom he pretends truly to worſhip, is an Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell to his God, and takes from him the honour hee ſhould render him to transfer the ſame to another; and in transferring it, acknowledgeth not his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head any longer, becauſe hee violates it in denying him. We ſay openly we are Chriſtians, we avow it publickly, yea even in the midſt of tortures, the which you make uſe of to make us deny it. When we are torne in pieces and covered with our bloud, we cry out, as far as our voices will extend, wee worſhip God in Jeſus Chriſt, believe if you will Jeſus Chriſt to be man onely. It is by him, and in him neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that God will bee known and honoured. So to the end wee may anſwer the Jewes, Have not they learn'd to worſhip God on earth by <hi>Moſes,</hi> a man whom God ſent to teach them to ſerve him, and that he made uſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> as a man, to publiſh his Law? as for the Greeks, were not they men that inſtructed them in their ſuperſtitions? to wit, <hi>Orpheus</hi> on the mountain of <hi>Pierius, Muſeus</hi> at <hi>Atbens, Melampus</hi> at <hi>Argos,</hi> and <hi>Trophonius</hi> in <hi>Beotia.</hi> Then if I ſhould caſt mine eyes upon you, who are the Maſters of all the world, do I not finde it was a man, a <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59934:61"/>
that put upon you a Religion ſo full of ridiculous myſteries, and troubleſome ceremonies? Why ſhould it not be permitted Jeſus Chriſt alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Divinity, he to whom only the Divinity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained, and to make himſelfe acknowledged for the God of Heaven and Earth? He ought not to be ſuſpected for an Impoſtor as others, for hee was not like to a <hi>Numa,</hi> who would not ſoften the wilde ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of theſe ſavage people, and barbarous, in filling them with aſtoniſhment by the infinite number of gods which made them afraid. Hee addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to men polliſhe &amp; perfectly knowing in the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the world, and yet withall their wiſedome, were blinde as concerning Heaven. He came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten, and diſcover to them the truth they knew not. Informe your ſelves whether the God-head of Jeſus Chriſt be the true God-head we ought to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Whether it change their manners that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and makes them become better then they were, all the other Deities muſt bee condemned as falſe, and principally that which is under the names and Images of dead men, by the artiſice of certaine ſuppoſed ſignes, of the miracles they counterfet, and the deceitfull Oracles they render, paſſe for a true Divinity, although it is knowne that all it doth is but the worke of Divels.</p>

               <p>VVE ſay then, that there is in Nature certain ſpiritual ſubſtances, to whom the name of Divels is given. This name is not new, the Philoſopher had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, and <hi>Socrates</hi> did nothing Without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his Divell. So they ſay, that from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy this Divell was alwayes by him, and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him not ſo long as the lived. <hi>Certes</hi>: this ſpirit was not proper but to turne him away from the love of good things The Poets alſo knew what the Divels were; and the ignorant common people, have them in their mouths when they would pronounce a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction. It is by an inward motion of the ſoule, that in thoſe imprecations in calling the evill ſpirits, in effect they call Satan, who is the Prince of this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Company. <hi>Blato</hi> did alſo aoknowledge the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Angels; and the Magidians who in their inchantments make uſe of the names of Angels, and Divels, to bee teſtimonies of their being. One may learn from the holy Scriptures how by the ſin of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Angels, who fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the irregularity of their own wil ſuffered their innocence to bee corrupted, came the race of the Divels, a race much more corrupted then theſe evill Angels from whence they draw their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and that God hath condemned with them, and their Prince, thoſe of whom we come from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59934:62"/>
of, Wherefore ſufficeth that wee now treat of the point that concerneth the operations of theſe ſpirits.</p>
               <p>They worke on men but to deſtroy them; the malice of the Divels from the beginning of times was imployed in doing evill. Thus they afflict bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with diſeaſes, and make them fall into trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome accidents; they ſtir up in mens mindes violent troubles, and ſudden motions, which move them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily. Their ſimple and ſubtile nature gives them the faculty of laying bold of the two ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that compoſe man.</p>
               <p>The power with which theſe ſpirits operate is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, one may very well know their action, but the manner of their operation falls not under the object of the ſight, neither can bee perceived by the organ of the ſenſes. As when there happens any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret irregularity in the aite, the diſtemper thereof makes the fruit to be loſt in the bloſſome, takes away its life when it begins to put forth, and nips them at the very time of their maturity: even as when the aire is infected by ſome ſudden cauſe, it ſpreads the plague upon the earth among the vapours that the Sun had drawn up; in the ſame manner, and with a contagion as unperceiveable, the Divels and evill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels by their blaſt caſt diſorders into mindes, agitate them with divers furies, give them thoughts of folly and filthineſs, make them capable more violent paſſions, and ſlide therein an infinite number of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Of theſe errours this is the principall, that, after they have abuſed, &amp; wrapt them up into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59934:62"/>
illuſions, they recommend them to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of theſe falſe gods, and oblige them to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſacrifices to their Idols, that they may be fed with the odour of the ſacrifices, and the bloud of theſe beaſts which is their moſt agreeable nouriſhment. For what nouriſhment do they raſte with more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then, the Idolatry of man, when by the wiles of their falſe juglings, they ſeduce them, and turne aſide their thoughts from the object of the true God? I will now diſcover by what way they deceive them.</p>
               <p>Every Spirit hath the ſame nimbleneſs as a bird, and becauſe the Angels and Divels are ſpirits, they are every where in a moment. All the world is but one place to them, it is all one with them to know what is done in every coaſt of the world, as to ſay it. This promptitude with which they know all things, makes them paſs for gods, becauſe their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is not knowne.</p>
               <p>So they will often appear to bee Authours of that which they declare; &amp; in effect they are ſomtimes of evill, but never of good. Beſides, they learnt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore from the mouthes of the Prophets the things which eternall providence hath determined; and now they take them from the holy Scriptures: it is from thence they draw the conjectures by which they judge of the times to come.</p>
               <p>They obſerve the changes that have happened in the fequell of times, and they ſtrive to appeare like to a Deitie, by the thefts they make of theſe predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions wherewith they abuſe the world. They work
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59934:63"/>
upon all with a wonderfull cunning to expreſs the Oracles they render, by terms full of ambiguity, that they may accommodate themſelves to the events. <hi>Craeſus</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> could tell much newes. It was by the means we before ſpoke of, <hi>Apollo</hi> declared, that <hi>Craeſus</hi> had boiled his Tortoiſe With the fleſh of a Lamb; hee had learnt it in <hi>Lydia,</hi> where he was in an inſtant. Moreover the Divels who have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in the aire, by their neighbourhood with the ſtarres, and the neareneſſe of the clouds may know the diſpoſition of the Heavens.</p>
               <p>They promiſe men raine which is ready to fall, and which they feele when they promiſe it. Truly wee muſt avow they are very helpfull in the cure of diſeaſes; for they are they that doe the evill, and afterwards ordaine the remedies, but they are reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies wonderfull new, and contrary to the evill: after one hath made uſe of their receipts, they ceaſe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the body, and then wee thinke they have cured it.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay more concerning the trickes of theſe deceitfull ſpirits, and their admirable effects? of the ſpirits of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> who brought to <hi>Rome</hi> the news of the victory obtained on King <hi>Perſeus</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> preſently after it was won? of that <hi>Veſtall</hi> that received water in a ſieve? of another that made a great ſhip ſaile which ſhe drew onely with her girdle? of that <hi>Domitius</hi> to whom the ſpirits of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> by their onely touch, changed the colour of his beard, and of black made it become red, that he might have ſome marke to make him
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59934:63"/>
elieveb it? when declaring to him this victory all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obtained by the Romans all theſe things which are the workers of the Devill have authoriſed Idolatry, perſwaded men that ſtones were true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, and hindred them to ſeeke the true God; this high and incomprehenſible majeſty to whom onely worſhip is due.</p>

               <p>BUt ſeeing Magicians have power to make ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits appear to men; ſeeing they recall the ſouls of the dead, whom they cover with infamy by their witchcrafts; that by the force of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, Children are made uſe of in their charmes to throw themſelves on the ground, and afterwards riſe up againe to declare Oracles; that by the deluſions, wherewith they deceive the eyes and eares, they repreſent a great number of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; that they infuſe dreams into us when aſleepe, and worke all theſe things, when once by the vertue of their invocations they have obtained the help of evill Angels and Devills, who make their goats, and tables propheſic: When this power worketh of one accord, and for it onely; with how much more affection doth it imploy all its forces to effect what it produceth, when there is no queſtion of any intereſt but of that which is a ſtranger to it? If the Angels and Devils do the ſame things as your gods,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59934:64"/>
where is the excellencie of the deity, wee muſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to bee above all other powers? is it not more ſeemely to preſume that they are they that make themſelves to bee acknowledged for gods, ſeeing their actions are like to them they take for actions of the gods, then to believe the power of the gods is not greater then that of Angels and Devils? but it may bee your gods are gods but in the temples, it is the place that gives them the title, and that out of temples, you do not acknowledge them for gods; that in your opinion, it is another kind of fury to leape over conſecrated towers to a deity, then to precipitate ones ſlle from a prophane houſe, that it is another ſort of rage to cut off ones privy parts, and armes, then to cut ones throat; in truth the deſpaire both of the one and the other meet both in one, as it is but one cauſe that tranſports them. But hitherto we have made uſe of nothihg but wordes; now wee muſt make uſe of the things themſelves, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, to ſhew you that your gods and divels are but one ſubſtance, and that they differ but in name.</p>
               <p>If a man ſhould bring before your Tribunalls, one that were truely poſſeſſed of a Divell, if a Chriſtian ſhould comand him to ſpeake, this wicked ſpirit wil confeſs then that he is a Devill, with as much truth as he ſaith falſely at another time he is a God. Let them preſent, any one of theſe they believe to be wrought upon within by a deity; that in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſacrifices they offer on the Altars, have the vertue of a God in ſenting the ſmell which goes out of the ſacrifices; who with force belch out words out of their ſtomacks; within breathing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59934:64"/>
oracles; if this heavenly virgin who promiſeth raine; if this <hi>AEſculapius</hi> that teacheth the ſecrets of Phyſicke, that preſerves the lives of them who muſt loſe the ſame ſoone after, confeſſe not by the mouths of theſe impoſtors, Whoſe fained inſpirations deceive the world, that they are but devills, if the preſence of a Chriſtian takes not from them the boldneſſe of lying, wee are willing that in the ſame place, you ſhed the bloud of this Chriſtian, and puniſh him as a wicked perſon. What demonſtration is clearer then this? what proofe more infallible? truth ſhines there in its purity, it is afficted with this force, that is not proper but for her ſelfe; there is nothing heere to bee evill thought on. Say then it is done by the power of Magick; or by ſome ſuch like tricke, if your eyes or eares will let you. But I pray what can you ſay againſt a thing that ſhews it ſelfe ſo cleare and without artifice? if theſe ſpirits are gods indeed, why do they falſely ſay they are devills? is it to obey us they do ſo? on this accout the deity receives law from the Chriſtians, but they ſhould not honour with this title, a nature that is under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man: I might add, that is ſubect to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his enemies, if it cauſeth ſhame.</p>
               <p>If on the other ſide theſe ſpirits are Divels, or Angels, how comes it when they ſpeake to others then to us, they would paſſe for gods? for as thoſe to whom divine honour is rendred wou'd not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Divels, if in truth they were gods, becauſe gods cannot take the qualitie of Divels without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their majeſty; ſo yit the names they give
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59934:65"/>
themſelves whom you acknowledge to bee Divels, were the names, of true gods, they could not bee ſo raſh as to take, and to put them in the rank of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; becauſe theſe gods would without doubt bee their Soveraignes, and they would feare to offend the majeſtie of them whoſe power they ſhould dread.</p>
               <p>Acknowledge then that the Deitie you honour is not a Deitie, becauſe, if it were, the Divels would not attribute it to themſelves, and the gods would not diſavow it. So ſeeing both the one and the other concur in acknowledging this truth, that thoſe the world acknowledge for gods are none, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs then they are Divels; and therefore you muſt reſolve to ſeek Deities ſomewhere elſe, ſeeing you now ſee what is the condition of them you take for gods.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing by our meanes your gods diſcover to you they are no gods, and that all the other to whom men erect Altars, are none in like manner; but this at the ſame time they make you know who the true God is, if it be this only God that we that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians worſhip, if we muſt believe of him what the Chriſtians believe, if hee muſt bee ſerved as their Lawes ordaine. When you conjure your gods in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, doe they aske who is that Jeſus Chriſt? doe they call the Hiſtory of his life a Fable? doe they ſay hee is a man of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as other men? that hee was a Magician? that, after dead, his Diſciples tooke away his body privately from the Sepulchre?
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59934:65"/>
and that he is now in Hell? ſay they not rather hee is in Heaven? that hee muſt diſcend to the terrour of all the world? with horrour to the Univerſe? with the lamentation of all men but Chriſtians? and that hee ſhall come downe on the earth full of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, as the vertue of God, the ſpirit of God, the Word, Wiſdome, Reaſon, and Son of God? your gods muſt doe as you doe, deride all theſe things, denie all the ſouls that liv'd ſince the Creation of the world ſhould take their bodies againe; that Jeſus Chriſt muſt judge them, they ſhould ſay it belongs to <hi>Radamanthus</hi> and <hi>Minos,</hi> according to the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the Poets; at leaſt they ſhould diſcharge themſelves of the ſhame of this ſin, and infamy of their condemnation, not avowing they are ſpirits of corruption, although it ſufficiently enough appeares by the condition of their meats they ſeed on, the bloud, ſmoake, ſtinking ſacrifices of beaſts, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure tongues of their Divines that they are ſo; and in the end not confeſs they are already condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the pains of Hell, expecting the univerſall judgement, where they ſhall receive the juſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their wickedneſs, with all them that have ſinned as they, and worſhipped them. Now all the power we have of them, is the name of Jeſus Chriſt who gives it us, it is the threatning we give them of the evils God is readie to powre on their heads, and which one day Jeſus Chriſt muſt declare to them. As they feare Jeſus Chriſt in God, and God in Jeſus Chriſt, they are under the government of the ſervants of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt: ſo by the onely touch
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59934:66"/>
of our hands, and breath of our mouths; the Divel ſeized with feare at the ſight of the flames that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron them are forced to obey us, to come our of the bodies they poſſeſs, in diſpite of them, and with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, to ſuffer this ſhame in our preſence. You that are wont to believe them when they lie, believe them when they ſpeake of thenſelves. No body will tell a lie to get ſhame by it, but rather to gaine honour; one will ſooner beleve them that confeſſe againſt their owne intereſt, then thoſe that denie to their advantage. Theſe Teſtimonies which we have of your Gods make men to bee Chriſtians; for wee cannot give a full beleeſe to what they ſay, without believing in Jeſus Chriſt our maſter. Your gods kindle in our hearts the faith which the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth us; they ſtrengthen our hope, and confirme us in the aſſurance wee have of our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As for you, to honour them, you offer them alſo the blood of Chriſtians; and if it were permitted then to lie when Chriſtians interrogate them, and labour to make you know the truth by their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they would take good heed of diſcovering your errours to you, as well for keeping the profit they have of them, and the honors you render them, as for the feare they might have that in becomming your ſelves Chriſtians, you drive them away as wee doe from the bodys they torment with ſo much rage.</p>

               <p>VVEE need nothing but the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment wee have from your gods, when wee make them confeſſe they are no gods, and when they anſwer us there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, then the onely God we ſerve, to purge us from the crime of high treaſon, and impiety to the Roman Religion. For if in truth the Gods they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip are no gods, in truth their Religion is no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; if their Religion bee no Religion, then thoſe they acknowledge for gods, are none, it follows wee are not guilty of the crime of impiety. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wee can maintaine, that this reproach reflects on you, that, becauſe ſo long as you honour a lye, you neglect not onely the true Religion of the true God, but moreover oppoſe God; and by this meanes truely fall into the crime of true impiety.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould agree your gods are true gods, would you not confeſſe, according to common opinion, that there is a God greater and ſtronger then they, who is as the principall and author of the Univerſe, and accompliſhed with power, and an infinite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty? for many have this opinion of the Deity; that to one onely God belongs Soveraigne power, and that hee commits the exerciſe of his functions to all the other Gods: what is that <hi>Plato</hi> would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59934:67"/>
when hee writ, that great <hi>Jupiter</hi> is in Heaven accompanied with an army of Gods and Divels. You may ſay, we muſt honour the officres and Livetenants of a Prince, even as the Prince whoſe majeſty they repreſent. But I demand of you, what crime commits hee who regards none but the prince, hopes not but in his favour, and will pleaſe none but him? what outrage commits he againſt the Godhead that gives not the name of God but to the Prince of Heaven? ſeeing in the world they give the name of Emperour but to the Soveraigne, and that it is a Capitall crime, by humane lawes, to call, or ſuffer to bee called with this title any other, then the maſter of the State? But let one worſhip God, another, <hi>Jupiter,</hi> let one in ſaying his prayers lift up his hands to Heaven, another put them on the Altar of faith; let one, if you will, number the clouds, another the ſeelings; one vow his ſoule to his God, another offer him that of a goat. But you ought to: take heed that this bee not a kinde of impiety, to take from men the liberty of ſerving God after their owne manner, to hinder them from making choice of a deity, and force them ſo in that which ſhould depend upon the will, that it ſhould not bee permitted them to worſhip the God they would, and bee forced to worſhip him they would not.</p>
               <p>Know wee not very well that neither the gods, nor men, demand any thing but voluntary ſervices: and this is the reaſon they ſuffer the vaine ſuperſtitions
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59934:67"/>
of the Egyptians, who by a ſtrange blindneſſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate Birds and Beaſts, and condemne to death them that have killed one of theſe gods. Moreover every province, and citty hath his particular God, <hi>Syria</hi> the God <hi>Aſtartes; Arabia</hi> the God <hi>Diſares; Bavaria, Bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus; Affrica</hi> the goddeſſe <hi>Celeſtis; Mauritania</hi> their Kings.</p>
               <p>The provinces I have named, me thinkes, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Roman Empire, and yet I have not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the Gods that are there worſhipped any of the gods of the Romans; in effect the gods that are honoured in theſe countries, are as little known at Rome, as thoſe that are worſhipt in the Cities of Italy, as the God <hi>Belventinus</hi> of <hi>Monte-rotondo, Viſidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of <hi>Narni,</hi> the Goddeſſe <hi>Ancaria</hi> of <hi>Aſcoli, Nurſia</hi> of <hi>Vulſina, Valentia</hi> of <hi>Ocricoly, Nortia</hi> of <hi>Sutry,</hi> and <hi>June</hi> of <hi>Monte-ſiaſooni,</hi> who is cald upon there, becauſe there ſhe was born, and to whom the inhabitants of the place gave it the name of her father. There are none but we to whom it is forbid to have a Religion a part.</p>
               <p>Wee offend the Romans, becauſe not ſerve the God of the Romans, and are unworthy the names of Romans. But we have this advantage, that God is the God of all men, and that we are all his, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or no. As for you, it is permitted you to worſhip all forts of gods, excepting the true God; as if the ſame were not by way of eminence, the God of us all, ſeeing we all are his.</p>

               <p>IN my opinion I have ſufficiently proved, what the falſe, and what the true Divinity is, ſeeing I have drawne my proofs, not onely from Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which reaſoning produceth, but alſo from the ſole teſtimony of thoſe you acknowledge to be gods; ſo that I have largely given ſatisfaction (as I think) in this point. But becauſe in this place, an occaſion is preſented to ſpeake of the name <hi>Romans,</hi> I will not avoid the combat that ſome oblige me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, againſt the opinion that hath ſeized on their mindes, and makes them ſay, the <hi>Romans</hi> obtained the Empire of all the world, and this greatneſs where to wee ſee them arrived, by their pietie, and deſerved to bee Maſters of all the Nations of the Earth, by the reverence carried by them to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the religion of the gods, the gods having rendred them flouriſhing beyond all other honours, becauſe the Romans ſurpaſs all other in devotion.</p>
               <p>There is ſome likelihood the <hi>Romans</hi> received this Recompence from the originall gods of <hi>Rome,</hi> in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the honours the <hi>Romans</hi> rendred unto thoſe gods; for example, the gods <hi>sterculus, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunus,</hi> and <hi>Larentina,</hi> who inlarged the bounds of their domination. For I doe not thinke the other gods had more inclination to a ſtrange Nation, then to their owne Countrey, or that they would have
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59934:68"/>
ſubjected to a people ſo far remote from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the Land where they were borne, where their youth brought up, where they acquired ſo much honour in their life time, or where finally after their death they had buriall given to their bodies. <hi>Cybele</hi> will not diſavow the affection ſhe bore to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to be produced from that ſhe carried to <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> becauſe hee was of her Countrey; ſhee defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him againſt the Armies of the Greeks, and loves the City where ſhe ſtill ſees the bloud of Trojans, and progeny of that Prince. Without doubt, when reſolved to favour the Romans, ſhee foreſaw they would revenge it, and put Greece in ſervitude, which had ruined the Empire of Troy.</p>
               <p>Certainly, ſhee hath cauſed it to bee ſeene in our time, that it was with a great deale of reaſon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Rome delayed to give unto him Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; for <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> having ended his dayes at Sirmion, the ſeventeenth of March, the chiefeſt Prieſt of that goddeſſe, this venerable chiefe of the Evnuches, the ſoure and twentieth of the ſame Month of March, with the horrour and impurity of the bloud he ſpilt, and which came from the wounds hee made in his body, rendred his vowes, as hee was wont, for the preſervation of this Prince after he was dead. O ſleepie Courtiers! O tedious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patchers, whoſe tarrying the cauſe that <hi>Cybele</hi> was not acquainted ſooner with the Emperours death! truly Chriſtians could not chooſe but make deriſion at ſuch a goddeſſe. But had it beene in the power
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59934:69"/>
of Jupiter to diſpoſe (as he thought good) of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the world, would he have ſuffered the power of the Romans to put his Iſle of Creet inſubjection? Would you think, the remembrance of the cave of Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> with the noiſe the <hi>Corybantes</hi> made, in beating on their head attires, and playing on their cymballs to hinder thoſe childiſh cries from diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him: again, the acceptable ſmel of the breath of his nurſe, ſhould not obliege him rather to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelfe againſt this conqueſt? would hee not have preferred the place of his buriall before all the greatneſſe of the Capitol? would hee not rather have enclined to have rayſed up above all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the earth, that which encloſed his aſhes? would <hi>juno</hi> have taken it well that Carthage, which ſhe preferred before <hi>samos,</hi> ſhould be overcome and deſtroyed, even by the race of <hi>AEneas,</hi> if I bee not deceived</p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59934:69"/>And yet the Romans have not done them ſo much honour, although they put Carthage under their power, againſt the deſigne and deſires of <hi>Juno,</hi> as to an unchaſt whore, and a villanous and an infamous <hi>Larentine,</hi> now of all the gods you honour, its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine there are many of them that have raigned in the would; if they had now the power to give Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and kingdomes, whilſt they were kings, and commanded maen, of whom recived they their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? what gods have beene worſhipped by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and by <hi>Jupiter</hi>? it may be twas ſome <hi>Sterculus,</hi> to whom they gave immortallity becauſe the firſt found out the invention of dunging the earth, but hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſince their death with the people that inhabited the territory of Rome. If any of your gods have not had the Soveraigue power heere below, in their time, there were Kings that rendred them not as yet, Divine honours, becauſe they were not as yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for gods; from whence it followes that it belongs to others then to them to give kingdomes, becauſe there were kings eſtabliſhed a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they conſecrated theſe deities.</p>
               <p>But ſee how ridiculous a thing it is to attribute the greatneſſe of the Romans, to the merit of their piety and care had or Religion, ſeeing their Religion became much more pompous and coſtly ſince their eſtate grew powerfull, and their dominion enlarged. For although <hi>Numa</hi> was author of all your ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious myſteries, yet in his time the Romans ſerved their gods without Images and Temples, their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59934:70"/>
being then void of all coſtlineſſe and oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; their ceremonies then neither rich, nor mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, wee ſaw not as then Capitolls raiſed up to Heaven, but onely altars of turfe made in haſt, as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved occaſion and upon neceſſity: te veſſels for their ſacrifices were as then but of earth, from whence onely iſſued the odor of all the bloud of the beaſts which were ſacrificed. Engraven repreſentations of the gods then no where appeared. For the Greeks and Tuſcans who firſt invented the art of making carved images to the gods were n ot as then ſpred in the City of Rome. Its true therefore the Romans were powerfull before they were Religious, neither was it their piety that was the cauſe of their greatneſſe</p>
               <p>For, how ſhould the care of Religion become great to them, who owe their greatneſs to impietie and ſacriledge? for it I bee not deceived, Kingdomes and Empires are eſtabliſhed by diſorders of war, and increaſe by victories. Wars and victories ordinarily produce the taking and ruine of Cities. Which things cannot bee done without offending the gods. Fury at the ſame time indifferently aſſaulting the walls of Temples and Cities, ſlaughters involving Prieſts and Citizens without diſtinction, and the Souldier eager for his prey, ſparing no more ſacred things, then prophane. In which regard the <hi>Romans</hi> committed as many ſacrilodges, as they obtained conqueſts; triumphed as often over their gods as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men; all Images of ſtrange and captive gods, yet in your Temples, remaine as ſo many booties ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59934:70"/>
form people overcome by you, and theſe gods ſuffer their enemies to worſhip them, giving an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Empire to them, whoſe outrages they ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have puniſhed, then recompenſed after that ſort their ſacrilegious flatteries.</p>
               <p>But as it's unprofitable to honour theſe gods that have neither ſenſe, nor knowledge, ſo it's as little dangerous to offend them. <hi>Certes</hi> true pietie permits not to believe, that this people who (as aforeſaid) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed Religion by ſcandalizing it, againe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Religion in labouring for its judgement, ſhould get this great power to which arrived, by any reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence borne by them to divine things; neither is it otherwiſe in like manner, to be believed, that thoſe Nations, whoſe Countries conduced in their being conquered by them, unto the Roman greatneſs, before loſing their Countreys, ſhould bee deſtitute of all manner of Religion.</p>

               <p>After all, if the gods of the <hi>Romans</hi> diſpoſed of Kingdomes, the Jewiſh Nation who alwaies negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted theſe kindes of Deities, had never formed an Eſtate powerfull as it hath done: they abhorred your Idolatry, and on the contrary, you have ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced oblations to their god, you have preſented gifts to his Temple, you have lived in alliance with them along time, and they had never fallen under your power, if they had not offended their God by the unworthy treating they uſed to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

and this wicked ſpirit, is ſubject to us, yet is falls out ſometimes, that like unto wicked and faithleſſe ſlaves, in the midſt of the feare they have of the authority God hath given us over them, they give themſelves over to actions of diſobedience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt: and as te ordinary effect of feare, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hatred, they ſtrive to wrong them, whoſe power they feare.</p>
               <p>Beſides in the eſtate of rage, and deſpaire to which they are reduced, becauſe their condemnation is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready pronounced, they find content in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they ſolace themſelves in their evils, by thoſe they make againſt the ſervants of God, againſt the day of the laſt judgement when they ſhall bee ſhut up in hell to ſuffer there eternally.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, they combate not with us after this ſort but at a diſtance, for when wee come neare them, they muſt yield, being under out power, and are forced to acknowledge the miſery of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo the Devills that aſſault us when far from us, have recourſe to entreaties when we affront them neare hand. Therefore when we muſt undergoe ſuch puniſhmets as you ordain for your wretched ſlaves, when they ſhut us up in priſos, whe tey cauſe us to be condemned to work in the mines, or to ſom other ſervile work of the ſame condition; in the end when they exerciſe all their rage againſt us, by te impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous motions of fury that tranſports them becauſe they ſee they are ſubjected to our authority, knowing their forces are inferior to ours, and therfore our victory is aſſured, and their deſtruction is inevitable,

               <p>BUT ſeeing Religion cannot bee forced, and the ſervice of God is a pure act of the will, it ſeemes, it were injuſtice to force free men to offer them ſacrifices, and would be ridiculous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liege them to honour the gods in deſpite of them, ſeeing they ought to be carried by their owne moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and intereſt to ſeeke their favour; if they be true gods, wee ſhould not ſnatch away the advantage that gives them the liberty of their nature: It ſhould be permitted them to ſay, I will not have <hi>Jupiter</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to mee: who are you that will force my will?

               <p>As for us, in the prayers wee make for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, wee call upon the eternall God, the true God, the living God, this God to whom the Emperours prefer their aſſiſtance before that of other gods; they know very well who gave them the empire they poſſeſſe; and men as they are, know who gave them the ſpirit wherewith they are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. They acknowledge there is no other, then this onely God, through whoſe power alone they ſubſiſt, to whom they are inferiour one degree one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after whom they are next in place; before and above all other that are called gods. Why ſhould they not be greater then theſe gods, ſeeing they are maſters of all the living, which are more worth then the dead? they conſider how farr their authority goes, and apprehend the eſſence of God in proving they can do nothing againſt him; also ſeeing God greater and of more power then themſelves, they are forced to acknowledge they can doe nothing but by him.</p>
               <p>Let the Princes of the earth makes as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes as they pleaſe to ſubdue Heaven, undertake to carry Heaven in triumph as a captive, command
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59934:74"/>
courts of guard to be kept in Heaven, ſtrive to make Heaven tributary, they labour in vaine, hee is great, becauſe not altogether ſo great as heaven. To him heaven and all creatures appertaine, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour drawes his originall from the ſame place whence man drew before hee was Emperour: the author of his ſoule, is the author of his power. It is to him to whom wee Chriſtians, addreſſe our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, make them with hands opened, and lifted up, becauſe innocent; the head bare, becauſe no cauſe to bee aſhamed when wee pray to God. There are none declares to us the words we are to ſay, becauſe it is our heart that acteth rather then our tongue: Wee pray for all the Emperours, and aske of God that he would give them along life; that their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire enjoy a profound peace; their houſe a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; their armies be invincible; themſelves aſſiſted with good counſells; the people remaine in their duties, no trouble ariſe in the world againſt their authority. In the end, we forget nothing the Prince can wiſh for, either as a man, or as an Emperour.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, we cannot aske theſe things but of him of whom wee know wee ſhall obtaine them: as hee is the onely one that muſt grant them, wee are they alone that muſt pray for them, becauſe we and none but we are his true ſubjects, for of all men hee is worſhipped of none but us, let them put us to death becauſe wee follow his doctrine, and offer this rich and fat ſacrifice, which hee will have us conſecrate unto him, to wit a prayer conceaved and produced from a chaſt body, an innocent ſoule, a ſpirit filled

with holineſſe, and not with the graines of incenſe of little value, the teares of that tree of <hi>Arabia,</hi> two drops of wine, the blood of an Oxe ready to die of old age, and for that reaſon even to bee rejected in true ſacrifices; finally after all ſort of uncleaneſſe, with a contaminated conſcience. In effect there is where withall to wonder that among you, the Prieſts (vicious as they are) exactly conſider it the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are pure and intire, they examine rather the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the ſacrifices, then the inſides of them that offer them, then whilſt we implore the grace of God for the Emperours, with our hands lifted up, and ſtretched toward heaven, let irons pierce us, <hi>gibbets</hi> put us on croſſes, fires conſume us, knives cut our throats, beaſts devoure us: A Chriſtian while in prayer lifting up his hands to God is in a condition fit to receave all ſorts of puniſhments; and therefore continue, O magiſtrates, ſo affected to juſtice; raviſh our ſoules, whilſt they are in prayers for the welfare of the Emperours, and make a crime of truth and the ſervice of God.</p>

It ſufficeth to ſay we are oblieged to render them our duties, as to whom our maſter hath commanded us ſo to doe: I can eaſily add, the Emperour is more Emperour of the Chriſtians, then of his other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, becauſe the God of the Chriſtians hath eſtabliſhed him, in regard whereof wee labour more to purpoſe for his welfare, then other men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee aske it not onely of the onely God who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can grant it us, not onely wee that demand it who are fitly quallified for obtaining the ſame, but the prayers moreover which we make for him have ſo much the more efficacy, as wee abaſe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Majeſty under that of gods, we ſubmit it to his onely power; to the greatneſſe of God, becauſe wee equall it not to him; for I give not the name of God to the Emperour, either becauſe I cannot lie, or have not the forhead to mocke him withall, or that himſelfe will not have me call him God.</p>
               <p>If hee bee man, hee hath reaſon to acknowledge that God is more then he, it being ſufficient for him to be called Emperour: this name which God hath given him is full of dignity, hee that calls him God, denyes that hee is Emperour, becauſe if hee bee not man he cannot be Emperour. Even when hee is ſet on his triumphant chariot, and ſees himſelfe rayſed up to the higheſt degree ot humane felicities in this world, he ſhould be advertiſed then, that he is man.

               <p>AUguſtus to whom the Empire owes its eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment becauſe Lord is the firname which wee give unto God, would not ſuffer his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to call him their Lord; yet I will make no difficulty to acknowledge the Emperour is my Lord, but it ſhall be, when not forced to call him my Lord, in the ſame ſenſe that appertaines to my God.</p>
               <p>When I ſay the Emperour is my Lord, I will not forbeare in ſo ſaying to preſerve my liberty. This kinde of reverence makes mee not his ſlave. For I have but one onely true Lord, to wit the powerfull and Eternall God, who is his God alſo as well as mine.</p>
               <p>But how can it be that the father of a countrey is the Lord of the ſame? cerres, a name of piety is much more agreeable to ſuch a man, then a name of power and authority. Secondly, therefore it is that we call the chiefe of perticular houſes, fathers,

                  </gap> leſs appearanc of reaſon to attribute that of God unto Emperours. Its a flattery thats not onely infamous, but alſo of a pernicious conſequence: as if forgetting the reſpect due to the Prince, (to whom this great Empire renders obedience) you ſhould thereby transfer the title of Emperour to another; is it not true you doe an extreame injury to the Emperour, whom you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged before for your maſter? by this caution you render him irreconcilable to you, and his hatred kindled by you, is dreadfull to him as well as unto you whom you have honoured with the name of Emperour; You your ſelves muſt bee pious to God, if you deſire to have God propitious to your Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. You muſt ceaſe to believe thers any other God, by forbearing to call your Emperour ſo who hath need of the aſſiſtance of God.</p>
               <p>But if the pleaſure of the world ſo governes your ſpirits that you bluſh not when you call man God againſt your owne knowledge, you ought, at leaſt, to feare this title you attribute to him, be not an ilO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for its the making of an imprecation againſt the life of the Emperour, to call him God before his apotheoſis.</p>

               <p>SO then Chriſtians are publick enemies, becauſe the honours they render to the Emperours, are neither vaine, flattering, nor raſh; becauſe that in the ſenſe of the true Religion, they profeſſe, they celebrate their ſolemne dayes, rather by the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a pure conſcience, then the diſorders of a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy deboyſtneſſe, Thinke you theſe are ſuch great teſtimonies of affection, to kindle fires in the midſt of the ſtreets, to ſet up tables there, to make feaſts in the publicke places; to change the face of the City into that of a great Taverne, to ſpill ſo much wine upon the pavement, that dirt is made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and afterwards to run in troopes, for quarrels, for committing inſolencies, for ſeeking of meates an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to unruly appetites? Muſt a publick ſhame bee the marke of a publicke joy? muſt theſe things bee counted ſeemely on the ſolemne dayes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which at no other time, on no other dayes are either fitting or decent.</p>
               <p>What? they who live according to the rules of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act diſcipline, that their prayers may obtaine from God the wellfare of the Emperour, ſhall they I ſay, change the manner of living, thus to houour the Emperour? ſhall liberty, and corruption paſſe for piety? What ſerves to enflame concupiſcence ſhall it bee imputed an act of Religion? I confeſſe it is juſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59934:78"/>
to condemne us; for why while obſervers of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, temperance, and all other Chriſtian and morrall vertues, deny we them the licentiouſneſſe of making ſuch like brutiſh rejoycings and bedlam ſports for the welfare of the Emperours? why when all the world beſides in joy, ſhade we not our doores at the ſame time with laurells? why ſet we not up candles and burne (as wee uſe to ſay) in the proverbe daye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light with torches? for it is counted a meritoriour thing with you, in celebrating publicke ſolemnities to adorne your dwellings with all manner of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ornaments agreeable to licentious youth in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots houſes.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee if they that envy us the name of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and ſuppoſe us enemies, to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, fall not into the ſelfeſame crimes they reproach us with that are Chriſtians, let us looke into your lives, examine your hiſtories that therein diſcover whether or no you (the people I meane) who accuſe us after this manner, offend not more then wee this ſecond Majeſty, whether you commit not more then wee, this ſecond ſacriledge, a crime layd to our charge, becauſe wee ſolemniſe not with you the dayes you feaſt on in honour to the Emperours, with all kind of beaſtly ceremonies repugnant to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, chaſtity and purity. I addreſſe my ſelfe to this common people of Rome, to this popularity who occupy the ſeven hils of this great City, and aske them if their language, as Roman ask is, hath ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any of their <hi>Caeſars.</hi> The placcards fixt to the Statues of <hi>Tiber,</hi> and the Cirques where they bring
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59934:79"/>
the wild beaſts, that are taught to teare men in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and whether they heare the people in the midſt of theſe publicke ſpectacles ſpeake ill of the Prince, can render ſufficient teſtimonies heerof. If nature had given to man a body of as tranſparent a matter as a looking glaſſe, is there any in this great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that appeares not with the image of ſome new Emperour engraven on his heart, ſet on a throne lifted up, giving order for the diſtributing of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Princes are wont to make to the publicke at his comming to the Empire, at which inſtant hee heares theſe confuſed voyces which crie,
<q>De noſtris annis tibi <hi>Jupiter</hi> augeat annos?</q>
Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our own years, ſhould <hi>Jupiter</hi> add more to thine.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian can neither pronounce theſe words, nor make wiſhes for the change of Emperours. You ſay theſe are actions of the vulgar, but they are the actions of the Romans, and of thoſe that are the greateſt enemies wee can have, for its this populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that crie the lowdeſt againſt the Chriſtians. But it may be other Orders have beene faithfull to their Princes to the proportion of the authority they have in the State; that there is come out no conjuration from the body of the Senate, and of the Knights, that the Souldiers have not attempted the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours lives, they are ſafe in theit owne pallaces: from whence then an <hi>Avidius Caſſius,</hi> a <hi>Piſcenius Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and a <hi>Claudius Albinius</hi>? from whence thoſe that aſſieged the Emperor <hi>Comodus</hi> between the two law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell woods? from whence thoſe in the exerciſe of the <hi>At hletes</hi> got the force they imployd to ſtrangle that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59934:79"/>
Prince? From whence thoſe that forced the palace with their armes in their hands, with more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then the <hi>Sigeres</hi> had, and the <hi>Parthenians</hi>? If I bee not deceived they are all Romans, all theſe Parricides are of the Religion of them that profeſſe not Chriſtianitie. So that theſe people, at the ſame moment they went to commit theſe attempts ſo full of impiety, did ſacrifice for the welfare of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, ſwore by his Genius, ſhewing themſelves outwardly much different from that they were within, and gave to the Chriſtians the names of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke enemies. But ſo many perſons as are dayly diſcovered to bee confederates, or approvers of this deteſtable party made againſt <hi>Severus,</hi> theſe reſts of ſo great a harveſt of parricides; what lawrells new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered, and covered with branches, did they not put up before their doores? with what eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and lighted torches did they not blacke the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of their houſes withall? what rich and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent tables did they not ſet up in the chiefe places of Rome? not to take part in the publicke joyes, but that by the occaſion of a ſolemnity ordayned for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, they made the Deities they cald on under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the prayers they had conceived, and changing in their minds the name of Prince, by the image of this pompe, they conſecrated that of their hopes.</p>
               <p>They that conſult with Aſtrologers, Devines, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and Magitians concerning the welfare of their Emperours, render them all theſeduties; theſe curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſciences were taught men by the revolted Angels.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59934:80"/>
God hath forbid the uſe thereof, and therefore Chriſtians male no uſe of them no not to my what ſhould be the ſucceſſe of their owne affairs; but it is true, one cannot without crime enquire of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors of the welfare of the Prince. For who can have an intereſt in it, but hee that hath a deſigne up on his death, who wiſheth it, hopes it, and expects ſomething ſhould happen againſt it? Wee do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelves of the fortune of our neighbours, with the ſame intention wee informe our ſelves of that of our maſters. The curioſity that produceth the affection of bloud hath other motions then that which enters in the mind of a ſubject by the hatred it carryes to ſervitude.</p>

Wee would alſo make warr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you without taking up armes, and caſting our ſelves into a revolt; It were enough not to live with you, and to ſeperate our ſelves, our divorce would print ſhame in your foreheads. For if the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who make ſo great a multitude of all ſorts of perſons, ſhould abandon you, to retire into ſome Countrey of the world diſperſed from all ſociety; truely the loſſe of ſo many Citizens, of what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever they are, would diſparage your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and alſo our retreat would bee a rude puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you; without doubt the ſolitude that would remaine with you; this ſilence of all things, this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

aſtoniſhment of nature, even as if all the world were dead, would frighten you, you might goe ſeeke ſubjects to command, there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to you more enemies then Citizens: now you have more Citizens then enemies, becauſe there are greater number of Chriſtians among you. But if we were not neare you, who would ſnatch you a way from theſe ſecret enemies, whoſe malignant operations make ſo ſtrange a confuſion in your minds, and ſo horrible an alteration of your healths? I have heard ſpeake of the poſſeſſion of Divells, where with you are tormented from whence we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you freely and Without reward; if wee had the ſpirit of revenge, it were enough to ſatisfie us, that theſe corrupted ſpirits might at all times ſeaſe on your bodies, and that entrance therein were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes open to them. But as you do not thinke of that you ought, to wit, ſo deare a protection, you ceaſe not to declare a people, to bee your enemies, who do you no hurt, whoſe aſſiſtance is ſo abſolutely neceſſary to you. It is true wee are enemies, yet not of men, but of their errours.</p>

you ſhould, approve of them as of a law full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſociety, beacause there is no ſuch thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by them as is wont to be feared from factious ſocieties, and ſuch as is forbid by the lawes.</p>
               <p>If I bee not deceived, the cauſe why Magiſtrates forbid them, is the care they have of the publicke tranquillitie: that the City be not divided in parties, for that ſooner diſturbes all the orders of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man people, makes tumults in the midſt of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the multitude, and alſo diſquiets the uſe of the lawfull pleaſures of this people, when the pleaſures they affect with ſo much deſire poſſeſſe their eyes; for it is ſubject to receive diverſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. They intereſſe themſelves in the factions made by the ambition of evill Citizens. They ſhare their affections among them, and one may feare theſe diſorders now more then ever, becauſe we live in a time, in which men fell their ſervices to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit violences. As for us, as wee care not for gaining honour, and poſſeſſing great matters of this world, nothing obliegeth us to aſſemble our ſelves againſt the prohibitions of Lawes; and its far from our thoughts, to meddle with publick affaires. Wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but one onely republicke of all men, which is the world; Wee renounce your ſhewes, as wee condemne their diverſe originalls, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wee have that they are the effects of ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and idolatrie.</p>
               <p>Finally, wee regard not what paſſeth there, have no comerce with the furies of the Cirques, with the unchaſtity, of the Theater, the vaine exerciſe of the

               <p>AFter ſhewing Chriſtian Religion (which you call a factious ſociety) innocent of all crimes by you attributed to it; its time I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto you its maners, to the end, that having refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the evill wherewith it is reproached, I ſhew you the good wherewith it is repleniſhed. Wee make a body, or by certaine knowledge all conſpire in the ſervice of the true God, where we live united under one Diſcipline, and one onely Faith, or, by a happie conjunction, conceive all of us the like hope of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal felicity. We aſſemble together by troops in our prayers to God, as if thereby wee would carry as by force, the grant of whatever prayers we preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; it is a violence that is agreeable to him; we pray to him for the Emperours, their Miniſters,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59934:83"/>
the magiſtrates that have the exerciſe of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for the polliticke eſtate, the tranquillity of the Empire, the retarding of the generall diſſolution that muſt put an end to all things. Wee aſſemble together to read the holy Scriptures, and wee read them according to the condition of the times, what ſerves either to admoniſh, or confirme the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. In effct the Scriptures nouriſh our faith, lift up our hope, and aſſure the confidence wee have in God, nevertheleſſe we ceaſe not to confirme our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline by the ſtrength of precepts we continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate.</p>
               <p>In theſe aſſemblies wee make exhortations, and threatnings, and exerciſe Divine cenſure, that bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth ſinners, and excludes them from our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion wee judge them with very much circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe we know that God is in the midſt of us, and ſees what we doe; and certainly it is a great fortelling of the judgement God will, one day, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce againſt the wicked, when the Church, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the enormity of their crimes, darts out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wilfull ſinners the thunderbolts of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deprives them from the participation of its prayers, its ſociety, and all ſort of holy commerce with it. In our aſſemblies there are Biſhops that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and have authority over all the faithfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge; they are approved by the ſuffrages of them whom they ought to conduct, and it is not bribes that acquire them this honor, but teſtimonies given of their good life. For in the Church of God nothing is done by the allurement of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59934:84"/>
gifts: if there be among us any kind of treaſure, the money layd up makes our Religion not aſhamed; neithercan it be ſayd what brought unto us is a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, or price payed to participate of its ho ineſſe: everyone contributes a little ſum, at the end of the month, or, when hee will: but it is, if hee will, and can: for none are conſtrayned to give: if wee get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny almes, it is of good will, riches gathered in this manner are as the pledges of piety; wee do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them in eating and drinking with exceſſe; we make not uſe of them for the fowle and loathſome exerciſe of gluttony: but we employ them in feeding the poore, and burying them, in comforting chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are deſtitute of parents and goods, in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping old men who have ſpent their beſt dayes in the ſervice of the faithfull, in helping the poore that have loſt by ſhipwracke what they had, and in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting them that ſerve in the mines, are baniſhed into Iſlands, or ſhut up in priſons, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Religion of the true God, that during the time they ſuffer for the confeſſion of his name they may be nouriſhed with the ſtocke of the Church. But its a ſtrang thing that this charity among us gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſom to blame us. See, ſay they, how they love one another; this aſtonitheth them, becauſe they hate one another, See, ſay they, how they are ready to die one for another, hut as for them they are ready, to kil one another; &amp; I think, they have nothing to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the name of Chriſtian we give one another, for with them paternal names, &amp; the affinity that blood produceth, expreſſeth but a fained affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; diſguiſed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59934:84"/>
amity. It muſt not ſeeme ſtrange to you if wee call one another brethren, ſeeing wee are all your brethren by the right of nature, which is mother to us all. Wee have the ſame principles as you, but you renounce the humanity common to us; becauſe you are evill brethren to us: but with how much more reaſon are they called and eſteemed brethren; who acknowledge one ſame father, to wit, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, that have received the ſame ſpirit of Sanctitie, who being ſhut up in the ſame darkeneſſe, and ignorance, as children in the belly of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, came forth happily, and in opening their eyes were frighted at the ſight of the ſame light, which is that o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> truth? But, it may bee, it is not believed we are brethren indeed, becauſe there are no trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that ſpeake of the bloody diſorders of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or becauſe wee are brethren, but unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſage of the goods of the world, which with you have the power to diſſolve the union of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood; therefore, as we live with the ſame intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, as if we had all but one ſpirit, and one ſoul, we make no difficulty to put all things betweene us in common; we have nothing in particular but our wives, of all things in the world there is nothing but wives, whereof wee reject community; and, on the contrary, among them, of their wives onely there is community with other men, for as they have uſed to deſile the mariages of their friends, they proſtiture alſo marriages with very much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the unchaſtitie of their friends: that which they have learnt, if I be not deceived, in the ſchoole
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59934:85"/>
of a Greeke <hi>Socrates,</hi> and Roman <hi>Cato,</hi> who have ſometimes lent their wives to their friends, thoſe they married to have children by, to bee engendred by others then themſelves and out of their houſes. I know not if they lent them againſt their wills; for why ſhould they have any care of their chaſtity, whom their husbands abandon ſo lightly? O fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous example of a Grecians wiſdome, and Roman ſeveritie! A Philoſopher and a Cenſor make a ſhamefull trade of the chaſtitie of their wives.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing wee live together with ſo much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that all our goods are common; why ſhould they wonder if wee make good cheere? for it is one of the exceſſes you reproach us with, beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous crimes where of you accuſe our repaſts, you reproove us with prodigality; it may bee it is of us <hi>Diogenes</hi> hath ſaid, the <hi>Megarians</hi> make feaſts, as if they would die tomorrow and they build alſo, as if they would never die. Certes, each of you fees eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the ſtraw in his neighbours eye, then the beame in his owne. The aire is corrupted with the ill ſents that goe out of the mouths of ſo many people, that ſpew in the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>What, the <hi>Saliens</hi> could not make one repaſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they found ſome body that lent them money to ſupplie their expences? your ſtewards would bee troubled to make ready the accounts of the money ſpent in feaſts, where you vow the tenth of your goods to <hi>Hercules</hi>? In <hi>Athens</hi> they chuſe the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt cookes to celebrate the feaſt of the <hi>Apaturies,</hi> wherein the midſt of their deboyſtnes, they call upon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59934:85"/>
the Deity of father <hi>Denis</hi>; the ſouldiers who have the charge of watching by night, to hinder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the City, are troubled at the ſight of the ſmoake that riſeth in the aire, in making ready ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in honour of <hi>Serapis</hi>? And yet they will talke of nothing, but the exceſſe of the Tables of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? But you need but conſider the name given to our repaſt to know the quality thereof. They expreſs themſelves with the ſame word that ſignifies dilecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Greekes, whatſoever the coſt is that is made, it is profitable, for they gaine alwayes in this expence; becauſe it hath piety for its foundation. Its a ſweetneſſe, wherewith wee comfort the want of the poore, but we do not treat them, as you thoſe infamous gluttons, who glory in ſelling you their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for the price of the good bits, where with they fill their bellies in the midſt of a thouſand indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But wee will have the leaſt ſerved with our goods, becauſe we know they, among all men, are, the moſt acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>Then ſeeing our banquets have ſo honeſt an end, conſider what our Diſcipline ſhould be in the reſt of our actions, even thoſe which more concerne the duties of Religion; it permits nothing that is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, nor far from modeſty. Before wee goe to table wee are fed with heavenly meat; which is the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we make to God; wee eate as much, as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſatisfie ones appetite, wee drinke as much as is permitted to perſons that have a care of their puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They that ſit there take their refection with ſo
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59934:86"/>
much temperance, as they may remember they are obliged to worſhip God, even at night. They enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine one another as people that know God heares what they ſay. After the repaſt done, and waſht their hands, and lighted the candles, they are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to prayſe God, and to ſing Pſalmes, taken out of the holy Scripture, or Hymns; every one compoſeth according to the capacity of his mind. By this it may be known, it they have committed any exceſſe at table; as the repaſt began with prayer, ſo it ends; they goe forth, no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in diverſe troopes to defile their hands with the bloud of men, not in ſeverall bands running in the ſtreets, not to doe inſolencies; but with the ſame care they had in comming in, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their modeſty and chaſtity.</p>
               <p>Finally, Chriſtians retire with ſo much ſtayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that wee may very well ſee, they are not fed ſo much with corporall meats, as the ſubſtance of heavenly and holy diſcipline. Certes, it were but reaſon, that this ſociety of the Chriſtians ſhould bee reputed unlawfull, if it were like to that the lawes forbid; it were but good reaſon it ſhould bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, if it were not different to that which deſerves to bee condemned; if one would reproach it with the ſame things wherewith they accuſe facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſocieties. But tell me, did wee ever aſſemble to procure the hurt of any one? As we are ſeperated, we are the ſame alſo in a bodie: as wee are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſo we are in generall that is to ſay, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever eſtate we are found, we offend no body, wee injure no body; when any vertuous or godly people
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59934:86"/>
are aſſociated, when any pious or chaſt perſons aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together, their union ſhould not be called a facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a lawfull ſociety.</p>

Nobody, as yet, cald on the true God at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Hanniball,</hi> after hee had got the great
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59934:87"/>
victory of <hi>Cannes,</hi> by the number of gold rings hee got of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and meaſured by the buſhell, which made the count of the men killed in the battel. All people indifferently adored your gods; when the <hi>Gaules</hi> came with their armes in their hands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Capitol, and beſieged it: but is it not a powerfull argument againſt your errour which wee ſee in your hiſtories, that when Cities were forced, temples and walls had the ſame deſtiny? for, from, thence I boldly conclude, that your gods ſend not theſe evills on the earth, becauſe they are mortall, as well as you. If diſcover the ſource of the evils, wherewith the race of men have been afflicted in all ages, know it hath been their ingratitude hath exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt them the anger of God. For, they have alwayes offended this great author of nature, becauſe not acknowledged the graces received of him. Hee hath given them the knowledge of a part of his greatneſſe, in expoſing before their eyes the beauty of the Univerſe, which publiſheth his honour ſo highly; and inſtead of imploying themſelves in ſo noble a ſearch; they faigned to themſelves other gods, to whom they have rendred the honour that appertained not, but to him alone.</p>
               <p>After this fault, they committed another, which is, in not ſeeking out him that is the maſter, and example of innocencie, and who is alſo the judge and revenger of ſin, abandoning themſelves to all ſorts of vices, and ſhamefully defiling themſelves with execrable crimes: the which, if they had loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into, as they were oblieged, without doubt,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59934:88"/>
they had knowne him, and in knowing, honoured him, and after that had ſooner reſented his favours, then his wrath. Let them not then trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the cauſe of theſe evills, but know they are the effects of the fury of this ſame God, who, in all ages, hath given them proofes of his indignation, before they heard ſpeake of the name of Chriſtians. Man this wicked race that inioyed at caſe all the goods God created for him, before all falſe gods? ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him were forged, will hee not comprehend that theſe evils came from the hand of him to whom he hath not rendred homage for his goods? In ſum, his ingratitude is his crime, hee hath offended the majeſty of God, in failing to make due acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of him. Yet if make compariſon of the calamities of the time paſt, with this time, wee ſhall finde ſince the very moment God ſent the firſt Chriſtians on the earth, publicke evills have beene more tollerable then before they were. Its very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to diſcover the reaſon of it, the innocence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they make profeſſion hath diminiſhed the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world, and begun to turne away, with their prayers, the juſt vengeance of God. But, ſee heere a manifeſt proofe of your blindneſſe. During the great draught of ſummer, when an exceſſive heat ſtayed the raine, and hindred that it fell not on the earth, in the time when every one deſired water, that the fruits of the earth might come to maturity, you loſe not the uſe of your pleaſures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſtneſſe, and among the paſtimes you take in your bathes, your tavernes, and your unchaſt houſes, you
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59934:88"/>
demand of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> by divers kind of ſacrifices, and by the uſe of many ſuperſtitions, the help whereof you have need; you ordain publicke prayers, where the people being bareſooted invoke the affiſtance of the Gods, you ſeeke in the Capitole that which you cannot find, but in heaven; you ſtay till the ſeelings of your temples be changed into clouds, to give you raine, and thinke to obtaine that you deſire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out addreſſing your ſelfe to God, and turning your ſelfe towards heaven, where hee powres downe his graces upon men. Our proceedings are much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from yours, in theſe publick neceſſities we mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſie our ſelves by faſtings; wee practiſe continency, with all the ſeverity wee can; wee abſtaine, for a time, from all corporall nouriſhment, we take ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and aſhes, as markes of our affliction; and in this condition, wee ſtrike at heaven with our cries; wee conſtraine him to have pitty on us; wee make him aſhamed of our miſery; and when wee have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the anger of God, and puld downe his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, you honour your <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and thanke him for a benefit comes not from him.</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59934:89"/>
draw publicke evills upon them; for the evill of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is the effect of the neglect you have of God, and the worſhip you render to ſtatues : in a word its more credible, that God neglected by mankind, ſhould bee ſooner irritated againſt you, then thoſe that receive his ſervices, otherwiſe the Gods you honour would be very unjuſt, if in puniſhing Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians they make no difficulty to puniſh them alſo that adore them.

Hee that hath ordained at the end of all ages the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, and to diſtribute to alrecompenſes or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting puniſhments, puts no difference betweene them before the conſummation of time, doth not, before hand, make a ſeperation of the good and evill, but reſervesit for his laſt judgement; in the meane time, hee equally treats all mankind, whether hee ſhewes them mercy, or reproves them in his anger; Hee will have both good and bad things common to his ſervants and the prophane; that wee may, in the ſociety of the world, without any diſtinction, bee all tryed by his clemency and ſeverity; as for us, as wee have learnt all theſe things of him, we love his clemency, and feare his ſeverity; contrarily, you neglect both the one and the other, and from thence
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59934:89"/>
it comes that all the miſeries the world receives from the hand of God, are, to us, voyces from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that admoniſh, and exhort us to do well, and to you, they are chaſtiſements of your crimes. In the midſt of theſe calamities, wee feele no diſplcaſure, for nothing tyes us to the world, and wee have no intereſt, but to bee gon ere long; beſides, wee know, they are the diſorders of your lives, that procure theſe evills, wherewith the world is afflicted; and if there falls any part upon us, becauſe we are mingled with you, wee take occaſion to rejoyce, becauſe it puts before our eyes the truth of the holy ſcriptures, that confirme in us the confidence wee have in the promiſes made to us; that fortiſies our faith, and aſſures our hope. If it be true, they are the Gods you honour afflict you ſo cruelly becauſe of us, how is it poſſible you continue, ſtill to worſhip ſo ungratefull, and unjuſt gods; ſeeing, contrarily, to injure the Chriſtians, they ſhould rather aſſiſt, and defend you?</p>

               <p>BUt, after all theſe crimes, they object againſt us, and ſay, wee are not any way proſitable in commerce of the world. I know not how that can be ſayd of us, ſeeing wee live with you, wee uſe the ſame meates, and the ſame habits as you, we have beene brought up the one as the other, and the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59934:90"/>
neceſſities of life are common betweene us. For, wee are not like the <hi>Brachmanes,</hi> or the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> wee retire not into the woods; wee baniſh not our ſelves from all things neceſſary for life, wee continually remember, we have great obligations to our God, our Lord, our Creator: we reject not any good thing, his goodneſſe hath produced, for our uſe: we containe our ſelves in a juſt moderation, that wee may not take with exceſſe, or without having need: we remaine with you in the world, but not ſeperate from the ordinary commerce: wee are not without your publicke places, your markets, your baths, your ſhops, your Inns, your Faires. Wee ſaile, beare armes, cultivate the ground, and trafficke with you; ſo that wee mingle our functions with yours; and make open profeſſion of working for your ſervice. I cannot comprehend how you can imagine wee are not profitable to you, and that we contribute nothing to the offices of ſociety, ſeeing it is with it, and by it wee live: But if I do not aſſiſt at your ceremonies, if I celebrate not your feaſts, yet I am a man as well that day as other dayes. During the Saturnalls I goe not into the bath before day, becauſe I will not employ the houres of night and day unprofitably, yet I waſh my ſelfe at a convenient houre, that the bath may ſerve to preſerve my health and conſerve my life and blood: is it not enough, When I am dead, that all my body growes ſtiffe and pale after it is waſhed? the daies on which are repreſented games in honour of your Gods, I eate not publikely, as you doe, according to the cuſtome of theſe wretched
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59934:90"/>
creatures, who at the inſtant they are to bee devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by wild beaſts, fill their bellies before all the world for their laſt repaſt; yet in any other place where I eate, I eate the ſame meats as you doe. I buy no flowers to make a garland to put on my head: what is it to you what uſe I make of the flowers I have bought? mee thinks they are more pleaſing to mee when they are free, unbound, and ſcattered without order. But, if wee muſt put them into the forme of a garland, wee are uſed, when they are in this condition, to put them neer our noſes to ſmell to them. Let them that put them on their heads, try if it be more to purpoſe to ſmell by the haires, or by the organ of the ſmelling part? I am not at your ſhewes, but, if my appetite mooves mee to taſt the good bitts that are ſold in theſe aſſemblyes, I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buy them in the places where they are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſold. I buy no incenſe: if the marchants of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> complaine on it, let theſe ſtrangers know more wares are ſpent, and with greater profuſeneſſe in burying Chriſtians, then to ſume the images of the God. You ſay, the tributes of the temples are leſſe every day by the malice of men, that there is leſſe given to them that keepe thoſe holy places; but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can wee ſuffice to give comfort both to men, and to your gods that implore our charity. Wee think, it is enough to uſe liberallity towards them that aske it of us: Let <hi>Jupiter</hi> give us his hand, and hee ſhall not take it away empty; wee will doe him the favour, which our mercy refuſeth to no body: Wee diſtribute more goods , in every ſtreet, then your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59934:91"/>
with all its ſacrifices doe in all your temples; and, on the other ſide, if the tributes of the temple ſuffer any diminution, the republicke is oblieged for her owne to the piety of the Chriſtians, becauſe they pay what they owe with the ſame fidelity, which makes them abſtaine from all frauds, by which men are wont to retaine unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the goods of others. If one conſider but the loſſe the publicke receives by theſe trickes and lies, where you ſtrive to fruſtrate her rights, it will bee found that the dammage your evil conſcience cauſeth to the State in this onely ran-counter, carries away quite al the good you can do in any other thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>

               <p>I Acknowledge there are certaine perſons that have reaſon to complaine of us, and may truely ſay, there is nothing to be gained for them of the Chriſtians. They are firſt theſe infamous corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of chaſtity; theſe brokers of foule pleaſures, and diſhoneſt loves, theſe wretched creatures that ſerve the vildeſt miniſters of unchaſtitie; after theſe, Murtherers, they which meddle with giving of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and <hi>Magicians,</hi> and finally <hi>southſayers, Deviners,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologers.</hi> But it is very profitable in this life, to be unuſefull to theſe people; Yet in what manner ſoever it be, that our Religion cauſeth dammage to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59934:91"/>
your affaires, it hath neither loſt where withall to recompence you by the helpe you may expect from it. How much do you eſteeme them, I ſay not them that deliver you from the power of Divells, them that pray for you to the true God: But, them you may have neere you, as aſſured guards, from whom there is nothing to be feared?</p>

               <p>IN effect, there is cauſe to wonder your paſſion is ſo irregular, that in proſecuting the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, you make no difficulty to take away the life of men that are profitable to the common wealth. The State receives by your injuſtice an evident da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and important loſſe: and yet no bodie lookes to it: no body weighs of what conſequence the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are of ſo many perſons of good life, and the puniſhment of ſo great a number of innocents. We ſpeake as boldly of the Chriſtians you put to death, for wee have an unreproachable teſtimony of their integrity, which wee take alſo from your regiſters, Sirs, who are employed, every day, in judging thoſe that are kept in priſons, and who terminate their proceſſes, by the ſentences you give againſt them, of all the malefactors accuſed before you, of ſo many ſorts of crimes; is there any of them charged with Murther, Robberie, Sacriledge, and other faults, to whom they impute alſo that hee is a Chriſtian?
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59934:92"/>
or elſe, when Chriſtians are preſented to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Criminalls, becauſe they are Chriſtians, is there, any amongſt them, whoſe life like that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priſoners? all the faulty wherewith your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſo filled that they are overcharged, are of your Religion; they are alſo of your Religion that make the mines groane under the weight of their blowes, they are the wretched creatures of the ſame Religion you are wherewith the wilde beaſts fill their enttayles. All theſe poore criminalls, your Citizens breed up to make them cruelly kill one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother before a bloody people, have the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you have of the deity.</p>
               <p>Finally, among all theſe wretched creatures, thers not one Chriſtian, unleſſe hee be charged by iuſtice, becauſe of his name Chriſtian: Or, if there be found a Chriſtian attainted of any crime, hee hath no more the name Chriſtian, becauſe he hath loſt that Divine qualitie, in loſing his innocence.</p>
            </div>

               <head>CHAP. XLV.</head>
               <p>ARe there none then in the world innocent but we, what marvaile? it muſt needs bee ſo; and otherwiſe it cannot bee: Foraſmuch as God, having taught us innocency; wee know it perfectly, as revealed from a perfect maſter, and keep it faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as diſpenſed by one who will not bee mocked by us in a ſeeming obedience unto what hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59934:92"/>
As for you its the opinion of men that makes you innocent, and their rules that governe all; thence it comes your injunctions eſtabliſh not fully the truth of this excellent vertue; and, as the things moſt offectuall to perfection are there wanting, ſo have they not the power of imprinting feare, in the hearts of thoſe, that owe them obedience. For, tell me, what light hath humane learning to teach that which is truely good? What authority humane power to free men from embracing the true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? If it bee eaſie to bee deceived by the one, it is no leſſe common to neglect the other.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider a little your lawes, and compare them with thoſe of our God; which law is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, that which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill</hi>: or that which ſaith <hi>Thou ſhalt not bee angry</hi>? which perfecter, that which forbids adultry, or which turnes the eyes from the object, ſurpriſing the mind when idle, cauſeth evill deſires to enter into the ſoul thereby? which lawe wiſer, that which condemnes evill deeds, or forbids evill ſpeakings? <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hich pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that which permits not to do wrong to others, or which ſuffers not ſo much as to revenge wrong after done unto our ſelves? but this is not all; for you muſt know your lawes, which ſeemed to ſet out innocence, whereof notwithſtanding they repreſent but an imperfect image, have borrowed that they have of good from the law of God as far more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then what in lawes eſtabliſhed by men.</p>
               <p>I have already ſpoken of the time wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> lived, and therefore not neceſſary to repeate what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59934:93"/>
before ſaid, to ſhew the lawes then publiſhed to bee the firſt, before all other humane lawes ſince, which have not the vertue of that primitive law: for, I pray you, what force have thoſe lawes, whereof men may avoid the ſeverity becauſe very often their crimes are covered, and wee may ſomtimes freely violate them when it is by accident, or conſtraint they are offended by us. But wee need do nothing to make them be neglected, but this conſideration, that the puniſhments are not of long continuance, and end with death: ſo <hi>Epicurus</hi> mockes at all ſorrowes and torments that afflict the body, becauſe hee ſaith, one ſhould not apprehend them it meane, and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and if violent they will not laſt long. As for us, who are to anſwer before a God, who knowes the moſt hidden things, and that his juſtice will revenge the faults of men, with paines that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver end, it is with good reaſon wee labour onely to attaine true innocencie; the perfect knowledge wee have of ſo rare a vertue, the difficulty wee have to hide our actions from him that ſees all, the horror of torments this great God prepares for the wicked, torments that are not onely long, but eternall, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieging us to conſerve purity, whereof Jeſus Chriſt hath given us an example; for wee feare this God, the Iudges ought alſo to feare that condemne them, whoſe hearts are touched with this feare; that is to ſay, Chriſtians, who feare God, and not man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever power man hath on the earth to afflict them with.</p>

               <p>I Thinke, I have cleared the Chriſtians of all the crimes, wherwith calumnious imputations make men thirſt for their blood. Explained all that tends to our juſtification; ſhewne, by what meanes, wee can proove the verity of the grounds of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in that I have produced the ſaith of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſtent with the Holy Scriptures, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſpirituall powers make of the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt. He that ſhall bee bold enough to make us paſſe for impious, ſhould not reſt on the skill of vaine eloquence, and the weake endeavours of fine words: but hee muſt make his proofe in the ſame forme, as wee have eſtabliſhed ours. Certes, theſe teſtimonies are of great authority, but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable fruits our Doctrine produceth, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof is become publicke by the commerce wee have in the world, makes ſo downright a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with rude incredulity, that to defend her ſelfe, ſhe is forced to ſay our profeſſion, hath no matter in it Divine, but is onely a ſect of Philoſophy, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liegeth Chriſtians to ranke themſelves there, in the exerciſe of morall vertues. The Philoſophers, ſaith ſhee, teach and practiſe the ſame things, Innocence, Juſtice, Patience, Temperance, and Chaſtity. If our Doctrine bee like that of Philoſophers, if the compariſon you make of us with them bee juſt, how
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59934:94"/>
comes it, wee are not treated as they are? for with you their ſects are tolerated, and you do not puniſh them? But, contrarily, the Doctrine we publiſh is forbid by your lawes, and expoſeth us to all ſorts of puniſhments? or elſe, why are not they, you eſteeme like unto us, forced to doe the ſame things you impoſe upon us as neceſſary, and which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe on perill of our lives? for, is there any that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a Philoſopher to ſacrifice, or ſweare by their gods, or to light candles at noone? But, contrarily, they have the liberty to overthrow the worſhip of your gods openly, and to reprehend your ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions in the bookes they compoſe, which when they make, you commend them, evidencing thereby that you approve of their opinions. Many among them raile impudently againſt the Princes of the world, and you ſuffer them, and the juſtice of the land hath rather recompenſes then puniſhments for them. They ſet up Statues for them, they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them with rewards, and wee heare not that they are delivered to the fury of wild beaſts, and muſt avow that it is with a great deale of reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they beare the name of Philoſophers, and not Chriſtians. This name Philoſopher driveth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Divells how ſhould they drive them away, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they put them in the ranke of gods, and take them and Divels, to bee for one and the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? <hi>Socrates</hi> had alwayes this word in his mouth, if my <hi>Daemon</hi> permit me; and the ſame Philoſopher, who witneſſeth hee had the ſame light of truth, when hee taught we muſt not honour the gods, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59934:94"/>
not to ordaine when giving up the Ghoſt, they ſhould ſacrifice a cocke to <hi>AEſculapius,</hi> I thinke it was an act of gratitude hee would render to <hi>Apollo,</hi> father of <hi>AEſculapius,</hi> becauſe he ſaid, <hi>Socrates</hi> was the wiſeſt of all men: O ſtrange imprudence of a God! he bore witneſſe of the wiſdome of a man, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the power of the gods. Now as truth is wont to kindle hatred, whoſoever is faithfull to it and preſents it all pure, and without diſguiſe, is liable to bee checked by the lovers of this paſſion; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily every man that makes profeſſion of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting truth, acquireth by an action ſo deteſtable the favour of thoſe who perſecute it. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers will appeare followers of the truth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe glory is the end they propoſe to themſelves, in faigning to love it, they corrupt it; but the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that have their ſalvation for an object, earneſtly deſire it, with an holy neceſſity, and after they have met with it, conſerve its purity, and publiſh it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing any change. It is not true then, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you imagine, that the knowledge and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Philoſophers are like to ours; but there are other arguments of difference betweene them and us. What is this <hi>Thales</hi> Prince of Phyſitians who when <hi>Craeſus</hi> ſollicited him to deliver what believe with certainty of God? Did hee not put him off with ſundry delayes to thinke further upon it? every handicraftsmen, the leaſt Chriſtian knowes God, and is able to ſhew how his greatneſſe is to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. He ſhews by the ſenſible things all that humane underſtanding finds in God, although <hi>Plato</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:59934:95"/>
affirmes this author of the Univerſe cannot eaſily be knowne, and when know him, it is hard to expreſſe his nature, and make his eſſence be conceived. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if you object to us that the practiſe of morall vertues is common betweene the Philoſophers and us, let us examine them in perticular. And to begin with chaſtity, I read the <hi>Athenians</hi> gave ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Socrates,</hi> as a defiler of young boyes; a Chriſtian man as making love to a woman one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, accuſtomes not to ſeeke a brutiſh pleaſure in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ſex which nature hath ordained. I have heard a <hi>Phrynè</hi> hath beene made uſe of for <hi>Diogenes</hi> deb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yſtneſſe, and ſubmitted her body to his fowle affections That <hi>Speuſippus</hi> a Philoſopher of <hi>platoes</hi> ſchoole, was kild n adultery; a Chriſtian is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to accompany with his lawfull wife onely. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> deprived himſelfe of his ſight, becauſe hee could not looke upon women without luſting after them, and afflicted himſelfe when hee could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them, and ſo by conſequence witneſſed his own incontinence.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian hath eyes, and yet in looking upon women, ſees them not; that is, with any unlawfull concupiſence, being wholly blind in his mind to ſuch deſires; though quicke ſighted enough to behold ſuch like objects with the eyes of his body. If queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of common civility, behold <hi>Diogenes</hi> with his fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy feet in greater arrogance treads on ſumptuous carpets, then <hi>Plato</hi> whoſe ſumptuous carpets they were; Neither is a Chriſtian high minded towards the poor. If ſpeake of moderation, <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>

among the <hi>Turiens,</hi> and <hi>Zeno</hi> among them of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ene,</hi> play the Tyrants, when as a Chriſtian hath not the ambition to be in the leaſt power or office over the people among whom hee lives; if wee treat of contentment in mind, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> will famiſh himſelfe, becauſe the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> went about but to reforme and amend his lawes; A Chriſtian even when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die, is thank full to thoſe that condemne him. If queſtion of faithfullneſſe in things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to anothers truſt, <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> refuſeth the reſtitution of goods left with him, to his gueſts; A Chriſtian even by thoſe that are not Chriſtians is reckoned truſty, becauſe made proofe they have of his fidelity. If touch on lowlineſſe, I find <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> made his friend <hi>Hermias</hi> goe ſhamefully from the place he had aſſumed; A Chriſtian offers wrong to no body, no not his greateſt enemie. The ſame <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> in deſigne to governe <hi>Alexander,</hi> the eaſier, flatters him with as much infamy, as <hi>Plato Dionyſius,</hi> when for good cheere hee ſoothed up the Tyrant in his liberty. <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> in the midſt of his purple, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the markes of great ſeverity in his lookes, gives himſelfe over to all kind of exceſſes: And <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi> when about to betray his countrey, is ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murdered: an act of barbarous revenge never yet undertooke by a Chriſtian to a man linked with him in the intereſt of the ſame Religion, though with never ſo much fury perſecuted by them. But ſome will ſay even among us, there are a people that gives themſelves the liberty of doing evill, that free themſelves from ſubjection to our lawes, from any
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59934:96"/>
what ever exact obſervation of what legally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by us. It is true, there are ſome ſuch, but ſo ſoone as they fall into this diſorder, wee hold them on more for Chriſtaians. But, contrarily, theſe Philoſophers, notwithſtanding the irregularity of their lives, keepe ſtill with you the name of wiſe men, and the honour which appertaineth to ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a title; ſo then what reſemblance is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Philoſopher, and a Chriſtian, a Diſciple of Greece, and a Diſciple of Heaven, a mind deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of vaine reputation, and a ſoule that ſeekes his ſalvation onely? A man that is vertuous in words onely, and hee that is ſo indeed: one that is wholly occupied in doing good, and another that makes no conſcience in committing what ever wickedneſſes: he that corrupts the truth to eſtabliſh error, and he that by ſubduing error renders to truth the beauty of its originall: hee that turnes truth out of doores as a theefe, and ſteales it away from the ſight of men, and hee that keepes it faithfully, that it may bee known by all the world.</p>

               <p>THe antiquitie of the holy Scriptures, which I have heeretofore diſcovered, is a famous teſtimony, which may ſerve mee ſtill in this place, to let you know this holy booke is a treaſure from whence theſe wiſe men of the world who are

Is there any Poet or Sophiſter that hath not drawn what he hath of excellent concernment from the rich ſources of the Prophets? It is in theſe delicious fountains the Philoſophers plunged themſelves to qualifie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of their minds, and ſome people have alſo bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Philoſophy from them, as the <hi>Thebans,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and of <hi>Argos,</hi> becauſe their Philoſophers cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting what they had read in the writings of theſe men ſent from God, compoſed peſtilent doctrines, which a man could not heare but with horror: ſo theſe people, who as I have ſaid, laboured not but for glory, and had no affection but for eloquence, having met in the holy Scriptures, with things that might be gainfull to them made their profit of them, and as they had no intention but to Content their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, accommodated the ſame to their deſignes, not acknowledging its holineſſe, which ſhould have hindred them from corrupting it; and not underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well the ſenſe, then covered with cloudes, and which the jewes themſelves, for whom the Prophets had written it, apprehended not, but thorough ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows that wrapt them up. They ſaw truth there with ſimplicity alwayes accompanied; but humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence blinded with her errors, not willing to believe in this truth which was ſhewed to her, remaines more doubtfull and unreſolved then before; from whence it comes theſe wiſe men of the world have

formed opinions variable and uncertaine touching the ſame things they found, or declared proved with infallible certainty. They have learnt onely from the holy Scriptures there is one God, and the opinions they have had of the nature of God divides them into many ſects: One aſſitming God hath no body: other, that he is corporeal1, (as the <hi>Platonicks</hi> &amp; <hi>Stoicks</hi>) one, that God is compoſed of Atomes; other, of numbers, (as <hi>Epicurus</hi> &amp; <hi>Pythagoras</hi>) one, that his ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is of fire (as it ſeemes to <hi>Heraclitus</hi>) the <hi>Platonicks</hi> hold he takes care of the conduct of the world: contrarily, the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curians</hi> that he remaines in an idle tranquillity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exerciſe, &amp; meddles not at all with human things. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> believe God hath his ſeat out of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, from whence he manageth &amp; removes, as a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turnes his frame. The <hi>Platonicks</hi> put him in the world, and ſay, hee governes it within, as hee that holds the rudder of a ſhip; ſo they are of different o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions concerning the nature of the world, to know whether it hath not been made, or whether it hath not beene; if it muſt end one day, or muſt laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; ſo, they are not agreed of the condition of our ſoule; ſome maintaine, it is divine and eternall; others, that it is ſubject death; each of them hath ſpoken according to his ſenſe, given way to his thoughts, changed, and corrupted the truth, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their owne motions; but wee muſt not wonder, if Philoſophers have made this worke of the oracles of the old Teſtament, ſeeing wee have amongſt us people, who ſhew themſelves children worthy of ſuch fathers, infecting the purity of our new Goſpell

with the corruption of their owne opinions, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſpirit of Philoſophy; and who by this onely way, which brought to the knowledge of the truth, have drawn many crooked paths, wherein men cannot engage themſelves without loſing themſelves: whereof I would willingly advertiſe you that the diverſity found betweene us, makes you not imagine our profeſſion is like that of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and that you judge not ill of the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee deſend it by different meanes, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in our doctrine. Theſe people that are ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from us, have violated the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and wee beat downe their crrours by this onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that the true rule of truth is that which hath beene taught by our Maſter, and tranſmitted to us by theſe holy perſons, who had the happineſſe to heare his word, and receive his Divine inſtructions.</p>
               <p>We ſhall ſhew in another place, that all which is not conformable to this rule, hath beene invented by new Doctors, who came not till after the bleſſed companions of the ſon of God; to deſtroy the truth, men have made uſe of truth it ſelfe by the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpirits of error, who have inſpired them to fight with it with its owne armes; they are they who have excited them to corrupt ſo ſaving a d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

They would ruinate faith by this deteſtable tricke, perſwading men they muſt not believe Chriſtians, by the ſame reaſon not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59934:98"/>
believe the Poets, nor Philoſophers; or rather wee ſhould believe the Poets and Philoſophers, becauſe not believe the Chriſtians. It is this ſacrilegious i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, that makes them laugh at us, when wee preach the laſt judgement; the Poets and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, upon the ground of this truth, ſet up a tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in Hell. They mocke at us alſo, when wee threaten them with eternall torments, which are thoſe hidden flames the earth ſhuts up in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and are reſerved by the juſtice of God, as in a treaſure, for the puniſhment of the wicked: for theſe prophaners have invented, that there is is hel a River of burning fire; if wee ſpeake to them of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, a place fild with agreeable and Divine beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ordained to be the reſidence of the ſoules of the bleſſed, and ſeperated from the world by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this Zone of fire which God hath put before it, preſently the Elyſian fields comes in their thoughts; they imagine that there is that delicious place wee declare unto them. Tell mee I pray you where the Poets and Philoſophers have drawn theſe things ſo like to our doctrine? if it bee not from our bookes and Diſcipline? if they have drawne them from our Diſcipline, they have without doubt the prerogative of antiquity upon them; therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that what wee teach is truer, and ought to have more beliefe then all theſe vaine opinions. In effect: theſe opinions are but the ſhaddowes of truth, and ſeeing the world hath given faith to theſe vailes, they ought rather to believe the truth that is the ſubſtance. If the Poets and Philoſophers are the firſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59934:98"/>
authors of theſe things which they have written, it muſt bee then that our Diſcipline is but the figure of that which is come after it, which nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not, becauſe the ſhadow is not before the body, and the figure cannot have beene before the truth, from whom it takes its originall.</p>

               <p>IT muſt bee acknowledged that the uſage wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from you, and that you give the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, are very different: if a Philoſopher ſets out what <hi>Laberius</hi> left in writing, according to the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that a mule is changed into a man, &amp; a woman into an adder; if he diſplayes al the cunning of his eloquence, if hee ſets out with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe all his arguments to ſettle this opinion, is it not true that hee moves your minds? that he drawes you to his partie? that hee forceth you to believe you muſt abſtaine from the fleſh of beaſts? and that after there are ſome found with you, that make ſome ſcruple to taſt it, becauſe in eating a peece of beeſe, they feare to devoure ſome of their aunceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors? contrarily, if a Chriſtian aſſures you, a man that is dead ſhall live againe one day, that hee that is in the grave ſhall come out and take againe the ſame forme he had, hee is abuſed by the people, not onely with blowes of the fiſt, but alſo with ſtones caſt at him. Now, mee thinkes, there is much
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59934:99"/>
blindneſſe in receiving the opinions of theſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and in condemning the Doctrine wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to you upon the point of the reſurrection; for if there bee reaſon perſwades that the ſoule of a dead man reenters into a body; why may not wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it enters into the ſame body again; and returnes into the ſame matter from whence it is ſeperated; ſeeing the effect of a true Reſurrection, is to be that which it was before? the ſoules after they have changed their bodies, according to the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and his Diſciples, are no more the ſame they were heretofore: becauſe they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come what they are not, unleſſe they ceaſe to be what they were: wee might find wherewithall to jeſt on this ſubject, if diſpoſed to ſport our minds, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine our leaſure with mirth: it wou'd bee a very pleaſant thing to enquire in what beaſts, perſons have beene changed that lived before us: but it is better we reſolve to determine the truth of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. We ſay then, it is more convenient to the dignity of our nature, to believe man ſhall become man againe, that every one in particular ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to be the ſame he was, and informed with the ſame ſoule, that animated him, with the ſame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities wherewith he was endowed, although the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy receive ſome change in his exterior figure. In ſum, the deſigne of the Univerſall judgement, being the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall reaſon of our reſurrection, it is neceſſary the ſame man that is dead live againe, that God may recompence, or puniſh for his good or evill actions the ſame perſons. And the ſame bodies that are in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59934:99"/>
the duſt of the grave muſt appeare at this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the ſoule cannot ſuffer alone, and without a ſenſible matter, that is to ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its fleſh, and as it hath not ſinned but in its fleſh, it alſo hath not merited but with its fleſh the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments the juſtice of God hath ordained for its crimes. But you ſay to mee, how can it bee that a matter reduced to duſt ſhould repreſent it ſelfe? conſider with thy ſelfe O man! that makeſt this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to me, thou ſhalt find in thy owne perſon the proofe of ſo rare a miracle. Thinke on what thou waſt before created, thou wert nothing. For if any thing before, thou wouldſt remember it. Thou then that wert nothing before thy creation, and when ceaſe to live, ſhalt returne to nothing: why canſt thou not once againe bee brought out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the will of the ſame Creator, who created thee of nothing? will there come any new thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee? Thou who before wert not, art made again: after thou ceaſeſt to live heere, thou ſhalt bee reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the reſurrection, and after this wee would have thee aske by what meanes God will rayſe thee up againe?</p>
               <p>But ſeeing hee made no difficulty to make thee what before thou wert, thou oughteſt not to thinke that hee finds any to an eaſier thing, that is, to make thee what thou wert heeretofore. Can one doubt of the power of God, that hath made this vaſt and immenſe bodie of the world of that which was not? of nothing, and out of a <hi>Chaos</hi>? and who at the ſame moment animated this world with a ſpirit, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59934:100"/>
life to all things? hee hath given teſtimonies, that witneſſe, and ſets forth examples to us of the reſurrection of man. Wee ſee every day, the light after ir hath loſt its darkeneſſe, takes it againe; and by turnes the darkeneſſe diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates it ſelfe, and ſucceeds to light againe: the Starrs deprived of their ſplendor, as if they were not, in being clothed with their luſter ſeeme to bee re-ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated: the time begins at the ſame terme where it finiſhed; the fruits fall off the trees, and come again in their ſeaſon; the corne puts not forth its eares plentifully, till after its former graine is corrupted, and rotten in the earth: all things in periſhing are conſerved, ſpring againe after dead; and thou, O man! that ſhouldſt bee ſo glorious by the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of thy nature, if thou kneweſt it, and that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt alſo by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> thy ſelfe to bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all creatures, as well of them that die not to live again, as of thoſe muſt die to riſe again. Is it poſſible thou ſhouldſt die to bee no more? and that thy death ought not have a return to life again? No certainly, in what place ſoever thy ſoul is ſeparated form thy body, whatſoever element hath deſtroyed thy being, ſwallowed up, conſumed, and reduced thee to nothing; it ſhall render thee all entire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing and all the Univerſe appertain to one and the ſame Lord. It follows by this diſcourſe, ſay you, that we muſt alwayes die, and always riſe again: and I anſwer you; If God, the great Lord of all things hath ſo ordayned it, ſo it ſhall bee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you like of it or no: but that which his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59934:100"/>
hath ordayned touching the Reſurrection of man, is conducted by a more equitable order: Its a myſtery newly revealed by his only Son Jeſus Chriſt. This wiſdome that hath compoſed the Univerſe with ſubſtances of different natures, and makes it ſubſiſt in a body, by the uniting of ſo many contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualities, of voyd, and ſolid, of things animate, and inanimate, of that in our power, and that above us, of life, and death, the ſame hath ordayned time, with this difference of conditions, that this firſt part in which wee live, ſince the very Creation of the World, was perpetually to the terme that muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the number of its yeares; and the other part that followes, and which we ſtay for, is infinite in its durance, and perpetuates unto eternity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two, there is a middle time, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter arrived to its end, the beauty of this Univerſe, which muſt end one day alſo, and is for the preſent, hung up before all eternity, ſhall change face; and then all mankind ſhall ariſe and appeare before the ſame God, to bee recompenſed according to all the good or evill we have done upon earth, either with infinite joy, or paine in the world to come. After which wee ſhall neither die, nor riſe againe any more. But without other change keepe ſtill the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wee appeare in at the howre of our Univerſall reſurrection; that is to ſay, the ſervants of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clothed with the ſubſtance of eternity, which is that of the Angels, ſhall remaine alwayes united to God; and the Prophane, and thoſe that violate the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59934:101"/>
lawes of God, be buried in flames, where ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually without conſuming; becauſe pertake of the nature of this fire, which is of ſuch a ſublime quality, as ſhall make them live in paines without being ſubject to corruption. The Philoſophers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the difference betweene hidden fire, and fire diſcovered to our eyes: ſo the fire ordained for the uſe of man, is other then that which ſerves for the juſtice of God: whether it formes the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings which heaven darts upon the earth, or diſgor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it ſelfe from the deepe Cavernes of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; it conſumes not that it burnes, it repaires ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it deſtroyes, ſo that the mountaines main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themſelves in their order, and man is ſtrucke with the lightening without offending his body, or being reduced to aſhes by the fire wherewith hee hath been touched.</p>
               <p>This miracle is a proofe of the nature of theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall flames, and an example of the vertue they have by the decree of the judgement of God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve puniſhments, wherewith his juſtice will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the wicked; the mountaines burne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine intire: why ſhould it not ſo come to paſſe with men found hainous offenders before God, and enemies of their Creator?</p>

               <p>THeſe things while wee declare to you under the notion of truth, in us alone you hold for preſumptuous aſſertions, when the ſelf ſame uttered by your Philoſophers, you eſteem admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lights of mind, and ſublime ſciences. They are wiſe, we ſimple: they deſerve to be honoured, wee to bee laughed at: yea, I dare ſay, more ſeverly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. But ſuppoſe the doctrine wee preach falſe, admit it conſiſts in vain opinions; if vain, they are neceſſary for the ſalvation of mens ſouls. If follies, wonderfull profitable; in regard they who beleeve them, are thereby excited to live well, for fear of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall puniſhment if they doe not; and againe if they doe, in hope of eternall felicity. Therefore it behooves us not to call theſe things falſe and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, which ſo much import us, to find true; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemne that which produceth nothing but good: which granted, the opinions you have for perſecuting our doctrine, rather then the doctrine wee profeſſe, ſhould paſſe for imaginations concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without ground.</p>
               <p>Again, this doctrine of ours being ſo profitable to men, deſerves not to bee held impertinent: if, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, you will have it to bee falſe, and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, you muſt yet acknowledge its innocency;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59934:102"/>
and conſequently, that it deſerves not to draw pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments upon the Chriſtians. Know we not, that when other men have given way to vain, and fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous opinions, they have not beene reprooved, your Lawes have not been armed with ſo much ſeverity, as to puniſh them, they having told freely their thoughts without being treated as Criminalls. The worſt a man can doe to thoſe, who after their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, publiſh their follies, is, to laugh at them; Wee finde not that ever they perſecuted them with ſword, and fire, that they have beene expoſed, for that only, to the infamy of gibbets, and rage of wild beaſts. This crueltie is not exerciſed, but againſt Chriſtians; and it is a ſtrange thing, that not onely this people blind in their paſſions, take delight to ſee us ſuffer; but ſome alſo among you, cauſe our bloud inhumanely to be ſhed, to gain the favour of the vulgar, and by this means ſeek glory in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice: as if, all you can doe to us, dependeth not of our good will. In effect, I am a Chriſtian, if I will be one, and therefore you cannot condemne mee, if I will not have you condemne mee. Now ſeeing you cannot uſe the power you have on mee, unleſs I will, it follows, that it is of my will, you have this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and not of the authoritie of your Magiſtracie. Therfore in vaine doe this people rejoice at our tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; our puniſhments that make them rejoice, make us rejoice alſo, becauſe wee had rather die, then loſe the grace of God. Contrarily, they that hate us, ſhould be afflicted, and not rejoice at our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, becauſe they make us obtain what we deſire.</p>

               <p>THerefore ſay you to us, what reaſon have you to complaine of the evills wee cauſe you to ſuffer, ſeeing you will needs ſuffer them? are not you oblieged rather to love thoſe that make you endure the puniſhments you deſire? it is true, wee are reſolved to endure them; but the reaſon is, becauſe, without doing worſe, wee know not how to avoid them: even as no body expoſeth himſelfe to the fury of war, by his good will, becauſe, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come neare it, without being afraid, and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his life, and yet they, that find themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged there, fight with all their might, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever averſion they had before, they rejoyce when they get the victory, becauſe they acquire glory, and enrich themſelves with the ſpoiles of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

A Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſan of <hi>Athens,</hi> after ſhe had wearied her executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59934:103"/>
and bit her tongue between her teeth, in caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into the Tyrants face who made her ſuffer, threw to him the inſtrument of her ſpeech, that if ſhee were overcome by the force of tortures ſhee could not, if ſhee would, diſcover them, who were of the conſpiracy. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> enquiring of <hi>Zeno Eleates,</hi> what good, Philoſophy brought to men; and the Philoſopher having anſwered him that it taught them to contemne death, hee ſigned his anſwer with his blood, unto the laſt groanes of his life, by the inhumanity of this Tyrant who made him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly to die by whipping. The rods which tryed the patience of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and made them feele the ſharpeſt ſtroakes thereof in the ſight of their neareſt kindred, who, in the meane time, exhorted them to endure it conſtantly, gave them ſo much the more honour, as they loſt or had their bloud ſpilt more in abundance; O lawfull glory! becauſe it is of the world; for it is the neglect or death, all that the cruelty of men hath inſupportable, is not imputed to an enraged obſtinacy, and a deſperate reſolution; it is permitted to whoſoever deſires, to ſuffer for his Countrey, Kingdome, Friend, that which is not permitted to ſuffer for Gods cauſe; it is ſtrange, you abhorr our conſtancy, and yet you make Statues for all theſe people, you ſet up their Statues with rare inſcriptions; engrave Elogies in ſtone, and marble for them, that they may laſt to Eternity, and, by your publicke monuments, ſtrive, to the utmoſt of your power, to give, in ſome kinde, a reſurrection to the dead; and, contrarily; you
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59934:104"/>
hold him for a mad man, that endures torments for the name of God, hopes from him, for a true reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Continue, O magiſtrates, ſo full of integrity, juſter in the opinion of this kind of people, if you ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the Chriſtians to fury, torment us, apply your tortures to us, judge us, and, in the end, exterminate us; your injuſtice is the proofe of our innocence; therefore, God will have us endure, that our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings may make our purity ſhine the clearer. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a few daies ſince, you condemned a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an maide to bee rather proſtituted to an infamous corrupter of her chaſtity, then to bee expoſed to the rage of a Lyon; you acknowledge there is no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor kind of death which is ſo intolerable to Chriſtians, as the loſſe of their chaſtity: but, doe what you pleaſe, all inventions the moſt exquiſite cruelty can adviſe you unto, are to no purpoſe, ſo far are they from profiting you, that contrarily they draw all the world to our Religion. The oftner you make a harveſt of the Chriſtians, the oftner their number encreaſeth: their blood is a ſeed which dies not on the earth, but puts forth proſperouſly. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, among you, have laboured, to perſwade men to ſuffer conſtantly paine, &amp; death, (as Cicero in his <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culans, Seneca</hi> in his Treatiſe againſt caſuall things, <hi>Diogenes, Pyrrhon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Callinicus,</hi>) but Chriſtians have better taught conſtancy, by the examples they have given, in ſupporting patiently ſo many evills, then all the Philoſophers, with al their diſcourſes. This ſame obſtinacy, you reproach us with, is an excellent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of truth, which we believe: for, who is it not,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59934:104"/>
that ſtriveth with contemplation, to ſeeke what it is? who after made his ſearch, comes not on our ſide? who, having embraced the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, deſires not to ſuffer for him, that by his ſufferings he may get the infinite treaſures of the grace of God, and that, in the price of his blood, they may obtaine the pardon of their faults; for the remiſſion of all our ſins is the aſſured recompenſe of our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This is the reaſon, that when they read your ſentences of death unto us wee render you thankes; becauſe by a happy emulation that meets betweene the judgements of God, and the judgement of men, at the ſame inſtant when you condemne us heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God pronounceth our abſolution in Heaven.</p>
