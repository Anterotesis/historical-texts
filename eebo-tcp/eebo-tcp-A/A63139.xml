            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Col. <hi>Adrian Scroope</hi> was firſt called to his Tryal, who having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt ſeveral of the Jury, at laſt had ſuch a one as he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to.</p>
            <p>Proclamation being made, and ſilence commanded, the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Read, and One of the Kings council ſtood up and ſpake to this Effect.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, <hi>You have heard by the Indictment of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral that did aſſemble themſelves together to compaſs and take away the Life of the</hi> King <hi>our late Soveraigne, among which perſons the priſoner at the Bar was one, who under his Hand and Seal did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the ſaid Murther, Firſt by ſetting Hand to the Commiſſion which gave being to that Bloody Court, and afterwards by Signing that bloody Warrant which occaſioned the ſevering his Head from his Body, which we can prove by ſeveral Witneſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court call for the VVarrant for the <hi>King's</hi> Execution, and went to ſhew it to one of the VVitneſſes. which when Col. <hi>Scroope</hi> ſaw, he ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord let me ſee it, if it be my hand I will not deny it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The VVarrant it is carried to him.</p>
            <p>Scroope. <hi>My Lord I do not deny but it is my Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Maſterton</hi> one of the VVitneſſes is ſworn.</p>
            <p>Kings Council. <hi>Whether did you ſee this Gentlemen ſitting among the Judges of the</hi> King?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65375:3"/>
               <hi>Maſterton.</hi> My Lord, I was at the High Court of Juſtice ſo called, ſeveral Times, and I ſaw the priſoner at the Bar ſitting among them, and particularly on the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> being the day on which Sentence was given.</p>
            <p>Scroope. <hi>My Lord, pray ask this Gentleman whether he and I were ever in company together that he ſhould know me ſo well, for I never ſaw him in my Life before to my knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which it was anſwered, That he in perſon anſwered to that Name, and was the Man.</p>
            <p>Several other Witneſſes were ſworn to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Scroope</hi> deſired that one might be askt if he could tell whereabout he ſate; To which the Witneſſe anſwered,</p>
            <p>My Lord, I cannot ſay that poſſitively, I cannot remember ſuch Circumſtance ſo long; but to the beſt of my remembrance, he was the uppermoſt Judge on the right hand.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Richard Browne</hi> was ſworn to give Evidence concerning ſeveral treaſonable words that he ſhould ſpeak about the Kings Murther.</p>
            <p>The Act for conſtituting the High Court of Juſtice was likewiſe read; and Col. <hi>Scroop</hi> owned that to be his hand which ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed thereunto; ſaying, he did not deſire that witneſſes ſhould be ſworn to more then was needful.</p>
            <p>The Kings Council then ſpake to the Jury, and told them; <hi>That they had heard by ſix ſeveral Witneſſes that the priſoner had ſate among the Kings Judges; and by three that he ſate the day which was by them called,</hi> the day of Judgement.</p>
            <p>The priſoner ſaid, that he had a great diſadvantage in anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſuch learned Men, who were to plead againſt him, and ſaid, <hi>That he would not undertake to juſtifie his perſon, but deſired Time and Council to anſwer to matter of Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Judge.</hi> That is where you have matter of Law.</p>
            <p>The Priſoner anſwered, My Lord, <hi>I was not of the Parliament, I beſeech you take notice of that; and that which was done, my Lord, was by a</hi> High Court of Juſtice, <hi>who had a commiſſion from the Parliament. My Lord, It was that Authority which was then accounted the ſupreme Authority that the generality of the Nation ſubmitted to; having received command from that authority it was in obedience to the ſame that I ſate, I was promrted thereunto by that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65375:3"/>
command: I have not time to bring theſe things to a Head, becauſe I have been theſe ſix weeks cloſe priſoner in the</hi> Tower, <hi>that I could not get councel to prepare myſelf? therefore my Lord, let me have ſome time and councel to provide myſelf to plead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>I was no contriver of that buſineſſe only executed the command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which was anſwered, That that which he called the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was no Parliament; that there was no colour of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to juſtifie them; and that if the whole Houſe of Commons had been ſitting (as theſe pretending that Authority were not a ſixth part) yet they could not act againſt Life of the leaſt Cripple at the Gate without the King, much leſſe againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Scroope.</hi> I ſay my Lord I am but a ſingle perſon, and if there be miſtakes I am not the only ſingle perſon that have been miſled, I hope that an Errour in Judgement, will not be accounted an Errour in Will, and ſhall not be accounted Malice, Truely my Lord I muſt ſay this, and I deſire your Lordſhip to take notice of me, that I am without any malice at all. After ſeveral things of the like Nature hoping that Authority of the the Rump-parliament would clear him and be taken as a ſufficient Plea for his aforeſaid Treaſonable conſpiracy, The Judge askt him if he had anything further to offer in the caſe, which he being not able to do; The Charge was given to the Jury, who never went out of the Court to give in their Verdict; and being asked according to the forme, whether the Priſoner at the Bar were Guilty of the High Treaſon whereof he ſtood indicted or not Guilty.</p>
            <p>The Fore-man ſaid <hi>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ILTY.</hi> and ſo they ſaid all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVhereupon the priſoner was taken from the Bar and Shackled with chaines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next who was called to the Bar was Mr. <hi>John Carew,</hi> who after the Formalities of the Court was paſſed as aforeſaid, and the <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndictment read, he was charged by the Kings Council as followeth.</p>
            <p>The Priſoner at the Bar ſtands Indicted for <hi>(not having the fear of God before his Eyes)</hi> Imagining, Contriving and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65375:4"/>
compaſſing the Death of our Late Soveraigne of bleſſed Memory; for the proof of this there are ſeveral things in the Indictment which do diſcover their private imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is that they did meet and conſult, &amp;c. there is a ſtatute of the 25t: of <hi>Edward</hi> the third againſt Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Deſigning, or compaſſing the Death of the <hi>KING,</hi> which ye are to enquire after.</p>
            <p>There was a thing called the <hi>High High Cuurt of Juſtice,</hi> in which bloody Court our Soveraigne was Tryed, and this Gentleman was one of thoſe Miſcreants that had the confidence, nay, the impudence to ſit among them, and afterwards Sealed to that bloody Roll whereupon he was Executed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Severall Witneſſes being Examined ſpake to this effect,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they ſaw him ſeveral days in that Court ſitting among thoſe who were called the Kings Judges, and particularly on the 27. day of <hi>January,</hi> 1648. on which day the Sentence paſſed; alſo knew that to be his hand which was to the Warrant for the Kings Execution, And for Eſtabliſhing <hi>A High Court of Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the Priſoner was asked what he had to ſay for himſelf? who anſwered, that he came not there to deny any thing that he had done; that whereas what was done in the caſe was Uſhered in with theſe words, <hi>[Not having the Fear of God before his Eyes]</hi> He did declare it was not done in ſuch a Fear, <hi>But in the Fear of the Holy and Righteous Lord the Judge of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where at the Court was much Troubled and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed that he ſhould make God the Author of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Murther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he went on to this purpoſe</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this came about there was an Ordinance where in my name was ſet, which when I ſaw I ſtroke it out; I leave it to the Lord to Judge, I thought not well of it,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65375:4"/>
and ſo was very unwilling to appear in it, there being as I thought enough beſide me to be imployed in it, and therefore I ſpeak the truth as it is in Jeſus, to ſhew how I had the Fear of the Lord before me, I ſay as to what I did was upon this account; I did it firſt in Obedience to the then Supreame Authority of <hi>England,</hi> and after the Lord gave anſwer to Solemne appeals.</p>
            <p>Running on after this rate the Court were wearied with his diſcourſe and put him on to plead to his Indictment.</p>
            <p>He deſired he might declare the grounds whereupon the Parliament proceeded, and give the Grounds and Reaſons of the Fact.</p>
            <p>To which the King's Council ſaid, Then you muſt needs confeſſe it. Whereupon he acknowledged, that he was there, and proceeded againſt the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; But was told (as the Court had often ſaid before) That neither the Lords nor the Commons, jointly or ſeverally, had any power without the King; and that the Power then in being had not the leaſt colour of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for what they did; and that it was not a thing to be debated without denying our Allegiance, that the Subject can hold up his hand againſt his Soveraign.</p>
            <p>After the Lord <hi>Anneſley</hi> made a learned Speech, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the illegality of their proceedings, that when a Treaty was concluded with the King, and accordingly all things like to be ſettled, he &amp; ſome others had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and deſigned to keep the far greater part of the Members out againſt their Allegiance, the Lawes of the Land, and againſt the priviledges of Parliament, &amp;c. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves an arbitrary Parliament and driving away the reſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But Mr <hi>Carew</hi> being not able to ſay any thing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his high charge: the Jury never went out for it, but presently brought him <hi>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ILTY.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> was brought next, and after all the Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Court were over, he firſt pleaded the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Parliament Man, ſeveral Witneſſes were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt him, That he ſo gloried in the death of the King, as to ſay, <hi>That he deſired it might be written upon his Tombſtone to th' end all the world might know it;</hi> as alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which expreſt his malicious forwardneſſe in that horrid Murther. The main part of his pleading was to juſtifie the Authority of the Rump-Parliament, which being ſo often anſwered before, need not here be incerted; The Jury ſoon concluded with him likewiſe, and found him Guilty.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gregory Clement</hi> petitioned the Court to wave his plea of <hi>not Guilty;</hi> which the Court granting, he confeſt the Indictment.</p>
            <p>Col. John Jones confeſt that he was preſent at giving Sentence againſt the King, only denied the form of the Indictment; whereupon a Jury was without his except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt any, quickly ſworn, and according to his own Confeſſion, found him Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Judge in a very Learned Speech endeavoured to make them ſenſible of the hainouſneſs of the Sin, and perſwading them to Repentance, prayed God to have mercy upon them, and read their Sentence upon all together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſhall go from hence to the place from whence you came, and from that place ſhall be drawn upon a <hi>Hurdle</hi> to the place of EXECUTION, and there ſhall HANG by the NECK till you are half Dead, and ſhall be cut down Alive, and your <hi>Privy-Members</hi> cut off before your Face and thrown into the <hi>Fire,</hi> your Belly ript up and your Bowels Burnt, your Head to be Severed from your Body, your <hi>BODY</hi> ſhall be divided into Four QUARTERS, and Diſpoſed as his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>All were Shackled with Fetters and carried to the <hi>Preſſe-yard.</hi>
