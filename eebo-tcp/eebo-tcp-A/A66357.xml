            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But for the obviation of this inconvenience, it will bee absolutely necessary for our Master of the silkeworme, to have such a proportionable number of trees, that the halfe may alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately repose unpluckt every second yeare.

               <p>The removall of these inconveniences is easily effected by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the course they practice in some parts of Spaine, which is by clipping the leaves from the branches with a sharpe instrument, like a Taylors sheares; by this way you disleave many stalkes at once, which falling into a cleane sheete spread under that tree for the purpose, seperating afterwards the leaves also, such as are sound from unsound, such as peradventure have much of the stalke, from those which are nothing but leafe, (the stalke being hurtfull to this tender Creature) and administred to them the Sunny side of the leafe upward is the most commendable practise of gathering and feeding that hath hitherto been delivered.</p>

               <head>To distinguish the sexes.</head>
               <p>THE Male of the worme, when grown great, is knowne from the Female, by a wrinkled head, and a great appearance of eyes; the Female hath the head round without any such appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. In the Bottomes of Balls the Male is knowne, as having work'd himselfe into a Bottome, long, slender, and by much shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at one end then the other: the Bottomes of the Female are big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, softer, round at one end, halfe poynted at the other.</p>
               <p>The Sex in those Butterflyes is thus distinguished: the Male is lesser of body then the Female, stirring the wings more often and more strongly.</p>
               <p>Selecting then two hundred bottomes (male &amp; female included in the number) you must passe a thread through the first and outward
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62566:17"/>
Downe, called the Sleave of the Ball (using a wary hand that you pierce not into the silke, lest the cold getting in you should quite abortive your Wormes) of which you must make severall connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons composed of an equall number of both Sexes; these (to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Rats and Mice) must be hang'd upon some hooke in a chamber of middle temper, but something inclining to coolenesse, yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever not subject to moysture, that the Butterflyes may come out with the more facility,</p>
               <p>Having pierced through their confinement, though nature her selfe infuses in them disposed applications to finde out their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Sexes, it will be necessary to couple such as yet are disjoyned: all which, after you shall perceive them in conjuncture, must bee set either upon Say, Piropus, Tammey, Chamlet, the Backside of old Velvet, (in generall vpon any stuffe which has no woolly Downe, wherein the graine may be lost, or where it may get betweene the threads, as is linnen) hang'd upon the wall close by their Balls, or in defect of such stuffe, take Walnut-tree leaves one handfull, or more as you shall see occasion, tye them by dozens backsides toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hang them at severall nailes or pinnes, and set the coupled Buterflies thereon. Take the Chamlet, or other stuffes, receiving the seed, and rub it gently between your hands, and the seed will come out with great facility.</p>
               <p>The principall time of the Butterflyes issuing out from the Cod, is in the morning about eight of the Clock: the seed collected must be put into a Boxe very cleane pasted with paper, to exclude all aire or dust, kept in a Chest in a drye temperate place where it may be preserved till the Spring following, avoyding to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny continuall fires in such Chambers, lest the warmth untimely hatch the Wormes, which being brought forth at such a season must perish for want of food.</p>
               <p>The Spaniard takes commonly the double and triple Balls for seed, not that he conceites every double Ball should produce two Butterflyes, or which is a conceit of more fondnesse, Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; but because the multiplicity of creatures spinning their silk in common, make the worke so confused that they cannot well winde it off, which makes them be put in the ranke of the pierced ones for sleave, and I must ingeniously acknowledge my self to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62566:18"/>
accede to his opinion; for these double and triple balls are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt for this purpose, since they commonly, as <hi>De Serres</hi> observes, come rather from a lustinesse and supplenesse of the Worme, then any naturall debility: Which sure are so much fitter to bee culled out, that the best balls may bee made into silke, which will easily winde, and the seede of these which is fully as proper for seed, but lesse apt for silke: neither doe I know why they should not bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, since the Spanish seed proceeding from these double and triple Balls carries a particular preheminence above the rest; which if wee shall make use of, the use is the same with others, except that they must bee clipped at the smaller end with the poynt of a paire of scissors, with a regard that you cut not cleane through the bottome, which would by admission of wind destroy the Worm, and this they doe that the Butterflies, if more then one, may finde an easie passage; the best bottomes (if you will preserve them) for Graine, are great, hard, weighty, and of carnation or flesh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>The balls preserved for seed being made choice of, the next thing wee are to fall upon is, how to winde off the bottomes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for silke: Which would bee of much more advantage for purity and plenty of silke, and facility of labour, if they could immediately bee wound off. The silke so freshly taken unwinding without any losse or violence: But this delayed, the Gumme, by which the Worme fastens her threads becomming dry, doth so harden the bottome, that without difficulty and losse, the winding cannot bee accomplished.</p>
               <p>This expeditious winding prevents the enclosed Worme of her full metamorphose into a Butterflye, and the bottome from perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: But then where shall wee finde so many workemen if the designe were generall, as could in seven or eight dayes winde off so many millions of bottomes? Not excluding therefore such as can have that conveniency, the next best course to kill the Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyes in those bottomes which wee cannot winde off, is by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and laying them in the Sunne, the heate of which in its owne worke stifles this Creature: But let this bee two or three dayes successively (not all at one exposure, lest your silke be burned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of stifling its spinner) two houres before, and two houres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62566:18"/>
each day respectively. Let the bottomes, spread upon sheets, be turned often, that the heate may destroy equally, no one excepted from this sharpe insolation; but this must not bee done with a rude hand, which instead of turning them may bruise the Worme, the slimy matter of whose body, being thus bruised, is very prejudiciall both for staining the silke, and gluing it so toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that no Artist can ever unwinde them.</p>

               <p>But that which is the best and least practised course is this: Take your bottomes, and fill such a Furnace or Copper as your Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers use, halfe full of Water: Within three fingers breadth of this boyling water, lay a lid or planke or board within the Copper, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through as thick with holes as a Cullender, and so fit to the side of the Furnace, that it by no meanes may sinke into the water: Upon this cover lay a thin Carpet of Darnix or the like, and upon the Carpet the silke bottomes, which must bee often stirred, with care not to use too much violence. The mouth of the Copper, except when you stir the bottomes, must bee constantly covered, that the heate may smother the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THIS Engine is very common in Norway and Mountaines of Sweden, wherewith they cut great quantity of Deal-bords; which Engine is very necessary to be in a great Towne or Forrest, to cut Timber, whether into planks or otherwise. This heer is not altogether like those of Norway: for they make the piece of Timber approch the Sawes on certaine wheels with teeth; but because of reparations which those toothd wheeles are often subject unto, I will omit that use: and in stead thereof, put two weights, about 2. or 300. pound weight a piece, whereof one is marked A. the other B. The Cords wherewith the sayd weights doe hang, to be fastned at the end of the 2. peeces of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wood, which slide on two other peeces of fixed wood, by the meanes of certaine small pulleys, which should be within the house, and so the sayd weights should alwayes draw the sayd peeces of moving wood, which advancing alway towards the Sawes rising and falling, shall quickly be cut into 4. 5. or 6. peeces, as you shall please to put on Saws, and placed at what distance you will have for the thicknesse of the planks or bords ye will cut: and when a peece is cut, then let one with a Lever turne a Rowler, wherto shall be fastned a strong
