            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Hortly after his Maiesties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Drumfreis,</hi> to <hi>Carleel,</hi> I posted away these two little Sermons, vnder hope they might serue for witnesses of my willing affection to haue attended his Maiestie in the rest of the iourney, if the condition, either of my person, which is infirme, or of the place, which was no longer pertinent to me, could so haue permitted. How they were miscarried, I know not, belike they haue taken in the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne</hi> way, wherein their father and <hi>fellowes</hi> had not been accustomed to walke before them:
<pb facs="tcp:9489:3"/>
alway, after long wandring, they returned backe againe vnto me, but not without good tydings; for the one of them told me, he was certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, to find fauour with my Lord Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> his Grace, who still kept in mind that <hi>Welcome,</hi> giuen to his Maiesty in the Royall Chappell of the Palace of <hi>Holy-roode-house,</hi> at his Maiesties comming in. The other seemed to mee no lesse confident that he would be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by my Lord Marques of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who did likewise remember the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on giuen to the worthy Nobles of <hi>England</hi>; as also, that hearty <hi>Acclamation</hi> of the people, who seemed to powre out their hearts with their voices, and cryes, for his Maiesties preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church of <hi>Drumfreis,</hi> at his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties going out.</p>
            <p>Both these I easily beleeued, when I called to mind the continual, and constant kindnesse, which through long experience I had found of the one, and that rare humanity of the other, euident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all, and whereof it pleased his Lordship when he was here, to giue me a speciall proofe. Yet could I not presume to present such base, and vnapparelled Pilgrimes to so Noble, and high Personages.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:9489:3"/>Sure I am, if they could haue ouertaken that Reuerend, Graue, &amp; most Learned Prelate, my Lord Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> they had not wanted a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone; for I knew from himselfe, that nothing comming from the B. of <hi>Candida Casa,</hi> would be v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My Lord, they are Strangers; I trust your Lordship will vse them kindly; all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour I craue, is, that your Lordship would once bring them vnder his Maiesties eye, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their sentence, whether they shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Presse, that they wander no more; or then returned home againe, vntill they gather further strength, to doe for themselues.

The hand of the Lord be with our most Gracious Soueraigne, <hi>the name of the God of Iacob defend him.</hi>
