         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The danger of troubles upon a reformation of this corruption

The writing that could not in nineteene
moneths before obtaine a few lines, hath
now gained foure anſwers in foure
moneths. In January came forth: Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of one <hi>Thomas Bakewell,</hi> in which the
Title pretends a briefe anſwer to my
twelve doubtfull Arguments (as he ſtiles them) againſt Infant-baptiſm
in my Exercitation about it. This Treatiſe I think hath
honour enough done it that it is named. If any man ſhew me any
thing worth the anſwering in it, it may in time gain a reply, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
for me it may take it's reſt. The next moneth was publiſhed
Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> his Vindication of baptizing Beleevers Infants in

the whole buſineſſe, is ſo neceſſary for the removing of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
which would prevent reading and entertaining my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and do undermine my preſent ſtation, that I am conſtrained,
firſt to plead for my ſelfe, before I engage further in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie:
wherefore I ſhall anſwer thoſe charges by themſelves

            <p>Firſt, Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Reader hath theſe
words.<note place="margin">§. 3. Of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the two Treatiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Infant-Baptiſme.</note> 
               <hi>Meane while I could not but lament the untimely birth of
Maſter</hi> T. <hi>his Exercitation, and his unneceſſary falling intravell
with it, after at leaſt ſixe able Brethren, and above ſo many daies by
nervous diſputation had given him ſo much Cauſe to doubt of his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or at leaſt a while to ſuſpend it.</hi> And this hath been by ſundry
perſons objected to me, that the publiſhing my Booke was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
unſeaſonable. Two reaſons are implyed in Doctor <hi>Homes</hi>
his words to inſinuate that it was untimely, becauſe it was unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.
Secondly, becauſe it was after ſuch a nervous diſputation
as he mentions.</p>
            <p>To that of needleſneſſe I anſwer. If it were neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Truth though generally oppoſed, when few or none were
willing to appeare for it, and ſpeciall providence called me out to
do it, if it were neceſſary to endeavour the preventing of unjuſt
perſecution for holding a Truth, to which in Sermons and other
waies Law-makers, and Magiſtrates were every where inſtigated,
if it were neceſſary when the people of God were perplexed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113779:6"/>
about a poynt of conſcience that pertaines to their continuall
practice, and diſputation in publike was declined, to endeavour the
bringing of Truth to light, if it were neceſſary for a man to keep
the ſolemne Covenant he hath by oath bound himſelfe to, though
it were to his great hazzard, if it were neceſſary in a time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
for a Miniſter of the Goſpell to do what belonged to
him to further it, if it be neceſſary for a Miniſter of the Goſpell to
provide for the giving of his account at the day of Jeſus Chriſt,
then it was neceſſary for me to fall in travell with my Exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

writing and publiſhing of my Treatiſes. And therefore I am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that what I did was ſo neceſſary, that had I not done what I
did, I ſhould neither have been faithfull to Chriſt, nor to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
nor to the State, nor to my own ſoule. I confeſſe my Book
was untimely publiſhed in reference to my own preferment, and
outward peace. I ſaw few or none regarded for clearing of Truth:
but popular Orators, ſuch as relate to great men, or are uſefull to
uphold a Party, are the men eſteemed. I could not expect any
other then oppoſition to my opinion, being againſt ſuch a ſtream of
men. But I feared that of our Lord Chriſt, <hi>He that is aſhamed of me
and my words in this adulterous and ſinfull Generation, of him ſhall the
Son of man be aſhamed when he ſhall come in his glory with his holy
Angels.</hi> How nervous the diſputation he mentions was, I ſuppoſe
the Doctor knowes not but by report, foraſmuch as I never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him preſent at it. The ſtrength, and ſubſtance of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
as well as my memory (who was then the reſpondent)
could beare them away, was faithfully digeſted by me in my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation,
which was compoſed not long after in part upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of that diſputation. In which diſputation I was ſo farre from
finding cauſe to doubt of my Tenet, that I profeſſe ſincerely both
that diſputation, and the ſeverall Anſwers of my learned Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts,
and reverend brethren Doctor <hi>Homes,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Geree,</hi>
and Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> have giuen me leſſe cauſe to doubt of my

it had been in my apprehenſion extreame imprudence, if not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
to have let ſlip the opportunity of making known the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of my doubts in this juncture of time, in which by Covenant
the State was engaged <hi>to ſettle worſhip, Catechizing, confeſſion of
faith, diſcipline according to Gods Word,</hi> to each of which this point
is of no ſmall moment: if he meane by ſuſpending my Tenet the
not printing my writings, neither am <hi>I</hi> juſtly to be blamed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
conſidering how long I waited and yet never received any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and after I ſay not, a moneth only, but ten moneths at
leaſt waiting for an anſwer about my motion to Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi>
in the Epilogue of my Examen, it was plainly rejected. And
though Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> excuſeth himſelfe by relating that <hi>I decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to him, that I could, and that I intimated to him I would keep the
opinion private to my ſelfe</hi> (in which either his memory or his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
were defective) <hi>and therefore took no further thought of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
my Treatiſes,</hi> yet I ſuppoſe it concerned Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi>
for many reaſons to have contrived ſome courſe for my ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or the abatement of height of pride, and confidence which the
perturbation of his mind, rather then the true intelligence of my
ſpirit in that buſineſſe made him imagine in my writings. As for
the unſeaſonableneſſe in politicke reſpects (though I do not take
upon me in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it could never have come more ſeaſonably, to have a matter

if any diviſions be now about that opinion they were afore my

Maſter <hi>Vines</hi> and my ſelfe, as our friends do from thence write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
            <p>That I may clearely and fully anſwer this charge, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and ſtate my ſelfe, and proceedings right in the thoughts of
men, I think it neceſſary to make this following Declaration. It
hapned that in the yeare 1627. reading the Catechiſme Lecture
at <hi>Magdalen Hall</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and having occaſion in one of my
Lectures to examine whether there be ſuch a priviledge to the
children of Beleevers, that they ſhould be accounted to belong to
the Covenant, and Church of God, I found not ſufficient ground
either from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. or from the inſtitution of Circumciſion for
the affirmative in that queſtion. The ſubſtance of my reaſons then
againſt the Argument drawn from Circumciſion to baptiſme, I
have compacted in that ſhort diſcourſe, which is part. 2, §. 8.
Pag. 29. of my Examen, and begins at thoſe words, I dare not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
&amp;c. Which being the chiefe thing I ſtand upon. I wonder
Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſo lightly paſſeth over calling it a tedious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
altering my words, and ſaying nothing to the reaſon I
bring. Wherefore then, and ſince I declined the urging of thoſe
reaſons for it, and wholly reſted on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. conceiving that
thoſe words [<hi>but now are they holy</hi>] did import that priviledge to
the children of a Beleeving Parent. And accordingly practiſed
baptizing of Infants upon the warrant of that Text only, as I often
told my Auditors at <hi>Lemſter</hi> in <hi>Hereford-ſhire,</hi> which ſome now
about the City can witneſſe. It happened after I was neceſſitated
to leave my place through the violence of the Kings Party, after
much wandring up and down with much danger to me and mine
I came to the City of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and there preached for halfe a yeare,
in which time in diſpute with an Antipaedobaptiſt, I urged that
Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. which he anſwered with ſo much evidence, as
that although I did not fully aſſent unto him, yet as one that durſt
not oppoſe Truth who ever brought it, I reſolved with my ſelfe
to conſider that matter more full, and to that end being enfeebled
with labour in preaching, and griefe by reaſon of the publike loſſes
at that time, and adviſed by my Phyſitian to remove out of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi>
underſtanding the Aſſembly was to ſit in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1643. I reſolved to
adventure a journey to <hi>London</hi> through <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> to conferre with
my Brethren of the Aſſembly, and by the advantage of Books in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113779:8"/>
               <hi>London</hi> to make further ſearch into that point. It pleaſed God to
ſtop my journey then by that ſad, and unexpected overthrow
neere <hi>Devizes,</hi> which neceſſitated me to get away from <hi>Briſtoll</hi>
by Sea into <hi>Pembrokeſhire.</hi> While I was there I chanced to meet
with <hi>Veſſius his theſes de poedobaptiſmo,</hi> and therin reading <hi>Cyprians</hi>
and others of the Ancients Teſtimonies, I ſuſpected that in point
of antiquity the matter was not ſo cleare as I had taken it, but
weighing thoſe paſſages, I conceived that the Ancients held only
baptizing of Infants in the caſe of ſuppoſed neceſſity, conceiving
that by baptiſme Grace was given, and that all are to be ſaved
from periſhing and after in proceſſe of time it became ordinary.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I reſolved if ever I came to <hi>London,</hi> to ſearch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into thoſe two points of the meaning of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. and the
Hiſtory of Paedobaptiſme, and accordingly God having brought
my wife and children with much difficulty to me after a ſecond
plunder, and by remarkable providence turning the wind againſt
the Ships when they went without us bringing us out of <hi>Pembrok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
the day before it was appointed by the Kings Forces to ſend
to apprehend me, making the wind ſerve for a ſpeedy voyage in
foure dayes from <hi>Milford</hi> Haven to the <hi>Downes,</hi> preſently upon
the receiving us into the Ship (which I hope I ſhall ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to the praiſe of our God) being come to <hi>London September</hi> 22.
1643. I applied my ſelfe to enquire into the points forenamed. It
happened that whereas I had this prejudice againſt the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the holineſſe of the children 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. of Legitimation
that no learned Proteſtant had ſo expounded it, meeting with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his notes not long before printed at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I found
him of that opinion, and after him <hi>Muſculus</hi> and <hi>Melancthon;</hi>
and finding that the Sanctification in the forepart of the verſe,
muſt be underſtood of lawfull copulation, expreſſed by <hi>Beza</hi> thus,
<hi>Fidelis uxor poteſt cum infideli marito bona conſcientia conſueſcere,</hi>
which ſenſe only was ſutable to the caſe reſolved by the Apoſtle
whether they might ſtill continue together, I obſerved that the
Apoſtle ſpeaking of the unbeleeving party mentions his unbeliefe,
but when he mentions the Beleever, expreſſeth only the relation
of husband and wife, and that the reaſon of the Apoſtle to prove
their lawfull copulation is an Argument <hi>ab abſurdo</hi> and including
this propoſition. <hi>All thoſe children whereof one of the parents is not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113779:9"/>
ſanctified to the other by lawfull cepulaetion are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,</hi> which being
expounded of federall uncleaneſſe were falſe, and is only true of
baſtardy, I concluded, that it was the meaning of the Apoſtle, and
could be no other. Whereupon when in a meeting of Miniſters
in the City of <hi>London,</hi> the queſtion was propounded what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
there was for Infant-baptiſme, I told my Breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n plainly,
that I doubted there was none. This occaſioned the Diſpute
Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> ſpeakes of which happened about <hi>January</hi> 1643.
Concerning which though ſome gave out I was ſatisfied by it,
others that I was ſo convinced, that I had nothing to ſay, yet the
truth is, this was all the ground of thoſe reports, that having at firſt
ſtood upon it that [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of ſuch <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14.] was meant only
of ſuch like, it being urged that then it could not be a reaſon, why
they ſhould ſuffer thoſe children to be brought to Chriſt, <hi>I</hi> yeelded
that it was to be expounded as <hi>Beza</hi> expounded it, <hi>horum &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milium
ut ſupra,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> expreſſe in my Exercitation, and further
granted that if when Chriſt ſaith [<hi>of theſe is the Kingdom of God</hi>]
he meant of their preſent ſtate of regeneration they might be
baptized, but that our Saviour meant it of their preſent ſtate <hi>I</hi> did
not grant: and <hi>I</hi> further yeelded that <hi>I</hi> ſhould not ſticke at the
baptiſme of an Infant concerning whom <hi>I</hi> ſhould be certified
from God that it was actually regenerate, and beleeving, meaning
no more but this, that ſuch a certificate would warrant me in ſuch
a caſe to baptize, it being all one with a profeſſion of faith, as
ſignes made by a dumbe perſon that he was a Chriſtian would
warrant his baptiſme. This conceſſion being made meerely upon
a ſuppoſition of an extraordinary revelation, firſt Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ke,</hi>
and after him Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> have often urged, though they have
been often tould, that a common rule cannot be drawn from an
extraordinary caſe. Not long after that Conference, my moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and reverend Father in law Maſter <hi>Henry Scudder</hi> fearing
the event of this matter, after ſome writing that paſt betweene us,
adviſed me to draw up the reaſons of my doubts, and he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to preſent them to the Committee choſen (as I conceived it)
to give ſatisfaction about that point, which <hi>I</hi> conceived might
well be by the leave of the Parliament, as the appointing the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
to give ſatisfaction about ſome doubts in taking the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
And if the Committee as a Committe could not do it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113779:9"/>
(which I ſuppoſe they might have done by communicating what
after debate was prepared for the Aſſembly, which I preſume
was, certainly it ſhould have been accurately done with exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of what could be objected, afore thoſe Articles in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory
about this matter were paſſed) yet particular members
might have done ſomewhat to ſatisfie me, who would have been
then, and ſhall be yet ſatisfied with one convincing argument, that
it was Chriſts appointment, that the Infants of Beleevers, becauſe
they are borne of Beleever are to be baptized. According to the
adviſe given in a ſhort ſpace, I firſt drew up the nine firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in my Exercitation, which were delivered as I relate in my
Examen in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March</hi> 1643. and after in <hi>Iuly</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the other three. Which I ſaid in my Examen were delivered
to Maſter <hi>Tuckney,</hi> but Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> tels me he doth deny it,
yet I conceive my Father <hi>Scudder</hi> told me ſo, who I am ſure would
ſpeake truth, and when I read that to him he did not correct me
in it, and Maſter <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> ſtill ſaies he had them after Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Tuckney</hi> had peruſed them. Beſides theſe Papers, that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
might more compendiouſly be given me at the motion of
my reverend Father in law, I ſet down in one page of a Paper in
quarto, the maine ground of my doubt, and delivered it to him,
whether he communicated it to any elſe I know not: my end
was that ſatisfaction to me might more eaſily be procured. This
ſhort thing I after put in my Examen, Part. 2. §. 8. as I ſaid above,
which Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> calls a tedious diſcourſe, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
leſſe then forty lines, and if it had been well anſwered,
might have eaſed Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> of the reſt of his labour. Now
the Papers before named, I perceived were toſſed up and down
from one to another, and it ſeemes Maſter <hi>Edwards</hi> the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
Lecturer at <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> got them, and picking out ſome
paſſages, but concealing others that would have cleared them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of refuting them, with the writing of another which
he joyned with mine, meerly abuſed me in the Pulpit at <hi>Chriſt-Church:</hi>
which I immediately charged him with after his Sermon
in the Veſtry, and he only excuſed it by telling me he named me
not, though there were ſundry Miniſters there that knew he
meant me. But this it ſeemes is like Maſter <hi>Edwards</hi> his juſtice to
other men. In this time <hi>I</hi> attended Maſter <hi>Thomas Goodwins</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113779:10"/>
about that Argument, had the patience to heare Maſter
<hi>Edwards</hi> his diſcourſe at <hi>Chriſt Church,</hi> and read many Treatiſes
and Sermons, in many of which <hi>I</hi> found rather invectives than ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
It happened that the Pariſhioners of <hi>Fanchurch</hi> became
diſaffected to me, and refuſed to heare me, though <hi>I</hi> medled not
at all with that matter in the Pulpit, and <hi>I</hi> perceived my mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
was likely to be withdrawn at the end of the yeare. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
one of the Aſſembly my loving friend, underſtanding that
the Honourable Societies of the <hi>Temples</hi> wanted a Preacher, ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the bringing of me thither. But the matter was by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Houſe of Commons referred to the Aſſembly, who choſe
a Committee to nominate a Preacher for them, of which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> was one, by whom <hi>I</hi> was rejected. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

my anſwer to his argument in writing. Which occaſion <hi>I</hi> tooke
to lay open my condition to him in a Letter, which begot no other
fruit but a little Treatiſe intituled, Infants Baptiſme proved law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
by Scripture. Shortly after in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1644. <hi>I</hi> met with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Marſhal's</hi> Sermon, and finding the vehemency of his ſpirit
againſt Antipaedobaptiſts, and having had experience both of his,
and Maſter <hi>Whites</hi> inflexibleneſſe by my former writings, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no likelihood of imploiment and maintenance for me and

to make a full anſwer to Maſter <hi>Marſhals</hi> Sermon, and finiſhed it
<hi>November</hi> 11. and having with much difficulty tranſcribed one
Copy, and gotten another written for me, <hi>I</hi> ſent my own to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Marſhall,</hi> who received it <hi>December</hi> 9 1644. About a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
after Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſent me word, that he would find a
time to ſpeake with me: <hi>I</hi> ſent him word, that for the returning
anſwer to my writing, <hi>I</hi> would not ſtraiten him; but foraſmuch
as by his rejecting me <hi>I</hi> miſſed being nominated to the <hi>Temple,</hi>
and <hi>I</hi> was then brought to great ſtraights, <hi>I</hi> requeſted that he

                  </gap>lating the ſolemne
Covenant I have taken, and betraying truth and innocency. Decem.</hi> 26.
This begat the friendly conference mentioned by Maſter <hi>Marſhall,</hi>
which was <hi>Decem.</hi> 30. 1644. in the morning afore the Aſſembly
ſate. At the very beginning of that Conference, Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this laſt written meſſage in his hand, &amp; reading thoſe words,
[<hi>and he demands of me a promiſe of ſilence in that point</hi>] told me <hi>that
he did not demand of me a promiſe of ſilence in that point; for that was
beyond his line:</hi> this was his very expreſſion. As ſoon as ever I
heard thoſe words, <hi>I</hi> conceived my ſelfe freed from the ſnare I
moſt feared of making a promiſe, which as the caſe might ſtand,
<hi>I</hi> could not keep with a good conſcience. Then Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi>
ſpake to this effect, that <hi>yet for the ſatisfaction of thoſe who ſhould
enquire of him concerning me, he deſired to know my intentions.</hi>
Whereupon <hi>I</hi> dealt freely, that I intended not to publiſh my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the Pulpit, if <hi>I</hi> might be where <hi>I</hi> ſhould not be put to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize:
for I conceived it not likely, that there would be a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of that thing in this Age, there having been ſo long a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of Infant-Baptiſme, and ſuch a prejudice in men againſt the
oppoſers of it: yet I told him that if any ſhould preach to that
people <hi>I</hi> had charge of, that which <hi>I</hi> conceived to be an errour,
I did reſolve to oppoſe it there, otherwiſe other mens preaching
abroad ſhould be no provocation to me: So that it is cleare, I made
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113779:11"/>
no promiſe, and that intimation of mine intentions which I made
was only, that I intended not to preach my opinion in that place
unleſſe provoked there. And this any man may perceive was my
meaning by Maſter <hi>Marſhals</hi> owne relation, in which the prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
is rightly expreſſed; <hi>That if any ſhould preach in my Pulpit for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
Infants, I tooke my ſelfe bound in the ſame place to preach
againſt it, otherwiſe mens preaching or printing abroad ſhould be no
provocation to me;</hi> to wit, to preach that opinion in that place.
And whereas Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> alleadgeth this for his <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi>
he might have remembred, that I told him in expreſſe termes, that
it Lawes were likely to be enacted to make the deniall of Infant-Baptiſme
penall, I held my ſelfe bound in conſcience to appeare
in publique about that matter: yea, and Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> told me
he intended me ſome animadverſions on my <hi>Examen;</hi> whence it
may be collected, that neither Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> nor my ſelfe had
agreed to lay aſide the diſpute it ſelfe. It is true, Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi>
did endeavour to poſſeſſe me with this, <hi>That Reformation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
might be without altering the uſe of Infant-Baptiſme.</hi> To
which <hi>I</hi> anſwered, that though much might be done other wayes,
yet it would never be right, till Chriſts way of baptizing were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.
About two houres after, Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> comming to me,
in the preſence of Maſter <hi>Obadiah Sedgwicke,</hi> repeating the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of my intention aforenamed, with the proviſo, told me,
<hi>he would give teſtimony in my behalfe as I</hi> deſired. Upon this <hi>I</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Maſter <hi>Marſhall,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Sedgewicke</hi> walking with
me, commended my proceeding in that matter, and made a notion
to me, which came to nothing. Upon this <hi>I</hi> went home very
chearfull, not only becauſe <hi>I</hi> prized amity with Maſter <hi>Marſhall,</hi>
and there was a likely way of my imploiment and maintenance;
but chiefly becauſe <hi>I</hi> was freed from that <hi>I</hi> feared, as a ſnare, the
promiſe of ſilence, and there were great hopes that my brethren
in the Miniſtery would not be rigid in ejecting out of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
and Communion, thoſe that diſſented from them in that
point, and ſo ſeparation and mutuall perſecution might be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(which was and is ſtill the great feare that poſſeſſeth my
ſpirit) and liberty might in time be given for the ſhining forth of
the light in this thing, and by degrees Reformation might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
which <hi>I</hi> conceived the only ſafe and happy way. Upon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113779:11"/>
theſe conſiderations <hi>I</hi> acquainted ſundry of my near friends with

<hi>I</hi> had with Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> in peace and amity: What
Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> did after for me I do not well know, I beleeve he
did as he promiſed, and after a triall of me three Lords-daies at the

Thomas Goodwin, <hi>Maſter</hi> Vines, <hi>and Master</hi> Marſhall, I
take rather to be the effect of a diſtempered palat, than a right-diſcerning
taſte.</p>
            <p>After this, ſundry things happened which did induce me to
yeeld to the importunity of thoſe that ſollicited earneſtly the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of my writings for the publike good. I had ſent to Maſter
<hi>Marſhall</hi> after his returne from <hi>Scotland,</hi> to know what he would
do about the motions I made in the Epilogue of my Examen, for
the diſcuſſing of the point in difference between him and me.
The beſt of the anſwer I received was, that <hi>ſith I had now a place
for my Miniſtery without baptizing Infants, he expected I would be
quiet.</hi> About that time I had occaſion to make triall of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
approbation of me. The Examiner told me, <hi>that there were
many of the Aſſembly that did ſcruple in Conſcience, the giving appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
to me becauſe of my opinion.</hi> The Directory had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
and an Ordinance of Parliament to make the not uſing it
penall. Preparations were to ſend Bills to the King, among which
I aſſured my ſelfe that would be one, which if once paſt, it would
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113779:12"/>
be too late to make an afterplea. The Sermons in publique were
ſtill as earneſt againſt this tenet as ever. The people of the City
much enquired into this matter. A publique diſputation was once
allowed about it to which I was earneſtly ſolicited but for weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reaſons refuſed it. Sundry came to me to requeſt the peruſall
of my papers for their ſatisfaction many learned, godly, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
perſons, both of them that differed in judgement, as well as
thoſe that agreed with me, moved me to have them printed, for
the bringing of truth to light. I ſaw not wherein any danger to
the State or Church might be created by the printing of them, and
which was beyond all to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was confirmed it was a truth I
held, had tried all fit meanes to have it examined, had been guided
in the ſearching of it, and preſerved for this buſineſſe by many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
providences, and thereupon after prayer to God by
my ſelfe, and with others for his direction, I yeelded to the printing
of them, <hi>not out of a restleſſe ſpirit to vent my ſelfe,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi>
imagined, <hi>nor out of any mind to encreaſe the diviſions and confuſions
of the time</hi> (then which there is nothing my ſpirit and waies more
abhorre) but to vindicate truth, performe my duty to which I was
bound by ſolemne Covenant, to do my beſt for the preventing of
that ſad evill of removing out of the Miniſtery, and out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and out of the State alſo them that could not yeeld to
Infant-Baptiſme, which is more likely then any thing to encreaſe
our diviſions, and make tumults, eſpecially if the relations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations
of ſome fiery ſpirits prevaile. And in this, <hi>I</hi> doubt not
but <hi>I</hi> have dealt faithfully to God and to the State, and charitably
to other men, without violating any engagement, what ever <hi>I</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in mine owne perſon. <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe had <hi>I</hi> ſeen any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Aſſembly, or Maſter <hi>Marſhall,</hi> or other leading-men
to examine my writings in a faire Scholaſtike way, and had <hi>I</hi>
had meanes to be able to beare the charges of an impreſſion, and
no Lawes likely to be eſtabliſhed to make the holding of my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
penall, <hi>I</hi> had reſolved not to publiſh my writings in <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
but in <hi>Latine,</hi> and therefore I firſt framed my Exercitation in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
conceiving the Aſſembly would have apprehended my aime
and intention, to be to deale only with Schollars in this matter: but
all things falling out croſſe to my expectation, <hi>I</hi> conceived it was

Pag. 76. <hi>You powre out ſuch abundance of ſcorne upon them, who

frequent in Schooles, and in the moſt temperate wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

them that diſſent from them, ſo that I aſſure my ſelfe, had not my

they would not have been ſo conſtrued. How ever Maſter
<hi>Geree</hi> ſay <hi>all men count my ſleighting opponents a blemiſh to my

that <hi>I</hi> had diſcovered the weakneſſe of the opponents by ſuch
expreſſions, nor did my Father <hi>Scudder</hi> except againſt thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
as offenſive which Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> doth, though more then
halfe was read to him, and obſerved by him of purpoſe to avoid
offence, afore it was ſent to Maſter <hi>Marſhall.</hi> 2. That there were
many reaſons why Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſhould have otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of me in thoſe expreſſions, as namely my Declaration of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113779:13"/>
my intention, and petition thereupon in the prologue of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen,

in the ſame place, Pag. 2. and Part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Sect 7. Pag. 26. and alſo in the

it, when in our friendly conference he had told me, <hi>he did not expect
ſo high expreſſions from me,</hi> which I conceived he meant of my
downright cenſuring of his Arguments, not contemning his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and I told him I conceived it neceſſary to do ſo, becauſe he
called his Arguments undeniable, and had charged the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
with a bloudy ſentence, I deſired an inſtance of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
as was offenſive, which being given by Maſter <hi>Marſhall,</hi>
I left thoſe words out in the printed Book, and would have dealt
ſo with any other, had I conceived it would have been ſo conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
I might adde further, that when Maſter <hi>Geree</hi> came to me the
day he publiſhed his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Booke, a moneth afore Maſter <hi>Marſhals</hi>
Defence came forth, I told him he did not conceive aright of me
in that charge in his Epiſtle Dedicatory, and gave him my reaſon,
and told him that I might have much wrong by it, and deſired that
intimation might be given to Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> thereof. Which
whether he did or no I know not, but I ſuppoſed it might have
occaſioned Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> if he could not alter his Copy, yet to
have added ſomething in the beginning or end of his Book, to
have allayed the aſperity of that charge. But what are thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage

Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> but to paſſe a right cenſure on his Sermons, as I
did in like manner on Doctor <hi>Featlies</hi> Treatiſe, Pag. 143. without
any vilifying of his learning, becauſe I ſaw the eſteem of them
held men in errour. Which is ſo frequent, and juſt a thing, that it

of his diſpute; which were, that <hi>foraſmuch as the promiſes to
Beleevers children are indefinite, as</hi> Acts 2. 39. Luke 19. 8. <hi>God
hath ſo caſt the order of his election, that multitudes come out of the
loynes of his people, that adminiſtration of the Lords Supper and
Baptiſme is to be by a Judgement, that we are to judge any Infant-children
of Beleevers to be holy by parcels, though not all in the
lumpe, that they are therefore to be accounted holy with a reall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

any of theſe Texts, which were the maine he alleadged, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proving that God had ordered his election ſo as for the moſt

Elect by parcels, though not all in the lumpe, nor that Baptiſme
is to be adminiſtred by ſuch a conjecturall or uncertaine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But foraſmuch as I have diſputed at large in my Examen,
Part. 2. Sect. 10. Part 3. Sect. 3. 4. about the promiſes to Beleevers
children, and examined all the Texts forementioned, and ſhewed
that we are not to adminiſter Ordinances by our conjecturall

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113779:16"/>
alleadgeth that paſſage, part 3. of my examination, pag. 36. of
which Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> pag. 94 of his defence ſayes, <hi>This you caſt
away with ſcorne, affirming it to be an eaſie anſwer, becauſe it is
eaſie to be anſwered;</hi> which poſſibly may be thought to have ſome
lepidity (which is ſure but a veniall ſin in one tired, as I was with
hewing at ſuch a knotty piece as Mr. <hi>Marſhalls</hi> Sermon) but how
it ſhould be <hi>a caſting of ſcorne</hi> I ſee not. In the ſame place Mr.
<hi>Marſhall</hi> ſayes, <hi>I make my ſelfe merry</hi> with the word virtuall, as
if the examining the ſenſe of a diſtinction, were making merry
with it, pag. 103. He ſayes, <hi>I wonder you ſhould ſeeke to caſt an</hi>
odium <hi>upon my expreſſion (as you doe here, and ſeverall other times</hi>)
<hi>by ſaying it is a joyning with</hi> Arminius. I anſwer, where I ſaid he
joynes with <hi>Arminius,</hi> I conceive ſtill I ſaid right; not to eaſt an
<hi>odium</hi> upon his expreſſions, but to ſhew the errour of them. And
for that particular <hi>I</hi> charged Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> with, in calling Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,
who ſought juſtification by the works of the law <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
ſeed, he joyns with <hi>Arminius</hi> in his Analyſis, c. 9. <hi>ad Rom.</hi>
and oppoſeth <hi>Bayne,</hi> it was right. For <hi>Arminius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ratio eſt à
duplice ſemine</hi> Abrahami, <hi>quorum unum tantum verbo iſto &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſito
comprehendatur. And this double ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>he calls
the ſons of promiſe, whom he defines, ſunt illi qui fide in Chriſtum
juſtitiam &amp; ſalutem quaerunt, and the children of the fleſh, whom
he defines; qui per opera legis juſtittam, &amp; ſalutem conſectantur.</hi>
(<hi>I</hi> confeſſe it was in my copy through an eaſie, but not materiall
overſight; <hi>conſequuntur,</hi> yet in the Engliſh <hi>I</hi> render it, follow:
but why <hi>this ſhould puzzle</hi> Mr. <hi>Marſhall I</hi> know not) And to
this calling ſome <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, who no otherwiſe were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
ſeed, but in that they profeſſing Judaiſme, ſought righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
by the law, <hi>Bayne</hi> rightly oppoſeth that ſpeech, <hi>that
thoſe that conceive carnally of the law ſeeking righteouſneſſe by it
without ſomething elſe adjoyned, to wit naturall</hi> generation; <hi>are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
called</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> in his Sermon, and
again in his defence, pag. 10. calls thoſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, who
are not ſo by naturall generation, or by faith; <hi>but are Proſelytes,
ſeeking Iuſtification by the works of the Law:</hi> Which is the very
ground of <hi>Arminius</hi> his perverting the ninth of the <hi>Romans</hi> to
maintain his opinion of reſpective Predeſtination. As for Maſter
<hi>Marſhall's</hi> vindication of himſelfe, it goes upon this miſtake, as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113779:16"/>
if <hi>I</hi> had charged him with agreeing with <hi>Arminius</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the ninth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in his opinion of election
upon foreſeen faith, whereas <hi>I</hi> only charged him with joyning
with <hi>Arminius</hi> in this particular, to call the Proſelytes that were
Jewes by profeſſion, but ſought righteouſneſſe by the law, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
ſeed; pag. 105. Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſayes, that <hi>I try all my wits
and artifices to ſhake the ſtrength of his ſecond concluſion by ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſpeeches, &amp;c.</hi> The truth is, <hi>I</hi> was put to the triall of all my wits
to find out the meaning of his ſecond concluſion; but as for the
ſtrength of it, it is ſo ſmall, that he that can but ſhew the ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
in it, may refute it without much adoe. As for the ſcornfull
ſpeeches Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> can find but one, which was the calling
of his ſecond concluſion, <hi>a Cothurnus;</hi> which <hi>I</hi> never dream't
would have been taken for an expreſſion of ſcorne, but a prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall
phraſe ſignifying an ambiguous ſpeech uſed by <hi>David Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi>
in his judgement on the 5 Articles ſent to the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi>
and by others the moſt grave, and ſolid Divines, <hi>I</hi> ſaid, pag. 54.
<hi>That Mr.</hi> Marſhall <hi>did very carnally imagine the Church of God to
be like civill corporations,</hi> this he calls pag. 121. <hi>a ſcornfull puffe,</hi> but
why he ſhould call it ſo, <hi>I</hi> am yet to ſeek. pag. 124. he ſayes, that
<hi>I ſleight and ſcorn that which I know nor how to anſwer,</hi> but it
would be hard for Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> to verify this in any particular;
pag. 133. he calls the uſe of the word <hi>Coccyſme</hi> very frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Schollars, and of the ſame meaning with <hi>Crambe</hi> uſed by

pag. 63. of my Examen, <hi>your argument needs a ſwimmer of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los
<hi>to bring it out of the deep,</hi> this he calls pag. 134. <hi>my method to

my anſwer is to deny the concluſion, that I ſhew no faultineſſe either
in the matter, or the forme of the argument, that the ſcope that I
mention is but a meer figment; that I doe as good as ſay that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectour
can make no argument out of it, and that therefore I need
make no anſwer. And that in one place I grant the minor, then the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113779:17"/>
major; and thus you moſt gallantly vapour upon me: and after, I
durſt leave all Schollers to judge, whether my anſwer deſerves all
this ſcorne;</hi> and after, <hi>you thought to carry it with more advantage
to you by ſcoffing, then by ſolemn refuting;</hi> and after. <hi>Truly Sir, I
am perſwaded all learned men either laugh at, or pity this vanity of
your diſputing;</hi> and pag. 164 <hi>not once ſuſpecting I ſhould have
met with an adverſary ſo uningenious to ſay no worſe, who would
have ſaid the balking of this queſtion, had been the yeelding of the

Marſhall. I</hi> did not ſay, <hi>his anſwer is to deny the concluſion,</hi> but thus,
<hi>I find no anſwer to the argument here, except it be an anſwer to an
argument to deny the concluſion.</hi> Nor doe <hi>I</hi> ſay, <hi>that the baulking
of the queſtion, whether the beleever, when he commits fornication
with an infidell, remove the barre in the unbeleeving party, as that
the child is (in the beleeving parents right) to be reckoned to belong
to the covenant of Grace, and Church of God, had been the yeelding
of the Cauſe, which he makes my uningenuity.</hi> 2. The paſſages on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taxe a defect in Logick in <hi>Mr. Marſhall</hi> in that place, but doe
indeed containe neither <hi>matter of ſcorn, nor gallant vapouring.</hi>
3. And however <hi>learned men pitty or laugh at the vanity of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,
I</hi> doubt not to make it appeare; that neither <hi>Mr. Marſhall</hi>
nor <hi>Mr. Geree</hi> have yet made an anſwer to that argument, which
doth overthrow his expoſition of federall holineſſe, that though
<hi>Mr. Geree</hi> ſayes there was <hi>ignoratio Elenchi,</hi> yet indeed there is
no <hi>ignoratio Elenchi,</hi> the thing being concluded that was to be
concluded; and whereas <hi>Mr. Marſhall</hi> firſt new makes the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,
and then denies it, he deales not rightly in putting in words
to anothers argument, and yet the major is rather true with his
addition, and then <hi>Mr. Marſhall</hi> puts a minor of his owne; and
denies it. But the truth is, the argument ſhould be thus framed:
<hi>That holineſſe which might be though one of the Parents, were
not ſanctified to the other, is not here meant; but faederall holineſſe
might be, though one of the Parents were not ſanctified to the other.</hi>

left it out of purpoſe, that it might not be ſo taken; conceiving <hi>Mr.
Marſhall</hi> would have conſtrued it (as even grave Scholars uſe it)
to ſignify an attempt that is faire in ſhew, but vaine in the iſſue.
pag. 122. I ſay of <hi>Mr. Marſhall's</hi> conſequence which he called
undeniable and clear, thus: <hi>if you apprehend clear conſequence in it,
you may enjoy your conceii; nos non ſumus adeò ſagaces, we are

truth is that was not mine intent, but the griefe of my ſpirit when
I wrote this, being then rejected by <hi>Mr. Marſhall</hi> in the buſines
of the Temple, being told that it was the Aſſemblies rule not to
nominate any to a place in the miniſtery that queſtioned the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
of infants, pinched with the ſadneſſe of my condition, and
conſidering how the Magiſtrate was incited againſt ſuch as could
not ſubſcribe to <hi>Mr. Marſhalls</hi> judgement, upon his reaſons
which he called undeniable, an indignation that men ſhould be
undone for not aſſenting to ſo poore proofes, made me after I ſaw
my <hi>exercitation</hi> ſtirred not to uſe that quickneſſe in thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
which I am perſwaded, had I not done, the point would

               </gap>t alſo in all ſorts of Auditories,
with much ingemination to make the perſons that queſtion the
baptizing of Infants odious, and unſufferable in a Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and to ſtop mens eares againſt ſuch evidence as may
cleare the truth in this matter. To this therefore, as being an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
in the mouth of all ſorts of men againſt the Ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
<hi>I</hi> thought it beſt to anſwer: 1. By granting <hi>much of the
relation to be true, though perhaps vehemency of oppoſition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath made
matters more, or worſe then they were, as it is wont to be in ſuch caſes.</hi>
To this Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſaies, <hi>that he is confident I ſhew more good
will to the Anabaptiſts, then intend ill will againſt thoſe worthy men
who have written thoſe ſtories. I</hi> do take with the right hand this
charitable opinion in Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> of my intentions, and I
plainly reply, that the truth is, that I did uſe thoſe words, neither
out of partiall good will to the one, nor partiall ill will to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but out of a deſire to remove that prejudice, which hindered
men from examining the Truth. As for the men I abhorre the
wicked practiſes of the one, yea ſo much the more I abhorre he
practiſes of them that would ſo ſolemnly by baptiſme engage
themſelves to be Chriſt Diſciples, and yet act ſuch monſtrous
villanies, as having learned that the more profeſſion a man
makes of holineſſe, the more accurſed is his wickedneſſe; and
for the other, I beare as much good will to the memory of
them, as if they had agreed with me in opinion. I hope I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113779:20"/>
ſhall never make agreement with me in opinion, the reaſon
or rule of my love, but relation to Jeſus Chriſt, appearing in
holineſſe of life. Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſaies, <hi>that the things are not
to be queſtioned, and that he thinks that I am the firſt of our Divines
who have ſuſpected them to overlaſh in their relations.</hi> To this <hi>I</hi> ſay,
my words are plaine, <hi>that much of this is true I make no queſtion,</hi>
meaning the maine of the relations, that the men denied bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
of Infants, and that they brake out into ſuch turbulent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
as are related of them. That which I added <hi>though perhaps
vehemency of oppoſition hath made matters more, or worſe then they
were, as it is wont to be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch caſes,</hi> meaning this, of ſome particular
circumſtances in ſome perſons, was not becauſe <hi>I</hi> ſuſpected the
overlaſhing of the Hiſtorians, as if they wanted fidelity, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
many things were brought to the publike knowledge by the
Biſhop and Canons of <hi>Munſter,</hi> their partiſans who were Papiſts,
and would aggravate all things to the moſt to make the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Reformation become odious; as <hi>Studley</hi> did in the accident of
<hi>Euoch ap Evan killing</hi> his mother and brother, or elſe by captives or
deſertors, who for favour or mercy would frame their tales, as they
conceived might further their ends and becauſe experience of the
uncertainty of the manner of carrying things in our times, hath
made me ſpeake warily concerning things paſt. And to ſpeake
plainly, when I conſider what <hi>Hooker</hi> relates out of <hi>Guy de Bres</hi>
of the ſeeming holineſſe of the generality of them, their Orthodox
confeſſion at firſt mentioned by Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> from Maſter
<hi>Dury</hi> his knowledge, the proceedings and parts of <hi>Bernardus Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus</hi>
and ſome others, the things mentioned by my Examen,
Part, 2. Sect. 3. the teſtimonies of <hi>Gualter,</hi> and <hi>Caſſander,</hi> that the
commotions in <hi>Germany</hi> began from oppreſſion in the State, that
<hi>Luther</hi> wrot to the Germane Princes againſt their opreſſions, the
ſtrange ſpirit of <hi>Lutherans</hi> ever ſince, and the wofull tragedies of
<hi>Germany</hi> in this laſt age, I do count the ſtory of the Anabaptiſts to
containe in it many things, the true reaſons of which, and the true
knowledge of the circumſtances concerning them will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
till the day of the revelation of the righteous judgement of
God. 2. I aſſigned ſome poſſible meanes of the turbulent carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
and errours of the Anabaptiſts, beſide their opinion of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paedobaptiſme.
To which Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſaies, <hi>he can hardly

gueſſe whether I int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

blame the Reformed Churches for not hearing them, or to hint it as
a warning to our ſelves.</hi> I anſwer, I did it to ſhew there might be
other reaſons of thoſe tumults and diviſions that the Anabaptiſts
fell into, then the opinion of Antipaedobaptiſme; ſundry of which,
if not all I think happened in their caſe. Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſaies, <hi>he
never read that they ſought Reformation in a regular way, or were
denied it, before they fell into thoſe furies.</hi> How farre they ſought it
I cannot tell, it is plaine that <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> and <hi>Pelargus</hi> and ſome
ſay <hi>Melancthon</hi> would have reformed it in <hi>Saxony,</hi> had not <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
pertinacy in that as well as Conſubſtantiation, and Images
withſtood it; and how <hi>Baltazar Huebmer</hi> ſought it at <hi>Zurich,</hi>
and was denied, it, is known. I thinke the Reformed Churches
have been to blame, and ſo may be our preſent Reformers, that
they have never yeelded to reforme it in a regular way; and if
<hi>Anabaptiſts have never ſought it afore me,</hi> it hath been it's likely,
becauſe they ſaw mens ſpirits ſo bent againſt them, that they
thought it in vaine, yea they have beene rather forced to
conceale themſelves, it having beene accounted criminall, juſtly
deſerving excomunication, deprivation, and ſometimes death, ſo
much as to queſtion it. And that the Anabaptiſts have been ſo caſt
out and rendered odious as they have been hath been the reaſon
why they have been forced to become a Sect (which I do not
juſtifie) and by reaſon thereof, factious ſpirits have joyned with
them, and perverted them with other errours, which perhaps had
not happened, had th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

man willing to gratifie others, and to ſerve the common good,

are many that can make report of my labours in the places where
God hath diſpoſed of me, there are none that can give one inſtance,

Infirmities <hi>I</hi> have, and thoſe many, but ſure the whole courſe of
my actions are a plea for me againſt this imputation of a braving,

was ſo farre from the braving humour, that, as may be perceived
by the relation above, neceſſity engaged me to it, not ſelfe
confidence, and an humour of oſtentation. The truth is, there were
other arguments that I had entered upon, before <hi>I</hi> was engaged
in this matter, as namely againſt the mortality of the ſoule, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
grace, the Antinomian errours about juſtification, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

offered, and Maſter <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> in his Lectures about

[<hi>and of all other promiſes of the Covenant of Grace</hi>] which is not

out of the <hi>Directory,</hi> that <hi>if there be not a promiſe of theſe ſaving
graces to Infants, in vaine are they baptized, and the ſeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is put to

which was indeed my reaſon, which was this, <hi>Maſter</hi> Marſhal's
<hi>ſecond concluſion is to be underſtood as the words in the Directory,</hi>
this Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> grants, <hi>but the words of the Directory ſpeake
of a promiſe of ſaving Grace.</hi> This I prove, 1. Becauſe the ſame
promiſe is ſaid to be made to the Beleevers ſeed, which is made
to Beleevers, for it were a ſtrange equivocation to underſtand the
ſame terme in the ſame propoſition in two different ſenſes, but
the promiſe made to Beleevers there meant, is the promiſe of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Grace, <hi>ergo</hi> ſo is the promiſe to their ſeed. 2. Becauſe the
words ſpeake of the ſame promiſe before, in the direction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

petition, elſe there would be a <hi>Cathurnus,</hi> which were abſurd,
but in the petition they mean the promiſes of ſaving Grace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo in the Doctrine. As for that which Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi>
makes my concluſion from the words of the <hi>Directory, that in
vaine are they baptized, the Seale is put to a blanke:</hi> It is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

is, it is to be preſumed in charity of all the Infants of Beleevers, that

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:113779:26"/>
that in the <hi>Directory</hi> the promiſe is meant of ſaving Grace, yet
he hath invented another ſhift to ſave the credit of the aſſertion

be taken as I conceive it is, is ſo <hi>manifeſtly againſt Proteſtant prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
and <hi>experience</hi> that none can hold it. But who would ever
conſtrue thoſe words, <hi>The promiſe is made to Beleevers and their

that they enjoy the inward graces of the promiſe, till they

to Beleevers</hi>] any otherwiſe then thus, the promiſe of ſaving Grace
is made by God to Beleevers? and muſt the ſame phraſe in the
ſame propoſition in the other part be conſtrued thus [<hi>the promiſe
is made to the ſeed of Beleevers</hi>] that is, <hi>it is to be preſumed by men
in charity till they diſcover the contrary, that all the Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
have the inward graces of the Covenant.</hi> As if the making
of a Covenant were all one with a charitable preſumption, or the
ſeed of Beleevers were all one with Infants, or when they are
adulti they are not their ſeed. The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. when he
expounded the promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. of the ſpirituall, not the naturall
ſeed, did not imagine, that the making the promiſe was mans act
of preſumption, but Gods act, and <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. (to which and <hi>Gen.</hi>
17. 7. it's likely the <hi>Directory</hi> alludes) the promiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Maſter <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi>

that the whole ſeries of the direction in the <hi>Directory</hi> carries
the meaning thus. For having ſaid, that <hi>Baptiſme is a Seale of the
Covenant of Grace, of our ingrafting into Chriſt, and of our union
with him, of remiſſion of ſins, regeneration, adoption, and life eternall,</hi>
it followes after, <hi>that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

within the Church, have by their birth intereſt in the Covenant,
and right to the Seale of it, and to the outward priviledges of the
Church, &amp;c.</hi> where the <hi>Directory</hi> makes a threefold intereſt: Firſt
intereſt in the Covenant. Secondly, right to the Seale of it. Thirdly,
right to the outward priviledges of the Church, the Covenant,
Seale, and outward Priviledges of the Church are put as diſtinct
things, and the Covenant they have intereſt in, is the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:113779:27"/>
of which Baptiſme is a Seale, as is plaine by the Pronoune
[<hi>it</hi>] which imports the ſame thing: Now Baptiſme is before ſaid
to be <hi>the Seale</hi> of the Covenant of ſaving Graces, therefore the
Covenant that the ſeed of Beleevers have intereſt in by their birth
according to the <hi>Directory,</hi> is the Covenant of ſaving Graces.
Which ſith Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> dares not aſſert, and Mr <hi>Geree</hi> ſaith

be laid to heart, and that the Aſſembly would remember that
which they ſay Pag 30. of the anſwer to the Remonſtrance of the

be ignorant how our Divines owne the outward adminiſtration of
the Covenant under the notion of Foedus externum and the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
grace of it under the notion of Foedus internum: and that ſtill I

<hi>I</hi> have met with that diſtinction of <hi>foedus externum &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>

of the thing ſignified for the ſigne, as the text it ſelfe expounds it;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113779:27"/>
and I confeſſe that the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28. diſtinguiſheth of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
outward in the fleſh, and circumciſion of the heart:</hi> but
no where in Scripture doe <hi>I</hi> meet with the diſtinction of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and inward Covenant, nor doe <hi>I</hi> conceive the expreſſion
right. For if the diſtinction be only <hi>diſtinctio nominis,</hi> it ſhould
be thus, Covenant is taken either properly or improperly by a
trope, and not Covenant is either outward or inward, if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
be <hi>diſtinctio rei:</hi> then there is ſome common notion of a
Covenant thus diſtributed, and ſo the ſenſe muſt be; ſome Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
that is, promiſes (for the nature of a Covenant is a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or ſingle promiſe) are either externall or internall, and this
may be underſtood either in reſpect of the making of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and ſo it is not right for all promiſes in that ſenſe are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
none internall for afore it be declared by ſome tranſeunt act
it is not a promiſe, but an intention or elſe it may be underſtood
in reſpect of the thing promiſed, and it is confeſſed that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
inward, and outward good things, and if this were the
meaning <hi>I</hi> ſhould not much except againſt it, though <hi>I</hi> ſhould like
it better to expreſſe it thus. The things covenanted are outward or
inward, which is plain and eaſie to be underſtood, then to ſay,
the Covenant is outward, or inward. But Mr <hi>Marſhall by the
outward Covenant means the outward adminiſtration of it, and by
the inward Covenant the ſpirituall grace of it.</hi> According to which
explication the diſtinction is not agreeable to Logick rules, nor
can ſtand Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> in any ſtead, but to convince him of trifling
and equivocating in his firſt argument, and two firſt concluſions.
<hi>Trifling I</hi> ſay in his firſt argument. For the firſt argument was
this. <hi>The infants of beleeving parents are foederati, therefore they
muſt be ſignati.</hi> Now Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> will not have the antecedent
underſtood of the inward Covenant, that is the ſpirituall grace;
he blames me for that, and he himſelfe rejects it in that ſenſe;
then the ſenſe muſt be, the infants of beleeving parents are <hi>foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
that is in the outward Covenant of Grace, that is according
to <hi>Mr Marſhall</hi> in the outward adminiſtration of the Covenant.
Now what is the outward adminiſtration he expreſſeth pag. 48.
of his Sermon, <hi>calling Baptiſme the new adminiſtration, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
the old.</hi> This then is <hi>Mr Marſhals</hi> argument. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of beleevers are in the outward Covenant, that is, in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113779:28"/>
outward adminiſtration, meaning Baptiſme or Circumciſion;
this is the antecedent, the conſequent or concluſion is, therefore
they muſt be <hi>ſignati;</hi> that is, baptized or circumciſed. But is not
this a meer inept tautology; all one as to prove they muſt bebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
becauſe they muſt be baptized; all one as to argue, he muſt have
<hi>enſem,</hi> becauſe he muſt have <hi>gladium;</hi> this is <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this is <hi>Pauls</hi> letter. <hi>I</hi> ſaid equivocating. For by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<hi>Mr Marſhall</hi> makes ſhew of one thing in the firſt concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but meanes another in the ſecond. For he had ſaid concluſion
the firſt, <hi>The Covenant of Grace for ſubſtance hath been alwayes
the ſame,</hi> and pag. 10. he ſhewes wherein lies the ſubſtance of
it; to wit, the ſpirituall part; now who would not have expected
that the ſecond concluſion ſhould be meant of the ſame Covenant
to wit the inward; ſith he ſayes, pag. 26. <hi>The proving the two firſt
concluſions gains the whole cauſe, if the Covenant be the ſame, and
children belong to it, then they are to be owned as Covenanters?</hi>
yea, and his firſt text to prove the ſecond concluſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39.
he himſelfe expounds it of <hi>Chriſt and ſaving benefits by him.</hi> But
it ſeems <hi>Mr Marſhal's</hi> heart failes him, he found that aſſertion
too hot for him, though that be the ordinary aſſertion, in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,
in books and Sermons, inſomuch that it is an uſuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
to ſay <hi>infants are confederates with their beleeving parents
in the Covenant of Grace;</hi> and therefore now, the ſecond conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>that the children of beleevers belong to the Covenant of Grace,</hi>
muſt be underſtood in another ſenſe then as the Covenant of
Grace is taken in the firſt concluſion, which is to equivocate. Yea
further by reading <hi>Mr Marſhalls</hi> defence, pag. 92. and elſewhere
<hi>I</hi> ſuſpect there is a farther equivocation in <hi>Mr Marſhalls</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which <hi>Mr Marſhall</hi> it ſeems doth not perceive, divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
being by him taken as the ſame, which are not the ſame;
nor to be confounded. For, pag. 92. <hi>Mr Marſhall</hi> ſpeaks thus;
<hi>I concluded therefore that by Gods own will, ſuch as enter into
Covenant ought to receive the ſeale,</hi> which ſeems to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
by which the ſequele of <hi>Mr Marſhalls</hi> firſt argument is
to be proved, ſo that he ſeems to frame the Syllogiſme entirely
thus. They that enter into Covenant ought to receive the ſeale,
but the children of beleevers enter into Covenant, therefore they
ought to receive the ſeale; ſo that the minor ſeems to him to be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:113779:28"/>
all one with this Propoſition: <hi>the children are foederati,</hi> which is
elſewhere expounded of the outward Covenant, or the right to
be baptized, but to have right to be baptized, is not all one with
entring into Covenant. Entring into Covenant is ſome act far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then having of right; for a perſon may have right to Baptiſm
before he enters into Covenant. <hi>Mr Marſhall</hi> ſhould have heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
diſtinguiſhed the Covenant of Grace, which is Gods act in
his promiſe of grace; and belongs to none but thoſe he hath made
that promiſe to, and the outward adminiſtration, which is the
adminiſtratours act; and not have called it the Covenant, and the
entring into Covenant with God, which is the act of the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and cannot be done ordinarily by an infant, who is onely
paſſive, and makes no promiſe at Baptiſme; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be rightly ſaid to enter into Covenant with God. The want
of ſuch diſtinctneſſe in expreſſion ſerves for no other purpoſe but
to puzzle a reader, and the very truth is, the argument which Mr
<hi>Marſhall,</hi> Mr <hi>Geree,</hi> Doctor <hi>Homes,</hi> &amp;c. bring from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Seale for the baptizing Infants, if it be well ſifted, is
either a Tautology, or an equivocation; as I may more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhew, if ever I have liberty to examine their intangled diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

ſaith, <hi>to all this you aſſent, and conſequently that there is nothing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
according to the Word, but a viſible right.</hi> But Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:113779:29"/>
addes; and <hi>then what will become of all your pleading, That becauſe
we cannot know that all Infants of Beleevers have the inward Grace,
we may not therefore baptize them.</hi> This Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> makes all
my pleading, but Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> neither doth nor can ſhew that
this is all or any part of my pleading. Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> Pag. 222.
hath theſe words: <hi>And as for that you adde, That Baptiſme is to be
adminiſtred, not to them who may have Grace, but to them who have
it. Then it ſeemes they are all wrongly baptized who have not inward
grace.</hi> But how doth this follow from my words, with any ſhew
of right deduction? That becauſe <hi>I</hi> ſay, it is not enough that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
be adminiſtred to perſons, in that they may have Grace, but it
is to be adminiſtred to them that have it, that therefore it ſeemes
they are all wrongly baptized who have not inward Grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
my ſpeech had been, that it is to be adminiſtred to none but
them that have it, which cannot be drawne from my words, till it
be proved that every affirmative propoſition is excluſive, which
true Logick will diſclaime. He that ſaith, A Coate is not a mans
becauſe he may buy it, but becauſe he hath bought it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that he only hath a Coate by right that hath bought it, for he
may have right to it another way, <hi>viz.</hi> by legacy My pleading is,
becauſe we have no command, we cannot baptize Infants without
will-worſhip according to ordinary rule, ſith the command is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to baptize Diſciples, or ſuch as profeſſe faith. I grant that if any
be a reall actuall Beleever that cannot ſpeake, yet if he profeſſe the
Faith by other ſignes, or God do reveale it for him he may be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
by the force of <hi>Philips</hi> rule, <hi>Acts</hi> 8 38. and <hi>Peters</hi> ſpeech,
<hi>Acts</hi> 10 47. But he that ſaith, reall actuall Beleevers may be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
doth not thereby affirme that they only are to bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.

All Crowes are black, therefore only Crowes are black,
is no good argument. Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> tels me Pag 95. <hi>that he is
confident, that I who durſt baptize an Infant known to be regenerate,
durſt not give the other Sacrament to it; becauſe more is required to
make them capable of that Sacrament, then is required to make them
capable of Baptiſme: a regenerate Infant I thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an actuall believer I ſhould as ſoone give the Lords ſupper as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme

beget ſelfe examination and diſcerning the Lords body. And thus
I have anſwered that accuſation of ſpending a whole ſheet of

<hi>problematicall Hereticks,</hi> by declaiming and exciting the Magiſtrate
againſt thoſe as Hereticks, of whom it is uncertaine whether they
hold an errour or no. As for Maſter <hi>Marſhals</hi> reaſons, they are
not convincing to me, nor is the holding rebaptization ſuch a new
opinion as he would make it. And for the other it is <hi>no out-leape,</hi>
but a queſtion that lay in my way by reaſon of Maſter <hi>Marſhals</hi>
words, and exceeding neceſſary to be reſolved, conſidering that
otherwiſe thoſe Miniſters and people that cannot agree about the
validity of Infant-baptiſme, or adult-baptiſme, ſuppoſed not to be
rightly done, for want of a right Miniſtery, or power to give the
Spirit, or the manner of it's adminiſtration, muſt of neceſſity ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113779:32"/>
none is to be admitted to the Lords Supper till he be rightly
baptized: which I profeſſe is to be ſtood upon in point of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for right order; yet if it be ſtood upon in point of conſcience,
ſo as in no caſe the contrary is to be permitted, it will of neceſſity
make many ſuperſtitious perplexities in Miniſters, and inferre ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
an unneceſſary Schiſme, this being not a ſufficient reaſon for a
refuſall of Communion, becauſe a Godly perſon takes his baptiſme
to be right, though I know the contrary. Nor do I thinke the thing
either ſuch a new opinion or practiſe. For beſides, that it may be
doubted whether all the Apoſtles were baptized, as ſuppoſe
<hi>Matthew</hi> (which is as probable for the negative as the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive)
yet were admitted to the Lords Supper by Chriſt himſelfe:
when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great and others did differre their baptiſme
ſo long, it is not likely they never received the Lords Supper afore
their baptiſme. Nor is it inconſiſtent with my grants: For what
though I grant <hi>that Baptiſme is the way and manner of ſolemne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
into the Church,</hi> meaning the regular way, yet it followes
not that none may receive in any caſe afore baptized. Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi>
holds Ordinatination by a Presbytery is the regular way of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
admiſſion into the office of publike Preaching, and it may
be fit by an Eccleſiaſticall Canon to order it ſo; yet I thinke it will
not be denied, but that there may be caſes, wherein a perſon may
lawfully be a publike Preacher without ſuch ordination. The other
grant which Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſaies is mine, was never expreſſed
by me ſo rawly as he laies it downe. It is not as he puts it downe,
<hi>that nothing is to be doue about the Sacraments, whereof we have not
either inſtitution or example:</hi> but as Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> might have
perceived if he had heeded my words, Examen, Pag. 28. Pag. 110.
Pag. 152. <hi>That no poſitive worſhip, or eſſentiall, or ſubſtantiall part of
it, is to be done without inſtitution by precept, or Apoſtolicall example,</hi>
I never denied, that many things pertaining to circumſtance and
order may be done about the Sacraments without either, and of
this kind I conceive Baptizing afore eating the Lords Supper to
be. As for <hi>itch after new opinions,</hi> why are not Doctor <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> and
Maſter <hi>Gataker,</hi> and indeed all that cleere truth more fully then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
cenſured in the like manner? I wiſh if my words would take

<hi>Marſhall,</hi> to ſhew that I was not the only man that queſtioned,
whether his proofes for Infant-baptiſme were ſo undeniable as he

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:113779:33"/>
For if <hi>however Circumciſion and Baptiſme agree or differ wee
muſt looke to the inſtitution,</hi> and the agreement is not enough to
conclude, that Baptiſme belongs onely to members in Church-Covenant,
and their children, becauſe it was ſo in Circumciſion
without an inſtitution, as the <hi>new England Elders</hi> reaſon, by the
ſame reaſon <hi>however Baptiſme and Circumciſion agree or differ:</hi> yet
Baptiſme will not belong to Infants, becauſe Circumciſion did ſo
by vertue of proportion, without an inſtitution, which if Mr <hi>Ball</hi>
or Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> could ſhew, they needed not trouble us with the
Command about Circumciſion of male infants, to prove Infant-Baptiſme,
which is indeed to maintain that the ceremoniall ſaw
ſtill binds, which is plain Judaiſme. But what ſayes Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi>
to this? <hi>If Mr Marſhall cut the ſinewes of the argument from
Circumciſion to Baptiſme, himſelfe was very much miſtaken in his
his own meaning and intention, becauſe in the ſame place he makes
them parallell in this, and I might have done well to have informed
the reader ſo much.</hi> I was told, there was a very intelligent man
that ſaid he was ſorry that <hi>I</hi> had <hi>Mr Marſhall</hi> for my <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi>
as knowing him to be apt to miſtake, which he conceived would
be a vexation to me, and indeed <hi>I</hi> find his words true. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>I</hi> ſaid only Mr <hi>Ball's words, cut the ſinewes of that argument;</hi> M.
<hi>Mar.</hi> miſtakes it as if <hi>I</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Mr Ball intends to cut the ſinews
of that argument, and that then he was miſtaken in his own meaning
and intentions. I</hi> confeſſe it were a very ſtrange thing to charge ſo

But I wonder the leſſe at <hi>Mr Marſhalls</hi> raſhneſſe in accuſing the
Anabaptiſts, when he is not aſhamed to tell me thus, pag. 238 of

no more promiſe for the one, then for the other:</hi> whereas
when he hath ſaid as much as he can for them, he can bring no
more promiſe for them then I doe, nor dares reject the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I reſtraine them by?</p>
            <p>But ſayes Mr <hi>Marſhall, you leave them to have their actuall
ſtanding in the viſible kingdome of the Devill.</hi> I ask whither the
children have actuall ſtanding in the viſible kingdome of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
afore they are baptized or not? If he ſay they have not, then
by not baptizing, I leave them not in the viſible kingdome of the
Devill, they are out of the viſible kingdome of the Devill, though
they be not baptized: if he ſay they have their actuall ſtanding in
the viſible kingdome of the Devill afore they are baptized, then
how is it true which the Proteſtants diſputing againſt <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
alleage againſt the neceſſity of baptizing infants to ſalvation, that
the children of beleevers are holy afore baptiſme. The truth is, I
neither leave infants in the Devills, nor Gods viſible kingdome:
for I conceive they are in neither kingdom viſibly till they declare
by their profeſſion to whom they belong viſibly. Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
often this expreſſion of <hi>belonging to the viſible kingdom of the
Devill,</hi> and I told him <hi>Examen</hi> pag. 41. <hi>I feared he did it ad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum
populum, to move the people,</hi> by affrighting them by a bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113779:37"/>
word, if they keep their children from baptiſme, then they
leave them to have an actuall ſtanding in the viſible kingdome of
the Devill, or to pleaſe them by making them beleeve that by
baptiſme their children are put out of the viſible kingdome of the
Devill. This <hi>I</hi> ſaid <hi>not judging his heart,</hi> but being jealous leaſt it
was ſo; and <hi>I</hi> confeſſe <hi>I</hi> am ſtill ſuſpicious he doth ſo, becauſe he
ſtill uſeth it after he hath been told it, and it is a meer engine to
ſtirre popular affections. For how hath the unbaptized infant an
actuall ſtanding in the viſible kingdome of the Devill; unleſſe it be
true that all unbaptized perſons have an actuall ſtanding in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
kingdome of the Devill, which is falſe in the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> of
old, the converted theefe on the Croſſe, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and
many others who were in the viſible kingdom of the Chriſt afore
they were baptized. On the other ſide, thouſands of people in
<hi>America</hi> baptized by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had as viſible ſtanding in the
Devills kingdome as before. <hi>I</hi> confeſſe when the baptized pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
the faith of Chriſt, then baptiſme is a note of a viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and a <hi>diſtinguiſhing badge between the people of God and the
Devill,</hi> and ſo by baptiſme a perſon is exhibited a member of the
Church, but otherwiſe <hi>I</hi> ſee no reaſon why an infant that makes
no profeſſion of Chriſt, ſhould be counted after baptiſme a viſible
member of the Church more then before. Let a child of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
be baptized, and after being an infant, and taken by a Turke,
be circumciſed, wherein is that child more a viſible member of
the Church of Chriſt then a Turkes child, or is hee not rather a
member of the Church of Mahomet, then of Chriſt? Are the
<hi>Janizaries</hi> any whit the more Chriſtians becauſe they were
baptized infants of Chriſtian Greekes? Proteſtant writers are
wont to define the viſible Church of Chriſtians a <hi>number of
perſons that profeſſe the faith of Chriſt.</hi> So Art. 19 of the Church
of England, and all ſorts of Proteſtant writers. Now that which
makes the viſible Church, makes each member a viſible member,
and that is profeſſion. Baptiſme and the Lords Supper; and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
are notes as they ſignify profeſſion, otherwiſe if a perſon be
baptized, if he ſhould heare or receive the Lords Supper, and did
not profeſſe the faith, he ſhould not be a viſible member for all
that. I confeſſe I have met with ſome writings which put Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
into the definition of the Church, as neceſſary to the being
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113779:38"/>
of a viſible Church, and the words in the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith of the</hi>
7 <hi>Churches of Anabaptiſts about London [being baptized into that
faith</hi>] Artic. 33. are ſomewhat doubtfull, though they ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to import that Baptiſme is neceſſary to the right order of a
Chriſtian Church, then to the being of a Church; and I confeſſe
they that hold that members are added to the Church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
and not otherwiſe, and hold a nullity of Paedo baptiſme,
muſt needs ſay the Churches that have no other then Infant-Baptiſme,
are no true Churches; nor their members Church-members,
as Maſter <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſhall</hi> ſayes pag. 84. of his <hi>Defence;</hi>
and ſo voluntary ſeparation neceſſary. But theſe points of the
neceſſity of right Baptiſme, not onely to the right order, but alſo
to the being of a viſible Church and Church-member, and ſo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
ſeparation barely for the defect of it, I have ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed;
as conſidering the many errours and ill conſequences
that would follow thereupon, and though provocations ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
yet <hi>I</hi> have in my practiſe ſhunned ſeparation from my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
brethren, and <hi>I</hi> preſume though Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> count right
Baptiſme a neceſſary duty, yet he will be more adviſed then to
make it eſſentiall, either <hi>conſtitutivè</hi> or <hi>conſecutivè</hi> to the being
of a Church or Chriſtian either viſible or inviſible, for feare of
giving too much advantage to Separatiſts, and Seekers. <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe
in reference to the preſent point this is the truth, that however e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
infant is either in the inviſible kingdome of God or Satan,
that is, elect or reprobate; yet no child till hee make profeſſion
doth viſibly belong either to the one, or to the other. <hi>I</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that in the viſible Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the infants were
reckoned to the Church, and the reaſon was from the peculiar
Church-ſtate of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> For then God took the whole
family of <hi>Abraham</hi> together in one day, and after the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> were but one Church or congregation: <hi>Acts</hi>

was applyed to, ſo that if <hi>Maſter Marſhall</hi> and <hi>Maſter Geree</hi>
will conclude from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. &amp;c. that we muſt have our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
baptized, becauſe they had theirs circumciſed we being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed
into their room, they muſt not only prove that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile-beleevers
are grafted into the inviſible Church in place of the
<hi>Jewes</hi> (which is the Apoſtles ſenſe there notwithſtanding, that
which M. <hi>Geree,</hi> or Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> have ſaid) nor that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
viſible Churches are graffed into the viſible Church in the
place of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> but they muſt alſo prove that the Gentiles are
taken into the ſame outward Church ſtate which the <hi>Jewes</hi>

               </gap>ad.
But that is moſt falſe. For now God gathers not a whole nation
together, nor hath appointed one Temple Altar, Prieſt, &amp;c. as he
did to the <hi>Jews:</hi> but he gathers now by preaching, ſome here, ſome
there, and the viſible Church hath now no ſuch policy or outward
government as the <hi>Jewes</hi> had then: and therefore there is not
the ſame reaſon of infants belonging to the viſible Church of the
Gentiles as they did to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> except one can prove that we
are to have the ſame outward face and conſtitution of the Church

ſaid; <hi>The thing that is to be proved is, that all the infants of every

                  </gap>fence</hi>
denies this, though it ſeemed plaine to me, that this text was
brought to prove his ſecond concluſion, which <hi>I</hi> took to bee the
ſame with the antecedent of his Enthymeme, or firſt argument;
and that <hi>I</hi> did conceive had this ſenſe, that all the infants of every
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:113779:39"/>
beleever are in the Covenant of free Grace in Chriſt, otherwiſe
his firſt argument is but nugatory, the antecedent and concluſion
being the ſame; and he equivocates in his two firſt concluſions,
underſtanding the firſt concluſion of the covenant of ſaving Grace
in Chriſt, the other of the outward Covenant as hee calls it,
as I ſhewed above: which ſerves for no better end then to delude
a reader. But <hi>pag.</hi> 135. he ſaith thus; <hi>The thing to be proved from
this text is, that our infants have the ſame right which the infants
of the</hi> Jewes <hi>had,</hi> pag. 140 <hi>The thing to be proved was, our infants
have the ſame priviledge with theirs;</hi> yet in the ſame page he thus
formeth the concluſion, <hi>and therefore we and they making up the
ſame body are taken in upon the ſame ground, our children with us,
as well as theirs with them:</hi> which laſt concluſion I do not take to
be the ſame with the former, nor any one of them the ſame, with
the other or with the antecedent of Mr <hi>Mar.</hi> ſecond argument,
or his ſecond concluſion, 3. It is yet uncertain to me what is the
<hi>medium</hi> he would prove his concluſion by out of that text. In his
<hi>Defence</hi> in three places he calls his confuſed heap of Dictates
his argument to wit, pag. 134. <hi>The Apoſtles ſcope was to ſhew

conſectary, if it be underſtood of priſtine Church-ſtate, I likewiſe
deny it. I grant <hi>the promiſe will bee extended to them and their

it is called, applyed to infants, but by the communicating <hi>the

will be two diſtincteſtates in the Chriſtian Churches: one of the</hi> Jews
<hi>holy Fathers and children, another of the Gentiles who have only
perſonall priviledges, none for their ſeed;</hi> for neither doth Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme

Apoſtle, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 14. For then a partition wall is kept up when
the Gentiles as Gentiles are excluded from acceſſe to God which
is not done by my doctrine, they that hold that the command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Circumciſion ſtill binds virtually, come nearer to the ſetting

            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> in his Sermon as I conceived made this the thing
he would prove, <hi>that we and our children are graffed in together;</hi>
this I granted in ſome ſenſe to be true, that God doth uſually call
and adopt the children with the Fathers, but I denyed it to be ſo
perpetually; ſo as that a rule for an outward ordinance may be
flamed thence. And ſo farre as I can collect the chiefe <hi>medium</hi>
Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> and Maſter <hi>Geree</hi> take hence to prove it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
<hi>we Gentiles have the ſame ingraſſing into the true olive which the</hi>
Jewes <hi>formerly had.</hi> This Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> made the Apoſtles
ſcope, though the truth is it is ſo farre from being the Apoſtles
ſcope, that it agrees not with his words, who makes the ancient
<hi>Jewes</hi> naturall branches, not ingraffed, and the ſcope of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
is otherwiſe, as hath been ſhewed: <hi>Examen,</hi> pag. 65. But the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e difference is about the ingraffing what that is, as I had ſaid.
<hi>The ingraffing to me is meant of the inviſible Church by election
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:113779:40"/>
and faith.</hi> To this Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> pag. 136. ſayes, <hi>I reply, if it
be meant of the inviſible Church onely and that all who are ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
in the Apoſtles ſenſe whether Jews or Gentiles are only elect ones,
I will promiſe you never to plead this Scripture more for any inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts;</hi>
and after <hi>if you pleaſe let us try it out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I agree to this motion, and determine that the graffing in <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 17. &amp;c. is meant of the ingraffing into the inviſible Church by
election and giving faith, with this caution; that I doe not deny
that the ſame people might or were ingraffed into the viſible
Church by profeſſion of faith, and baptiſme; but hold that this
ingraffing is more then that which is into the viſible Church by
outward profeſſion and ordinances. To prove my determination,
I thus argue.</p>
            <p>1. That ingraffing which is Gods act by his ſole power, is into
the inviſible Church by election and giving faith. For graffing into
the inviſible Church is as Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſaith, pag. 135. <hi>admiſſion
into viſible memberſhip,</hi> which if it be by an outward ordinance, is
the eaſie act of the adminiſtratour; if by profeſſion of faith, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
act of the profeſſour. But the ingraffing meant <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. is
Gods act from his ſole power, as is proved from verſe 23. where
the reaſon is rendred why the Jewes ſhould be again graſſed in,
is, becauſe <hi>God is able to graffe them in again; Ergo,</hi> the graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
here is into the inviſible Church.</p>
            <p>2. That ingraffing which is called reconciliation oppoſite to
caſting away, that is by election and giving faith; for no other
acts can reconcile: but the ingraffing here is called <hi>reconciliation</hi>
oppoſite <hi>to caſting away v.</hi> 13. as may appeare in that <hi>v.</hi> 16. is a
reaſon of the clauſe about the reception of the Jewes, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and
the 17 <hi>verſe,</hi> is an admonition from the ſuppoſition, <hi>v.</hi> 15. that
the Jewes were caſt away: which is called breaking off, <hi>v.</hi> 17.
now if breaking off, <hi>v.</hi> 17. be the ſame with caſting away, <hi>v.</hi> 15.
then ingraffing is the ſame with reconciliation; <hi>Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
is by election and giving of faith.</p>
            <p>3. The ingraffing muſt bee meant of that act whereby the
branch ſtand in the tree as a branch this will none deny, it being
the very <hi>terminus</hi> of ingraffing, as hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the <hi>terminus</hi> of Calefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But that is by giving faith. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is proved
from <hi>v.</hi> 20. where it is ſaid, <hi>by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:113779:41"/>
thou ſtandeſt by faith,</hi> whence I argue. That act whereby the
branch ſtands in the tree as a branch, muſt be the giving that
meanes whereby the branch thus ſtands, but that is faith, <hi>v.</hi> 20.
<hi>Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> the act of ingraffing is by giving of faith.</p>
            <p>4. That ingraffing is meant <hi>v.</hi> 17. whereby the <hi>wild olive is
Copartaker of the root and fatneſſe of the olive tree,</hi> as is aſſerted
there. But ſuch is only election and giving of faith. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The
<hi>minor</hi> I prove by conſidering who the root is, and what the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the olive tree is. 1. Negatively, the root is not as Maſter
<hi>Marſhall</hi> and Maſter <hi>Blake, every beleeving pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent.</hi> For then all
the branches ſhould be naturall; the child of every beleeving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
is a naturall branch from his father: but here the Apoſtle
makes the Gentiles branches and a wild olive graffed in beſides
nature, and the Jewes only naturall branches growing from the
root, <hi>v.</hi> 21. 24. Nor is it of any moment which is objected, that
other parents are called roots as <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> Iſai. 11. 1. For here only
the root notes ſuch a Father as is holy and from whom the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are holy; which agrees not to every beleeving Father. 2. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively.
The root is no other then <hi>Abraham.</hi> I ſaid twice in my
<hi>Examen,</hi> pag. 68. 129. <hi>Abraham only is a holy root, or at moſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
Iſaac and Iacob;</hi> which I ſaid only by conceſſion: that if
it were ſo, yet every godly parent was not a holy root, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ſerved my turn there, if it were ſo. This Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> pag.
134. calls; <hi>ſaying, and unſaying.</hi> But Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> might have
conſidered that I did in that addition only mention the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others, and not contradicted it there where it was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my purpoſe if it were granted; but otherwiſe, where I
expreſſe my owne judgement, I mention only <hi>Abraham</hi> as the
root, <hi>Exercit. pag.</hi> 10. <hi>Examen, pag.</hi> 64, 65. And ſoe doe <hi>Deodate

               <hi>for the Fathers</hi> either becauſe of the Covenant

he is ſaid to reſerve a lamp in <hi>Judah</hi> for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake, but this
ſpeech hath ſpeciall reſpect to the Jewes, whereas the benefit of
the root, v. 17. 18. is common to Gentiles and Jews. As for the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the <hi>olive tree Deodate</hi> ſaith truly, it is <hi>the bleſſing and promiſe
made to Abraham &amp; his ſeed</hi> &amp; ſo the Apoſtle expreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
14. And it would be too frigid, and waſhy an expoſition to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it of outward priviledges, &amp; ordinances. Yea it were falſe,
for the Gentiles were not partaker of the outward priviledges and
ordinances of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Jewes they being taken away.
Now theſe things being put it muſt needs be, that this ingraffing
muſt be by giving faith ſith by faith only the Gentiles are partakers
of the root <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the fatneſſe of the olive tree the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Church, not by naturall generation of beleeving parents, nor
by outward adminiſtrations. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ingraffing here into the
inviſible Church is by election and giving of faith.</p>
            <p>5. From verſe 25. If the breaking off the Jewes be by blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then the ingraffing is by giving faith, but the former is true,
<hi>verſe</hi> 25. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the latter.</p>
            <p>6. If reingraffing of the Jewes produceth ſalvation, is by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them from iniquity, taking away their ſins according to Gods
Covenant, then it is into the inviſible Church by giving faith, but
the former is true, <hi>verſe</hi> 26, 27. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the latter.</p>
            <p>7. If the reingraffing be by vertue of Gods election and love,
his gifts of calling then it is into the inviſible Church by election
and giving faith, but the former is true <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the latter.</p>
            <p>8. If the ingraffing both of Jewes and Gentiles be the fruit of
gods mercy, the breaking off by ſhutting up in unbeleefe, then the
ingraffing is into the inviſible Church by election and giving faith,
but the former is true, <hi>verſe</hi> 30, 31, 32. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the latter.</p>
            <p>What ſhould I ſay more? It is ſo plaine from the whole ſcope
and tenour of the Apoſtles words, that the ingraffing there ſpoken
of is into the inviſible Church by election and giving faith, that
from the firſt verſe of the chapter to verſe 13. there is ſcarce a

Mr</hi> Marſhall <hi>accuſeth me as ſymbolizing with</hi> Arminius,
<hi>and puts this in the margine of his book,</hi> pag. 144. <hi>and in the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex:
<hi>and thereby thinks to cut ſcores with me for accuſing him as</hi>
ſymbolizing with Arminius, pag. 69. <hi>of my</hi> Examen.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer. 1. That there is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Mr <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

agrees with <hi>Arminius</hi> his tenet, and I quote <hi>Arminius</hi> his
words in the margine; and therein I did juſtly. For <hi>Arminius</hi> alſo
underſtood his ſpeech of outward adminiſtrations, to wit the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Goſpell, in the end of his <hi>Anti-perkins,</hi> and both Mr
<hi>Marſhall</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> agree, <hi>that the infants of the wicked for
theſe outward diſpenſations are comprehended in their parents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the tenour of Gods juſtice.</hi> But I expreſſely rejected
the tenet of <hi>Arminius</hi> about revocable election, and Apoſtaſy
from grace; which if they ſhould follow from my interpretation,
<hi>I</hi> conceiving otherwiſe, yet were not <hi>I</hi> to be charged with ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing

underſtand not how this diſtinction gives you the leaſt help.</hi> I reply,
that it plainly avoyds the conſequence objected againſt my inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation;
for though the branches in one paſſage be meant of the
branches in appearance, and the breaking off that which was ſo in
appearance, yet, other places, as in the ſame verſe in the ingraffing
may be meant of true ingraffing into the inviſible Church in
like manner, as it is <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 2. But becauſe upon more accurate
examination I conceive that is not the genuine anſwer, I ſhall
therefore let it paſſe. 3. I ſay, when the Apoſtle ſaith the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were broken off, he meanes it of the branches that were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch, and of the ingraffing that was truly ſuch into the inviſible
Church, but that by the branches are not meant ſingular perſons;
but the people, or as M. <hi>Mar.</hi> ſpeaks p. 137. <hi>the body of them were
the branches ſpoken of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n this place, &amp;</hi> M <hi>Geree</hi> p. 16. Nor is it either
the Arminians tenet, or any errour to ſay that the body of a people
which were once the elect people of God, and ingraffed into the
inviſible Church, becauſe the generality or a greater number were
ſuch among that people, are broken off from election, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Church. For a people or nation is not a conſiſtent being,
but a fluent being as a river, which is the ſame river ſtill, though
not the ſame water; and therefore as when <hi>Cyrus</hi> turned <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
from it's own channell, hee may bee ſaid to have turned away
the ſame river <hi>Euphrates</hi> that was created at firſt though it were
not the ſame numericall water; ſo when God rejected the Jews
from being his elect, beleeving people he broke off the ſame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that were the true branches of <hi>Abraham</hi> the true root in the
inviſible Church, and yet no one particular perſon, who was elect

And indeed the text leads me to this interpretation. For

            <p>Thus have I beſides my firſt purpoſe put into this <hi>Apology</hi> this

I affirm;</hi> I perceive this text is his chiefe hold for Infant-baptiſm,
and in Mr <hi>Blakes</hi> new anſwer to my <hi>Examen, pag.</hi> 69. I find theſe

            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Blake</hi> in his anſwer to my letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 30. ſaith thus. <hi>If
the ingraffing bee by ſaving faith onely, to derive ſaving grace
perſonally inherent as a fruit of election from</hi> Abraham; <hi>then
it muſt be that we are elect in</hi> Abraham, Abraham <hi>may ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

as Chriſt, this would follow; but I make <hi>Abraham</hi> onely a
root as he is called the Father of all them that beleeve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.
not by begetting faith in them, but as an exemplary cauſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,

an argument, as if it were unreaſonable to require him to make
a ſyllogiſme in mood and figure in a Sermon. And yet hee did
make diverſe in that Sermon, as <hi>pag.</hi> 39, 41. But it ſeems neither
then nor ſince is he willing to tell what promiſe that is, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39
and then conclude ſyllogiſtically; for then it would plainly appear
that that text ſerves not his purpoſe, who in his ſecond concluſion
will <hi>not aſſert that the promiſe of ſaving grace is made to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

Mr <hi>Marſhall pag.</hi> 251. 252. tells me, <hi>this is a poor argument.</hi> And
yet ſuch arguments have been accounted after other arguments

<hi>I</hi> love to ſpeak plainly without equivocation, but it ſeems

is equivocating with him. But what a ridiculous charge is
this? It's equivocation when a word is taken in various ſenſes.
<hi>Is</hi> it equivocation in me to take the word <hi>covenant of grace onely

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113779:46"/>
but that it was ſo from the beginning, and alwayes in the Church
we do not find the Pelagians yeelded, yet did they not perhaps
queſtion it, either becauſe they were carried away with that
erroneous rule that what they ſaw every where practiſed, and
found not when it began to take that for an Apoſtolicall tradition,

<hi>I deſire to know what colour of truth you can put upon theſe words.
I</hi> anſwer, the words are true without any colour put upon them,
For <hi>I</hi> did not deny that <hi>I</hi> found Infant baptiſme practiſed before,
but that the determination of that council was the ſpring head,
that is as Examen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And upon reading of them, the thing that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith <hi>the
Church alwayes had, held and keeps,</hi> ſeems not to me to be the
practiſe of Infant baptiſme, unleſſe by conſequence (which in
matter of hiſtory is not ſo cleare a proofe) but the doctrine of
originall ſin in Infants, which <hi>Pelagians</hi> denyed, not the practiſe
of baptizing Infants. For the words immediately before are <hi>nemo

a paſſage in a Sermon <hi>ad populum,</hi> in which uſually there is not

But for this teſtimony of <hi>Tertullian</hi> my ſtomacke was
quickly eaſed of it, as finding not onely by reading, <hi>Delacerda</hi>
his note on it, but alſo by conſidering the occaſion and words going
before that <hi>ex ſeminis praerogativa</hi> imports not federal holines, but
holineſſe, by reaſon of the freedom from that unholineſſe in their
procreation, which the infidels children had from the many groſſe
idolatrous ſuperſtitions, by which they were defiled, and as it
were dedicated to the Devill. And I conceive <hi>Hieromes</hi> words
to <hi>Paulinus, Epiſt.</hi> 153. cited by Maſter <hi>Blake in his anſwer to my
letter,</hi> pag. 57. expounding thus <hi>Tertullian, aſſereas ſanctos dici

ſordibus polluantur,</hi> ſhew that in <hi>Tertullian</hi> the praerogative of
ſeed, notes onely freedome from pollutions of Idolatry, at or
before their birth, not covenant holineſſe, and the word <hi>candida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos
fides,</hi> the ſame with <hi>deſignatos ſanctitatis</hi> prove that they
were holy in expectation, becauſe in hope and intention believers,
and ſo to be baptized. And though I find <hi>Tertullians</hi> words ſome-what
obſcure, as all his writings are; yet in that he cals them <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignatos
ſanctitatis</hi> (which ſeems to be meant of baptiſme) not
onely <hi>ex ſeminis praerogativa,</hi> but alſo <hi>ex inſtitution is diſciplina,</hi>
which Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> himſelfe interprets <hi>of their education,
pag.</hi> 73. of his defence, it ſeems plaine to me, that this place
proves that <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes their Chriſtian education the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to the baptiſme of beleevers children in his daies: and ſo
this place makes againſt Maſter <hi>Marſhals</hi> tenet not for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It</hi> is true, the Ancients doe alluſively call <hi>baptiſme circumciſion.</hi>
as they do the <hi>Lords Table the Altar, the Lords Supper the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
the Presbyters Prieſts, the Deacons Levites;</hi> nor do <hi>I</hi>
deny that they ſay <hi>circumciſion was a type of baptiſme,</hi> (which
Proteſtant writers grant not) and that they thereupon <hi>make bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſus
ſucceed circumciſion, and they argue for baptizing of Infants
from circumciſion,</hi> this I granted in my <hi>exercitation and Examen.</hi>
But yet <hi>I</hi> thinke neither Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> nor his friend can ſhew
that they argued thus, the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by vertue of the Covenant, <hi>I</hi> will be thy God and the God of
thy ſeed, therefore the children of beleevers onely are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
by vertue of the Covenant <hi>I</hi> find that they argued thus from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113779:48"/>
circumciſion, <hi>circumciſion was the remedy againſt originall ſinne,
and the male that is not circumciſed, ſhall be cut off from his people,
ſo Baptiſme is the remedy of originall ſin, and by reaſon of it, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized
infant dying, ſhall bee damned.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> thinke if Maſter
<hi>Marſhals</hi> friend could, he would have ſhewed that they argued
from federall holineſſe of infants of beleeving parents, to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of Baptiſme; this <hi>I</hi> yet think is a late device, no elder then
<hi>Zuinglius</hi> as <hi>I</hi> ſaid in my <hi>Examen.</hi> And ſo my <hi>hedge is not yet tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,</hi>
but rather Mr <hi>Marſhal's</hi> hedge, whereby hee fenceth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſme
either from Antiquity or Scripture is already ſo
broken down, that a mean Scholler may goe through it; and if any
truth-ſearching Scholler bee ſatisfied by Mr <hi>Marſhals</hi> writing, it
is to me an amazement. 2. As for that which he ſaith, that <hi>Grotius
is the ſtrongeſt ſtake in my hedge,</hi> meaning in point of antiquity,
therein Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> is much deceived. For, 1. the chiefe
ſtake in my hedge in point of antiquity is the obſervation upon
what ground the Ancients taught Infant-Baptiſme, which was
not Covenant-holines, <hi>but ſuppoſed neceſſity to ſave the child from
periſhing; and the ſuppoſed power that Baptiſme hath to give grace,</hi>
which <hi>I</hi> gathered from <hi>Cyprian, Auguſtin,</hi> and others, but do not
remember that <hi>I</hi> received it from any but by my own obſervation.
2. My hedge was in ſome ſort made in my <hi>Exercitation</hi> before
<hi>I</hi> ever took notice of any thing in <hi>Grotius</hi> about paedobaptiſme,
which was about the time <hi>I</hi> began to frame my <hi>Examen</hi> upon
occaſion of Mr <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> his citing his <hi>annotation</hi> upon
<hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. where <hi>Grotius</hi> is ſo farre from <hi>being a ſtake in
my hedge, that</hi> Doctor Homes, <hi>pag.</hi> 146. ſaith, that <hi>for</hi> Grotius <hi>his
own opinion it is clear and full for Infant-Baptiſme upon that</hi> 19
<hi>of Matthew v.</hi> 14. and therefore <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe his teſtimony is the
leſſe to be ſuſpected in this matter. <hi>I</hi> confeſſe that <hi>Grotius</hi> put me
in mind of that of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> which I find in the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his life, that though his Father were a <hi>Greeke</hi> Biſhop, yet he
remained unbaptized, till being ſent to <hi>Athens</hi> to ſtudy; being at ſea
he was in danger of drowning: and being perplexed, that he was
likely to dye being unbaptized; he reſolved to be baptized when
he came to ſhore. Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> askes <hi>how I prove his Father was
a Chriſtian when he was born?</hi> To this I anſwer, that I had thought
Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> had not been ignorant, that this inſtance of <hi>Gregory
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:113779:48"/>
Nazianzen's</hi> Father is brought by many Proteſtant writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Papiſts that deny marriage to the Clergy, to prove that
then Biſhops were married, and did uſe their wives. If Mr <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi>
pleaſe, he may read what <hi>Chamier panſtrat: Cathol. tom.</hi> 3.
<hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 13. §. 10. ſayes of his father and mother.</p>
            <p>I alſo found in <hi>Grotius</hi> the inſtance of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> which I
confeſſe I took upon his word as wanting books and time to read
ſo much as was neceſſary to examine the matter, <hi>Grotius</hi> not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
whence he had it. But if that inſtance do not hold, the
inſtance of <hi>Hierome</hi> is plain, whom <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his life proves out
of his own writings to have been born of Chriſtian parents in
<hi>Pannonia,</hi> yet was baptized at <hi>Rome,</hi> whither he was ſent to be

Marſhall</hi> ſayes nothing to <hi>Zonaras,</hi> and what he brings in anſwer
to <hi>Balſamous</hi> gloſſe is nothing to the purpoſe. For neither did
<hi>Grotius</hi> nor <hi>I</hi> ſay that <hi>Balſamon</hi> denied Infant-Baptiſme accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own opinion, but that <hi>from that canon Balſamon and
Zonaras, do infer that an infant cannot be baptized becauſe it hath
not power to chooſe the confeſſion of Divine Baptiſme,</hi> which is all
one with that which <hi>Mr Marſhall</hi> himſelfe ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. <hi>There
is required of him that would profeſſe himſelfe a follower of Chriſt
(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:113779:49"/>
or (as Balſamon hath it) there is required of everyone in Baptiſme
his own promiſe, which an infant in its mothers wombe cannot doe.</hi>
And can an infant out of the mothers womb do it? ſo that it is
plain even by <hi>Mr Marſhals</hi> own explication of the <hi>Canon,</hi> that
that <hi>Council</hi> held that thoſe were only to be baptized, that could
make a promiſe themſelves. <hi>I</hi> doubt not but that this <hi>Councill</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Baptiſme of infants, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> did in caſe of danger
of death, but <hi>I</hi> think it is plain that out of that caſe they allowed
not the baptiſme of an infant, no not though a beleevers infant;
till the child could make its own confeſſion: as appeares from
their ſcrupling the baptizing of the mother converted now with
child, leſt it ſhould be taken to reach to the child in the womb,
and from the generall reaſon, <hi>that every one manifeſts his own free
choice in confeſſion.</hi> And <hi>I</hi> am peſwaded that this was the true
ſtate of Baptiſme in thoſe dayes, in the Greek and Latin Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that they did baptize all ſorts of infants whether of beleevers or
unbeleevers, in caſe of danger of death, leaſt they ſhould periſh
for want of it; in which caſe Lay-perſons did baptize: and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine

they baptized not ordinarily, till they came to years to make their
own confeſſion. The caſes of <hi>Nazianzen, Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
Conſtantine</hi> the great, and others; and their ſolemn bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
onely at Eaſter and Whitſuntide, which is obſerved in the
Rubrick of the Engliſh Liturgy, me thinke ſhould abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
men concerning this truth. I cited likewiſe <hi>Grotius</hi> his
ſpeech <hi>of many of the Greekes, who in every age even to this day,
doe keep the cuſtome of deferring the Baptiſme of little ones, till
they could themſelves make a confeſſion of their faith.</hi> For which
words though he cite no Authour, yet I preſume <hi>Grotius,</hi> who is
even by <hi>Spanheimius,</hi> often ſtiled <hi>vir ſummus;</hi> would not have ſaid
it, unleſſe he had ſome ground for it. Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſayes, <hi>I might
bluſh for juſtifying the Anabaptiſts, in ſaying that the Ancients, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
the Greeke Church have rejected the baptiſme of infants
for many hundred yeares;</hi> meaning in the firſt ages after Chriſt. But
as yet, neither Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> nor his friend have ſhewed me ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
reaſon why I ſhould retract it. For what he brings out of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
and <hi>Balſamon,</hi> men of much later ſtanding about the later
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:113779:49"/>
Canons, and Imperiall lawes of the <hi>Greekes;</hi> and one of the 8
Canons concluded in <hi>Carthage</hi> againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> requiring
infants to be baptized: proves not, but that the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
baptizing of infants many hundred of years in the firſt ages;
nor doth it overthrow that of <hi>Grotius, that many of the Greekes</hi>
(he doth not ſay the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church) <hi>in every age to this day doe
keep the cuſtome of deferring the baptizing of little ones, till they
could themſelves make a confeſſion of their faith.</hi> Yea, the lawes
brought by Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> rather prove it. For why ſhould lawes
be made for it, but becauſe many did neglect it? And the ſtory
out of <hi>Balſamon</hi> about captives of Chriſtians, rather ſhewes that
ſome were not baptized, when little ones even among Ch<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
becauſe they determine if there were no witneſſes to prove
their Baptiſme, though children of Chriſtians; they ſhould bee
baptized.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Grotius</hi> his <hi>being a friend to the Socinians,</hi> it is nothing
to me, who knew not <hi>Grotius</hi> nor his wayes; nor ever pleaded
for him. Yet I remember I have read that though he was accuſed
thereof long agoe by <hi>Ravenſpergerus,</hi> hee was juſtified by <hi>Voſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and what ever <hi>Rivet, Mareſius, Laurentius,</hi> charge him with,
yet his works have a place among the learned, and may be read
and made uſe of <hi>cum judicio,</hi> at leaſt as the works of Papiſts, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,
Prelatiſts, &amp;c. who yet may be tainted with errours. Even
<hi>Theophilus Philokyriaces, Loncardie uſis;</hi> if I miſtake not Maſter
<hi>Marſhals</hi> friend, doth in the very title page of his <hi>Dies Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>

               </gap> 
               <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
Nor doe I find that in that wherein I made uſe of <hi>Grotius,
he hath deceived me; or I or he wronged the truth, or our Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Marſhall pag.</hi> 54. of his <hi>Defence</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he perceived I

it, and am by that <hi>I</hi> find there the more confirmed in that truth,
wherein <hi>I</hi> concurre with that Authour: though the truth is the

And thus farre <hi>I</hi> have thought good to expreſſe my ſelfe in this

            <p>As for my opinion about baptizing, <hi>I</hi> have publiquely declared
when <hi>I</hi> examined whether to viſible Church memberſhip were
neceſſary reall ſanctity in the judgement of Church-officers, that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:113779:52"/>
by profeſſion ſufficient to it, I mean a profeſſion of repentance
and faith in Chriſt, which is <hi>ſerious, ſober, free, and underſtanding;</hi>
but denied that it is neceſſary there ſhould be a further probation
by trying mens ſpirits, ſo as to ſatisfie the particular congregation
or Church-officers; that a perſon be admitted to Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip,
and the Lords Supper. I confeſſe ſuch triall is requiſite
in admitting into ſpeciall function<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or intimate ſociety; but not to
communion in worſhip. And my opinion is, that as much is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to make capable of baptiſme, as of the Lords Supper; and
that being admitted to the one, if rightly performed, they are not
to be debarred of the other, for want of a further triall of their
ſpirits. And though I never ſaid that <hi>by rectifying Baptiſme, all the
abuſes I mention following padobaptiſme would be removed</hi> (for
I did not make paedobaptiſme the ſole or principall cauſe of them,
that is mans corruption, which will fall into thoſe or the like in
ſome meaſure, if paedobaptiſme were removed) yet it is true
which I ſaid in my <hi>Examen, part.</hi> 2. §. 7. <hi>the onely way to further
reformation, is to begin in a regular way at the purging of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Jeſus Chriſt, to wit Baptiſme.</hi> Even as though all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and ſuperſtition were not removed by removing Latin Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
yet that was the onely regular way to begin at the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it. And it is eaſie to conceive, that foraſmuch as the groſſe
ignorance of people is much occaſioned by their baptizing afore
they know, that if they were not baptized till they knew chriſtian
Religion, as it was in the firſt ages, groſſe ignorance in chriſtian
profeſſours would be almoſt wholly reformed, and for chriſtian
walking, if baptiſme were adminiſtred with a ſolemn abrenunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
profeſſion and promiſe by the baptized in his own perſon,
&amp; upon that were baptized, I doubt not but it would have more
aw on mens conſciences then many other means uſed or deviſed,
conſidering how in the primitive times men differred baptiſme
for feare they might not enjoy their luſts, and they were counted
by ſome as guilty of inexpiable crime that fell away after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme:
and on the other ſide, infant-baptiſme is the ground upon
which innumerable people ignorant and profane harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as if they were good chriſtians, regenerate, and ſhould be
ſaved without holineſſe of life, never owning or conſidering any
profeſſion or promiſe made for them as theirs.</p>

becauſe <hi>then the Proſelytes children were baptized:</hi> pag. 256.
But the anſwer to it is eaſie. For though the rite of Baptiſme was

and was uſed according to another rule then among the Jewes.
For they did not baptize Jewes either elder or younger as the
ſame learned men I cited confeſſe, but onely the Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were uncleane; and they were initiated by ſacrifice as

ſet down my argument to prove Infant-baptiſme will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
it belongs to him to tell me what he denies in my ſyllogiſme,
that I may prove it, though I have already done it, and ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more fully when he tells me what he doth deny: but it is a meer
ſhift for him to impoſe on me the proofe of a Propoſition I owne
not, and not tell me what he denies in my own ſyllogiſme. This
is contrary to the rules of diſputation I have been acquainted with;
yet if Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſhall declare that he holds the ſubject of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
to be but a circumſtance, I ſhall be ready to oppoſe him
therein further; and ſhew that the point in difference is not
the bare age or ſexe, but qualification of perſons to be baptized;
yea the reaſon and main uſe of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>As for Mr <hi>Marſhals</hi> principle for his virtuall command I have
ſhewed above;<note place="margin">No command about the Iewes Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now in force.</note> that when he ſhould have brought all Proteſtant
Divines averring this maxime, that <hi>all the commands and inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God about the Sacraments of the Jewes; bind us as much as
they did them in all things which belong to the ſubſtance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and were not accidentall to them:</hi> in ſtead of this he alleageth
another thing, that Proteſtant Divines make <hi>the ſame generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
end and uſe of our Sacraments, and the Iewes Sacraments, and
argue thereupon from one to the other,</hi> which is quite beſide the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.
For the maxime is of commands about the Sacraments,
and they are all about the rituals or adminiſtrations, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commands about the Sacraments, binding us as the Jewes, he
produceth not one command binding us, or one Proteſtant avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
            <p>As for the command, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. when I ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:113779:55"/>
               <hi>minor</hi> in another; there bee foure termes, and the ſyllogiſme is
naught. To this Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> makes no reply in a logicall form,
but tells us in a looſe diſcourſe, <hi>that foraſmuch as there is no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
ground of certainty, but onely of charity, that any growne perſon
to be baptized hath actually the inward grace; and ſo in charity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee
are to conceive of beleevers infants, becauſe Chriſt ſaid,</hi> Mark 10.
14. <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdome of God, they are to be baptized</hi> So
that in his <hi>Defence</hi> Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> alters his argument which he ſet
down in his Sermon, concluding not from a capacity of inward
grace to Baptiſme as he did then; but from the judgement of
charity that they have actually the inward grace,<note place="margin">We have no evidence for judgement of charity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, nor is a judgement of charity to be our rule in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſtering Baptiſme.</note> which he ſeems
to count ſufficient for Baptiſme. Mr <hi>Geree</hi> his reaſoning is to the
ſame effect: <hi>vindic. paedobapt. ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 7. and is thus formed by
him into a ſyllogiſm, <hi>where we have evidence for judgement of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that there is the grace of the Covenant, there we may ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the ſeal
of the Covenant. But we have evidence for the judgement of charity,
that in infants of beleevers there is the grace of the Covenant. Ergo,</hi>
Of this Syllogiſm I deny both <hi>major</hi> &amp; <hi>minor. Acts</hi> 10. 47. doth not
provethe <hi>major.</hi> For the Apoſtle there did not baptize upon a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of charity of what was latent, but from a certaine ſenſe of
their magnifying God, and the gift of the holy Ghoſt; nor was
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> baptized becauſe in the judgement of charity hee
had the grace of the Covenant, but becauſe he profeſſed the faith,
which was certain to <hi>Philip.</hi> And this was <hi>Maſter Marſhals</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in his Sermon, pag. 47. where he confeſſeth <hi>that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
charity or charitable conjecture was not the ground of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them to the ordinance, but the profeſſion and confeſſion of
the party made according to the word, which they were bound to reſt
in.</hi> And therefore I ſee not how Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> can count a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of charity ſufficient for Infant-baptiſme, without croſſing
himſelfe in his firſt Sermon. For my part I doe not think a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
ought to be ruled in baptizing by his own judgement of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
(which is ofttimes very uncharitable to thoſe that deſerve
beſt) but by certain knowledge of true ſanctification by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
revelation, or of the parties profeſſion of the faith by other
meanes, either of which is ſufficient, not both neceſſary. Nor do I
<hi>require of infants more aſſurance then of grown men,</hi> but ſhewes of
repentance and faith in either. Yet, as when one being required
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:113779:56"/>
to bring no more then a ſervants teſtimony for the grant of a
thing, if he bring the maſters hand and ſeale without the ſervants
teſtimony and the thing be granted; he that grants it doth require
no more then the ſervants teſtimony: ſo when I ſay, if ſhewes of
repentance and faith be exhibited <hi>I</hi> will baptize, and <hi>I</hi> will bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
upon extraordinary revelation, that an infant is a beleever:
<hi>I</hi> doe not require more aſſurance of an infant then of a growne
perſon, when <hi>I</hi> ſay, if the infant profeſſe the faith, <hi>I</hi> will baptize,
if God witneſſe for it that it is a beleever <hi>I</hi> will baptize, in neither
goe <hi>I</hi> by judgement of charity, but certainty either of revelation
or profeſſion, which neither <hi>Master Geree</hi> nor <hi>Maſter Marſhall</hi>
can make good of all the infants of beleevers. But ſaith <hi>Maſter
Geree there's evidence in charity to judge that the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
have the grace of the Covenant.</hi> To this <hi>I</hi> anſwer, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for judgement of charity is to be taken from a perſons own
deeds according to the rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>charity beleeveth all
things, capacity of grace</hi> is common to all perſons on earth, and
therefore is no ground to baptize one more then another. That
<hi>ſome infants have been actually partakers of inward grace,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi>
19. 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 1. 5. yeelds nothing to prove any
judgement to be right that it is ſo in any other, but onely that it
may be ſo. <hi>Infants of beleevers are not under the Covenant of Grace
or within the externall adminiſtration of it,</hi> by vertue of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. they ſpeak of more then externall adminiſtration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
muſt be underſtood of the elect which the Apoſtle denies to have
bin ever by God aſſured to the natural ſeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8. 15. no judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of charity that the infants of beleevers are under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace can be deducted from theſe texts, the moſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturall
hope that it ſhall be ſo, which experience ſhewes to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
often, therefore theſe things yeeld not a warrant for infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme.
Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> argues from <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. that <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing

That which we argue from receiving of families, and from the
Apoſtles commiſſion to baptize nations is, that nations may make
Lawes for their whole nations to be baptized; and if the major part
of a nation do according to their duty receive baptiſme, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
for the whole nation to ſubmit themſelves to become Schollers
of Chriſt, they may juſtly compell by any penalty to joyne with them
in the externall worſhip of God. This therefore is it which is drawn
from the commiſſion directed to the Diſciples for the baptizing of
nations, that nations may act as nations, and families as families;
that is, that the more organ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hitherto is objected againſt my two Treatiſes and Appendix, <hi>I</hi>
doubt not but with Gods aſſiſtance to anſwer. Afore <hi>I</hi> could fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

ſome of the aſſembly would not give over till they had outed me

actions from the ſin of making ſchiſme, and ſtopping the courſe
of the Goſpell for their own ends, not permitting any to preach
the Goſpell without concurrence in opinion with them, when as
<hi>Paul</hi> rejoiced that Chriſt was preached; though it added afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his bonds, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 18. what my deſire was in the <hi>Prologue
of my Examen,</hi> is ſtill, that <hi>we may give one another the right hand

and cleare the truth of God to the people whoſe eyes are upon us. I</hi>
may call God to witneſſe that my ayme in making and publiſhing
my Treatiſes, was the benefit of the Aſſembly by making knowne
to them reaſons why the Doctrine of the <hi>Directory</hi> ſhould be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

reject me, repay evill for good, I hope God will help me to bear
it, and to love them ſtill, and joyn with them in promoting the
work of Chriſt; notwithſtanding I meet with diſcouragements
where I aſſured my ſelfe greateſt encouragement.</p>
            <p>To conclude; as the caſe now ſtands, I know not into what

requeſt that they that can pray, would beg for me that <hi>I</hi> may doe

of Chriſt, that the Paſtors and teachers in them may take heed of

into the liſts with Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> was not out of choice <hi>as valuing
my ſelf,</hi> as they miſtake; but out of neceſſity lead thereto by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God. How well I have acquitted my ſelfe may appeare
by the bringing of <hi>Maſter Marſhall</hi> to many conceſſions which
overthrow his firſt argument. Whether this anſwer of <hi>Maſter
Blake</hi> be <hi>ſinewy for argument, I</hi> hope in time to examine. <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that to put the queſtion upon the right <hi>Baſis,</hi> is to examine
whether the formall reaſon why the Jewes were circumciſed,
were their intereſt in the Covenant? whether there be the ſame
Church-ſtate now that was then? whether any command about
the Jewes Sacraments now bind us? But <hi>I</hi> paſſe to Mr <hi>Blakes

<hi>I</hi> ſhall deprehend <hi>I</hi> have failed in, <hi>I</hi> ſhall <hi>I</hi> hope confeſſe to God,

Blake</hi> was, becauſe <hi>I</hi> preſumed <hi>Maſter Marſhall</hi> had acquainted
him with the thing, and the reaſon of printing my Treatiſes as
they were is declared above. Why <hi>I</hi> would not take upon me the
place of opponent in the diſpute with my brethren <hi>I</hi> gave the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
becauſe the argument would preſently lead them to oppoſe;
this being al my argument againſt Infant-baptiſm that I could wel

the ſame perſon ſhould be both borne after the fleſh and after the

I would give him no more occaſion to ſay I do <hi>inſult, whoop, and

that <hi>Iſaack was borne after the fleſh,</hi> (though it be true, he was ſo
in the two ſenſes Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> mentions which are nothing to
this place of the Apoſtle) it is untrue in the Apoſtles ſenſe, for
then he ſhould be the child of the bondmayd; not by promiſe, a
perſecutor to be caſt out not to inherit, and a type of legall juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries
belonging to the covenant in mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> for all theſe
things are true of him that is borne after the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 22, &amp;c.
<hi>But the Apoſtle doth not ſay, that they are caſt out, but mentions a
command of caſting them out.</hi> As if Gods <hi>dictum</hi> were not <hi>factum:</hi>
if they were not caſt out, why doth the Apoſtle alleage that text?
<hi>But they are in the Church, otherwiſe they could not be caſt out.</hi> I
anſwer, I deny not but legall inſtitiaries may be in the viſible
Church, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe; though the Apoſtle
make the parallel only in the caſting out that they might not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but if Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> would gather any thing hence for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
he muſt prove that the Apoſtle makes ſome to be in the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, by vertue of being borne after the fleſh as their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
which is as wide from the Apoſtles meaning, as Eaſt &amp;

borne after the fleſh, which is all one with the Apoſtle as legall
inſtitiaries, another borne after the ſpirit, which is all one as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers?
so that this is Maſter <hi>Blakes</hi> tergiverſation, not my
calumny.</p>
            <p>In The fifth chapter Mr <hi>Blake</hi> complaines, that I take <hi>more
paines then needs to find out Maſter</hi> Marſhals <hi>meaning in his ſecond
concluſion,</hi> and after. <hi>And indeed I never ſaw a learned man ſo run
himſelfe into a maze needleſly, as you in this diſcourſe do; being at a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:113779:62"/>
ſtand; you ſay, whether Maſter</hi> Marſhall <hi>meanes a covenant of
grace, or outward ordinances, as though theſe two were oppoſite,
and priviledge of ordinances were not of grace, or that ſaving grace
could be had, in Gods ordinary way, without this priviledge.</hi> To
acquit my ſelfe of this imputation, I ſay, that it was very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to take that paines I did, to bring my ſelfe out of that maze
which I had not run my ſelfe into; but the confuſedneſſe and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
of Maſter <hi>Marſhals</hi> expreſſions lead me into. Maſter
<hi>Marſhall</hi> had made this the anteceedent in his firſt argument, <hi>The
Infants of beleeving parents are faederati, or within the covenant of
grace;</hi> This I conceived to be the ſame with his ſecond concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though againſt the rule of diſpute he varies the terme [<hi>faedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,
or within the covenant of grace</hi>] into this, [<hi>he would have to
be accounted his, to belong to him, to his Church and family, and
not to the Devils</hi>] which I do not take to be equipollent. This
neceſſitated me to ſhew the many ſenſes of his words, and to
take paines to find out his meaning; elſe I, knew not what to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or what to grant. Now, to clear the matter: when it is ſaid,
<hi>Infants of beleevers are faederati, or in the covenant of grace,</hi> this
may be underſtood three wayes. 1 <hi>They are in the covenant of
grace</hi> by their owne act of covenanting, becauſe they promiſe the
performance of the condition on their part, and this ſenſe is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
falſe; and yet when Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſayes <hi>they are to be
accounted covenanters,</hi> he ſpeakes as if he meant ſo: For what is a
covenanter but he that makes a promiſe? 2 They are in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace by the adminiſtratours act, becauſe he gives them
the ſeale of the covenant; but then the ſecond concluſion ſhould
be, they are baptized or to be baptized, now this being the ſame
with the antecedent of Maſter <hi>Marſhals</hi> firſt argument, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
muſt be thus; Infants of beleevers are baptized, or to be
baptized, <hi>ergo</hi> they are to be baptized, which is meerly to trifle:
and yet as <hi>I</hi> ſhewed above, this is the effect of Maſter <hi>Marſhals</hi>
arguing, who will have his ſecond concluſion, and antecedent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<hi>of the outward covenant,</hi> as he cals it. 3 They are in the
covenant of grace by Gods act of promiſe, and this is that which
Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſhould have ſaid, if he would have ſpoken plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without equivocation, God by his promiſe to the Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
puts them in the covenant of grace, or he accounts them

them, and not have ſaid God would have them accounted his by
us, by giving them the outward covenant, as he calls it. Now, if
he affirme this, that God hath promiſed grace to Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
this grace is either ſaving grace, or outward ordinances.
But ſaith Maſter <hi>Blake theſe are not oppoſite, but ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſo, yet they are diſtinct, and the promiſe of the one is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of the other: the promiſe of the Word and Sacraments, is
not a promiſe of the Spirit. Now here was the doubt, whether
Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> affirme a promiſe of ſaving grace to beleevers
Infants, or of outward ordinances. <hi>I</hi> ſaid neither was true, yet
the former was more agreeable to his meaning. To prove this <hi>I</hi>
alleaged, that though ſometimes Maſter <hi>Marſhall,</hi> Maſter <hi>Blake</hi>
and others ſpake more warily, (in which <hi>I</hi> dealt candidly with
Maſter <hi>Blake,</hi> reciting his expreſſe words full enough for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
yet <hi>I</hi> ſaid moſt of Mr. <hi>Marſhals</hi> and others expreſſions, and
one expreſſion of Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> ſpake as if they meant that God
had made a covenant, or promiſe of ſaving grace. And to prove it
to be their meaning: produced their allegation of theſe textes,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Matt.</hi> 19. 14. which are to be underſtood
of ſaving grace, and that otherwiſe the ſeale would be put to a
blanke, and that Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> ſaith, <hi>God promiſeth to be a God in
covenant to his and their ſeed, which people in covenant have alſo a
promiſe from him of the Spirit.</hi> Now what ſayes Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> to
this, he denyes not that theſe texts ſpeake of a promiſe of ſaving
grace, but askes me <hi>hows they are meant, whether abſolutely or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately?</hi>
and then faſtens upon me an aſſertion that is none of
mine, and <hi>I</hi> beleeve wrongs Maſter <hi>Blackwood</hi> too. But herein
Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> goes from the buſineſſe, and inſtead of a reſpondent

               </gap> proved theſe texts alleaged by them for Infants
being in the covenant of grace ſpeake of a promiſe of ſaving

of ſaving grace is made to a beleevers child, theſe texts
are alleged to no purpoſe by him. This is no place to anſwer Mr.
<hi>Blakes</hi> unpertinent queſtions; which he propounds to me as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that becauſe <hi>I</hi> ſaid, <hi>the texts are plainely meant of ſaving

whether in alleaging <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. for infants of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

in that from hence they aſſert the certainty of their ſalvation
if they dye in infancy, not conſidering that if God have made ſuch
a promiſe to a beleevers ſeed, it will as well aſſure the ſalvation of
a beleevers ſeed in old age as infancy; ſith in old age they are their
ſeed, and the promiſe in reſpect of regenerating grace, which

he did not or would not underſtand my words: I did

[<hi>promiſe</hi>] in that aſſertion in the doctrinall part [<hi>the promiſe is
made to beleevers and their ſeed</hi>] which cannot be interpreted of
the thing promiſed; but Gods act of promiſe, which is ſaid to be

riſeth up againſt God himſelfe, rather then any one of your adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
But how this ſhould riſe up againſt God, Mr <hi>Blake</hi> neither
doth nor can ſhew: Mr <hi>Blake</hi> ſeems to runne to his old ſhift, that
God promiſeth Church-priviledges upon condition. If ſo, <hi>Cede

<hi>Maſter Marſhall, pag.</hi> 127. of his <hi>Defence</hi> accuſeth me that <hi>I
ſometimes ſay that</hi> Gen. 17. 7. <hi>was a promiſe peculiar to</hi> Abraham,
<hi>at other times it was at the utmoſt to be extended no further then to</hi>
Abraham Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>to have their poſterity (as born of them)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:113779:65"/>
to belong to the viſible Church.</hi> But <hi>Maſter Marſhall</hi> wrongs me,
I have neither of theſe Propoſitions in either of my Treatiſes;
what I conceive of it I have ſet down plainly, <hi>Exercit. pag.</hi> 2. 3.
But <hi>Maſter Marſhall would have the promiſe, I will be the God of
thy ſeed as promiſing viſible Church-memberſhip to belong to the
naturall ſeed of every beleever.</hi> 1. <hi>becauſe the Covenant was made
to him for his Faiths ſake. Anſ.</hi> if that were the motive, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
not the promiſe belongs to every beleever as <hi>Abraham;</hi> no
more then it followes, the promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18, 19. was made
to <hi>Peter</hi> by reaſon of his confeſſion, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. therefore it was
made to every one that confeſſeth as <hi>Peter</hi> did, 2. How elſe ſhould
Proſelytes children have Church-memberſhip. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of that promiſe, but by vertue of Gods command. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48
To his third reaſon I have often anſwered and proved, that <hi>Deut.</hi>
30. 6. <hi>Iſai</hi> 44. 2, 3. <hi>Iſai</hi> 59. 21. muſt be meant of the elect, elſe how
did God keep that promiſe when he did not circumciſe the heart
of <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Joſiahs</hi> children. <hi>Maſter Marſhall</hi> pag. 129. puts
this upon me; <hi>that I ſay God made this promiſe to</hi> Abraham Iſaac
<hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>to be the God of them, and their ſeed.</hi> But I doe not
remember that <hi>I</hi> ſay ſo any where, nor that the Scriptures ſayes
ſo though <hi>I</hi> meet with promiſes ſomewhat like it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 24
<hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 4. 14. But theſe promiſes ſo farre as they pertain to their
naturall ſeed, were peculiar to them; and pertain not to every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever,
and his naturall ſeed. For none of the Gentiles are <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
ſeed, but by Faith. From all which <hi>I</hi> conclude, there is not
a promiſe either of ſaving grace or Church-priviledge made to
the ſeed of beleevers, and ſo they are not certainly in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace; in reſpect of Gods act of promiſing.</p>

is any other then a conjecture, <hi>I</hi> let it paſſe. One paſſage of Mr

that the Corinthiane tooke it, for a common received principle;
that if a man had as adulterous wife, that his children were legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and not baſtards; ſo it muſt be if you opinion paſſe for a reaſon.
I</hi> know not how he collects from my words; <hi>I</hi> ſay that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
took it for certain that their owne children were holy,
that is legitimate; and <hi>I</hi> ſay the force of the Apoſtles argument
lies in this Propoſition, that all the children of thoſe parents,
whereof one is not ſanctified to the other, that is, doe not lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
couple together are unclean, that is illegitimate; and that the
Apoſtle ſaith, the unbeleeving husband is ſanctified to the wife,
that is, is lawfully uſed by his wife becauſe hee is her husband,
as if he had been holy: out of which, all the engines of <hi>Mr Blakes</hi>
wit cannot extort the inference he puts on my opinion.</p>

               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:113779:66"/>
In the ſecond ſection <hi>Mr Blake</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">1 Cor 7. 14. is not meant of inſtrumentall ſanctification and federall holineſſe.</note> that <hi>I</hi> heard before Mr
<hi>Goodwins</hi> Lectures of inſtrumentall ſanctification. If it were ſo,
yet <hi>I</hi> profeſſe <hi>I</hi> did never heed or know it ſo as to take notice of it
till <hi>I</hi> heard Mr <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> uſe the phraſe. Mr <hi>Blake</hi> to my

not this argument of yours of as great force againſt your interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a matrimoniall, as ours of an inſtrument all ſanctification?
I</hi> anſwer no: for they that cannot beget children may be ſaid to
be ſanctified matrimonially, that is, may lawfully come together;
but not inſtrumentally ſo as to beget a holy ſeed, which is Maſter
<hi>Blakes</hi> ſenſe. For they that by age or accidentall inabilities cannot
be ſanctified for generation, cannot beget children either by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
or legitimate. Mr <hi>Blake</hi> addes. <hi>The ſanctifying by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
party here mentioned, reſpects the iſſue which you confeſſe
in grounding a legitimation of iſſue upon it. I</hi> grant where there
is iſſue, the holineſſe of it depends on the ſanctification; but where
there is ſanctification, it is not alwayes ſuppoſed there is iſſue,
or that there may be iſſue: to the begetting of which, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally
ſanctified. Mr <hi>Blake. This ſanctifying (whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall
or matremoniall) hath its influence upon the ſeed; ſuch a
brand lying upon all the iſſue, where there is iſſue (be it baſtardy or
gentiliſme) were enough to conclude againſt ſuch marriages, one
principal end of marriage being poſterity.</hi> He ſuppoſeth it ſeems, that
uncleanenes is here meant, which is ſuch a brand on the iſſue as is
enough to conclude againſt all ſuch marriages. This is very right,
but I ſubſume that brand in all the iſſue where there is iſſue; which
were enough to conclude againſt all ſuch marriages is baſtardy,
not gentiliſm. For baſtardy in the iſſue proves the ſuppoſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
not to be right, but gentiliſme in the iſſue concludes nothing
againſt the marriage: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the uncleaneneſſe here is baſtardy, not

the ſeed of infidels (neither parent beleeving) are neceſſarily &amp; infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly

which I ſay I am ſure Mr <hi>Blake</hi> is miſtaken, whether ignorantly
or wilfully, I determine not; for he ſpeakes of certainty of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
of the children in the latter part of the verſe, whereas the
queſtion is whether inſtrumentall ſanctification for the begetting
a holy iſſue; of which the ſanctification in the fore part of the verſe
is expounded, be contingent or no: and this I am ſure is true, and
therefore their lawfull living together for preſent according to
Mr <hi>Blakes</hi> expoſition ſhould be taken from a future contingent,
which <hi>Chamier</hi> truly counted abſurd, though as happy a Logician
as he was, he foreſaw not how it ſerved againſt himſelfe. <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus

            </p>
            <p>To my third argument he ſaith. <hi>Here you beg the queſtion and
reaſon flat againſt the Apoſtle. That ſanctifying which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
mentions is areſult of the faith of the beleeving yoke-fellow, the
unbeleever is twice ſaid to be ſanctified, but not the beleever; the
beleever doth ſanctify, if any ſenſe can be made of the Apoſtles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</hi>
I anſwer. <hi>He begs the queſtion,</hi> who ſuppoſeth what he
ſhould prove: Mr <hi>Blake</hi> doth not, nor can ſhew I doe ſo; nor doe I
<hi>reaſon flat againſt the Apoſtle;</hi> the Apoſtle no where ſaith the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
is the reſult of the faith of the beleeving yoke-fellow, if
it were ſo, an unbeleeving fornicatour might be ſaid to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by his beleeving whore, as well as a husband by his beleeving
wife. The unbeleever is ſaid twice to be ſanctified, becauſe the
doubt aroſe from his unbeleefe; but the ſaith of the beleever is
not at all expreſſed, to ſhew that the faith did not ſanctifie, but the
relation. But if it were meant of inſtrumentall ſanctification, it
would come from Gods deſignation, not the faith of the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For whoſe inſtrument ſhould he be that is ſanctified for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
a holy ſeed but Gods? now to this nothing is anſwered,
and ſo this argument ſtands good againſt Mr <hi>Blake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To my fourth argument he ſaith. <hi>Underſtanding the Apoſtle of
inſtrumentall ſanctification and of federall holineſſe, the propoſition</hi>
[their children could not be holy without that ſanctification] <hi>is
moſt true, neceſſarily and univerſally true, as the iſſue of ſuch a birth,
they are federally unclean and unholy; if afterwards by grace they
are changed, this is no finit of their birth, of which the queſtion is
in this place, but of the Goſpell work in their ſoules,</hi> To which I
ſay the queſtion is not here what is the fruit of birth, not how the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:113779:67"/>
Propoſition can be true underſtood of federall holineſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall
ſanctification. And I ſay it is moſt certainly falſe, for
many a child of both unbeleeving parents are federally holy. But
ſaith Mr <hi>Blake,</hi> they are not ſo at their birth. But this is nothing
to the purpoſe, ſith the Propoſition hath not thoſe words in it, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the Apoſtle. The Apoſtles reaſon ſuppoſeth it cannot be at any
time. And yet it may bee certaine that the child of two unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
may be federally holy at birth whether it be underſtood of
election, inherent holineſſe, or outward holineſſe, if God pleaſe to
work and declare it. But the iſſue of them that are not lawfully
conjoyned as husband and wife, cannot be made legitimate by
God becauſe it is contrary to the definition of legitimation, which
is a ſtate conſequent upon birth by the lawfull copulation of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
husband and wife.</p>

All the children of the unbeleeving husband not ſanctified to
the wife, are uncleane. Mr <hi>Blake</hi> ſaith, <hi>The truth of the Apoſtles
ſequele depends on this Propoſition; All the children of an nobelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
are unclean, unleſſe for generation, he or ſhee be ſanctified by a
beleever.</hi> I deny it, for the termes <hi>for generation by a beleever</hi> are
added by him, not in the Apoſtle; and ſo he changeth the terms.
Yet it is to be noted that though the Apoſtles <hi>major</hi> be of husband
and wife in particular, Mr <hi>Blake</hi> makes the Propoſition on which
it depends of unbeleevers in generall, and ſo by his own practife
juſtifies me againſt his owne exception. 2. The Propoſition Mr
<hi>Blake</hi> layes down as upon which the <hi>major</hi> in the Apoſtle ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme
depends. <hi>All the children of an unbeleever are unclean, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
for generation be or ſhee be ſanct fied by a beleever,</hi> is falſe; and
ſo is that which he ſaith after. <hi>All thoſe that are borne of unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
parents, and one of them not ſanctified in the other, are out of
the Covenant of grace, yea the other is falſe too,</hi> according to Mr
<hi>Blakes</hi> opinion; <hi>unbeleeving parents never beget children by birth-priviledge
holy.</hi> For children born of infidels brought into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
family had right to circumciſion, and ſo were by birth-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
holy in Mr <hi>Blakes</hi> ſenſe. Mr <hi>Blake</hi> tels me, the Apoſtles
Propoſition according to my interpretation is this. <hi>All the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of an unbeleever are baſtards, except in generation he or ſhee be
ſanctified by a beleever.</hi> But this I deny: I have ſet down the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
according to my interpretation plainly enough already.</p>
            <p>My alleaging <hi>Chamiers</hi> words againſt his opinion was no <hi>jeare,</hi>
but a right way of uſing an authors reaſons againſt another, againſt

was circumciſion was common to them which had no part in the

of grace, or parents faith as the formal reaſon why Infants
were circumciſed, but from Gods command according to that
Church-ſtate that then he thought good to appoint. This being
clear from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> interprets it, as if <hi>I</hi> had ſaid
circumciſion was not a ſigne of the ſubſtance of the Covenant,
and runs out in a large diſcourſe to prove the contrary; which
toucheth not me who have expreſſely granted it <hi>Exercit: pag.</hi> 3.
<hi>Examen pag.</hi> 39, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is a meer calumny in Maſter <hi>Blake,</hi> to
to tell me <hi>that I cloſe with the Jeſuites, and with high diſdaine
ſhake off the doctrine of the Proteſtants.</hi> But ſaith Maſter <hi>Blake,
pag.</hi> 43. you ſay in your <hi>exercitation,</hi> pag. 2. <hi>The Covenant made
with</hi> Abraham <hi>is not a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e Goſpell Covenant, but mixt.</hi> In the
ſame place I explaine my meaning, and prove it ſo fully, that I
wonder that Maſter <hi>Marſhall,</hi> Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> and others are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to except againſt it. What the Jeſuites ſay in this matter,
or what the Proteſtants ſay againſt them, <hi>I</hi> have not time to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
The thing, as <hi>I</hi> deliver it, is plaine according to Scripture:
that there were ſome peculiar promiſes made to <hi>Abraham, Ge.</hi> 17.
which are not made to every beleever. To tell us that <hi>godlineſſe
hath the promiſe of the life that now is,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. is nothing
to the preſent purpoſe, for it doth not follow therefore that godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
hath the promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> or that Chriſt ſhould
be every godly mans ſeed, &amp;c. Mr <hi>Blake</hi> ſaith, <hi>circumciſion was a
fruit of the faith of the parents,</hi> but this is falſe; for then all, &amp; none
but children of beleevers were to be circumciſed, which is not true:
whoſe children ſoever they were, if in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, if bought
with money of any ſtranger, they were to be circumciſed, <hi>I</hi> had
ſaid, <hi>circumciſion was a priviledge in that time of the Churches
minority,</hi> and this the Apoſtle delivers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. Mr <hi>Blake</hi>
takes it as if <hi>I</hi> had ſaid, <hi>the fruition of the promiſes in ſuch a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
were onely a priviledge during the time of the Churches
minority, and would have me give ſome Scripture or colour of
reaſon for it, which is to impoſe on me the proving of that <hi>I</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:113779:70"/>
not. <hi>I</hi> ſaid, <hi>he that will prove the birth priviledge of our
children from the Jewes, muſt make our caſe as theirs, and ſo bring
us under the ceremoniall law.</hi> This Maſter <hi>Blake puts into a formall</hi>
propoſition of his owne, a man of ſtraw and then denies it, the
reaſon of my words is plaine, circumciſion of Infants was from
the paedagogy,, or peculiar Church-ſtate of the Jewes, as may be
proved from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. and obliged to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. therefore, they that from hence would draw
the birth priviledge of our children, muſt make our caſe the ſame
with the Jewes, and ſo bring us under the ceremoniall law. The
reſt of that ſection is vaine, and not worth a line in anſwer. <hi>I</hi> ſaid
truely, that the interpetation of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 14. of legitimation is no
more to be called a ſingular opinion then Maſter <hi>Blakes,</hi> and that
<hi>I</hi> have proved by alleaging eleven Authors for it, and can do

them. Why <hi>I</hi> did not alter one or two paſſages, that Doctor
<hi>Wilmot</hi> excepted againſt, <hi>I</hi> ſhall be willing to give Maſter <hi>Blake</hi>
the reaſon. Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> is miſtaken in that he ſaith, that my
friend of the Aſſembly that delivered my letter to Maſter <hi>Marſhal,</hi>
was the man that told me of the Committee of the Aſſembly, and
adviſed me to preſent the reaſons of my doubts to them; it was not
he, but my reverend and deare Father in law. And that friend of
mine of the Aſſembly, that delivered my letter to Mr <hi>Marſhall,</hi>
tels me that though he was deſirous to have Maſter <hi>Blakes</hi> book
printed, that the point might be diſputed; yet he did not approve
many of his proofes: but by his ſpeech with me lately, <hi>I</hi> conceive
he did except at ſundry of the ſame things which I did. But to
the matter of that chapter. Letting paſſe the conference, and the
occurrence therein, which was promiſed ſhould not be divulged
by any hearers, nor was there any exact record kept of it; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
is now brought to writing, the queſtion is whether I <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9
prove a <hi>birth</hi> priviledge of Chriſtians, equall to the nation of the

to ſay</hi> page 13. <hi>This is no undeniable Axiome, that, what all the
Proteſtant Divines defend againſt the Papiſts, muſt be truth unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable.</hi>
To this I ſay, I am well aware that this is a loud calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the contrary whereof is manifeſt by the many and beſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Divines I quote all along my <hi>Examen,</hi> and very ſeldome

but becauſe Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſpake of his virtuall conſequence as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable,
as if he had been <hi>Doctor irrefragabilis,</hi> and it is neceſſary
when men goe about to bind men to the conſent of Divines in
ſome Churches, that we freely claime our liberty, and not become
the ſervants of men. Mr <hi>Blake</hi> ſaith <hi>I doe not know one Proteſtant
writer that hath declared himſelfe in this thing, but hath declared
himſelf to be your adverſary.</hi> I anſwer, none of the Antipaedopap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
are my adverſaries in this; yet ſome of them are Proteſtant
writers: in the point of expounding <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. which is the

I and you have entred into Covenant to the extirpation of Popery;
and I would learn of you by what character or marke it may be now
diſcerned.</hi> I anſwer, not by this, that that is to be accounted Popery
which all Proteſtant Divines oppoſe the Papiſts in; for then many
things would not be counted Popery which are, nor any thing
to be counted Popery till we knew all Proteſtant Divines oppoſe
it an endles, impoſſible buſines. But there is a ſhorter way then that,
and it is that is to be counted Popery which is commonly known
by that name, as the doctrine of the Popes ſupremacy infallibility,
the doctrine of the Maſſe, Tranſubſtantiation, Bread-worſhip,
Croſſe-worſhip, Invocation of Saints, &amp;c. Or if you will have
a more fixed way, you may take that to be Popery which
either the 39 Articles of the Church of England condemn in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to Papiſts, or is renounced in the Scottiſh negative Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
or Confeſſion in the yeare 1581 as I remember, or what the

<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. or any other Scripture Covenant-holines

that we cannot aſſign any one thing for truth in which Prete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants

concluſion right: I put the concluſion thus; and therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
to be baptized, whereas I ſhould have added: and the nations
being diſcipled, then infants as part of the nation are to be baptized:</hi>
To ſhew the cauſleſneſſe of this exception, Mr <hi>Blake</hi> pag. 20 of
his <hi>birth-priviledge</hi> had ſaid thus, <hi>The infants of any nation make
up a part of the nation, and the nation, where they came was to bee
diſcipled;</hi> but ſet not down his concluſion, and therefore <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
he meant to infer thence that infants were comprized in
thoſe words, <hi>baptizing them, Matth.</hi> 28. 19. put down his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
thus, <hi>and therefore the infants: to be baptized.</hi> Mr <hi>Blake</hi>
would have <hi>diſcipled</hi> put into the concluſion. But <hi>I</hi> conceive ſtill
<hi>diſcipled</hi> ſhould not be put in the concluſion, and the premiſes
were ſet down by himſelfe, and therefore <hi>I</hi> did him no wrong.
For his argument in form muſt be thus. They who are part of a
diſcipled nation are to be baptized, infants are part of a diſcipled
nation, therefore infants are to be baptized; any man may ſee that
<hi>diſcipled</hi> ſhould not be put in the concluſion, ſith it is in the <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
quod non ingreditur concluſionem.</hi> Now let his <hi>major</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſtand, and <hi>I</hi> will ſubſume upon Mr <hi>Blakes</hi> ground; Infidels of
growne yeares are part of a diſcipled nation, for they are part of
the nation; and if the nation be diſcipled, they are part of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
nation: therefore by Mr <hi>Blakes</hi> reaſon, Infidels of growne
yeares are to be baptized. Mr <hi>Blake</hi> at laſt <hi>pag.</hi> 67. ſets downe
his rule, in theſe words <hi>they are baptized by vertue of a priviledge
from their parent, not from the nation:</hi> which is plainely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Mr <hi>Rutherfurds</hi> aſſertion. <hi>I</hi> confeſſe if my firſt argument
againſt the aſſertion <hi>I</hi> conceive Mr <hi>Rutherfurds</hi> may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
then the 2d. will be eaſily anſwered as M. <hi>Blake</hi> truly obſerves,
<hi>p.</hi> 68. In anſwering my 3d. Mr <hi>Blake</hi> askes, <hi>How is it that wicked
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:113779:74"/>
parents are now brought in this diſpute?</hi> I anſwer becauſe it was
the term <hi>Mr Rutherfurd</hi> uſed in his aſſertion: not to ſhew my
allowance of the baptiſme of infants of parents not wicked, nor
out of agreement with <hi>Mr Thomas Goodwin</hi> in this. <hi>Mr Blake</hi>
page 69. <hi>indeavours to prove by my tenet there can be no rule ſet
down to know that any man is baptizable, becauſe he conceives I
hold onely true beleevers before God, members of the inviſible
Church, veſſels of mercy, redeemed ones are the men diſcipled to be
baptized; but who are ſuch, cannot be known.</hi> Ergo, <hi>by my opinion
none are to be baptized.</hi> M. <hi>Blake</hi> indeavours to gather that to be my
opinion out of my words, which are brought in <hi>obtorto cello,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their intent, nothing to his purpoſe. <hi>I</hi> ſay that <hi>Mr Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals
words in this ſenſe are good, beleevers of every nation are the
peculiar people meant;</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>and this is meant of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church; and that God hath not choſen ſimply the nation of the
Gentiles, but a people out of them:</hi> Revel. 5. 7. but doe <hi>I</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
expound <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. as if [nations] there comprehended
only ſuch elect perſons and true beleevers? or doe <hi>I</hi> any where
ſay, that ſuch only are Diſciples and to be baptized? Why then
doth <hi>Mr Blake</hi> not onely here, but after in another chapter to

Nor is that the advantage which <hi>I</hi> ſay the Independents

17. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. as <hi>I</hi> ſhewed above. In like manner <hi>Maſter
Blake</hi> chapter 14. page 93. becauſe <hi>I</hi> ſaid that Infants may by

is wrought in them; as aſſes are made to ſpeake with mans voice,

then I deny that wee have any liberty at all to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
from analogy or reſemblance, to prove or make a dutie
or command in morals or ceremonials, though <hi>I</hi> grant we may
uſe analogy to inforce a duty before proved. For an argument
to prove a thing to bee a morall dutie from the old Teſtament,
muſt bee by proving the ſame thing, then to have been morall
as Maſter <hi>Cawdray</hi> and Maſter <hi>Palmer</hi> endeavour to prove one
day in ſeven for a Sabbath to bee morall and perpetuall, but
an argument from analogy is from one thing to another, as
like, for analogy or proportion is betweene, not the ſame
but more things as like. As for the Apoſtles arguing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9.

               </gap>
from a generall maxime that <hi>the labourer is worthy of his reward</hi>
proved by ſundy inſtances, inferres a particular truth concerning
miniſters. The argument 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. 17. is to prove. that they
which profeſſe C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t, may not partake of the things of Idols,
from this generall truth that they which joyn in the ſeruice of any
God they hold communion with that God, and are one with thoſe
that worſhip that God this the Apoſtle proves by inſtances in the
Chriſtian, and Jewiſh ſervices. So that this argument is from
a generall truth proved by an induction of inſtances. That <hi>Matth.</hi>
12. 3. 4. is onely an inſtance to prove that ſacrifice muſt give place
to mercy: a ceremoniall to a moralll duty; not an argument
from meer analogy or reſemblance of things different. But
what ever arguing there be in morals, certaine it is that no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is good from bare analogy in ceremonials, or meer poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Jewes; to prove, thus it was in ſuch a rite of the
Jewes, therefore it muſt be ſo in ſuch a rite of the Chriſtians,
there's no example of ſuch arguing in the Scriptures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>I</hi> ſaid rightly <hi>Examen pag.</hi> 29. <hi>To me it is a dangerous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon which they goe that ſo argue, to wit, that in meer poſitive
things (ſuch as circumciſion and baptiſme are) we may frame an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to Gods worſhip, from analogy, or reſemblance conceived by us
betweene two ordinances; whereof one is quite taken away without
any inſtitution gathered by precept or Apoſtolicall example.</hi> Maſter
<hi>Blake would knowe who they be that do ſo, I</hi> anſwer, Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi>
in his firſt argument, and five firſt concluſions, and virtuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from circumciſion; Maſter <hi>Blake birth-priviledge pag.</hi> 15.
and generally all that prove Infant-baptiſme, by Infant-circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.
For circumciſion and baptiſme, are meer poſitive things;
baptizing of Infants is confeſſed not to have expreſſe inſtitution
gathered by expreſſe precept, or example in the new Teſt: and that
which is alleaged, is either expreſſe, or no precept, or example
at all: and if it were to be gathered by conſequence from inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:113779:77"/>
or example Apoſtolicall in the new Teſtament, without the
helpe of the precept of circumciſion there would be, for as much
as it concernes my part, an end of the controverſie: therefore it
is clear, they that argue from circumciſion to baptiſme, doe frame
an addition to Gods worſhip, from analogy or reſemblance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by them, between two ordinances: whereof one is quite
taken away, without any inſtitution gathered by precept, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall
example. But ſaith Maſter <hi>Blake. It is not barely the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
between circumciſion and baptiſme, by which we inforce the
baptiſme of Infants, but the grounds of both circumciſion and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>
This is ſaid, but when the grounds are required, what are they
but the analogy between baptiſme and circumciſion, that they are
like; what's the reaſon of the one, is the reaſon of the other: and
therefore what is done in the one, is to be done in the other? Now
whence is this arguing but barely from the likeneſſe, which makes
an argument meerly from analogy. If the argument were
drawn from ſome thing proper to baptiſme it were another caſe,
but being drawne from circumciſion to baptiſme, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
meerly from analogy. If they reſt not on this, let them lay
aſide this argument, and ſticke to precept or Apoſtolicall exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the new Teſtament. To ſhew the danger of this way of
arguing, I thus reaſoned <hi>Examen pag,</hi> 29. <hi>For if we may do it in
one thing, why not in another? where ſhall we ſtay? They that read
the Popiſh expoſitors of their rituals do know, that this principle
hath brought in ſurplice, purification of women, &amp;c. that I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not greater matters. I deſire any Learned man to ſet me downe
a rule from Gods word, how farre I may go in my conceived parity
of reaſon, equity or analogy, where I muſt ſtay; when it will be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
and will-worſhip when not; when my conſcience may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed,
when not.</hi> Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> in anſwer hereto, layes downe
three rules. 1. <hi>When parity of reaſon or analogy, doth not inſtitute
any peece of worſhip, or the leaſt part of the ſervice of God but
onely helpes to a right underſtanding of the nature, uſe, end, extent
of that which is inſtituted.</hi> 2. <hi>When in our reaſoning from analogy,
from the right understanding of any inctitution, or ordinance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
do not reſt ſoly on the analogy that we find with other commands, but
have our further reaſon for confirmation.</hi> 3. <hi>When the analogy holds
full proportion in that for which it is brought, ſo that nothing can
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:113779:77"/>
fairely be brought againſt the one, but may be alſo concluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the other.</hi> To this I anſwer. 1 That never a one of theſe
rules is brought out of Gods word. Not the firſt, for there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declaration of ſuch a rule, nor example to prove that rule. The
proving of excommunicating of women from Miriams ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of the camp, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 14. is not a Scripture collection,
but a meer deviſe of men; the argument againſt nonreſidence
from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 8. is good after other arguments, but without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proofe is not convincing: and it is not in meer poſitive things
but morall. The argument of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. 14. is not
from one poſitive rite to another, but from an ordinance of God
agreeable to common equity in the old Teſtament, to illuſtrate an
ordinance in the new Teſtament, about a morall duty of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.
The ſecond and third rules are not ſet downe from any
declaration or example in the Scripture. 2 I ſay theſe rules are very
uncertaine, For no reaſon is given why they may not make a new
worſhip, who may by their analogy extend it beyond the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the new Teſtament yea, it will be alleaged by Papiſts, and
others, that when they appoint Surplice, Purification, Organs,
&amp;c. they do not make a new worſhip, but adde circumſtances to
the ordinances of Chriſt. Yea, The ſecond rule overthrowes all,
For if we may not ſoly reſt on the analogy; why at all? This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſhew that analogy hath no ſtrength, that indeed it doth
onely illuſtrate cannot prove; what is an argument by analogy,
but an argument <hi>a ſimilt?</hi> If analogy could prove, we might reſt
ſoly on it, without any other confirmation. It is true, many deſire
more arguments, but in truth if it be an argument that proves, we
may rely on it ſoly though there be no other. The third rule like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
is uncertaine and vaine. For how ſhall we knowe when the
analogy holds full propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion? when nothing can be fairely
brought againſt the one, but may be alſo concluded on the other?
when is the proportion full, if onely when <hi>omnia ſunt paria;</hi> this
can never happen in analogies between the rites of <hi>Moſes</hi> and
rites of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> If when there is a parity in many things, it will
be uncertaine how many parityes will ſerve turne to make the
proportion full; what force there is in an analogy when there are
more diſparities: And ſo for a rule to knowe when a thing is fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought, whether the rule be to be taken from Logicke, or the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:113779:78"/>
judgement of the Learned. So that theſe rules are very uncertain.
3 It is alſo uncertaine whether theſe rules be ſufficient, whether
there be no need of any more. For theſe rules will not exclude
proofe of imparity of miniſters, Infant commuuion, &amp;c by analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
Or if they do the ſame aberration from theſe rules that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
the analogy for theſe; will be incident to the analogy for
Infant-baptiſme. We may ſay Infant-communion, or imparity in
the miniſtery is no more a new inſtituted worſhip, then Infant
baptiſme; they that alleage analogy for imparity of the Clergy,
and Infant-communion reſt not ſoly on it: it ſeems to be brought
as fairely with as full proportion in the one as the other. So that
<hi>I</hi> conclude, not onely with Maſter <hi>Rutherfurd proportions are
weake proportions,</hi> but alſo that in theſe poſitive rites, and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they are no probations at all, but meer illuſtrations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the argument for Infant-baptiſme from the analogy of
Infant-circumciſion is a meer nullity.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the <hi>ſection</hi> containes nothing but wrong inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from my words; <hi>I</hi> diſtinguiſh between Evangelicall promiſes
and promiſes domeſticall ſpecially reſpecting <hi>Abrahams</hi> family,
<hi>If this diſtinction may paſſe then</hi> Abrahams <hi>family had no Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
promiſes</hi> ſaith Maſter <hi>Blake, you make</hi> ſaith he, <hi>an oppoſition
between them.</hi> But what ridiculous arguing is this? It's all one as

and the ſame thing: For there are other that belong to him, as
wife, children, friends, beſides ſervants. And indeed to belong
to Chriſt, and to be a Diſciple of Chriſt, are not one and the ſame

it were meant of a little child in age, how doth it follow that ſuch
a one is there a Diſciple? This, if any muſt be the proofe: He
that is received in chriſts name, is a Diſciple. A little child may be

were ſo that it could be proved, that the terme Diſciple is any

And ſo was the reaſon from <hi>Iſai</hi> 49. 22. urged in that conference
as an argument by it ſelfe, to my beſt remembrance, however it
were after diſpoſed in the <hi>birth-priviledge.</hi> But ſaith Maſter
<hi>Blake, the queſtion here is not (as after your manner you miſtake
it) whether this text proves Infant-baptiſme, but whether it gives
any intimation, that Infants in the dayes of the Goſpell be any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church-viſible, or intitled to any priviledges of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
as Chriſts Diſciples. I</hi> reply, The proving of that intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
tended to prove Infant-baptiſme, and therefore thoſe words
were alleaged for Infant-baptiſme; which was that <hi>I</hi> ſaid, not a
whit miſtaking the queſtion. Now ſith Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> confeſſeth
that the words muſt needs be allegoricall, why doth he expound
the terme ſons and daughters of infants, and tell us that <hi>their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of their little ones muſt be underſtood no otherwiſe then of the
acceſſe of the Gentiles with their Infants to the Church of Chriſt.</hi>
For if the Carriage, and nourſing <hi>v.</hi> 23. be allegoricall meant of
perſwaſions, exhortations, and ſuch like acts, Infants could not
be thus carried And ſo Mr <hi>Blakes</hi> allegationis but an empty ſound.</p>

in houſholds were Infidels, if an houſhold be the precedent to be
followed; and he that followeth the precedent muſt baptize houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
without any other qualification; then when he baptizeth
the beleeving maſter, he muſt baptize the unbeleeving ſervant,

any worſe to ſay, I wonder that you had not ſpoke it, your beſt friends
I beleeve will ſay that you have ſufficiently ſhewed your ſelfe abſurd
in language.</hi> Sure Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> knowes that a ſpeech may be
worſe cenſured then by terming it very abſurd, <hi>I</hi> might have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:113779:80"/>
it ſophiſticall, deceitfull, and that had beene worſe. My beſt
friends can finde no abuſive language of any mans perſon, their
ſpeeches or arguments I cenſure in no more abſurd language then
uſually ſchollers do, and particularly Maſter <hi>Gataker</hi> doth Doctor
<hi>Ames,</hi> and <hi>Voetius</hi> as <hi>I</hi> have ſhewed in this <hi>Apology</hi> above §. 5.
Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> addes, <hi>I onely ſay ſome more learned then I, as learned
as you have denied my words to be either abſurd or heterodox.</hi> Be
it ſo; yet affection may blinde their eyes. But let us examine the
ſpeech. <hi>I</hi> reaſoned thus, if the precedent to be followed be a
houſhold, then thoſe of the houſhold are to be baptized either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the houſhold; if this be ſaid, then the Infidell wife is to
be baptized becauſe of the houſhold, or becauſe they profeſſe the
faith; and then the precedent is not a houſhold, but a profeſſor of
faith. To this Maſter <hi>Blake, For full anſwer I ſay, that wife and
ſervant, as wife and ſervant, are in a capacity for baptiſme: if any
wife and ſervant were in thoſe houſholds they were baptized; elſe the
Scripture would not have ſaid the whole family was baptized. It is
ſufficient that Scripture mentioning baptiſme of whole houſholds,
excepts none from a capacity of baptiſme. I</hi> reply, in that which he
cals a full anſwer, there is no anſwer at all to my reaſon; for he
neither denyes my diſtinction to be ſufficient, nor doth he tell us
which member he will chooſe in the <hi>Dilemma,</hi> nor how he will
avoid the conſequent upon his choice. And therefore his learned
friends, though they were ten times learneder then my ſelfe, yet
in this are miſtaken in acquitting either the former ſpeech, of this
anſwer, from abſurdity. But let us conſider what he ſayes. <hi>It is
ſufficient, that Scripture mentioning baptiſme of whole houſholds,
excepts none from a capacity of baptiſme.</hi> I reply: Is this ſufficient
to make the baptizing of houſholds the precedent, that is the
pattern by which we may now baptize Infants, becauſe Infants
are not excepted? Then neither are Infidels excepted there; nor
naturall fooles or idiots of ripe yeares, and ſo are to be the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of baptizing. <hi>But wife and ſervant as wife and ſervant, are
in a capacity for baptiſme.</hi> Anſwer. It is not true, that wife and
ſervant as wife and ſervant are in a capacity for baptiſme, if [<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s]
betaken with reduplication, and [capacity] of actuall right, but as
they are profeſſors of faith. But if it be underſtood that, <hi>

that is <hi>though wife,</hi> and <hi>capacity</hi> in reſpect of future poſſibility,

then it is true of an Infidell, of any man ſhall we therefore make
an Infidell, or a man ſimply the precedent of baptizing? I ſaid
there's no reaſon why it ſhould not be laid as well, that baptizing

<hi>I,</hi> the terme houſhold is taken <hi>Acts</hi> 16. for thoſe of the houſe

circumſtances of the thing, that Chriſt intended ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

infancy have no intereſt in Chriſt, but are without Covenant of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
without God, without hope.</hi> But for that <hi>I</hi> ſaid; thirdly, that
<hi>there is no certainty, onely conjecture that they were infants of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
I avow it.</hi> Mr <hi>Blake averres a certainty beyond conjecture,
becauſe Chriſt was miniſter of the circumciſion,</hi> Rom. 15. 8. <hi>ſent to
the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Mat. 15. 24. <hi>carried himſelfe
otherwiſe to the Canaanitiſh woman in behalfe of her daughter,</hi> verſe
22. 23. <hi>If theſe had had no other intereſt, Chriſt would have been
as facile to others as to them. I</hi> reply, Chriſt was miniſter of the

               </gap>mciſion, was ſent to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, yet
cured the ſervant of the Centurion, the Samaritan leper, the

her not that ſhee was not a beleever, but that ſhee was a Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
if this reaſon prove any thing it is, that the childrens pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

of them beleeving on Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 11. Againſt the fourth thing
<hi>I</hi> ſay of thoſe children that were brought to Chriſt, that the

Mr <hi>Blake</hi> excepts that it is meant of the viſible Church, and
and of all infants of beleevers as ſuch: now on this hinge turns

<hi>I</hi> determine the Kingdome of heaven to be meant of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

               <hi>But ſaith Maſter</hi> Blake, Chriſt had never been ſo much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with his Diſciples for forbidding them, ſeeing their election and

viſible title, ſuch as the Apoſtles ought to have knowne. <hi>I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
The reaſon of Chriſts anger was their hindering him in his

this is but a dreame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> added further, <hi>that Chriſts action in this was extraordinary,
and ſo no ordinary rule for baptizing by the Publike miniſtery. Mr</hi>
Blake <hi>would have me conſider how this can ſtand with that I ſaid
before, that they that brought the Infants might do it without faith
in Chriſt, as the Meſſiah upon the fame of his miracles, and account
that he was a Prophet. I</hi> anſwer, there is no oppoſition, they might
conceive him to be but a Prophet, not the Meſſiah: and yet Chriſt
might act as an extraordinary Prophet, and as the Meſſiah, Mr

about Gods ſealing. Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſpake of Gods ſealing the
baptized; <hi>I</hi> ſaid, God ſeales not to every one that is baptized, but
onely to true beleevers: For his ſealing, is the confirming of his
promiſe; but God promiſeth righteouſneſſe to none but true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.
Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> anſwers. <hi>You acknowledge baptiſme to be is
its nature a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and to be of God,
therefore in it God muſt ſeale to every baptized perſon, or elſe you
muſt ſay they are not baptized.</hi> I reply: <hi>I</hi> acknowledge baptiſme
of profeſſours of faith to be of God, though they be not true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers:
and I acknowledge baptiſme in its nature to be a ſeale
of the covenant of God, but not a ſeale actuall, but aptitudinall;
that is, all right baptiſm is in its nature apt to ſeale, as a garland
hung out is to ſignify wine to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>old, yet actually the one ſignifies
ſo onely to the intelligent, and the other onely to true beleevers.
And God never ſeales actually till a perſon be a beleever. I ſaid;

it is but a notion; the Scripture makes not Gods promiſe in

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:113779:82"/>
the graces of the Covenant, yet actually Gods ſeales not but when
it is adminiſtred to a beleever. It may be called a right act of the
adminiſtratour according to Gods appointment, but not Gods
ſealing. <hi>I</hi> call Gods ſealing onely when either by his ſpirit or
oath, or outward rite, he aſſures his grace, as by circumciſion to
<hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. 11. he appointed <hi>Iſmael</hi> to be circumciſed,
but did not ſeale to him righteouſneſſe by faith. The inference Mr
<hi>Blake</hi> makes from my words, <hi>as if I held none baptizable, but
thoſe in whoſe heart Gods law is written,</hi> hath no colour, for I do
not make the adminiſtratours baptizing, or, ſith they will have it
ſo called, ſealing,, to be Gods ſealing. God appoints the word to
be preached to many hypocrites, and the preacher that aſſures
them of the promiſes doth it by Gods appointment, yet God doth
not aſſure the promiſes to them. <hi>I</hi> do not make him onely baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to whom God ſeales, but him whom Chriſt appoints to be
baptized, whether God ſeales to him or no. Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> urgeth
me with Bellarmines argument; <hi>of the Sacraments be ſeales of
grace, they are often falſe, and God ſhould beare witneſſe to a lye, and
tels of the ſpeech of ſome that have ſaid, that this argument is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable;
unleſſe we confeſſe that the ſeale of the Sacrament is
conditionall. I</hi> like not to call the Sacrament a conditionall ſeale,
for that which ſeales doth aſſure, and ſuppoſeth the condition: In
my apprehenſion, that which is called conditionall ſealing is not
ſealing but offering, or propounding, or repreſenting: but about
this <hi>I</hi> will not contend. Yet in that ſenſe <hi>I</hi> yeeld it to be a ſeale
actually, <hi>I</hi> yeeld it to be a ſeale onely to beleevers, but <hi>I</hi> deny that
becauſe the Sacrament is in its nature a ſeale of grace, God doth
ſeale alwayes when it is rightly adminiſtred. The nature of it is to
be a ſeale aptitudinall, not actuall; and ſo it is eaſie to anſwer Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines
argument, without croſſing my ſpeeches. But be the
Sacraments ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ales conditionall or abſolute, actuall or aptitudinall,
what is this to prove that <hi>God ſeales conditionally in this ſenſe, as
if God left it to mans liberty, to whom he had ſealed, to agnize or
recognize that ſealing, or to free themſelves, if they pleaſe, and ſo
nullify all; yet ſo as to afford them a while the favour, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of being in Covenant with him,</hi> which Maſter <hi>Marſhall I</hi>
conceived meant by his <hi>conditionall ſealing,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> find not in his

and in part: and askes me. <hi>Is circumciſion of heart abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
Is all ſpirituall meat and drinke in Sacraments abrogated? Is
Chriſt himſelfe abrogated?</hi> I anſwer, no: but withall ſay, theſe

thing. Gods Covenant of grace, is his promiſe of grace; and of
this truly, Maſter <hi>Marſhall in his defence</hi> page 117. <hi>multitudes
were baptized, to whom God yet never gave ſaving graces, and
therefore never promiſed them; for had he made a promiſe, he would
have performed it.</hi> Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> makes <hi>the nature of a Covenant
an agreement betweene two parties, and ſayes, a promiſe or tender
without conſent, is no Covenant.</hi> How then do children Covenant
at baptiſme, or enter into Covenant who yeeld no conſent? He

Gen.</hi> 17. 7. 9. But he doth not rightly call that a tender, which was

to ſpeak plainly, Mr <hi>Blake</hi> doth but play faſt and looſe, ſometimes
aſſerting a certainty of ſalvation from the covenant, ſometimes
onely a right to outward priviledges; and yet he and Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi>
ſtick not to declaim againſt <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> for not aſſuring ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

originall corruption, not for want of right to Baptiſme; but to ſay
they are utterly loſt is more then Mr <hi>Blake</hi> hath ground to affirme.
I have often ſhewed that a right to baptiſm is from the command
of Chriſt, not from ſuch covenant holineſſe as Mr <hi>Blake</hi> aſſerts:
ſalvation comes from Gods election and Chriſts redemption. It
is a meer ſlander, and a groundleſſe crimination, wherewith Mr

or any other he can produce doth inferre, that all the infants of
the whole Church of Chriſt have nothing to doe with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
