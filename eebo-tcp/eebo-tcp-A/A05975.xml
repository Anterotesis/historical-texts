            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But now being to depart from you, and toiourney into a farre Countrey, and finding your kindneſſe and loue toward me ſuch, as I was not with any reaſon to expect, I altered my minde, and hauing nothing
<pb facs="tcp:7185:3"/>
elſe to offer vnto you, I reſolued to make this a monument of my thankefulneſſe to you, and a testimony of my deſire to doe you the beſt ſeruice I am able. For my paines herein, I leaue them to the iudgement of any learned Reader; for the profit of the Treatiſe, I ſay no more but this, it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the practiſe of the beſt Generals of all antiquity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the formes of Battailes. And whereas many hold opinion, that it ſorteth not with the vſe of our times, they muſt giue me leaue to be of another mind: Indeed our actions in Warre are onely now a dayes and ſieges oppugnations of Cities; Battailes wee heare not of, ſaue onely of a few in <hi>France,</hi> and that of <hi>Newport</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> But this manner will not laſt alwayes, nor is there any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to be made without Battailes. He that is Master of the field, may diſpoſe of his affaires as he listeth; hee may ſpoyle the Enemies Countrey at his pleaſure, he may march where he thinketh beſt, he may lay ſiege to what Towne he is diſpoſed, he may raiſe any ſiege that the Enemy hath layed againſt him or his. Neither can any man be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the field without Battaile, in ordering whereof, that Generall that is moſt skilfull, ſeldome miſſeth of winning the day: experience of former times cleares this. I ſhould exceede the compaſſe of an Epistle if I brought the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which ſerue to this purpoſe. Now for the skill of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Battailes, it is not to be learned out of the practiſe of our dayes, wherein when we come into the field, we make ſhewes, and musters rather, then obſerue any formes of Battailes for vſe: Battailes must not be alwayes of one figure. The wiſe Generals of ancienter times, faſhioned their battailes according to the range, which they ſaw the Enemy had before taken vp. The place often maketh an
<pb facs="tcp:7185:3"/>
alteration in that forme, which otherwiſe would ſerue to our purpoſe. He that is acquainted but with one forme, if he be forced to change that vpon the ſudden, diſordereth his troopes, and bringeth all into a confuſion. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the formes of battailes being then ſo neceſsary for a Generall, this little Pamphlet muſt needs be welcome to them that deſire the mannaging of fields, and the command of Armies. For here haue you all formes expreſſed, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their vſe; ſo that the Generall that is acquainted with the practiſe of theſe precepts ſhall not be to ſeeke to make tranſmutation of his battaile, into what forme ſoeuer neceſsity ſhall require, &amp; that vpon the ſudden. As for them that hold, that great Ordnance will not admit any of theſe ancient formes in our dayes, I hold that for a dreame, and not worthy the anſwering; ſince the inuention of great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we neuer read of any forme of battaile diſordered thereby; ſome ſlaughter hath beene made by great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the Army that ſuffred by great Ordnance, hath beene forced the ſooner to ioyne with the Enemy; when the Armies are ioyned, great Ordnance hath and muſt ſit ſtill, and looke about as an idle ſpectator, ſeruing for no other vſe, then for a pray to him that gameth the field. Now for ſmall ſhot, it ſucceedeth in the place of the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed of antiquity. By them a Battaile may be broken, if they be not repreſſed, and themſelues cut off in time. But what is ſaid of them that may not be ſaid of Bowes and Arrowes? The greateſt fields that we gained againſt the <hi>French,</hi> were gained onely by our Archery. To ſay nothing of other Nations, that had the skill of ſhooting: ſo that no reaſon can be alleadged why the formes of Battailes vſed by antiquity for aduantage, may not be as well vſed in our
<pb facs="tcp:7185:4"/>
dayes. Howſoeuer the matter ſtandeth, my deſire is, that the Treatiſe may with your fauourable acceptance beare your names in the Front thereof. Not becauſe I thinke it worthy of your Patronage, but for that I would haue it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the world, how much I eſteeme of your kindneſſe (as I ſaid) and of your loue, which you expreſſed toward me in my taking leaue of the City.

Their honour was the more, becauſe they fought with the moſt valiant men of all the</hi> Grecians, <hi>and ouercame them being many more in number then themſelues, contrary to all mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; but of all other</hi> Epaminondas <hi>was the man that merited moſt praiſe, who by his owne valour and martiall skill, won a battaile againſt thoſe Generals of</hi> Greece, <hi>which to that day were held inuincible.</hi> This Teſtimony of the <hi>Loxephalange</hi> is ſomewhat long, but the worthineſſe of the circumſtances will, I hope, beare

me out to recite it, wherein the forme agreeable to <hi>Aelian</hi> is firſt to be noted, as <hi>aduancing one wing againſt</hi> the Enemy, <hi>and holding off the</hi> other; albeit it goe a little further then <hi>Aelian</hi> preſcribeth, in that the <hi>wing kept off,</hi> ſtood not ſtill, waiting time to come forward, but when the Enemy came vp, ioyned with him, giuing ground, of purpoſe to diſtract his phalange, and on that ſide to buſie him with a ſlow fight, leſt happily he might giue vpon the aduerſe flanke of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and ſuccour his owne partie that already was in fight. It ſheweth beſides, the aduantage of Military skill; for the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> Maſters of Armes at that day in <hi>Greece,</hi> hauing faſhioned <hi>a halfe Moone,</hi> and imagining in that forme to incloſe the ſmall number of the <hi>Baeotians,</hi> and to charge them on euery ſide, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> with his <hi>Loxe Phalange</hi> ſo plyed the front of their wings, that the reſt of <hi>the halfe Moone,</hi> being neuer able to ſtrike ſtroake, became vnprofitable: It ſhewes further what kinde of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile is fitteſt to encounter the <hi>halfe moone:</hi> Laſtly, it hath the reaſon and vſe of the <hi>Loxe phalange;</hi> that is, to charge one of the Enemies wings with the beſt and ſtrongeſt part of our forces, and at the ſame inſtant to annoy him with the other wing, thereby to embarre him from giuing aide to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were in fight. <note n="g" place="margin">Diod. l. 17 592 E</note>

                  <p>THis Chapter ſheweth the inlarging of a <hi>Phalange</hi> or battell, by diuers placings partly of the armed, partly of the light-armed. It is not hard to be vnderſtood; the rather becauſe moſt of the alterations here mentioned are ſpoken of heretofore either in <hi>Aelian,</hi> or in my notes: Sixe formes are here ſet downe, two by changing the place of ſome of the Armed, the other foure by changing the place of the light-armed, the armed are altered by <note n="b" place="margin">Doubling the front by middle men.</note> Parembole or <note n="c" place="margin">Adioyning.</note> Proſtaxis, the light armed by <note n="d" place="margin">Forefronting.</note> Protaxis, <note n="e" place="margin">Placing after.</note> Epitaxis, <note n="f" place="margin">Placing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene.</note> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxis, and <note n="g" place="margin">Placing on the wings.</note> Hypotaxis; what the ſignification of each is ſhall be ſhewed in the notes following.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Parembole.</hi>] This muſt alwayes be of armed, which are taken from the reare of the Armed, and inſerted betwixt the files of the front: of this kinde is the doubling of the front by middle men with their halfe files, whereof <hi>Aelian</hi> hath ſpoken in the 29 Chapter, ſee the figure there.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Protaxis</hi> or <hi>fore-fronting.</hi>] I haue ſhewed before in the notes vpon the ſeuenth Chapter, that <hi>the light-armed</hi> were diuerſly placed in the front, in the reare, on the wings, within the battell; when they are placed before, it is called Protaxis, ſee the figure here: <note n="h" place="margin">Diod.

                  <p>6. <hi>Hypotaxis.</hi>] Placing of the light armed on the wings was much vſed in ancient time, as the manner is alſo at this day: but <hi>Aelian</hi> would haue them ſo placed, that the eminency of them ſhould make a hollow front in the battaile: <hi>Patritius</hi> taketh <hi>Hypotaxis</hi> to be the placing of the light armed in the <hi>reare,</hi> which ſeemeth to be a miſtaking, both becauſe the placing of them in the reare is in this Chapter called <hi>Epitaxis,</hi> and alſo becauſe there being foure manners of ordering the light-armed, one in the <hi>front,</hi> another in the <hi>reare,</hi> the third <hi>within the body of the Phalange</hi> man to man, the fourth in the <hi>wings:</hi> if this ordering ſhould be vnderſtood to be behinde the Phalange, there would be two kinds of placing of the light armed in the <hi>reare,</hi> and none

Notwithstanding, being puffed vp with the hope of a ſpeedy victory, and with the fight of the Enemy, and their happy battailes of former times, thinking nothing ſo hard that it might not be atchieued by their valour, they made no end of their chace, till they came neere to the Wall, and Gates of the Towne; and ſome of them entring at a gate, otherſome clymbing vp the wall, imagined they had gotten poſſeſsion of the towne.

But if the place bee found plaine and euen, the Trumpet of the middle battell will bee ſufficient for all the other battels: if it be vneuen, or the winde, as it often happeneth, boiſterous, or the noiſe of waters hinder the cleerneſſe of the ſound, it will not bee inconuenient for a Trumpet to ſpeake in euery battell ſo that three may be ſounded in the whole Army. For the more that ſtilneſſe is obſerued, the leſſe ſhall the youger ſort of Souldiers be diſturbed, or the beaſts affrighted, and more terrible ſhall the battell ſeeme to the enemy, and directions be better heard and put in execution.</hi>

               <p>(1) <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing now to ſpeake of <hi>marching,</hi> I will firſt giue to vnderſtand that ſome kinde of march is a (2) <hi>right-induction,</hi> otherſome a (3) <hi>deduction</hi> on the <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left hand,</hi> and that in a <hi>ſingle,</hi> or <hi>double,</hi> or <hi>treble,</hi> or <hi>quadrupleſided</hi> battell: In a <hi>ſingle,</hi> when one Enemy is feared, in a <hi>double,</hi> when two in a <hi>treble,</hi> when three in a <hi>quadruple,</hi> when the Enemy purpoſeth to giue on all ſides. Therefore the March is vndertaken ſometimes in a <hi>ſingle,</hi> ſometimes in a <hi>double,</hi> or in a <hi>three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,</hi> or in a <hi>fourefold</hi> phalange.</p>
               <p>(4) A right induction is, when one body of the ſame kinde followeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as if a Xenagy lead, the reſt follow Xenage-wiſe; or if a Tetrarchy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7185:27"/>
lead, the reſt follow according to that forme. It is ſo called when the march ſtretcheth it ſelfe forth into a <hi>wing,</hi> hauing the <hi>depth</hi> many times exceeding the <hi>length.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt it is oppoſed the <hi>caelembolos</hi> or <hi>hollow-wedge,</hi> which is framed when the Antiſtomus <hi>diphalange</hi> diſioyneth the leading wings, cloſing the reare in forme of the letter V, as the figure after doth teach, in which the front is diſſeuered, and the reare ioyned and knit together: for the right induction pointing at the <hi>midſt</hi> of the Enemies battell, the Caelembolos quickly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before, ſerueth both to <hi>frustrate</hi> the charge of the front of the <hi>induction,</hi> and to <hi>claſpe in</hi> and circumuent the <hi>flanks thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore a Triphalange is to be ſet againſt the Caelembolos, one Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange fighting againſt one wing of the Caelembolos, the ſecond againſt the other, and the middle or third phalange forbearing, and expecting a time fit to charge.</p>

                     <hi>Leo</hi> ſheweth the inconueniency of the <hi>Herſe</hi> or induction in marching thorow Champaine and large plaines, firſt in that the Enemy with <hi>a broad-fronted</hi> battaile may <hi>enfold</hi> and encompaſſe the front, and ſo eaſily rout it then, becauſe if the Enemy <hi>charge the flanke</hi> it will quickly be broken, as being without depth: further, if he fall vpon the <hi>reare,</hi> it is in the like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of encompaſſing, as was the front: laſtly neither can the <hi>front</hi> giue ſuccour and aſſiſtance to the <hi>reare,</hi> in caſe it be ouerpreſſed by the Enemy, nor yet the <hi>reare</hi> to the <hi>front,</hi> they being ſo farre diſtance one from another. And he concludeth that the forme of a <hi>ſquare</hi> or <hi>broad-fronted</hi> battaile, is fit for a march in all occaſions, being eaſily to be ordered, and without danger.

Of Deductions there are 2 kinds: one to the <hi>right,</hi> the other to the <hi>left hand.</hi> And becauſe the file-leaders march on the right or left hand flanke, not in front; therefore the one is called <hi>a right hand deduction;</hi> the other <hi>a left hand deduction.</hi> So that not the body which continueth or beginneth the march, but the place of the file<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders in the march, makes the difference betwixt Induction and Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What the Vſe of Deduction is, we ſhall ſee in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>A right Induction is.</hi>] <hi>Aelian</hi> deſcribeth the right Induction by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of ſeuerall bodies of one kind one after another: as if a<note n="a" place="margin"> A Xenagy and a Syntagma, are all one: It conſiſteth of 16 files, 16 men to the file.</note> Xenagy lead, all the reſt of the forces are to bee ſeparated into Xenagies, and ſingly one after another to follow the firſt leading Xenagy: ſo of other bodies leſſer or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Notwithſtanding in a right Induction, wee muſt take this caution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that the <hi>file-leaders</hi> proceed in the <hi>front;</hi> for otherwiſe if they bee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the <hi>flanke,</hi> it is now no <hi>induction,</hi> but a <hi>deduction,</hi> howſoeuer the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall bodies of a kind follow one another.</p>
                  <p>This is that manner of marching which is called, marching in a <hi>wing,</hi> of which I haue ſpoken ſufficiently in my notes vpon the 30 Chapter. There are other kind of <hi>inductiue marches</hi> ſet forth in the Greeke Hiſtory, which are not altogether of the forme which <hi>Aelian</hi> deſcribeth: for where <hi>Aelian</hi> would haue <hi>Xenagies</hi> to follow one another with the <hi>file-leaders in front,</hi> his meaning is, that the whole 16 files of the Xenagie ſhould bee laid together all the <hi>file<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders</hi> being layed in an euen front. Now you haue examples where whole Companies march in one file; ſo that all the file-leaders haue not the front, but reſt included in the inward parts of the file, and yet many of theſe files ioyned together make an induction. <note n="a" place="margin">Xenoph.

After they ſtood in this order, hee commanded them to follow, as he led, and ſtraightway he led them running: but becauſe hee perceiued that the way was too ſtreight to march with ſo many in Front, hee willed the firſt</hi>

the file-leaders ought to be placed within the hollow flanks of the Caelem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolos, as it were a lyning to the inſides; and the Di-phalange Antiſtomus being once framed (which is to haue the file-leaders in the middeſt from the one end of the battaile to the other) there needeth no further labour, then to diſpatch the <hi>front</hi> in the middeſt (leauing the file-leaders on both ſides) and to faſten and ioyne together the <hi>reare,</hi> to the end that the front of the <hi>right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> may enter into the hollowneſſe, but yet be maſhed, as it were in a net, and neither able to paſſe through the reare of the Caelembolos, being cloſe ſhut, nor yet to giue offence to thoſe that fight in the front of the Caelem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolos, hauing no man whom they may charge in the void ſpace; nor yet da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to breake the forme of their battaile after ioyning.

                     <hi>Vegetius, that in fight the manner of your embattailing is not to be changed, nor any number of Souldiers to be tranſported to other places then they haue: For hereof tumult and confuſion will ſtreight ariſe, and the enemy will eaſily take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of ſuch as are not ready or fallout to be diſordered.</hi> I haue ſaid that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines and Grecians differ in the name of this battaile, howbeit they agree both about the forme, which may here appeare by <hi>Aelian,</hi> who reſembleth it to the letter V, neither can there a better reſemblance be made; for as the letter V conſiſteth of two lines which are open in the top, cloſe in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, ſo doth this forme of battaile of two ſides, which in front are void, open, and diſſeuered, in the reare ioyned and cloſed faſt together. If you will therefore frame this battaile, you muſt firſt make a ſquare, the file-leaders being all in front; then muſt you wheele the wings of your battaile into the middeſt, and ſo your file-leaders ſhall be in the middeſt; laſtly, you are to open the front of your battaile, leauing halfe the file-leaders in the inſide of one flanke, and halfe in the inſide of the other, keeping the reare cloſe knit together: and for the <hi>opening,</hi> it ought to be ſomewhat more then will receiue into the void ſpace the front of the <hi>right induction,</hi> which being once let in, the inward two flanks of the wedge where the file-leaders are, ought to <hi>face</hi> to both hands, and to charge the outward flanks of the right inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo circumuent them.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Furthermore, a Triphalange.</hi>] A Triphalange in this place of <hi>Aelian</hi> is, when a ſquare body or phalange is from front to reare diuided into three parts. The figure ſhewes the manner. The Triphalange hath as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage againſt the Caelembolos, as the Caelembolos had againſt the right induction. The Caelembolos compelled the <hi>right induction</hi> to fight with the worſt men, and auoided the affront of the file-leaders, which were the beſt. The <hi>Triphalange</hi> hauing the file-leaders in front, oppoſeth two ſeuerall fronts: againſt the two wings of the Caelembolos, where there are no file<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders (for they are alwayes diſpoſed for the inſide) and both auoideth the aduantage the Caelembolos ſought, and maketh the Caelembolos fight with the worſt men, in as much as one of the Phalanges chargeth the front of one wing of the Caelembolos, the file-leaders whereof are in flanke within the hollowneſſe, the other chargeth the other. Now it hath this aduantage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that it ſpareth <hi>reſerues</hi> for all occaſions, by off-holding the third Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange. If the Caelembolos be beaten by the two oppoſing Phalanges, all is loſt, and no hope left of winning the field, no other forces being to ſecond it, where notwithſtanding the Caelembolos hauing gotten the better, may be curbed, and the victory arreſted by this reſerue, and by the remnant of the other two Phalanges broken.</p>

Deduction is the mother of many formes of battailes vſuall in marches: from it come the Caelembolos, whereof we ſpake before; from it are the Antiſtomus, the Periſtomus, the Homoioſtomus, the Heteroſtomus, of which hereafter.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>When the Phalange proceedeth in a wing.] Suidas</hi> hath, <hi>that Paragoge or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction is ſaid to be when the phalange marcheth with the file-leaders on the right or left hand; if on the left, it is ſaid to be a left-hand deduction; if on the right, a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand deduction.</hi> He maketh no mention of a <hi>wing</hi> as <hi>Aelian</hi> doth; for it may ſo fall out, that the body may be ſuch as hath the depth and breadth all one, as a Xenagy which hath ſixteene in breadth, and ſixteene in depth: ſome bodies alſo, as the Taxies and Tetrarchies haue the depth leſſe then the breadth, the firſt holding ſixteen in depth &amp; no more then eight in breadth, the laſt foure in breadth and ſixteene in depth, ſo that they march not in a <hi>wing.</hi> But becauſe marches for the moſt part are vndertaken in a <hi>wing,</hi> it is the cauſe why <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith that deductions proceed in a <hi>wing,</hi> the depth whereof manifoldly exceedeth the length, and they proceed.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Not by file but by ranke.</hi>] That is, the file-leaders being wheeled to the flanke, after they haue ſetled themſelues to march, proceed on their iourney as they ſtand in the flanke, onely facing that way the march is intended, and returne not to lead in the front of the battaile, as they did at firſt. To lead by file is, when the file-leaders proceede, and haue their files following at their backe. To lead by ranke is, when that which was the flanke at firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the front, and beginneth the march, and the reſt follow according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flanke-wiſe: yet this is to be noted, that albeit the front of the battaile be changed in the deduction, yet remaine the files, files as they were before, and are not altered into rankes. <hi>Aelian</hi> himſelfe giueth teſtimony hereto, affirming that the Phalange proceedeth not by file, but by ranke, whereas if the files held not their firſt name after wheeling to the right or left flank, the march forward (the file-leaders being in the flanke) ſhould be by file and not by ranke.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>For the phalange marcheth in a double, treble, or quadruple ſide.</hi>] A <hi>double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </hi> is that, which hath the file-leaders on both the flankes, the reſt backe to backe within, when the enemy giueth on. For otherwiſe, when they march forward, all their faces are ſet one way, that is toward the place whether the march is intended. A <hi>treble-ſided</hi> battaile is, when three ſides of the battaile are to be charged, whether the front and both the flankes, or both the flanks and the reare, or the reare, one of the flanks, and the front, and the file-leaders are ordered on all the three ſides. A quadruple battaile is, when the file-leaders are placed in front in the reare and in both the flankes. An example of the quadruple battaile will ſhew the vſe and framing of the reſt: for as the reſt oppoſe one, two, or three ſides againſt the enemy, ſo the quadruple fortifieth and ſtrengthneth all the foure ſides, by placing the file<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders in them. Of ordering the file-leaders vpon one flanke, deduction may be be an example; vpon both flanks, the Antiſtomus phalange vpon front

and reare, the Amphiſtomus, on all foure ſides, the Pleſium, of all which occaſion will be giuen to ſpeake hereafter. Now I may ſignifie that the <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium</hi> is a ſquare hollow battaile, the length whereof much exceedeth the depth, hauing the armed foot placed on all the foure ſides, the light-armed throwne into the middeſt.

                  <p>(1) THere are many kinds of battailes, which being vſefull for a march, are deſcribed partly in the former two chapters, partly in this and in the chapters following, whereof ſome are for eaſe of the march (as the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi>) ſome for fight. Thoſe which are for fight, are either <hi>offenſiue,</hi> or elſe <hi>defenſiue.</hi> Of the <hi>offenſiue</hi> kinde is the Caelembolos before mentioned, of the <hi>defenſiue</hi> the Triphalange to be oppoſed againſt the Caelembolos, and both the <hi>deductions,</hi> which are repreſented in the two laſt Chapters: and in this chapter is deſcribed another of the defenſiue formes, that is to ſay the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange Autistomus;</hi> in which although the march be not continued (for it is alwayes taken vp in a ſtand, to reſiſt a charge of the enemy) yet it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy defenſiue againſt the ſudden attempts of the enemy which is about to charge your reare.</p>

                  <p>3. <hi>It is of great vſe</hi>] The vſe of this battaile is principally againſt horſe, as <hi>Aelian</hi> giueth to vnderſtand; becauſe they are quicke and ſpeedy, and can ſuddenly turne, diuide themſelues, and charge where they liſt. And the flanks of the battell being the weakeſt part (for your beſt men are placed in the front and reare) it is needfull to finde out ſome meanes to defend them, which is to inſtruct your Souldiers how to receiue the charge by turning their faces to the flankes. In front you are alwaies ready; becauſe faces and weapons are bent that way. Effect the like in the flankes, and you ſhall be able to reſiſt any charge of the enemy. For foot, the danger is not ſo great, becauſe your men ſhall be able to <hi>face</hi> euery way, as readily as the enemy; giue them only exerciſe, and acqaint them with that manner of fight.</p>

But I take the reaſon, why it was ſeldome put in practice, to be, becauſe <hi>the flankes of pikes</hi> in the <hi>Grecian</hi> battell were for the moſt part, garded with horſe and light-armed. The front and reare hauing no ſuch defence, were commonly attached by the enemy, ſeeking all aduantage to diſtreſſe them; and in caſe the horſe and light-armed bee abſent, the <hi>flankes</hi> are the faireſt marke of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; which can by no other meanes be ſecured, but by facing that way where he giueth on; which may be euidently ſeene by the fight <hi>Cyrus</hi> the elder had againſt <hi>Craeſus,</hi> which example you ſhall ſee ſet out in my notes vpon the 46.

So the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtomus Phalange, which the Celtes caſt themſelues into, was not onely fearefull to the eye, but alſo fitly ordered for fight. The Inſubrians and Boyans came forth to fight wearing bretches &amp; a kind of looſe and light coats; but the Geſates out of a vaine glory and raſhneſſe caſt them away, and ſtood naked, ſauing that they had their armes alone, in the front of the batell, imagining they were by that meanes fitter for action,</hi>

                     <hi>by reaſon of the buſhes of the place, which would catch hold of any garment, and be a hinderance to the vſe of armes. The firſt fight was about the hill in the ſight of all, by reaſon that the multitude of ſo many horſe-menout of both armies were mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fight; wherein it happened</hi> Attilius <hi>to be ſlaine (while too venturouſly he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelfe to danger) and his head to be preſented to the</hi> Kings <hi>of the Celts, but yet the Roman horſe-men brauely fighting, became maſters of the place, and of the enemy: After this the foot ioining, the accident was rare and maruailous not onely to them which were preſent, but alſo to all thoſe, who can by reading repreſent before their eyes the truth of that which was done. For firſt the fight being attached by 3 armies, it muſt needs be that the very ſight and manner of the conflict appeared ſtrange and wihout example; ſecondly, who would not doubt either now or then, whether the Celts manner of embattailing were more dangerous, the enemy charging them in two places at once; or the beſt and apteſt for victory, as oppoſing againſt both the enemies at once, and withall ſecuring themſelues from encompaſsing and inuaſion of the reare: and which is of moſt importance, no hope being left of ſafety, if they ſhould chance to be foyled. For that is the property and profit of the Amphiſtomus battaile; it made the Romans more confident, to haue the enemy encloſed on all ſides; and yet the brauery and noyſe and tumult of the Celts gaue them cauſe of aſtoniſhment; For there was an innumerable multitude of Trumpets and Shalmes, to which the whole army together adding the Paean, the cry was ſo great, that not onely the trumpets and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but the places round about with their rebounding ecchoes ſeemed of themſelues to ſpeake. Furthermore, the ſight and motion of the naked men that ſtood in the front, being in flower of their age, and excelling in talneſſe of ſtature, was fearefull. Now all the Gaules that had the front were adorned with bracelets and chaines of gold; which the Romans eyeing, were partly astonied, partly being filled with rich hopes, were incited much the rather to ioyne battell; but when the darters running out of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man army according to their custome, threw many and forcible darts at the Celtes, the Celtes of the reare found good vſe of their coates and breeches; but thoſe that fought naked in the front, this accident happening contrary to their expectation, were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled out of meaſure and wonderfully perplexed: for the Gauliſh target being not of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to couer a mans body, the greater and nakeder their bodies were, the more were they ſubiect to wounds, and the leſſe the weapons miſſed the marke. At the laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to ſaue themſelues from the light-armed, who plied them a farre off, nor from the multitude of dartes that fell amongst them, and being troubled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with their preſent ſtate, ſome of them out of a rage and brutiſhneſſe ranne vainly vpon the enemy, and willingly offered themſelues to ſlaughter, other retiring leaſurely to their friendes, and ſhewing manifeſt tokens of feare, diſordered them behinde. Thus the Roman light-armed allaid the pride of the Geſates. But the multitude of the Inſubrians, Boyans, and Tauriſcans, after the Romans had receiued their light-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into their battell, and aduanced the cohorts, (of armed) to ioyne hand to hand, maintained a ſtout fight, and albeit they receiued many woundes, yet fainted they not in minds, being onely inferior both generally and particularly in the kinde of armes they bore. For both their targets in defence, and their ſwords in offence, had a great difference; by reaſon the Gaulois ſword is onely fit to ſtrike withall. But when the Roman horſe from the hill haſted downe in wing, and ſtoutly came to handy ſtroakes with them, the foot-men of the Celtes were cut in pieces in the places where they fought, and the horſe tooke themſelues to flight: There dyed therefore of the Celtes 30000, and 10000 were take priſoners, amongst whom was</hi> Concolitan <hi>one of the</hi> Kings, <hi>the other</hi> K. Aneroeſtus, <hi>flying to a certaine place with a few, killed</hi>

In the meane time the Indians knitting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether their whole power of horſe, made head againſt Alexander with all ſpeed, giuing their horſe a full carriere. Then Caenus, as was commanded, ſhewed himſelfe at their backes. The Indians ſeeing this, were forced to order their horſe in an Amphistomus, oppoſing one part (the moſt and ſtrongeſt) to Alexander, the other to Caenus and his troopes; which thing troubled the array and mindes of the Indians. And Alexander, taking hold of the opportunity, charged thoſe which were oppoſed to him in the inſtant, while the other were facing about to Caenus.

placed in the middeſt within, the bringers vp on the flanks without; and the battaile being firſt cloſed, muſt be ſuddenly opened vpon the charge of the Horſe in the middeſt, and the file-leaders diuiding themſelues halfe on one ſide, halfe on the other, and facing to the middle ſpace with their whole files puſh at the Horſe with their Pikes, as they paſſe thorow. It is called a Diphalange, becauſe the phalange is parted in two; as the battaile oppoſed againſt the Caelembolos is named a Triphalange, becauſe it conſiſteth of three parts ſeuerall, and in the ninth Chapter the whole Macedonian pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange is named a Tetraphalangarchy, becauſe the body is diuided into foure ſeuerall parts: and it is named a Diphalange Antiſtomus, becauſe as the Phalange Antiſtomus receiueth the Horſe without in the flanks, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſeth them ſo this altering that forme, onely by placing the file-leaders in depth within, and opening vpon the ſudden receiue the Horſe in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned voide ſpace, either to be ouerthrowne by their Pikes, or elſe to giue them a paſſage without danger to themſelues.

Then hee chargeth with his horſe in a full Carrere: to auoide the fury of the horſe, they opened and gaue him a free paſſage, but not without ſtroakes, and darts ſent at his horſe; and ſo made his charge more hurtfull to himſelfe then vnto them: I cannot ſay the file-leaders were here in the middeſt, as <hi>Aelian</hi> requireth, becauſe the charge was ſudden and vnexpected. In premeditated defences, there is no doubt, but it is the better way to place the file-leaders in the middeſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering they are accounted the ſtrength of the battell, and in all conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are firſt brought to fight, eſpecially being armed men, and able to offend the horſe with their Pikes; This opening then auailed againſt the giuing on of horſe ordered in a narrow front: for that was the manner of ordering the Perſian horſe; and it may ſerue for any horſe-battaile if it bee

Of ancient time ſythed Chariots were in requeſt, to which the foot whether light or armed could make ſmall reſiſtance; they had two long ſtaues appointed with ſharpe iron faſtened to the beame of the chariot bearing out before, and ſythes ſtanding out on all ſides to cut aſunder whatſoeuer came in the way: the horſe were armed and hardly to be wounded, as you may ſee in the figure of the 22 Chapter. The reamedy then againſt them was to open the bataile in front and reare, to the end to let them paſſe thorough, which opening was after the manner ſet downe in this Chapter. <note n="a" place="margin">Died ſic. lib. 17. 592.

                     </note> called oblique, yet we may not imagine, that theſe Loxe-phalanges are the ſame that is deſcribed in the 30 Chapter. For in that one of the Phalange forbeare the fight, the other aduanceth to ioyne with the enemy; in this both fight at once, and haue their aduantage by charging the flanks of the enemy. That began the fight in front &amp; had there the file-leaders, this in both flanks; this ſeeks to encompaſſe, that to auoid encompaſſing it ſelfe, as I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my notes vpon the ſame Chapter.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>The oblique deduction on the right-hand, hauing the file-leaders without.</hi>] I muſt imagine, till further information, that here is a fault in the text: my reaſon is this; all <hi>deductions</hi> are made to oppoſe the file-leaders againſt the enemy in fight. So is the right-hand <hi>deduction</hi> vſed, when it is ſuſpected the enemy will charge the right-hand flanke: the left-hand Deduction, when it is ſuſpected he will charge the left; ſo in wheelings we turne the front againſt the enemy, ſo in countermarches. Now this forme being inuented to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſe the enemy, and to fight vpon his flankes, I would thinke the file<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders ought to be placed on the inward flanks of the Diphalange; as it is in the Caelembolos; for were the bringers vp to be within, they ſhould ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine all the weight of the fight, the battaile being once diuided, and the file-leaders ſtanding without ſhould idlely looke on, which is contrary to the military diſcipline of the Grecians, whoſe care was to vſe the file-leaders in fight as much as was poſſible. Neither is it thereupon to be concluded, that this Diphalange and the Diphalange Antiſtomus are all one. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both haue their file-leaders within, yet doe they differ both in forme and end. In forme, becauſe this moueth forward with both Phalanges, the other ſtandeth ſtill: this is oblique, the other in a ſtreight line; that hath the front of the two phalanges euen, this (as it falleth out in the motion) ſometimes the one more forword, ſometimes the other. In their ends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this goeth to aſſault and to breake the enemies battaile, the other ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth faſt and ſeekes onely to ſaue it ſelfe; the one being offenſiue, the other defenſiue. So that, as I ſaid before, the Caelembolos and this are both fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of the Diphalange Antiſtomus, both hauing their file-leaders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the middeſt of the battaile; and yet differ in that the Caelembolos is but one body hollowed within; this diuided into two bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they fearing to be encloſed.</hi>] The caſe of this ſquare is almoſt all one with the ſquare againſt which the Caelembolos is oppoſed: For both are in danger to be encloſed. Now as the other <hi>ſquare</hi> was faine to caſt it ſelfe into a <hi>Triphalange,</hi> and to oppoſe two of the <hi>phalanges</hi> againſt the two wings of the <hi>Caelembolos,</hi> reſeruing the third for all accidents; ſo this <hi>ſquare</hi> diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſelfe into two <hi>phalanges</hi> (but hath no third) ſetting the one againſt the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7185:45"/>
right-hand battaile of the Periſtomus, the other againſt the left; for by this oppoſition they inhibit the enemy from attaching their flanks. Of this forme I finde not many <hi>preſidents</hi> in the Greeke hiſtory; I will receite one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Arr. l. 5. 111. C. Diod. Sic. l. 609.</note> one out of <hi>Arrian</hi> concerning <hi>Alexander,</hi> which if it hit not this forme in euery point, yet it hath fully the effect of that which is intended by <hi>Aelian: Alexander</hi> being to deliuer battaile to <hi>Porus</hi> a King of part of India, lying on the other ſide of the riuer Hydaſpes, found his enemies army to be thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battailed; <hi>He had placed his Elephants in the front</hi> 100 <hi>foot distant one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and he placed them there to giue terror to</hi> Alexanders <hi>Horſe, for hee imagined that no enemy durſt approach the ſpaces betwixt the Elephants, neither with Horſe for feare of the Elephants, and much leſſe with foot, becauſe the armed on his ſide were there to receiue them, and the Elephants would tread and trample them vnder their feet. Next he ordered the foot, not in an equall front with the beasts, but in a ſecond front after them, ſo that the files came vp almoſt to the ſpaces betwixt the Elephants; beſides, he added foot vpon the wings aboue the Elephans. On both the wings of the foot he ordered his Horſe, and before them his Chariots. This was the embattailing of</hi> Porus. Alexander <hi>as ſoone as he ſaw the Indians ſtand in battaile array, cauſed his Horſe to make alte, that he might haue his foot come vp, who aduanced ſtill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And when the Phalange was come vnto him running, he embattailed it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, nor forthwith led it againſt the enemy, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſt he ſhould deliuer it weary and out of breath into the hands of the Barbarians, that were freſh; but circling and riding here and there in rounds with his Horſe, he reſted his foot, and gaue them time to refreſh themſelues. And after he beheld the Indian manner of Embattailing, hee thought it not good to giue vpon the middeſt (of the front) where the Elephants ſtood, and the Phalange was cloſe ordered againſt the ſpaces of the Elephants, fearing the reaſons that led</hi> Porus <hi>to embattaile in that forme. But, as he was ſtronger in horſe, taking to him the moſt of his Horſe, he ſpeeded to the left wing of the enemy, in purpoſe to giue on there, and ſent</hi> Coenus <hi>with</hi> Demetrius <hi>his troope and his owne troope againſt the right wing; commanding him, that when the Barbarians ſeeing his troopes, ſhould turue their ſtrength of Horſe againſt him,</hi> Coenus <hi>ſhould inuade their backs. He gaue the Phalange to</hi> Seleucus, Antigones <hi>and</hi> Tauron <hi>to lead; commanding them not to fall on, before they ſaw the enemies foot and horſe put into a branſle by his Horſe.</hi> What the euent of the fight was, I haue before ſhewed in my notes vpon the Phalange Amphiſtomus, where I haue cited the latter end of this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now may be ſeene by this example, that <hi>Alexander</hi> began the fight not in the front, but in the flankes; and the cauſe why he did it, was, becauſe the front was exceeding ſtrong by reaſon of the Elephants. And by this meanes defeating firſt the enemies Horſe, then his foot, he left the Elephants naked, and without defence againſt the darts and other miſſiue weapons of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians, and gained a worthy victory againſt a ſtrong enemy. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this example come not home in all points to the Periſtomus (for <hi>Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> limiteth it to foot againſt foot, this fight was betwixt Horſe and Horſe) yet is the reaſon of warre alike in both. For as the file-leaders of the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomus giue on vpon the flanke of the aduerſe ſquare, which is the weakeſt part of it; ſo did the Horſe of <hi>Alexander</hi> ſurmounting the Indians both in number and valor, giue on vpon the flanks of <hi>Porus</hi> his army which was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt, and ſo began and ended the victory.</p>

                  <p>1 HOmoioſtomus is a Diphalange, the battailes whereof haue like fronts. To this forme is incident, firſt that it be marching, then that it march in <hi>deductions;</hi> laſtly, that the deductions be vpon one and the ſelfe, and not vpon contrary ſides, <hi>viz.</hi> that the file-leaders of the Phalanges, be all of them either vpon the right hand, or vpon the left hand of their Phalanges. And therefore <hi>Suidas</hi> defineth it to be a <hi>Diphalange, which hath the leaders of either Phalange ordered in the ſame ſide of the march.</hi> Where he ſaith that the <hi>leaders</hi> are ordered on the ſame ſide in both Phalanges (which words are likewiſe in <hi>Aelian</hi> in the end of the Chapter) wee muſt vnderſtand no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>2 <hi>Becauſe a whole file.</hi>] I am out of doubt that this place is corrupted: any man that marketh the coherence will eaſily be of mine opinion. The inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of a Diphalange, which conſiſteth of two phalanges. The cauſe why this forme is called a Diphalange, Homoioſtomus, is in theſe words aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be, becauſe a <hi>whole file, that is, 16 men mouing, another file followeth it:</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:7185:48"/>
let one file follow another, what is that to two Phalanges? Euery Phalange hath many files in it, as the <note n="a" place="margin">Aelian c. 7.</note> ſeuenth Chapter will teach vs; nor will any man ſay that a file is a phalange, nor that the following of one file ſingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other will make a Diphalange: the truer cauſe is alleadged in the words following: It is therefore called Homoioſtomus, becauſe <hi>they that follow, follow in the like figure:</hi> which words albeit they be generall, yet being explained and particulariſed in the end of the Chapter, they ſhew, <hi>that it is called a Diphalange Homoiostomus when two phalanges follow one another, either in a right, or a left hand deduction.</hi> And by that part of the text the nature of the Homoioſtomus is ſufficiently expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>This is oppoſed againſt the</hi>

                     <hi>Plinthium.</hi>] How this forme ſhould be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the Plinthium, I muſt confeſſe I yet vnderſtand not, vnleſſe it be that being in a march, the Plinthium charge one of them on that ſide where the deduction, (that is in the front, for the flanke is now become the front) (the file-leader facing to the enemy way) and that the other if it be the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding phalange retiring &amp; whealing, the following file aduancing and whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) giue vpon the flank of the Plinthium, ſo that the Plinthium be charged both in front and in flanke, which is no ſmall aduantage in fight; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if the Plinthium meet the Phalanges ſo following one another, and charge the front which leadeth (which indeed is not the front but the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding flanke, in aſmuch as the march proceedeth not by file but by ranke, as <hi>Aelian</hi> hath) <hi>the deducton</hi> not onely loſeth the benefit of bringing the file lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to fight, but is alſo ſubiect to <hi>ouerwinging,</hi> and by that meanes in worſe caſe then is the <hi>induction</hi> which hath the file-leaders in front. There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſes of the Homoiſtomus, they are here ſpecified by <hi>Aelian.</hi> For the the Deduction directing the front againſt the enemy that appeareth, or is like to appeare on the flank of the deduction, the phalanges may fitly ſecond one another, when either of them is charged; not vnlike the two btatailons of<note place="margin">

And if both the deductions be charged at once, they are at no greater inconuenience, then if they ſtood ranged in ordinary manner, being either of them 16 deepe, and the fronts which are in the deduction ready to receiue the affort of the enemy, and the reſt of the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Creſſant may be framed not onely before fight is begun, but alſo in the heat of fight: Before the fight, you haue an example of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians againſt <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> which I haue cited at large in my notes vpon the 30 Chap. <note n="c" place="margin">

Now as formes of aduantage are to be ſought againſt the enemy; ſo is it needfull to aduiſe what beſt oppoſition is to be made againſt ſuch battailes: in caſe the enemy vſe them. The Rombe of horſe was of old time accounted a forcible figure againſt foot; the horſe therein had the better. The Menoeides was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented to reſiſt and ouerthrow the horſe: The foot had beene the better; what was then beſt for the horſe? to abſtaine from charging (ſaith <hi>Aelian</hi>) and to ply the foot with miſſiue weapons, to the end to force them to break

For the two fronts fighting in the winges and keeping their place, it is not poſsible for the halfe circle to come forward with an euen front: when they are therefore confuſed and haue broken their array, let the third battaile that remained in the middeſt for ſeconds, charge them, as they diſorderl, aduance. If they ſtill keepe their place in the bottome of the hollowneſſe, oppoſe the light-armed and darters againſt them, who will excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly diſtreſſe them with their miſsiue weapons: likewiſe you may doe well to frame a Loxe-phalange of your whole Army, and with your two Loxes, charge the winges, preuenting ſo the circling and encompaſing of the Menoeides. For the Enemy, being a long while hindered from comming to blowes with his whole Army, ſhall bee kept in play with a few, none fighting but thoſe onely that are in the winges, which firſt of neceſsitie muſt ioyne, becauſe of the oblique onſet. It will not bee a miſſe alſo, leiſurely to retire with the Army ſometimes, as though you were in feare; or elſe facing about to make your retreat orderly, as if you fled; and afterward turning ſudd onely to meete the Enemie that preſſeth vpon you. For ſometimes the Enemie being ouer-ioyed in the imagination of a true flight, doth follow vnaduiſedly, and make a diſorderly purſuit; euery man preſsing to be formoſt, vpon whom you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne without danger, and againe, chaſe them that follow you; who will be ſtruckes with a fear in that you dare, contrary to their expectation, turne again &amp; make head againſt them. Onoſander</hi> giueth here three wayes to reſiſt the Menoeides: one by diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your battaile into a Triphalange, &amp; oppoſing two phalanges againſt the two wings of the Creſſant, forbearing and ſtanding firme with the third till opportunity be to moue (which is the battaile that <hi>Aelian</hi> oppoſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Caelembolos.) The ſecond by vſing the Loxe-phalange againſt it, as did <hi>Epaminondas</hi> at the battaile of Leuſtra againſt the Lacedemonian halfe moone, as I haue ſhewed elſewhere, namely Chap. 30. §. 7.

                     <hi>Vegetius</hi> reſembleth them to the letter V. His words are theſe: <hi>Againſt it (that is againſt the wedge) the forme of battaile is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, which they call Forfex. For this is a kinde of battaile framed of the choyceſt Souldiers to the likeneſſe of the letter V. and it receiueth and ſhutteth within it the wedge. Vegetius</hi> ſaith, the Forfex or Forceps is like the letter V. Of this forme is the Caelembolos in <hi>Aelian;</hi> and reſembled to the ſame letter in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tearmes; as you may ſee in his thirtie ſixe Chapter. So that hauing the ſame forme, it muſt be the ſame battaile, howſoeuer they differ in the Greeke and Latin names. This being ſo, and ſeeing <hi>Aelian</hi> in this Chapter deſcribeth the Epicampios by it ſelfe, and in another Chapter the Caelem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolos by it ſelfe giuing a different forme to them both, there is no probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to thinke they ſhould be one. Now beſides the forme here ſet downe by <hi>Aelian,</hi> (which is to bee marked, as it is deſcribed,) the deſcription of <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſhewes the forme of the Epicampios Emproſthia, out of whoſe words a man may eaſily diſcerne, that the Caelembolos and it are not all

Put therefore two Gammas togither in this ſort <figure/> and you haue the perfect forme of the Epicampios Empro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthia. The paſſage is worth the recitall, although it be ſomewhat long. For it both containeth the forme of the battaile, and the manner of oppoſition againſt it.

That turned the concauity or hallowneſſe backward toward the reare, and the two hornes againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and ſought to encompaſſe, this turneth the conuexe or outward part foremoſt, not the hornes, and endeauoureth to auoid encompaſſing: For the Epicampios, if a man ſhould enter into the hollowneſſe thereof, claſpeth him in, and is able to charge him in front, and on both flanks at one time. But the conuexe halfe Moone auoiding that danger, meeteth the enemy with the bearing out of the halfe circle, and giueth the two wings of the Epicam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pios enough to doe, being not to be annoyed with the depth of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſe, which remaineth a pretty diſtance more backward then the points of the wings. So that this forme is fit to be oppoſed againſt the Epicampios, and looſeth no aduantage of embattailing: and it auoideth the perill of the hollow front by not entring, and yet maintaineth the fight againſt the two wings that are thru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

His words are in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect theſe: <hi>Hanniball,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>embattailed his army thus; He placed on the left hand the Spaniſh and Celtiſh horſe right ouer againſt the Roman horſe: next to them of foot halfe the Lybian heauy armed; then the Spaniards and Celts, next them the other halfe of the Lybians. On the right wing he ordered the Numidian horſe: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had framed an euen front of the whole Army, he aduanced the middle Spaniards and Gauls, and caſt them into a conuexe halfe Moone, gathering vp the depth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with and making it thin, meaning to hide the Lybians with it, and diſpoſing the Lybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans behinde them as ſeconds.</hi> And a little after he declareth the manner of fight. <hi>Then the heauy-armed foot ſucceeding the light armed, encountred together. The Spaniards therefore and Gauls a while brauely maintained their order and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Romans; but being ouer-preſſed, they turned their backs, and retired, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing the forme of their halfe Moone. The Roman Cohorts couragiouſly following ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily broke aſunder the battaile of the Celts, which at firſt was ordered in a ſmall depth; themſelues transferring the thickneſſe of their battaile from the wings of the middeſt, where the fight was; for the middeſt and the wings fought not at the ſame time. The middeſt began the fight firſt, becauſe the Celts ranged in a halfe Moone, bore much more forward the the wings, hauing not the hollownes but the prominent ſwelling of the half-Moone lying out toward the enemy. So the Romans following &amp; running together to the middeſt, where the enemy gaue grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, entered ſo far into the enemies battaile, that they had the heauy-armed Lybians on either of their flanks; of whom thoſe of the right wing facing to the Target, charged them on the right; thoſe of the left wing, facing to the pike, gaue vpon their left ſide, occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe ſhewing what was fit to be done: ſo that it cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced</hi>

If it had had the due proportion of depth, it might haue ſtood a longer time againſt the efforts of the enemy, and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the victory againſt the broad-fronted phalange; againſt which if it may be oppoſed, there is no queſtion but it may be ſet againſt the Epicampios, becauſe the broad-fronted phalange hath all her forces vnited together, the Epicampios fighteth onely with her two wings, the middeſt of the battaile being farre from ioyning; vnleſſe a man be compelled to enter into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſe of the front, in which caſe both the front and the wings may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy him.</p>

                  <p>(1) THis Chapter containeth the deſcription of two battails, one of horſe, the other of foot to be oppoſed in fight one againſt another; namely the <hi>ſquare of horſe,</hi> and the <hi>wedge of foot.</hi> Of which the tetragonall horſe-bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, <hi>ſquare in figure, or ground</hi> (for all is one) is deſcribed in my notes vpon the 18. Chapter of <hi>Aelian,</hi> as alſo the <hi>wedge of horſe,</hi> from which this wedge of foot (as <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith) is deriued. It will be therefore needleſſe to repeat, what is there written about the formes and diuerſity of them; or to make compariſon of their vſe and aduantage. Againſt the Rhombe of horſe, if they come to charge foot, he hath ſet downe two formes of foot to receiue them; the <hi>Creſſant</hi> and the <hi>hollow-fronted</hi> battaile called <hi>Epicampios emproſthia:</hi> which vpon this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eaſon, becauſe they are hollow in front both, and the Rhombe ſhooteth forth and chargeth in a point, muſt of neceſſity by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that point into their hollowneſſe, and plying it with their weapons on all ſides, diſtreſſe the Rhombe both in front and flanke, which is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kinde of fight, and ſuch a one as ſeldome may be tolerated or endured.</p>
                  <p>(2) Againſt the <hi>ſquare horſe battaile</hi> in figure or ground, he oppoſeth in this Chapter, the <hi>wedge</hi> of foot, which albeit it cannot with the like art wrappe in and encompaſſe the ſquare, yet is it of force ſufficient to breake and diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it, and ſo to diſorder and deface it. For the ſquare of horſe hauing a large front and going with full ſpeed to charge, falleth vpon the narrow front of the wedge, which according to <hi>Aelian</hi> ought to containe no more then three men, and they knitting themſelues cloſe, their pikes pretended and being ſeconded with the reſt of their companions behinde pretending their pikes likewiſe, receiue the charge with a firme ſtand, ſo that onely the middeſt of the horſe falling vpon the point of their front; cannot reach to the flanks of the wings thereof (becauſe the wedge from the firſt narrowing groweth backward into an increaſing breadth) without breaking of their forme, and altering of the front of their ſquare, wherein they were ordered: which if they doe, their repulſe cannot but follow, becauſe they fight out of order. Now that the forme of the <hi>wedge</hi> in horſe is able to endure the ſhot of the horſe, that came againſt them in a <hi>ſquare,</hi> appeareth by the 18. Chapter of this booke, where it is ſaid that <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedon <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> father vſed this forme alone, and that <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelfe ordered his horſe in the ſame manner, who were both victorious in all their fields. That it is as good for foot againſt horſe beſides the reaſons before rehearſed may be euident by this, that the horſe are in motion in the charge, and by that meanes are ſoone diſordered, whereas the foot ſtand faſt, and keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſecure to repulſe the violence of the horſe.</p>

                     <hi>prowe againſt the enemy, imagining that whereſoeuer he ſhould breake their array, he ſhould thereby ouerthrow their whole army. For he reſolued to bring the beſt and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt part of his army to fight, caſting the weakeſt behinde in the reare, knowing that being defeated they would diſcourage their owne ſide, and breed new courage in the enemy. The enemy ranged his horſe like a phalange of armed foot in a great depth without ioyning foot with them. But</hi> Epaminondas <hi>made a ſtrong wedge of his horſe alſo allotting them</hi>

For you ſhall hardly find any, that will make good their ground, after they ſee them of their owne ſide take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to their feet. And to the end, to with hold the Athenians from ſuccouring thoſe of the left wing next vnto them, he placed both horſe and foot right ouer againſt them vpon the hils, to put them in feare of charging their reare, if they gaue ayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the enemy, ſo led he on to the charge, and was not deceiued of his hopes.

When the Roman army had entred the forreſt by day-light, the enemy riſing out his ambuſh vpon the ſudden inuaded them on both flanks. Which</hi> Flaccus <hi>(hee was the Roman Generall) ſeeing, ſtilled the tumult by the Captaines commanding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man to his place, and armies, and bringing the baggage and carriage beaſts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he constantly and without feare embattailed his army partly by himſelfe, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Legates and by the Tribunes of the ſouldiers, as the time and place required. The enemy came on, and the skirmiſh was attached in the vttermoſt parts of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Phalange, and at laſt the battailes ioyned. The fight was hot in all parts, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune diuers: for the Legeons behaued themſelues brauely, and the auxiliarie; in both wings as well. The mercinaries were hardly laid vnto by the enemy (who bore the like armes; and was a better kind of ſouldier) &amp; had much ado to make good their ground. The Celtiberians, when they ſaw they could not match the legions in the ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fight, and Enſigne againſt Enſigne, caſt themſelues into a wedge, and ſo aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Romans: in which kind of fight they are ſo powerfull, that they are ſcarcely to be reſiſted. Then the legions alſo branced, and the battell was almoſt broken. Which danger when</hi> Flaccus <hi>perceiued, he rode to the legionary horſemen And is there no helpe in you ſaid he?

They obeyed, and pulling off their horſes bridles they paſſed &amp; repaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the enemies wedge twice with great ſlaughter, eueryone breaking his ſtaffe. The Celtiberians after the breaking and diſperſing of their wedge, in which all their hope remained, began to be afraid, and almoſt quitting the ſight, ſought where they might beſt to ſaue themſelues.

For when the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians running on furiouſly fell vpon the Romans with a ſhout and outery giuing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the milder; they preſently broake the front of thoſe that ſtood in the void ſpace, (for the Heruli were not yet come vp) and the leaders of the point of the wedge cutting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder all that ſtood in their way, euen to the vttermoſt depth of the file, and yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no great ſlaughter, were carried beyond the bringers vp of</hi> Narſes <hi>battaile, and ſome of them continued their courſe further, thinking to take in the Roman Campe, Then</hi> Narſes <hi>preſently turning about and extending out his wings, and making (as the Tacticks name is) an</hi> Epicampios emproſthia, <hi>commanded the archers on</hi>

For being on horſebacke higher then the Barbarian foot, they might at their pleaſure ſtrike them, as they aduanced forward, being in a great bredth, and nothing to ſhadow them.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Agathias.</hi> It would be long to rehearſe the reſt of the battaile which he exaggerateth rhetorically. I haue recited ſo much, as both ſheweth the ſtrength of the <hi>wedge,</hi> and withall the manner which was vſed by <hi>Narſes,</hi> to ouerthrow it. For I find three kinde of wayes which haue beene practiſed to reſiſt and defeat it. One by charging it with horſe, before it enter the aduerſe battaile, as <hi>Flaccus</hi> did againſt the Celtiberians. The ſecond to frame the aduerſe battaile empty in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt (filling it with ſome ſouldiers notwithſtanding for ſhew) and when hee entreth the ſpace, to plye his reare with ſhot, and charge it throughly as <hi>Narſes</hi> did. The third to oppoſe againſt it a <hi>hollow wedge</hi> (which <hi>Vegetius</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth forfex) and receiuing and letting in the point of this wedge into the hollowneſſe of the other to claſpe it in, and charge it on all ſides. <hi>Againſt the wedge ſaith</hi> Vegetius, <hi>is oppoſed the battaile called forfex, a paire of ſheeres: For it is framed of the beſt and valianteſt ſouldiers to the ſimilitude of the letter</hi> V. <hi>and it receiueth in, and embraceth the wedge, ſo that it cannot breake through it.</hi>

But the manner of framing both ſtandeth vpon one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: For the file-leaders being placed within the Caelembolos, the front of the battaile is opened and the reare kept cloſe: in the other, the file-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being without, the reare is opened, the front ſtill maintained ſhut. <note place="margin">

                     </note>
Now the file leaders place is varied in either of them, becauſe of the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall effects which they worke. The hollow fronted wedge Caelembolos ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to hold the enemy together, &amp; ſo defeat him. The other to diſpart and rout him, and ſo to gaine the victory. And becauſe the ſtreſſe of the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembolos is within (for the flankes of the hollowneſſe claſpe in the enemy, and fight againſt his flanks) therefore are the file leaders the formoſt that fight within; as likewiſe becauſe the outſides of the wedge of this Chapter beare all the weight of the fight, therefore in it are the file-leaders without. For as in all other battailes the file-leaders ought firſt to attach the enemy, ſo is it likewiſe in theſe two formes. But where <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith, that this battell is made out of the <hi>Diphalange Antiſtomus,</hi> by ioyning the wings in front, and opening them behinde, I take the Text to be corrupted. For the Dipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange Antiſtomus hath the file-leaders within, to reſiſt the horſe that charge them, as the 40 Chapter teacheth: this hath the file-leaders without to breake the enemies battaile and diſſeuer it. The Caelembolos indeed is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of the Diphalange Antiſtomus: But the wedge of this Chapter ſpringeth out of the Phalange Antiſtomus, which hath the file-leaders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. And ſo I am of opinion, it ought to be read in the Text. And yet there is no queſtion but another way of figuring the wedge may be practiſed, then to leaue it hollow behind. In this Chapter it is called Embolos, and <hi>Aelian</hi> faith it is borrowed of the horſe-wedge: Now that the horſe-wedge is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid</p>

                  <p>IN this Chapter, being the laſt, that deſcribeth formes of battailes, are two kindes of battailes ſet forth, which are (if I miſtake not) of more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, I am ſure, ſuch as haue beene more practiſed, then any of the other, that goe before in this booke; and they ſpecially giue aduantage to them, that haue aduantage in numbers of men, and can frame a larger fronted Phalange then the enemy is able. And either of them oppoſeth a large front againſt the enemy, the one ſtretching it beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the points of both their wings the other beyond the point one of their wings.

                  <p>1 <hi>When both wings of the Phalange ouer-reach the enemies front.</hi>] To make it then Hyperphalangeſis, the front muſt be much broader then the enemies, &amp; extended beyond both their wings, of purpoſe to ouer reach &amp; wrap them in, charging not onely the front, but alſo the flankes on both ſides at once; which is ſo dangerous a kinde of fight, that he that is ſo aſſayled, can haue no great hope of making reſiſtance againſt his enemy; becauſe the front be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place which is ordained for fight, and the pikes being bent and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from thence, if at the ſame time the flankes be alſo charged, the ſides of the ſouldiers muſt needs lye open to wounds, no man being able to defend himſelfe, and turne his weapons two wayes at once.

Thus were the Lacedemonians embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed: Their enemies thus; The Mantinaeans had the right wing, becauſe the warre was made in their Territory: by them ſtood the Arcadians their confederates. Then 1000 ſelected Argiues, whom the City had long time trained vp in military exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; to whom ioyned the other Argiues; and after them were ordered the Cleoneans, and the Orneatians their allies.

When they were ready to ioyne, King</hi> Agis <hi>bethought himſelfe of this ſtrata gem: It is the manner of all armies in the onſet to ſtretch out their right wings, and with them to circumuent and encompaſſe the left wings of their aduerſaries; becauſe euery ſouldier carefull of his owne ſefety ſeekes to couer his vnarmed ſide with the tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get of him that ſtandeth next to his right hand, and imagineth that the ſetting of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets cloſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſerues for the beſt defence againſt the enemy. The cauſe is this; the corner file-leader of the right wing deſiring to withdraw as much as hee can his naked ſide from the weapons of the enemy proceedeth to the right hand, and the reſt follow him. And at that time the Mantineans a great deale ouer-reached the Scirites with their wing. The Lacedemonians and Tegeats much more the Athenians, by reaſon they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And for the void ſpace that ſhould remaine vpon their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing; he commanded two Polemarchs or Coronels,</hi> Hipponoidas <hi>and</hi> Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <hi>to lead therin two cohorts from the right wing, and fill vp the void ſpace, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that he ſhould, this notwithſtanding, leaue himſelfe ſtrength enough in the right wing, and that the wing oppoſed againſt the Mantineans ſhould hereby be better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to the encounter. But it happened that</hi> Hipponoidas <hi>&amp;</hi> Ariſtocles <hi>followed not theſe directions, whether the reaſon were in the ſudden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When they came to hands, the right wing of the Mantineans put the Scirites and Braſideans to flight. And they and their allies, and the 1000 ſelected Argiues falling into the empty ſpace, that was not filled vp, made a great ſlaughter of the Lacedemonians; and encompaſsing them forced them to turne their backes in haſt, and flye to their waggons, and ſlue alſo ſome of the elder ſort of ſouldiers, that were left for guard there.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Thucydides.</hi> I proſecute not the remanen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus then apply it. The Mantineans had their right wing farre extended beyond the point of the left wing of the Scirites and braſidaeans; who by marching out to the left hand ſought to equall the front of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, but left the ground voyd, wherein they were firſt placed.

                     <hi>IF we admoniſh firſt that they ought to be ſhort.</hi>] The ordering and motions of an army ought to be quickly performed, the rather becauſe the tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the body and the occaſions of them are ſudden for the moſt part. And therefore the meanes to worke the tranſmutations commanded (theſe meanes are the words of direction) ought to ſuite to the nature of the motions themſelues, and to be applyed to celerity by ſhortneſſe of ſpeach. Short ſpeach is better carried away, and ſooner put in execution, then ſpeech that is longer. Yet is not ſuch a ſhortneſſe to bee affected, as will bring with it obſcurity, according to the ſaying of the Poet; <hi>Breuis eſſe labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro—Obſcurus fio. I labour to be ſhort, and ſo become obſcure.</hi> And therefore I take the practice of French Commanders, when they command Facing in theſe words; <hi>A droie, a gauche,</hi> to the right, to the left, without adding <hi>face,</hi> and likewiſe of the Netherlanders in imitation of the French <hi>Reehes om, ſlinks om,</hi> and of ſome Engliſh in theſe words; <hi>To the right, to the left,</hi> not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the motion which is to be made to the hand appointed. Theſe I ſay, I take to be without the warrant of reaſon, and of all antiquity, from which <hi>Aelian</hi> draweth this rule. For the command of <hi>right</hi> and left alone ſheweth that the Commander would haue a motion performed to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hand, but leaueth vncertaine what the motion ſhould be, ſo that albeit ſome ſouldiers fall to <hi>a countermarch,</hi> ſome other to <hi>wheeling,</hi> or to <hi>doubling,</hi> or to <hi>facing,</hi> they are to be reputed blameleſſe, and to haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that which their direction willed them to doe, becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was of mouing to the <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left</hi> hand onely, not ſhewing what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be made to either hand. Shortneſſe therefore is required by <hi>Aelian,</hi> but ſuch a Shortneſſe as is not wrapped vp in obſcurity, and which may fully deliuer the minde of the Commander to the ſouldiers, which hee hath in exerciſe. And as the words ought to bee ſhort, ſo ought they to be,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Without double ſignification.</hi>] Where they haue a double ſignification, that is, may be diuerſly vnderſtood by them, who are vnder direction; ſome of the ſouldiers (as <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith) will doe one thing, ſome another, which muſt needs breed a confuſion in the body exerciſed. For as vniformity of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in euery particular ſouldier preſerueth the whole body, and euery ioynt, or part, thereof entire, ſo the diſsimilitude of motion in the particulars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a diſioynting, as it were, &amp; a diſorder of the multitude of the whole battaile in generall. To auoid then the inconuenience of double vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in words: <hi>Aelian</hi> thinketh fit, that the <hi>ſpeciall</hi> word ſhould be placed before the <hi>generall,</hi> and in ſtead of <hi>Face to the pike,</hi> he would haue the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7185:77"/>
to pronounce thus: <hi>To the pike face</hi> (that is to the <hi>right hand:</hi>) hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the word <hi>right hand</hi> to be more ſpeciall or ſtreighter in ſignification, then the word <hi>Face.</hi> Let me haue pardon if I differ from <hi>Aelian</hi> herein. For Logicians hold thoſe words more generall, that ſtretch vnto, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend vnder them moſt particulars. Now conſidering there are foure moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the battaile, which cannot be put in vſe but by words of direction, and in the direction the word <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left hand</hi> is of neceſsity to be applyed to euery of them (as for example <hi>Countermarch</hi> to the <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left hand. Face</hi> to the right or <hi>left hand,</hi> and ſo of the reſt:) it is euident, that the word <hi>right hand,</hi> or <hi>left hand</hi> is more generall then any one of the motions, becauſe it ſtretcheth to them all. So that albeit we retaine the rule of <hi>Aelian,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſet the ſpeciall before the generall, yet may we very ſafely from his example, and not onely in <hi>facing,</hi> but alſo in the three other motions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the direction thus: <hi>Face</hi> to the <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left hand, Double</hi> to the <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left hand, Countermarch</hi> to the <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left hand, Wheele</hi> to the <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left hand:</hi> becauſe the word <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left hand</hi> is more generall, then any one of the <hi>motions.</hi> But admit it were more particular, yet the neceſsity of our language would force vs to forſake this rule of <hi>Aelian.</hi> For in euery language there is an idiome or propriety of ſpeech, and that not onely in the phraſe it ſelf, but alſo in the very ioyning &amp; tying together of the words of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. So that that which ſorteth well with one language, will not be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in another. In Greeke, in which tongue <hi>Aelian</hi> wrote, it ſoundeth well to place the nowne gouerned by a verbe, before the verbe it ſelfe. So in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Dutch, French, and other tongues. In Engliſh if a man ſhould doe the like (vnleſſe it were in verſe, wherein the number of the feet is more reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted then the ordering of the words) he ſhould be accounted ridiculous or vaine. For take the example here ſet downe, to the <hi>right han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>SIlence when a battaile is put in order either for fight, or exerciſe, is one of the principall points of obedience, which belongeth to a ſouldier; the breach whereof more endangereth the proceeding of warre, then a rawe ſouldier would thinke, who onely is wont to offend in that kind. I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entreated of ſignes, and ſhewed, that in the obſeruing of directions conſiſteth the greateſt helpe of victory; in neglecting them, the chiefeſt meanes to take an ouerthrow, and be defeated. For as directions being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted giue life vnto warlike actions to effect that which the Commander deſireth, ſo whatſoeuer hindereth the receiuing of directions, muſt needs croſſe the deſignes of the Commander, and by conſequence fruſtrate and diſanull that which was thought by him moſt fit to be put in practice either for the good order, or for the preſeruation of the Army, or elſe for the gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of victory: A man that is not attentiue cannot marke the command deliuered: Nor can he be attentiue, that whileſt it is deliuered buſieth his head with other thoughts, or elſe entertaineth his next ſtanders by with talke, a meanes to diuert aſwell the ſpeaker as the hearer from that heed which ought to be giuen to direction; in aſmuch as no man hath the ability to heare another mans ſpeech, and himſelfe take at the ſame inſtant, or at the ſame time to diſcerne two mens ſeuerall ſpeeches, which are deliuered together.

But the manner is, that the leaders of the ſecond file fall directly behind the leader of the firſt file, and the ſecond man of the ſecond file behind the ſecond man of the firſt, and ſo the reſt of thoſe two files. The ſame order is for the reſt of the euen files, when they double the odde files. And the word is:</p>

                     <p>It is to be obſerued, that in all theſe motions of doubling rankes or front, the ſouldiers are to returne after their motion to their firſt poſture; which is done by facing about to the right or left hand, and then by mouing, and by recouering their firſt place.
