            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:63063:5"/>
that I propoſed him to my ſelf for a Pattern in the Deſign I then had, to carry my Curioſity as far as the place where the Sun riſeth; <hi>that</hi> I have often drowned in the ſweetneſs of his entertainment the bitterneſſes, which elſe I muſt have ſwallowed all alone, in ſuch irkſome and unpleaſant paſſages, as are thoſe of <hi>Aſia.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE deſire of ſeeing the World having made me Travel into <hi>Paleſtina</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> would not let me ſtop there; it put me upon a reſolution to ſee the <hi>Red Sea</hi> from one end to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63063:10"/>
other. I went from <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> after I had ſtaid there above a year; and in two and thirty hours, going the <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> pace, I arrived at <hi>Suez,</hi> where I embarked in a Galley, which in ſeventeen days carry'd me, always in ſight of land, to the Port of <hi>Gidda,</hi> which is half a days journey from <hi>Mecca.</hi> There I was conſtrained (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my hopes, and the promiſe which the <hi>Beig</hi> of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> had made me) to go a ſhore on that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Holy Land of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> where a Chriſtian, that is not a Slave, dares not ſet his foot. I ſtaid there four and thirty days; and then I embarked in a ſmall Veſſel, which in fifteen days carried me along the Coaſt of <hi>Arabia the Happy</hi> to <hi>Moka,</hi> near the Streight of <hi>Babel-mandel.</hi> I reſolved to paſs thence to the Iſle of <hi>Maſowa</hi> and <hi>Arkiko,</hi> to get as far as <hi>Gouder,</hi> the Capital Town of the Country of <hi>Alebech,</hi> or the Kingdom of <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> but I received certain information, that, ſince the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had been killed there by the intrigue of the Queen Mother, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63063:10"/>
together with the Jeſuit Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, whom they had brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Goa,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks were not ſafe there; a poor Capuchin having loſt his head at <hi>Suaken,</hi> for having attempted to enter into that Kingdom: That indeed, by going under the name of a <hi>Greek</hi> or an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> I did not run ſo great hazard, and that even the King himſelf, when he ſhould know, that I could do him ſervice, would give me Land to Till by Slaves, which I might buy if I had money; but that undoubtedly they would forthwith oblige me to Marry, as they had lately done a certain Frier, who had paſſed there under the name of a <hi>Greek</hi> Phyſitian; and that they would never ſuffer me to come away again.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations, among others, induced me to change my reſolution. I went aboard of an <hi>Indian</hi> Veſſel; I paſſed thoſe Streights, and in two and twenty days I arrived at <hi>Surratte</hi> in <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> the Empire of the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> in the Year 1655. There I found,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63063:11"/>
that he who then Reigned there, was call'd <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> that is to ſay, King of the World; who, according to the Hiſtory of that Countrey, was Son of <hi>Jehan-Guyre,</hi> which ſignifieth Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the World, Grandchild of <hi>Ekbar,</hi> which is Great, and that thus aſcending by <hi>Hohmayons,</hi> or the Fortunate, Father of <hi>Ekbar,</hi> and his other Predeceſſors, he was the <hi>Tenth</hi> of thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from that <hi>Timur-Lengue,</hi> which ſignifieth the <hi>Lame Prince,</hi> commonly and corruptly call'd <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> ſo renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his Conqueſts; who Married his near Kinſwoman, the only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Prince of the Nations of <hi>Great Tartary,</hi> call'd <hi>Mogols,</hi> who have left and communicated their Name to the ſtrangers, that now Govern <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan,</hi> the Countrey of the <hi>Indians;</hi> though thoſe that are employ'd in publick Charges and Offices, and even thoſe that are liſted in the <hi>Militia,</hi> be not all of the Race of the <hi>Mogols,</hi> but ſtrangers, and Nations gather'd out of all Countries, moſt of them <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> ſome <hi>Arabians,</hi> and ſome <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63063:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For, to be eſteem'd a <hi>Mogol,</hi> 'tis enough to be a ſtranger white of Face, and a <hi>Mahumetan;</hi> in diſtinction as well to the <hi>Indians,</hi> who are brown, and <hi>Pagans,</hi> as to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> who are call'd <hi>Franguis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I found alſo at my arrival, <hi>that</hi> this King of the World, <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> of above ſeventy years of Age, had four Sons and two Daughters; <hi>that,</hi> ſome years ſince, he had made theſe four Sons Vice-Kings or Governours of four of his moſt conſiderable Provinces or Kingdoms; <hi>that</hi> it was almoſt a year that he was fallen into a great ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whence it was believed he would never recover: Which had occaſioned a great diviſion among theſe four Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (all laying claim to the Empire) and had kindled among them a War which laſted about five years, and which I deſign here to deſcribe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been preſent at ſome of the moſt conſiderable Actions, and entertained for the ſpace of eight years at that Court, where Fortune and the ſmall ſtock of Money (left me after divers

encounters with Robbers, and the expences of a Voyage of ſix and forty days from <hi>Suratte</hi> to <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Dehli,</hi> the Capital Towns of that Empire) obliged me to take a Salary from the <hi>Grand Mogol</hi> in the quality of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and a little while after from <hi>Danech-mend-Kan,</hi> the moſt knowing Man of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who had been <hi>Bakchis</hi> or Great Maſter of the Horſe, and was one of the moſt powerful and the moſt conſiderable <hi>Omrahs</hi> or Lords of that Court.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eldeſt</hi> of theſe four Sons of <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was call'd <hi>Dara,</hi> that is <hi>Darius.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> was call'd <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> that is the Valiant Prince. The Name of the <hi>Third</hi> was <hi>Aurenge-Zebe,</hi> which ſignifies the Ornament of the Throne. That of the <hi>Fourth</hi> was <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad-Bakche,</hi> as if you ſhould ſay, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire accompliſhed. Of the two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the eldeſt was call'd <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> that is the Miſtreſs Princeſs; and the youngeſt <hi>Rauchenara-Begum,</hi> which is as much as Bright Princeſs, or the Splendour of Princeſſes.</p>

'Tis the Cuſtom of the Countrey, to give ſuch Names to their Princes and Princeſſes. Thus the Wife of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> ſo renown'd for her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for having a Tomb, which much more deſerved to be reckon'd among the Wonders of the World, than thoſe unſhapen Maſſes, and thoſe heaps of ſtones in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was called <hi>Tage-Mehalle,</hi> that is to ſay, the Crown of the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> and the Wife of <hi>Jehan-Guyre,</hi> who hath ſo long Govern'd the State, whilſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band minded nothing but Drinking and Divertiſements, was firſt called <hi>Nour-Mehalle,</hi> and afterwards, <hi>Nour-Jehan-Begum,</hi> the Light of the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> the Light of the <hi>World.</hi> The reaſon, why they give ſuch kind of Names to the Great Ones, and not Names from their Land or Dominion (as is uſual in <hi>Europe)</hi> is, becauſe all the Land being the Kings, there are no Marquiſates, Earldoms and Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, of which the Grandees might bear their Names; all conſiſts in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions either of Land or ready Money,

which the King giveth, increaſeth, retrencheth, and takes away, as ſeems good unto him: And 'tis even for this reaſon, that the <hi>Omrahs</hi> have alſo no other but ſuch Names; one <hi>(for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)</hi> being called <hi>Raz-Audaze-Kan, i. e.</hi> a Thunderer; another, <hi>Safe Cheken-Kan,</hi> a Breaker of Ranks; a third, <hi>Bare-Audaze-Kan,</hi> a Man of Lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; others, <hi>Dianet-Kan,</hi> or <hi>Danech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend-Kan,</hi> or <hi>Fazel-Kan, i. e.</hi> the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lord, the Intelligent, the Perfect, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dara,</hi> the Eldeſt Son, wanted not good Qualities. He was Gallant in Converſation, Witty in Reparties, exceeding Civil and Liberal, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained too good an opinion of his perſon, eſteeming himſelf alone ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all, and thinking it ſcarce poſſible that any Body was able to give him counſel; inſomuch, that he would give reproachful Names to thoſe who pretended to adviſe him in any thing; whereby it came to paſs, that even thoſe, who were moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to him, were ſhie to diſcover to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63063:15"/>
him the moſt ſecret Intrigues of his Brothers. Beſides, he was apt to be tranſported with paſſion, to menace, to injure, to affront, even the greateſt <hi>Omrahs</hi> or Lords; but all paſſed over like a flaſh of Light. Though he was a Mahumetan, and publickly expreſſed in the ordinary Exerciſes of Religion to be ſo, yet, in private, he was Heathen with the Heathen, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian with the Chriſtians. He had conſtantly about him of thoſe Heathen Doctors, to whom he gave very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Penſions, and who (as was ſaid) had inſtilled into him Opinions contrary to the Religion of the Land; of which I may touch ſomething hereafter, when I ſhall come to ſpeak of the Religion of the <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> He alſo hearkened of late very willingly to the Reverend Father <hi>Buzee</hi> a Jeſuit, and began very well to reliſh what he ſuggeſted. Yet there are ſome who ſay, that at the bottom he was void of all Religion, and that whatever he pretended in it, was only for curioſity, or, as others ſay, out
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63063:16"/>
of policy, to make himſelf beloved by the Chriſtians, who are pretty nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in his Artillery; but above all, to gain the Affection of the <hi>Rajas</hi> or Soveraign Gentiles, that were Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the Empire, and to make them of his party upon occaſion. Mean time, this hath not mueh furthered his Affairs, on the contrary, it will appear in the ſequel of this Hiſtory, that the pretence uſed by <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> his third Brother, to Cut off his Head, was, that he was turned <hi>Kafer,</hi> that is to ſay, an Infidel, of no Religion, an Idolater.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> the ſecond Brother, was much of the humour of <hi>Dara,</hi> but he was more cloſe and more ſettled, and had better Conduct and Dexterity. He was fit to manage an Intrigue well, and he made, under hand, friends by the force of preſents, which he heaped upon the great <hi>Omrahs,</hi> and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally upon the moſt powerful <hi>Rajas,</hi> as <hi>Jeſſomſeigne,</hi> and ſome others; but he did ſomewhat too much indulge his pleaſures, in entertaining an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63063:16"/>
number of Women, among whom when he was, he ſpent whole days and nights in drinking, ſinging, and dancing. He made them preſents of very rich Apparel; and he encreaſed or leſſened their penſions according as the fancy took him: By which kind of Life his Affairs did languiſh, and the affections of many of his people cooled. He caſt himſelf into the Religion of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> although <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> his Father, and all his Brothers, were of the <hi>Turkiſh.</hi> 'Tis known that <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metaniſm</hi> is divided into ſeveral Sects, which made that famous <hi>Check-Sady,</hi> Author of the <hi>Gouliſtan,</hi> ſay in Verſe, which is to this effect in Proſe; <hi>I am a Dervich Drinker, I ſeem to be without Religion, and I am known of ſixty two Sects.</hi> But of all thoſe Sects there are two principal ones, whoſe Partiſans are mortal Enemies to one another. The <hi>one</hi> is that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> whom the <hi>Perſians</hi> call <hi>Oſmantous,</hi> that is, Sectators of <hi>Oſman;</hi> they believing that 'tis he that was the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſor of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Great
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63063:17"/>
Caliph or Soveraign Prieſt, to whom alone it did appertain to interpret the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and to decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies to be met with in the Law. The <hi>other</hi> is that of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> whom the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Chias, Rafezys, Aly-Merdans,</hi> that is, Sectaries, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Partiſans of <hi>Aly,</hi> becauſe they believe, contrary to the belief of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that this ſucceſſion and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Authority, which I juſt now intimated, was due only to <hi>Aly</hi> the Son-in-law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> It was by reaſon of State that <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> had embraced this latter Sect, conſidering that all the <hi>Perſians</hi> being <hi>Chias,</hi> and moſt of them, or their Children, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the greateſt power at the Court of <hi>Mogol,</hi> and holding the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Places of the Empire, he had moſt reaſon to hope, that, when occaſion ſerved, they would all take his part.</p>

                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> the third Brother, had not that Gallantry, nor ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Preſence of <hi>Dara,</hi> he appeared more ſerious and melaneholy, and

was indeed much more judicious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the World very well, and knowing whom to chuſe for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and purpoſe, and where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his favour and bounty moſt for his intereſt. He was reſerved, crafty, and exceedingly verſed in diſſembling, inſomuch that for a long while he made profeſſion to be <hi>Fakire,</hi> that is, Poor, <hi>Dervich,</hi> or Devout, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the World, and faining not to pretend at all to the Crown, but to deſire to paſs his Life in Prayer and other Devotions. In the mean time he failed not to make a party at Court, eſpecially when he was made Vice-King of <hi>Decan;</hi> but he did it with ſo much dexterity, art, and ſecrecy, that it could hardly be perceived. He alſo had the skill to maintain himſelf in the Affection of <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> his Father, who although he much loved <hi>Dara,</hi> could yet not forbear to ſhew that he eſteemed <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and judged him capable to Reign; which cauſed jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie enough in <hi>Dara,</hi> who began to find it, inſomuch that he could not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63063:18"/>
hold from ſaying ſometimes to his friends in private; <hi>Of all my Brothers I apprehend only this Nemazi,</hi> that is, this <hi>Bigot,</hi> this great Praying-man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> the Youngeſt of all, was the leaſt dextrous, and the leaſt judicious. He cared for nothing but mirth and paſtime, to drink, hunt, and ſhoot. Yet he had ſome good Qualities; for he was very civil and liberal; he gloried in it, that he kept nothing ſecret; he deſpiſed <hi>Cabals;</hi> and he bragg'd openly, that he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted only in his Arm and Sword: In ſhort, he was very Brave, and if this Bravery had been accompanied with ſome Conduct, he would have carried the Bell from all his Brothers, and been King of <hi>Indoſtan;</hi> as will appear in what is to follow.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the two Daughters, the Eldeſt, <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> was very Beautiful, and a great Wit, paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately beloved of her Father. It was even rumoured, that he loved her to that degree as is hardly to be imagined, and that he alledged for his excuſe,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63063:18"/>
that, according to the determination of his <hi>Mullahs</hi> or Doctors of his Law, it was permitted a Man to eat of the Fruit of the Tree he had planted. He had ſo great a confidence in her, that he had given her charge to watch over his ſafety, and to have an Eye to all what came to his Table: And ſhe knew perfectly to manage his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and even in the moſt weighty Affairs to bend him as ſhe pleaſed. She was exceedingly enriched by great penſions, and by coſtly preſents, which ſhe received from all parts, for ſuch Negotiations as ſhe employed her ſelf in about her Father: And ſhe made alſo great expences, being of a very liberal and generous diſpoſition. She ſtuck entirely to <hi>Dara,</hi> her Eldeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpouſed cordially his part, and declared openly for him; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to make the Affairs of <hi>Dara</hi> proſper, and to keep him in the affection of his Father; for ſhe ſupported him in all things, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed him of all occurrences: Yet that was not ſo much, becauſe he was
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63063:19"/>
the Eldeſt Son, and ſhe the Eldeſt Daughter (as the people believed) as becauſe he had promiſed her, that as ſoon as he ſhould come to the Crown he would Marry her; which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether extraordinary, and almoſt never practiſed in <hi>Indoſtan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſcruple to relate here ſome of the <hi>Amours</hi> of this Princeſs, although ſhut up in a <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and well kept, like other Women. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I apprehend, that I may be thought to prepare Matter for a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer; for they are not <hi>Amours</hi> like ours, followed by Gallant and <hi>Comical</hi> Adventures, but attended with Events dreadful and <hi>Tragical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now 'tis reported, that this Princeſs found means to let a young Gallant enter the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> who was of no great Quality, but proper, and of a good Meen. But among ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of jealous and envious perſons, ſhe could not carry on her buſineſs ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, but ſhe was diſcover'd. <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> her Father, was ſoon adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of it, and reſolved to ſurpriſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63063:19"/>
her, under the pretence of giving her a Viſit, as he uſed to do. The Princeſs ſeeing him come unexpected, had no more time than to hide this unfortunate Lover in one of the great Chaudrons made to Bath in; which yet could not be ſo done, but that <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> ſuſpected it. Mean time he quarrelled not with his Daughter, but entertained her a pretty while, as he was wont to do; and at length told her, that he found her in a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and leſs neat poſture; that it was convenient ſhe ſhould waſh her ſelf, and bath oftner; commanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, with ſomewhat a ſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that forthwith a Fire ſhould be made under that Chaudron, and he would not part thence, before the Eunuchs had brought him word, that that unhappy Man was diſpatched. Some time after ſhe took other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſhe choſe for her <hi>Kane-ſaman,</hi> that is, her Steward, a certain <hi>Perſian</hi> called <hi>Nazerkan,</hi> who was a young <hi>Omrah,</hi> the handſomeſt and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed of the whole Court, a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63063:20"/>
Man of Courage and Ambition, the Darling of all, inſomuch that <hi>Chah-Heſtkan,</hi> Uncle of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Marry him to the Princeſs: But <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> received that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition very ill, and beſides, when he was informed of ſome of the ſecret Intrigues that had been formed, he reſolved quickly to rid himſelf of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerkan.</hi> He therefore preſented to him, as 'twere to do him honour, a <hi>Betele,</hi> which he could not refuſe to chew preſently, after the Cuſtom of the Countrey. <hi>Betele</hi> is a little knot made up of very delicate leaves, and ſome other things, with a little Chalk of Sea-Cockles; which maketh the Mouth and Lips of a Vermilion co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the Breath ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. This young Lord thought of nothing leſs than being poyſoned: He went away from the Company very jocund and content into his <hi>Paleky;</hi> but the Drug was ſo ſtrong, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could come to his Houſe, he was no more alive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rauchenara-Begum</hi> never paſſed for ſo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63063:20"/>
handſome and ſpiritual as <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> but ſhe was not leſs cheerful, and comely enough, and hated pleaſures no more than her Siſter. But ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted her ſelf wholly to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and conſequently declared her ſelf an Enemy to <hi>Begum-Saheb</hi> and <hi>Dara.</hi> This was the cauſe, that ſhe had no great Riches, nor any conſiderable ſhare in the Affairs of the State: Nevertheleſs as ſhe was in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and wanted no Wit and Spies, ſhe could not but diſcover many important Matters, of which ſhe gave ſecret advertiſement to <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> ſome years before the Troubles, finding himſelf charged with theſe four Princes, all come to Age, all Married, all pretending to the Crown, Enemies to one another, and each of them making ſecretly a Party, was perplexed enough, as to what was fitteſt for him to do, fearing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his own Perſon, and foreſeeing what afterwards befell him: For, to ſhut them up in <hi>Goualeor,</hi> which is a Fortreſs where the Princes are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63063:21"/>
kept cloſe, and which is held impregnable, it being ſituated upon an inacceſſible Rock, and having within it ſelf good water, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion enough for a Garriſon; <hi>that</hi> was not ſo eaſie a thing. They were too potent already, each of them having a Princely Train. And again, he could not handſomely remove them far off, without giving them ſome Government fit for their Birth; wherein he apprehended they would Cantonize themſelves, and become little independent Kings; as actually they afterwards did. Nevertheleſs, fearing leſt they ſhould cut one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Throat before his Eyes, if he kept them ſtill at Court, he at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to ſend them away. And ſo he ſent <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> his ſecond Son, into the Kingdom of <hi>Bengale;</hi> his third, <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> into <hi>Decan;</hi> and the youngeſt, <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> to <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaratte;</hi> giving to <hi>Dara,</hi> the eldeſt, <hi>Cabal</hi> and <hi>Multan.</hi> The three firſt went away very well content with their Government; and there they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63063:21"/>
Acted each the Soveraign, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the Revenues of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Countries, entertaining great Troops, under the pretence of bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling their Subjects and Neighbours. As to <hi>Dara,</hi> becauſe the eldeſt, and deſigned to the Crown, he ſtirred not from the Court; which that he ſhould not do, ſeemed alſo to be the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> who entertained him in the hopes of ſucceeding him after his Death. He even permitted then, that Orders were iſſued out by him, and that he might ſit in a kind of Throne, beneath his, among the <hi>Omrahs;</hi> ſo that it ſeemed, as if there were two Kings together. But as 'tis very difficult for two Soveraigns to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> though <hi>Dara</hi> ſhew'd him great Obſervance and Affection, always harbour'd ſome diffidence, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring above all things the <hi>Morſel;</hi> and beſides, for as much as he knew the parts of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and thought him more capable to Reign than any of the reſt, he had always (as they ſay) ſome particular correſpondence with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63063:22"/>
This it is, what I thought fit to premiſe concerning theſe four Princes, and their Father <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> becauſe 'tis neceſſary for the underſtanding of all that follows. I eſteem'd alſo, that I was not to forget thoſe two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, as having been the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Actors in the Tragedy; the Women in the <hi>Indies</hi> taking very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as well as at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and in many other places, the beſt part in the moſt important Tranſactions, though Men take ſeldom notice of it, and trouble their heads of ſeeking for other Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>But to deliver this Hiſtory with clearneſs, we muſt riſe ſomewhat higher, and relate what paſſed, ſome time before the Troubles, between <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> the King of <hi>Golkonda,</hi> and his Viſier <hi>Emir-Jemla;</hi> becauſe this will diſcover to us the Character and Temper of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who is to be the <hi>Heros</hi> of this Piece, and the King of the <hi>Indies.</hi> Let us then ſee, after what manner <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to lay the firſt foundation of the Royalty of <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63063:22"/>
During the time that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was in <hi>Decan,</hi> the King of <hi>Golkonda</hi> had for his Viſier and General of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies this <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> who was a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> by Nation, and very famous in the <hi>Indies.</hi> He was not a Man of great Extraction, but beaten in Buſiueſs, a perſon of excellent parts, and a great Captain. He had the Wit of amaſſing great Treaſures, not only by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Affairs of this opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Kingdom, but alſo by Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Trade, ſending ſhips into very many parts, and cauſing the Diamond Mines, which he alone had farmed under many borrowed names, to be wrought with extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. So that people diſcourſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of nothing but of the Riches of <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> and of the plenty of his Diamonds, which were not reckon'd but by Sacks. He had alſo the skill to render himſelf very potent and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, entertaining, beſides the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the King, very good Troops for his particular, and above all a very good Artillery, with abundance of

                     <hi>Franguys</hi> or Chriſtians to manage it. In a word, he grew ſo rich, and ſo puiſſant, eſpecially after he had found a way to enter into the Kingdom of <hi>Karnates,</hi> and to pillage all the ancient Churches of the Idols of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that the King of <hi>Golkonda</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came jealous of it, and prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to unſaddle him; and that the more, becauſe he could not bear what was reported of him, as if he had uſed too great familiarity with the Queen his Mother, that was yet beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. Yet he diſcover'd nothing of his Deſign to any, having patience, and waiting 'till <hi>Emir</hi> came to the Court, for he was then in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Karnates</hi> with his Army. But one day, when more particular News was brought him of what had paſſed between his Mother and Him, he had not power enough to diſſemble any longer, but was tranſported by choler to fall to invectives and menaces: Whereof <hi>Emir</hi> was ſoon made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, having at the Court abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Wives Kindred, and all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63063:24"/>
his neareſt Relations and beſt Friends poſſeſſing the principal Offices. The Kings Mother alſo, who did not hate him, had ſpeedy information of the ſame. Which obliged <hi>Emir,</hi> without delay, to write to his only Son, <hi>Mahmet Emir-Kan,</hi> who then was about the King, requiring him to do the beſt he could to withdraw with all ſpeed from the Court, under ſome pretence of Hunting, or the like, and to come and joyn with him. <hi>Mahmet Emir-Kan</hi> failed not to attempt divers ways; but, the King cauſing him to be nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly obſerved, none of them all would ſucceed. This very much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed <hi>Emir,</hi> and made him take a ſtrange reſolution, which caſt the King in great danger to loſe his Crown and Life; ſo true 'tis; that <hi>he who knows not to Diſſemble, knows not how to Reign.</hi> He writ to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who was then in <hi>Daulet-Abad,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Decan,</hi> about fifteen or ſixteen days Journey from <hi>Golkonda,</hi> giving him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, <hi>that</hi> the King of <hi>Golkonda</hi> did intend to ruin him and his Family,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63063:25"/>
notwithſtanding the ſignal Services he had done him, as all the World knew; which was an un-exampled Injuſtice and Ingratitude; <hi>that</hi> this neceſſitated him to take his refuge to him, and to intreat him, that he would receive him into his protection; <hi>that,</hi> for the reſt, if he would follow his advice, and confide in him, he would ſo diſpoſe Affairs, that he would at once put into his hands both the King and Kingdom of <hi>Golkonda.</hi> This thing he made very eaſie, uſing the following Diſcourſe: You need but take four or five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, of the beſt of your Army, and to March with Expedition to <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konda,</hi> ſpreading a rumour by the way, that 'tis an Ambaſſadour of <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> that goes in haſte, about conſiderable Matters, to ſpeak with the King at <hi>Bag-naguer.</hi> The <hi>Dabir,</hi> who is he that is firſt to be addreſſed unto, to make any thing known unto the King, is allyed to me, and my Creature, and altogether mine; take care of nothing but to March with expedition, and I will ſo order it, that without making
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63063:25"/>
you known, you ſhall come to the Gates of <hi>Bag-naguer;</hi> and when the King ſhall come out to receive the Letters, according to cuſtome, you may eaſily ſeize on him, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of all his Family, and do with him what ſhall ſeem good to you; in regard that his Houſe of <hi>Bag-naguer,</hi> where he commonly reſides, is unwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and unfortified. He added, <hi>that</hi> he would make this Enterpriſe upon his own Charges, offering him fifty thouſand <hi>Roupies</hi> a day (which is about five and twenty thouſand Crowns) during the whole time of the March.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who looked only for ſome ſuch occaſion, had no mind at all to loſe ſo fair an one. He ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Expedition, and did ſo fortunately manage his Enterpriſe, that he arrived at <hi>Bag-naguer,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe known than as an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of <hi>Chah-Jehan.</hi> The King of <hi>Golkonda</hi> being advertiſed of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of this pretended Ambaſſadour, came forth into a Garden, according to cuſtome, received him with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63063:26"/>
and having unfortunately put himſelf into the hands of his Enemy, ten or twelve Slaves, <hi>Gurgis,</hi> were ready to fall upon and to ſeize his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as had been projected; but that a certain <hi>Omrah,</hi> touched with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, could not forbear to cry out, though he was of the party, and a Creature of <hi>Emir, Doth not your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſee that this is</hi> Aureng-Zebe? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; or you are taken.</hi> Whereat the King being affrighted, ſlips away, and gets haſtily on horſeback, riding with all his might to the Fortreſs of <hi>Golkonda,</hi> which is but a ſhort League from thence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſeeing he was defeated in his Deſign, yet was not therefore diſcompoſed; but ſeized at the ſame time on the Royal Houſe, taketh all the rich and good things he finds there; yet ſending to the King all his Wives (which over all the <hi>Indies</hi> is very religiouſly obſerved;) and goeth to Beſiege him in his Fortreſs. But as the Siege, for want of having brought along all Neceſſaries, held on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63063:26"/>
long, and laſted above two months, he received Order from <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> to raiſe it, and to retire into <hi>Decan</hi> again; ſo that, although the Fortreſs was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extremities, for want of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals and Ammunition of War, he found himſelf obliged to abandon his Enterpriſe. He knew very well, that it was <hi>Dara</hi> and <hi>Begum</hi> that had induced <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> to ſend theſe Orders, from the apprehenſion they entertained, that he would become too powerful; but in the mean time he never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd any reſentment of it, ſaying only, that he ought to obey the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Father. Yet he withdrew not, without cauſing underhand pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made to him of all the Charges of his Expedition: Beſides, he Married his Son <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> to the Eldeſt Daughter of that King, with a promiſe, that he would make him his Succeſſor, cauſing him alſo to give him for a Dowry the Fortreſs and the Appurtenances of <hi>Bamguyre.</hi> He alſo made the King conſent, that all the Silver Money, that ſhould be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63063:27"/>
Coined for the future in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhould bear on one ſide the Arms of <hi>Chah-Jehan;</hi> and that <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> ſhould withdraw with his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, all his Goods, Troops, and Artillery.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Great Men were not long together, but they framed great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: On the way they Beſieged and took <hi>Bider,</hi> one of the ſtrongeſt and moſt important Places of <hi>Viſapour;</hi> and thence they went to <hi>Daulet-Abad,</hi> where they contracted ſo intimate a Friendſhip together, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> could not live without ſeeing <hi>Emir</hi> twice a day, nor <hi>Emir</hi> without ſeeing <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi> Their Union began to cauſe a new Face in all the Affairs of thoſe Parts, and laid the firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Royalty of <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Prince having uſed the Art to make himſelf to be called to the Court divers times, went with great and rich preſents to <hi>Agra</hi> to <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> preſenting him his Service, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to make War againſt the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63063:27"/>
King of <hi>Golkonda,</hi> and him of <hi>Viſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Portugals.</hi> At firſt he preſented to him that great Diamond, which is eſteem'd match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; giving him to underſtand, that the precious ſtones of <hi>Golkonda</hi> were quite other things, than thoſe Rocks of <hi>Kandahar;</hi> that <hi>there</hi> it was, where the War ought to be made, to get the poſſeſſion thereof, and to go as far as <hi>Cape Comory. Chah-Jehan,</hi> whether it were that he was dazled by the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of <hi>Emir,</hi> or whether he thought it fit, as ſome believe he did, to have an Army in the Field, ſomewhat to reſtrain <hi>Dara,</hi> whom he found active in making himſelf potent, and who with inſolence had ill treated the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier <hi>Sadullah-Kan</hi> (whom <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> paſſionately loved, and conſidered as the greateſt Stateſman that had been in the <hi>Indies)</hi> cauſing him even to be made away with poyſon, as a Man not of his party, but inclined to <hi>Sultan Sujah;</hi> or rather, becauſe he found him too powerful, and in a condition to be the Umpire of the Crown, if
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63063:28"/>
                     <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> ſhould deceaſe; or laſtly, becauſe being neither <hi>Perſian,</hi> nor of <hi>Perſian</hi> Extraction, but an <hi>Indian,</hi> there were not wanting envious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ſpread abroad, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in divers places numerous Troops of <hi>Patans,</hi> very Gallant Men, and well paid, with a deſign to make himſelf King, or his Son; or at leaſt to expel the <hi>Mogols,</hi> and to reſtore to the Throne the Nation of the <hi>Patans,</hi> of whom he had taken his Wife. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> reſolved to ſend an Army towards <hi>Decan</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Emir-Jemla.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Dara,</hi> who ſaw the conſequence of this Affair, and that the ſending of Troops for thoſe parts, was to give ſtrength to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> oppoſed it exceedingly, and did what he could to hinder it. Nevertheleſs, when he ſaw that <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was reſolute for it, he at laſt thought it beſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but with this condition, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſhould keep in <hi>Daulet-Abad,</hi> as Governour only of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, without medling at all in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63063:28"/>
War, or pretending to Govern the Army; that <hi>Emir</hi> ſhould be the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute General, who for a pledge of his Fidelity was to leave his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at the Court. <hi>Emir</hi> ſtruggled enough within himſelf, whether he ſhould agree to this laſt condition, but when <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> deſired him to give that ſatisfaction to <hi>Dara,</hi> and promiſed him, that after a little while he would ſend him back his Wife and Children, he conſented, and Marched into <hi>Decan</hi> towards <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> with a very Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Army, and without any ſtop en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Viſapour,</hi> where he Beſieged a ſtrong place called <hi>Kaliane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Affairs of <hi>Indoſtan</hi> were in that condition, as I have been relating, when <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> fell dangerouſly ſick. I ſhall not ſpeak here of his ſickneſs, much leſs relate the particulars of it. I ſhall only ſay this, that it was little ſutable to a Man of above ſeventy years of Age, who ſhould rather think on preſerving his ſtrength, than to ruin it, as he did. This ſickneſs did ſoon allarm and trouble all <hi>Indoſtan.</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:63063:29"/>
Mighty Armies were levied in <hi>Dehly</hi> and <hi>Agra,</hi> the Capitals of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> did the like in <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale;</hi> and <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> in <hi>Decan;</hi> and <hi>Mord-Bakche</hi> in <hi>Guzaratte:</hi> All four aſſembled to themſelves their Allies and Friends; all four write, promiſe, and form divers Intrigues. <hi>Dara</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſurpriſed ſome of their Letters, ſhew'd them to <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> and made great noiſe about them; and his Siſter <hi>Begum</hi> failed not to make uſe of this occaſion, to animate the King againſt them. But <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was diffident of <hi>Dara,</hi> and fearing to be poyſoned, gave order, that particular care ſhould be had of what was brought to his Table. 'Twas alſo ſaid, that he wrote to <hi>Aureng-Zebe;</hi> and that <hi>Dara</hi> being advertiſed thereof, could not forbear to menace, and to break into very paſſionate expreſſions. In the mean time the Diſtemper of <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, and 'twas bruited every where, that he was dead. Whereupon the whole Court was diſorder'd, the whole Town allarm'd, the Shops for many
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63063:29"/>
days ſhut up; and the four Sons of the King made openly great Preparations, each for himſelf: And to ſay truth, it was not without reaſon, that they all made ready for War; for they all very well knew, that there was no hopes of quarter, that there was no other way, than to vanquiſh or dye, to be King or undone, and that he that ſhould be Conquerour would rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all the reſt, as formerly <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> had done of his Brothers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> who had heaped up great Treaſures in that rich Kingdom of <hi>Bengale,</hi> ruining ſome of the <hi>Rajas</hi> or petty Kings that are in thoſe parts, and drawing great Sums from others, took the Field firſt of all with a puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Army, and in the confidence he had of all the <hi>Perſian Omrahs,</hi> for the Sect of whom he had declared himſelf, he boldly Marched towards <hi>Agra,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out openly that <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was dead, that <hi>Dara</hi> had poyſon'd him, that he would revenge the death of his Father, and in a word, that he would be King. <hi>Dara</hi> deſired <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:63063:30"/>
to write himſelf to him, and to forbid him to advance further; which he did, aſſuring him, that his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was not at all dangerous, and that he was already much better. But he having Friends at Court, who aſſured him that the ſickneſs of <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was mortal, he diſſembled, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to advance, ſaying ſtill, that he knew very well <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was dead; and if he ſhould be alive, he was deſirous to come and kiſs his feet, and to receive his Commands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> immediately after, if not at the ſame time, taketh the Field alſo in <hi>Decan,</hi> maketh a great noiſe, and prepareth to March towards <hi>Agra.</hi> The ſame prohibition was made to him alſo, as well from <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> as from <hi>Dara,</hi> who threaten'd him. But he diſſembleth, for the ſame reaſon that <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> had done, and giveth the like anſwer. Mean time, finding that his Treaſure was low, and his Souldiery very inconſiderable, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed two artifices, which ſucceeded admirably well; the one, in regard
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63063:30"/>
of <hi>Morad-Bakche;</hi> the other, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Emir-Jemla.</hi> To <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> he writes with ſpeed a very fair Letter, importing, <hi>that</hi> he had always been his true and intimate Friend; <hi>that,</hi> as for himſelf, he laid no claim at all to the Crown; <hi>that</hi> he might remember, he had all his Life time made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a <hi>Fakire,</hi> but that <hi>Dara</hi> was a perſon incapable to Govern a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; <hi>that</hi> he was a <hi>Kafer,</hi> an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, and hated of all the greateſt <hi>Omrahs;</hi> that <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> was a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fezy,</hi> an Heretick, and by conſequence an Enemy to <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> and unworthy of the Crown: So that, in a word, there was none but he <hi>(Morad-Bakche)</hi> that could reaſonably pretend to the Succeſſion; <hi>that</hi> the Crown did expect him; <hi>that</hi> the whole Court, which was not ignorant of his Valour, would be for him; and <hi>that</hi> for his particular, if he would promiſe him, that being King, he would give him leave to live quietly in ſome Corner or other of his Empire, there to ſerve God the remainder of his days, he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63063:31"/>
was ready to make a conjunction with him, to aſſiſt him with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Friends, and to put into his hands his whole Army, to fight <hi>Dara</hi> and <hi>Sultan Sujah;</hi> that in the mean time he ſent him an hundred thouſand Rupies (which make about fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns of our Money) and prayed him to accept thereof as a pledge of his friendſhip; and <hi>that</hi> he would adviſe him to come with all poſſible ſpeed to ſeize on the Caſtle of <hi>Suratte,</hi> where he knew to be the Treaſure of the Land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> who was neither too rich nor too powerful, received with much joy this propoſition of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and the hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Rupies ſent by him; and ſhew'd <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>'s Letter to every body, thereby to oblige the Flower of that Countrey to take up Arms for him, and the ſubſtantial Merchants to lend him the more willingly ſuch Sums of Money as he demanded of them. He began in good earneſt to Act the King, made large promiſes to all, and, in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63063:31"/>
ſhort, did ſo well, that he ſet a good Army on foot; of whom he ſingled out ſome three thouſand, who, under the Conduct of <hi>Chah-Abas,</hi> one of his Eunuchs, but a Valiant Man, ſhould go to Beſiege <hi>Suratte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſent his Eldeſt Son, <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> (him whom he had Married to the Daughter of the King of <hi>Golkonda)</hi> to <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> who was yet employed in the Siege of <hi>Kaliane,</hi> to perſwade him to come to him to <hi>Daulet-Abad,</hi> pretending to have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the greateſt importance to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to him. <hi>Emir,</hi> who ſoon ſuſpected his intentions, excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaying openly that <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was not dead, <hi>that</hi> he had freſh News of his being alive, and <hi>that</hi> beſides, all his Family being at <hi>Agra</hi> in the hands of <hi>Dara,</hi> he could by no means aſſiſt <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> nor declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for him. Whereupon <hi>Sultan Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moud</hi> return'd to <hi>Daulet-Abad,</hi> without effecting any thing, and very much diſſatisfied with <hi>Emir.</hi> But <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> loſt no courage for all that, but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63063:32"/>
ſent the ſecond time to <hi>Emir,</hi> yet not <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> but <hi>Sultan Mazum</hi> his Second Son, who preſented to him his Fathers Letter, and handled him with that dexterity, ſweetneſs, and proteſtation of friendſhip, that it was not poſſible to reſiſt him. <hi>Emir</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſſed the Siege of <hi>Kaliane,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Beſieged to Surrender upon Compoſition, took the choice of his Army, and with all diligence went away with <hi>Sultan Mazum.</hi> At his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> courted him in the higheſt degree, treating him no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than with the Name of <hi>Baba</hi> and <hi>Babagy,</hi> that is, Father, Lord-Father; and after an hundred embraces, he took him ſomewhat aſide, and told him (according to what I could learn from perſons who knew of it) That it was not juſt, that having his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at the Court, he ſhould adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do any thing in his behalf that might come to be known; but that, after all, there was nothing ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult but an expedient might be found. Give me leave therefore, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63063:32"/>
propoſe to you a Deſign, which at firſt will poſſibly ſurpriſe you; but, ſince you apprehend the danger of your Wife and Children that are in Hoſtage, the beſt way of providing for their ſecurity would be, to ſuffer me to ſeize on your perſon, and to put you in priſon. It is out of doubt, that all the World will believe it done in earneſt: For who would imagin, that ſuch a perſon as you would be content to let your ſelf be laid in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? In the interim, I could make uſe of part of your Army, and of your Artillery, as you ſhall judge moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and convenient: You alſo could furniſh me with a Sum of Money, as you have frequently offered it; and beſides, methinks I might tempt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune further, and we might together take our meaſures, to ſee in what manner I had beſt to demean my ſelf; if you would alſo permit, that I might cauſe you to be tranſported into the Fortreſs of <hi>Daulet-Abad,</hi> where you ſhould be Maſter; and that there I might have you kept by my own Son,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63063:33"/>
                     <hi>Sultan Mazum,</hi> or <hi>Sultan Mahmoud;</hi> this would yet better palliate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I ſee not, what <hi>Dara</hi> could juſtly ſay of it, nor how he could reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably treat your Wife and Children ill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Emir,</hi> whether it were by reaſon of the Friendſhip he had ſworn to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> or for the great promiſes made to him, or the apprehenſion he had, of ſeeing near him <hi>Sultan Mazum,</hi> who ſtood by, very penſive and well armed, and <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> who looked grim upon him for his coming away at the ſollicitation of his Brother, not at that of his, and had at his very entrance lift up his Foot as if he would have hit him; whatever of theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might induce him, conſented to all what <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> deſired, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Expedient to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be impriſon'd; ſo that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> being no ſooner gone, but the Great Maſter of the Artillery was ſeen to approach with ſome fierceneſs to <hi>Emir,</hi> and to command him in the Name of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> to follow him, locking him up in a Chamber, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63063:33"/>
there giving him very good words, whilſt all the Souldiery, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had thereabout, went to their Arms. The report of the detention of <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> was no ſooner ſpread, but a great tumult aroſe; and thoſe, whom he had brought along with him, although aſtoniſh'd, yet put themſelves into a poſture of reſcuing him, and with their Swords drawn ran to force the Guards, and the Gate of his Priſon; which was eaſie for them to do: For <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had not with him ſufficient Troops to make good ſo bold an Enterpriſe; the only Name of <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> made all tremble. But the whole matter being altogether counterfeited, all theſe Commotions were preſently calmed <hi>by</hi> the intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were given to the Chief Officers of <hi>Emir</hi>'s Army, and <hi>by</hi> the preſence of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who there appeared very reſolute with his two Sons, and ſpoke now to one, then to another; and at laſt <hi>by</hi> promiſes and preſents, liberally beſtowed on thoſe that were concerned. So that all the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63063:34"/>
Troops of <hi>Emir,</hi> and even moſt of thoſe of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> ſeeing things troubled, and being without their General, and believing <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> to be dead, or, at beſt, deſperately ſick; conſidering alſo the ample promiſes made to them of augmenting their Stipend, and of giving them at that very time three months advance, ſoon liſted themſelves under <hi>Aureng-Zebe;</hi> who having ſeized on all the Equipage of <hi>Emir,</hi> even his very Camels and Tents, took the Field, reſolved to March to the Siege of <hi>Suratte,</hi> and to haſten the taking it in; where <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> was exceedingly embarraſſed, becauſe that his beſt Troops were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed there, and that he found more reſiſtance in that place than he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. But <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> after ſome days March, was informed, that the Governour had ſurrendred the Place; for which he ſent Congratulations to <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> acquainting him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of his Tranſactions with <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> and aſſuring him, <hi>that</hi> he had Forces and Money enough, and very
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63063:34"/>
good Intelligence at the Court; <hi>that</hi> nothing was wanting; <hi>that</hi> he was directly going to <hi>Brampour</hi> and <hi>Agra; that</hi> he had expected him on the way, and therefore deſired him to joyn with him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> found not ſo much Money in the Fortreſs of <hi>Suratte</hi> as he had imagined, whether it were that really there was not ſo much as was reported, or whether the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour had diverted a part of it, as ſome believed: Yet notwithſtanding that little he found there was uſeful to him, to pay the Souldiers that had liſted themſelves in hopes of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, they ſhould make of the imagined vaſt Treaſure of <hi>Suratte.</hi> 'Tis not leſs true, that he had no greater reaſon to boaſt of the taking of this Place, in regard there was not any Regular Fortification about it; and yet his Army had lain before it above a month, and would never have reduced it without the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> who furniſh'd them with the Invention of Springing a Mine,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63063:35"/>
which ruining a great ſide of the Wall, caſt the Beſieged into ſuch a conſternation, that it made them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſurrender. The reduction of this Town did much advance his Deſign, Fame proclaiming imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately throughout theſe Countries, that <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> had taken <hi>Suratte;</hi> that he had ſprung a Mine, which ſounded very big among the <hi>Indians,</hi> who as yet do little underſtand that practice; and that <hi>there</hi> he had found a vaſt Treaſure. Notwithſtanding this great noiſe, and all the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, joyned to all thoſe frequent Letters and great Promiſes of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> the Eunuch <hi>Chah-Abas,</hi> a Man of good Senſe, of a great Heart, and exceedingly affectionate to the Service of his Maſter, was not of opinion, that <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> ſhould ſo much tye himſelf in intereſt to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> or precipitate his conjunction with him, but adviſed, that he ſhould amuſe him with words, and let him advance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone towards <hi>Agra;</hi> that in the mean time there would come certain News
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63063:35"/>
of the ſickneſs of <hi>Chah-Jehan;</hi> that he ſhould firſt ſee, what Channel Affairs would run in; that he ſhould Fortifie <hi>Suratte,</hi> as a very good Poſt, able to render him Maſter of a very large and rich Countrey; and that perhaps in time he might ſeize <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,</hi> which is a very conſiderable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of a River, and as 'twere a Bar of <hi>Decan.</hi> But the continual Letters and Proteſtations of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ſmall Forces, Artillery, and Treaſure of <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with an exceſſive ambition to Reign, made him regardleſs of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderations; ſo that he went away from <hi>Amadevad,</hi> abandon'd <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaratte,</hi> and took his way through the Woods and Mountains, with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, to be at the Rendevouz, where <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had looked for him theſe two or three days.</p>
                  <p>Great Solemnities of Joy were made at the conjunction of the two Armies, the Princes viſited one another, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-Zebe</hi> made a hundred proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and no leſs promiſes to <hi>Morad-Backche,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:63063:36"/>
aſſured him afreſh, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, of his not caring for the Crown, as alſo of his being there for no other end than to aſſiſt him againſt <hi>Dara,</hi> their Common Enemy, and to place him in the Throne, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Enterview, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Friendſhip, both Armies Marched together, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing always, during the March, in the proteſtations of Friendſhip, and in his Courtſhip to <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> treating him never otherwiſe, whether in publick or private, but with the Title of <hi>Hazaret,</hi> that is, King and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: So that <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> was fully perſwaded, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> meant ſincerely, from an exceſs of affection towards him; whence he even wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and without ceremony, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the ſubmiſſions and reſpects he ſhew'd him; inſtead of remembring what had lately paſſed at <hi>Golkonda,</hi> and of conſidering, that he, who had thus hazarded himſelf with ſo much boldneſs to uſurp a Kingdon, was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63063:36"/>
not of a temper to live and dye a <hi>Fakire</hi>-</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Armies thus joyned made a Body conſiderable enough; which begot a great noiſe at Court, and gave cauſe of thoughtfulneſs, not only to <hi>Dara,</hi> but to <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> himſelf, who knew the great parts and ſubtle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and the Courage of <hi>Morad-Bakche;</hi> and who foreſaw very well, that a Fire was a kindling, which would be very hard to quench. It was to no purpoſe to write Letters upon Letters, ſignifying that he was well, and giving Order that they ſhould turn back to their reſpective Governments, and expreſſing alſo, that he would forget all that had paſſed hitherto. All his <hi>Letters</hi> were not able to hinder their advance; and as the ſickneſs of <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> did ſtill paſs for mortal, there being no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wanting to bring and ſpread ſuch News, they ſtill continued to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, giving out, that they were <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> counterfeited by <hi>Dara;</hi> that <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was dead indeed; but that, in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63063:37"/>
caſe he were alive, they would go to kiſs his Feet, and deliver him from the hands of <hi>Dara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then ſhould <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> this unfortunate King, do, who ſeeth, that his Sons have no regard to his Orders; who is informed at all hours, that they march apace towards <hi>Agra</hi> in the head of their Armies, and who in this conjuncture finds himſelf ſick to boot in the hands of <hi>Dara,</hi> that is, of a man who breatheth nothing but War; who prepareth for it with all imaginable earneſtneſs, and with all the marks of an enraged reſentment againſt his Brothers? But what could he do in this extremity? He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to abandon to them his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to leave them to their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. He is forced to ſend for his old and moſt truſty Captains, whom he knows for the moſt part to be not very affectionate to <hi>Dara;</hi> he muſt command them to fight for <hi>Dara,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Blood, his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thoſe, for whom he hath more eſteem than for <hi>Dara;</hi> he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63063:37"/>
forthwith to ſend an Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> becauſe 'tis he that is moſt advanced; and he is to ſend another againſt <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad-Bakche,</hi> who no leſs are marching towards him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Soliman Chekouh,</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Dara,</hi> a young Prince of about Five and twenty years of Age, very proper of Body, and of good Parts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, generous, liberal, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally beloved, eſpecially of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> who had already enriched him, and who conſidered <hi>him</hi> rather for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour than <hi>Dara,</hi> was he, that was made General of this Army againſt <hi>Sujah.</hi> Nevertheleſs <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> who wiſhed much rather, that <hi>Sujah</hi> were return'd to <hi>Bengale,</hi> than that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be tryed by a bloody Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, which could not be but very Tragical, and wherein he run the hazard of loſing one or other of his Sons, gave him for Companion an Ancient <hi>Raja,</hi> called <hi>Jeſſeigne,</hi> who is at preſent one of the powerfulleſt and richeſt <hi>Rajas</hi> of all <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> and one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63063:38"/>
the ableſt in the whole Kingdom, with a ſecret Order not to fight, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were altogether unavoidable; as alſo to endeavour by all means to induce <hi>Sujah</hi> to retire, and to reſerve his Forces for a better occaſion; that is to ſay, after they ſhould have ſeen the event of the ſickneſs of <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> and the ſucceſs of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and of <hi>Morad-Bache.</hi> But this young Prince, <hi>Soliman Chekouh,</hi> full of heat and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, breathing after nothing but to ſignalize himſelf by ſome great action, and <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> fearing leſt <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> gaining a Battel ſhould firſt make himſelf Maſter of the Capital Towns of the Empire, <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Dehly;</hi> it was impoſſible for the <hi>Raja Jeſſeigne</hi> to keep them from a Combat. The two Armies are no ſooner in ſight of one another, but they prepare to fall on, and they were not long from giving ſome Vollies of Cannon. I ſhall not relate the particulars of this Fight, for, beſides that the narration of it would be too long and tedious, in the ſequel of this Hiſtory we ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63063:38"/>
to deſcribe more conſiderable ones, by which the Reader will be able to judge of this. 'Tis ſufficient to know in general, that the firſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet was very ſharp and obſtinate on both ſides, but that at length <hi>Soliman Chekouh</hi> did urge <hi>Sujah</hi> with that force and vigour, that he diſorder'd him, and made him fly: So that if <hi>Jeſſeigne,</hi> and the <hi>Patan Delil-kan,</hi> who was one of the firſt Captains and a valiant Man, but an intimate Friend of the <hi>Raja,</hi> and did not act but being moved by him, had ſeconded him in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, 'tis thought that the whole Army of <hi>Sujah</hi> would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and himſelf in danger of being taken: But that was not the Deſign of the <hi>Raja</hi> to deſtroy him, no more than it was that of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> who had given him order to the contrary. Thus then had <hi>Sujah</hi> time to retreat, and that without loſing any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of his Men; yet becauſe <hi>Soliman Chekouh</hi> kept the field, and brought away ſome pieces of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, it was preſently bruited at Court,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63063:39"/>
                     <hi>Sujah</hi> had been totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. This Defeat purchaſed great reputation to <hi>Soliman Chekouh,</hi> leſſen'd much the eſteem of <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> and cooled exceedingly all the <hi>Perſians</hi> that had an inclination for him.</p>
                  <p>After that ſome days were ſpent in the purſuit of <hi>Sujah,</hi> the Prince <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Chekouh,</hi> who every day received News from the Court, and who lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> did approach with great reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, well knowing, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dara</hi> had no great ſtock of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but good ſtore of ſecret Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, reſolved to quit the purſuit of <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> and with all ſpeed to return to <hi>Agra,</hi> where in all appearance <hi>Dara</hi> was to give Battel againſt <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Morad-Bakche.</hi> This was the beſt counſel he could take, for no man doubts, that if he could have been there in good time, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> would not have had the advantage; and 'tis even believed, he would never have hazarded the Combat, the party being too unequal; but the bad fortune of <hi>Dara</hi> did not permit it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:63063:39"/>
Whilſt all that was thus tranſacted toward <hi>Elabas,</hi> which is the place where the <hi>Gemna</hi> is joyned to <hi>Ganges;</hi> the Scene was very different on the ſide of <hi>Agra.</hi> At the Court they were much ſurpriſed to hear, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had paſſed the River of <hi>Brampour,</hi> and all the other paſſages that were moſt difficult between the Mountains; ſo that with all haſte they ſent away ſome Troops to diſpute with him the paſſage of the River <hi>Eugenes,</hi> whilſt the whole Army was making ready. For which purpoſe, there were choſen two of the moſt conſiderable and the moſt powerful of the Kingdom to command it; the one was <hi>Kaſem-Kan,</hi> a renowned Captain and very affectionate to <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> but one that had no great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to <hi>Dara,</hi> and who went not but to oblige <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> whom he ſaw in the hands of <hi>Dara:</hi> The other was <hi>Jeſſomſeigne,</hi> a potent <hi>Raja,</hi> not inferiour to <hi>Jeſſeigne,</hi> and Son-in-law to that <hi>Raja Rana,</hi> who was at the time of <hi>Ekbar</hi> ſo puiſſant, as if he had been the Emperour of the <hi>Raja's. Dara</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:63063:40"/>
at their farewel expreſſed to them great kindneſs, and preſented them nobly; but <hi>Chah Jehan</hi> took his time, before their departure, to charge them in ſecret, as he had done the <hi>Raja Jeſſeigne,</hi> when he went away in the Expedition againſt <hi>Sultan Suiah</hi> with <hi>Soliman Chekouh.</hi> Neither were they wanting, in their March, to ſend ſeveral times to <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad-Bakche,</hi> to perſwade them to turn back: But this was in vain; their Envoys came not again, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my advanced with that diligence, that they ſaw it much ſooner than they thought upon a riſing ground, not far remote from the River.</p>
                  <p>It being then Summer, and the ſeaſon of the greateſt heats, the River was fordable; which was the cauſe, that at the ſame time <hi>Kaſem-Kan</hi> and the <hi>Raja</hi> prepared themſelves to give Battel; beſides that, they ſoon knew the reſolution of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> that he would force them, ſince that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his Army was not all come up, he gave them ſome Vollies of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63063:40"/>
his deſign being to amuſe them, fearing leſt they themſelves ſhould paſs the River, not only to prevent his paſſage, but alſo to hinder his Army from repoſing, and from taking an advantageous poſt; which was indeed in great diſorder, and ſo tired by their March, and ſo faint by the heat, that if at the very firſt it had been aſſaulted, and kept from paſſing the Water, it would doubtleſs have been routed without much reſiſtance. [I was not by in this firſt Encounter, but thus it was generally diſcourſed of, and it agreeth with the after-relation of many of our <hi>French-men,</hi> who ſerved <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> in the Artillery.] But they were content to ſtay at the River-ſide, to keep <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> from paſſing it, according to the Order they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had let his Army reſt two or three days, and by amuſing the Enemy, had fitted it to paſs the River, he made his whole Artillery play, which was very well placed; and he commanded, that under
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63063:41"/>
the favour of the Cannon they ſhould paſs the River. <hi>Kaſem-Kan</hi> and the <hi>Raja,</hi> on their part, diſcharged theirs alſo, and did what they could to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe the Enemy, and to keep him from paſſing. The Combat was ſharp enough at firſt, and very obſtinately maintained by the extraordinary Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Jeſſomſeigne.</hi> For as to <hi>Kaſem-Kan,</hi> although a great Captain, and a ſtout Man, he gave no great proof of his Valour in this occaſion; yea, ſome accuſe him of Treachery, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him that he had in the night cauſed the Bullets and Powder to be hid under the Sand, there being no more of them to be found after two or three diſcharges. However it be, the Combat for all that was, as I ſaid, very reſolutely carried on, and the paſſage long diſputed. There were Rocks in the Bed of the River, which did much embaraſs, and the Banks in many places were very high and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to climb up. But at laſt, <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> caſt himſelf into the water with ſo much reſolution and force, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63063:41"/>
ſhew'd ſo much valour and boldneſs, that there was no reſiſting of him. He paſſed over, and with him a good part of the Army, which made <hi>Kaſem-Kan</hi> to give back, and caſt <hi>Jeſſomſeigne</hi> into great danger of his perſon. For by and by he found the whole Body of the Enemy upon him, and without the extraordinary reſolution of his <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipous,</hi> who almoſt all were killed about him, he had been a dead man. One may judge of the great danger he was in upon this occaſion, by this, that after he had diſengaged himſelf as well as he could, and was come back to his own, not daring to return to <hi>Agra,</hi> becauſe of the great loſs he had ſuffered, of ſeven or eight thouſand <hi>Ragipous</hi> he had but five or ſix hundred of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Ragipous,</hi> who take their name from the <hi>Rajas,</hi> that is to ſay, the Children of the <hi>Rajas,</hi> are from Father to Son ſuch Men as make the Sword their Profeſſion. The <hi>Rajas,</hi> whoſe Subjects they are, do aſſign them Lands for their ſubſiſtence, on condition to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63063:42"/>
be always ready to go to War when ſummoned. So that one might ſay, that they were a ſort of Pagan Nobles, if the <hi>Rajas</hi> gave them their Lands in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety for them and their Children. They are great takers of <hi>Opium;</hi> and I have ſometimes wondred at the quantity I have ſeen them take: They accuſtom themſelves to it from their youth. On the day of Battel they double the Doſe, this Drug animating, or rather inebriating them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them inſenſible of danger; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they caſt themſelves into the Combat like ſo many furious Beaſts, not knowing what it is to run away, but dying at the feet of their <hi>Raja,</hi> when he ſtands to it. They want nothing but Order, Reſolution they have enough. 'Tis a pleaſure thus to ſee them, with the fume of <hi>Opium</hi> in their head, to embrace one another, when the Battel is to begin, and to give their mutual Farewels, as Men reſolved to dye. And that they do for this reaſon; that the <hi>Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol,</hi> though a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63063:42"/>
an Enemy of the Heathen, yet for all that entertains always a good number of <hi>Rajas</hi> in his ſervice, whom he conſiders as his other <hi>Omrahs,</hi> and imploys in his Armies as if they were <hi>Mahumetans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot forbear to relate here the fierce reception, which the Daughter of the <hi>Rana</hi> gave to her Husband <hi>Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomſeigne,</hi> after his defeat and flight. When ſhe heard that he was nigh, and had underſtood what had paſſed in the Battel; that he had fought with all poſſible courage, that he had but four or five hundred Men left; and that at laſt, not being able to reſiſt any longer the Enemy, he had been obliged to retreat: She, in ſtead of ſending one to receive him, and to conſole him in his misfortunes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in a dry mood to ſhut the Gates of the Caſtle, and not to let this infamous Man enter; that he was not her Husband; that ſhe would never ſee him; that the Son-in-law of the Great <hi>Rana,</hi> could not have ſo low a Soul; that he was to remember,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63063:43"/>
that being grafted into ſo Illuſtrious an Houſe, he was to imitate the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it; and, in a word, that he was either to vanquiſh or to dye. A moment after ſhe was of another humour; ſhe commands a Pile of Wood to be laid, that ſhe might burn her ſelf, that they abus'd her; that her Husband muſt needs be dead; that it could not be otherwiſe. And a little while after this, ſhe was ſeen to change her countenance, to fall into paſſion, and to break out into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand reproaches againſt him. In ſhort, ſhe remained thus tranſported eight or nine days, without being able to reſolve to ſee her Husband, 'till at laſt her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coming in, brought her in ſome degree to her ſelf, and comforted her, aſſuring her, that as ſoon as the <hi>Raja</hi> had but a little refreſh'd himſelf, he would raiſe another Army, to fight <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and repair his Honour at any rate.</p>
                  <p>By which ſtory one may ſee a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the Courage of the Women in that Countrey: To which I could
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63063:43"/>
add ſomething I have ſeen ſome of them do, who burned themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live after the death of their Husbands; but we muſt reſerve this Diſcourſe for another place, where I ſhall alſo ſhew, that there is nothing which opinion, prepoſſeſſion, cuſtom, hope, and the point of honour, &amp;c. may not make Men do or ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dara</hi> having underſtood what had paſſed at <hi>Eugenes,</hi> fell into that choler againſt <hi>Kaſem-Kan,</hi> that it was thought he would have cut off his Head, if he had been upon the place. He was alſo tranſported againſt <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> as the Perſon that was the firſt and principal Cauſe of the Misfortune, and who had furniſh'd <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> with Men, Money, and Cannon. He is ready to kill his Son <hi>Mahmet Emir-Kan,</hi> and will ſend his Wife and Daughter to <hi>Baſar,</hi> or the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of proſtituted Women; and 'tis paſt doubt, that he would have done ſome ſuch thing, if <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> with much art and prudence, had not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated the exceſs of his paſſion, in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63063:44"/>
remonſtrating to him, that <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> had not ſo little conduct, nor ſo great a Friendſhip for <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> as to hazard, and in a manner to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his Family, for the advancing of his Intereſt; that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> muſt needs have gulled and enſnared him, by his uſual artifice and cunning.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Morad-Bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi> the happy ſucceſs of this firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter did ſo ſwell their hearts, and gave ſuch Courage to their whole Army, that henceforth they believed themſelves invincible, and capable to compaſs any thing. Beſides, <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> the more to animate his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, bragged openly, that he had Thirty thouſand <hi>Mogols</hi> at his devotion in the Army of <hi>Dara;</hi> and there was ſomething in it, as appeared by the ſequel. <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> was for nothing but fighting, and would march with all diligence. But <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, that it was neceſſary the Army ſhould refreſh themſelves for ſome time upon the Banks of this ſweet River; that in the mean time
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63063:44"/>
he would write to all his Friends, and get a full and certain information of the ſtate of the Court, and of the condition of all Affairs. So that he marched not towards <hi>Agra,</hi> 'till he had reſted ſome days, and after that he marched but ſlowly, to inform himſelf of all, and to take his time and meaſures.</p>
                  <p>Concerning <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> when he plainly ſaw the reſolution of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> and that there was no hope left to make them turn back, he was in ſuch a perplexity, that he knew not what to reſolve, and foreſeeing ſome great calamity, he would fain have hindred the laſt deciſive Battel, for which he ſaw <hi>Dara</hi> preparing himſelf with great eagerneſs. But what could he do to oppoſe it? He was yet too weak of his ſickneſs, and ſaw himſelf ſtill in the hands of <hi>Dara,</hi> whom, as I have ſaid, he truſted not much: So that he found himſelf obliged to acquieſce in his Will, and to commit to him all the Forces of the Empire, and to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63063:45"/>
command all Captains to obey him. Immediately all was in Arms: I know not, whether there was ever a more gallant Army ſeen in <hi>Indoſtan.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, that there were little leſs than an hundred thouſand Horſe, and twenty thouſand Foot, with four thouſand peeces of Cannon, without reckoning the incredible number of Servants, Followers, Victuallers, whom Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans me thinks do often put into the number of the Combatants, when they ſpeak of thoſe formidable Armies of three or four hundred thouſand Men, of which their Books are full. Though this Army was very brave, and ſtrong enough to cut in pieces two or three of ſuch as <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had, in which there were no more than thirty five or forty thouſand Men in all, and theſe tired and haraſſed by a very long and irkſom March, during the height of the Heats; and but a ſmall number of Cannon, in reſpect of that of <hi>Dara.</hi> Mean time (which ſeems hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) there was ſcarce any Body that preſaged well for <hi>Dara,</hi> all knowing,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63063:45"/>
that moſt of the chief <hi>Omrahs</hi> had no affection for him, and that all the good Souldiers that were for him, and whom he might confide in, were in the Army of <hi>Soliman Chekouh,</hi> his Son. And 'twas for this reaſon, that the moſt prudent and the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Friends, and <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> himſelf, counſelled him, not to hazard a Battel: <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> offering, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm as he was, that he would go into the Field himſelf, and be carried before <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> to interpoſe; which was looked upon as a very good Expedient for Peace, and for accomodating the Affairs of <hi>Chah-Jehan.</hi> For 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> would never have had the boldneſs to fight againſt their own Father; and if they ſhould have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it, they would have ſmarted for it, becauſe, beſides that the match was not equal, and all the great <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> were ſo affectionate to <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> that they would not have failed to fight reſolutely, if they had ſeen him in the head of the Army; beſides this,

                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:63063:47"/>
I ſay, the Captains themſelves of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> bore great affection and reſpect to this Prince, whoſe Creatures they moſt were; and the whole Army, in a manner, was his. So that in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, not one of them would have preſumed to draw his Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, nor he been at the pains of drawing his.</p>
                  <p>Then they adviſed <hi>Dara,</hi> that if he would not hearken to this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, he ſhould at leaſt not precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the buſineſs, but delay, 'till <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Chekouh,</hi> who made all haſte to joyn, were come in. Which was alſo very good counſel, in regard that that Prince was beloved of all, and was lately come home victorious, and had the moſt faithful and the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Souldiers with him. But <hi>Dara</hi> would never hearken to any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that could be made to him, and he thought on nothing elſe but to give Battel preſently, and to go againſt <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> in perſon. And poſſibly he did not amiſs, as to his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63063:47"/>
and particular Intereſt, if he could have commanded Fortune, and made things ſucceed as he contrived them. For the Conſiderations he had (as he could not forbear now and then to diſcover) were ſome ſuch as theſe:</p>
                  <p>He looked upon himſelf as Maſter of the Perſon of <hi>Chah-Jehan;</hi> that he could diſpoſe of him as he pleaſed; that he was alſo Poſſeſſor of all the Treaſures and Forces of the Empire; that <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> was half ruined; that his two other Brothers, with a weak and tired Army, were come to caſt themſelves into his hands; that, if he gained the Battel, they could not eſcape him; that he ſhould all at once be abſolute Maſter, and at the end of all his troubles, and at the height of his wiſhes, ſo as no body could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him in any thing, or diſpute the Crown with him. Whereas if <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> ſhould take the Field, all Affairs would be accommodated, his Brothers would return to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> who began to recover his health, would reſume
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63063:48"/>
the Government as before, and all things would return into their firſt channel: That, if he ſhould ſtay for <hi>Soliman Chekouh,</hi> his Son, <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> might take ſome Deſign to his diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or contrive ſomething with <hi>Aureng-Zebe;</hi> that whatever he could do for gaining the Victory, the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which <hi>Soliman Chekouh</hi> had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, would ſtill give him all the honour of it. And after that, what would not he be capable to undertake, ſwelled with ſo much glory and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and eſpecially being ſupported, as he was, by the favour and affection of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> and of the greateſt part of the <hi>Omrahs?</hi> What did he know, whether he would keep any modeſty, or any reſpect for him, and whether his Ambition might not carry him?</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations made <hi>Dara</hi> reſolve to ſtand out againſt the counſel of all, and to purſue his point. And for that purpoſe, he commanded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the whole Army to take the Field, and thereupon came to take
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63063:48"/>
leave of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> who was in the Fortreſs of <hi>Agra.</hi> This good old Man was ready to melt in tears, when he embraced him; but withall failed not to repreſent to him, with a very grave countenance: Well, <hi>Dara,</hi> ſince thou art reſolved to follow thine own will, go, God bleſs thee, but remember well theſe few words; <hi>If thou loſeſt the Battel, take heed of ever coming into my Preſence.</hi> But this made no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon him; he goeth forth briskly, taketh horſe, and ſeizeth on the Paſſage of the River <hi>Tchembel,</hi> which is about Twenty Miles from <hi>Agra;</hi> where he fortified himſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his Enemy. But the ſubtile and crafty <hi>Fakire,</hi> who wanted no good Spies, and people that gave him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of all, and who knew that the Paſſage was there very difficult, took good heed to attempt the forcing it. He came to encamp himſelf near it, ſo that from the Camp of <hi>Dara</hi> one might diſcover his Tents. But what doth he in the mean time? He inveagles a certain Rebel of <hi>Raja,</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:63063:49"/>
called <hi>Chempet,</hi> preſents him richly, and promiſeth him a thouſand fine things, if he would let him paſs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his Territories, that ſo he might go with ſpeed to gain a certain place, where he knew that the River might be paſſed on foot with eaſe. <hi>Chempet</hi> agreeth, and offers of his own accord, that he would himſelf attend him, and ſhew him the way through the Woods and Hills of his Countrey. <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> raiſed his Camp the ſame night, without any noiſe, leaving ſome of his Tents to amuſe <hi>Dara,</hi> and marching night and day, made ſuch haſte, that he was almoſt as ſoon on the other ſide of the River, as <hi>Dara</hi> could have notice of it. Which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged <hi>Dara</hi> to abandon the River there, and to leave all his Fortifications, and to follow his Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, he was told, did advance with great diligence towards <hi>Agra,</hi> to gain the River of <hi>Gemna,</hi> and there without trouble, and at his eaſe, to enjoy the water, to fortifie, and to fix himſelf well, and ſo to expect <hi>Dara.</hi> The place
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63063:49"/>
where he encamped is but five leagues from <hi>Agra,</hi> it was formerly called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monguer,</hi> and now <hi>Fateabad,</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>Place of Victory.</hi> A little while after, <hi>Dara</hi> alſo came to encamp there, nigh the Bank of the ſame River, between <hi>Agra</hi> and the Army of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The two Armies were there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three and four days in ſight of one another, without fighting. Mean time <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> wrote ſeveral Letters to <hi>Dara,</hi> that <hi>Soliman Chekouh</hi> was not far off; that he ſhould not precipitate; that he ſhould come near <hi>Agra,</hi> and chuſe an advantageous place to fortifie himſelf 'till he came. But <hi>Dara</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that before three days were paſſed, he would bring to him <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> tyed hand and foot, to do with them what he ſhould think fit. And without expecting any longer, he began at that very hour to put his Army in Battel array.</p>
                  <p>He placed in the Front all his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, cauſing them to be tyed the one to the other with Chains, to ſhut
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63063:50"/>
the paſſage to the Cavalry. Behind theſe Peeces of Cannon, he placed alſo front-wiſe a great number of light Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, on the forepart of the Bodies whereof they faſten a ſmall Peece, of the bigneſs of a double Muſquet; a Man ſitting on the hind-part of the Camel, being able to charge and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge without lighting. Behind theſe Camels ſtood the greateſt part of the Muſqueteers. Of the reſt of the Army, which chiefly conſiſted in Cavalry, furniſh'd with Bows and Arrows, (as ordinarily are the <hi>Mogols,</hi> that is, at preſent, white Men, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans, ſtrangers, as <hi>Perſians, Turks, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Usbecks;)</hi> or with a Sword, and a kind of Half-pike, as commonly are the <hi>Ragipous:</hi> Of all theſe, I ſay, there were made three different Bodies. The right Wing was committed to <hi>Calil-ullah-Kan,</hi> with Thirty Thouſand <hi>Mogols</hi> under his Command; for he was made Great <hi>Bakchis,</hi> that is, Great Maſter of the Cavalry, in the place of <hi>Danechmend-Kan,</hi> that was afterwards my <hi>Agah,</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:63063:50"/>
who voluntarily reſigned this Office, ſeeing that he was not well beloved of <hi>Dara,</hi> for having always highly maintained againſt him the Intereſt and Authority of <hi>Chah-Jehan.</hi> The left Wing was given to <hi>Ruſtam-Kan Dakny,</hi> a very renowned and very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Captain, together with the <hi>Raja Chatreſale,</hi> and the <hi>Raja Ramſeigne Routlé.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> put alſo their Army almoſt into the ſame Order; except that in the midſt of the Troops of ſome <hi>Omrahs,</hi> they had hid ſome ſmall Field-Peeces, which was, as was ſaid, after the way and Art of <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> and with no ill effect.</p>
                  <p>They hardly made uſe of any more Art, than what hath been now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; only they placed here and there ſome Men caſting <hi>Bannes,</hi> which is a kind of Granado faſtened to a ſtick, that may be caſt very far through the Cavalry, and which extremely terrifieth Horſes, and even hurts and kills ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:63063:51"/>
All this Cavalry turns about very eaſily, and they draw their Arrows with marvellous ſwiftneſs; one Man being able to draw ſix of them, before a Muſqueteer can twice diſcharge his Muſquet. The ſame Cavalry keeps alſo very cloſe in ſeveral Troops under their reſpective Officers, eſpecially when they are going to fight hand to hand. But after all, I ſee not, that this way of putting an Army in array, is any great matter, in compariſon of our Armies, when in good order.</p>
                  <p>All things being thus diſpoſed, the Artillery began to play on both ſides; for 'tis always the Cannon that makes the prelude amongſt <hi>them;</hi> and the Arrows were now ſeen to fly through the Air, when unexpectedly there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to fall a Storm of Rain, ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that it interrupted the Combat. The Rain ceaſing, the Cannon began afreſh to roar; and then it was that <hi>Dara</hi> appeared, who being mounted upon a proud Elephant of <hi>Ceilau,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that an Onſet ſhould be made on all ſides; and himſelf advanced
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63063:51"/>
into the midſt of the Body of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, directly towards the Enemies Artillery, who received him warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, kill'd ſtore of Men about him, and put into diſorder, not only the Main Body which he commanded, but alſo the other Bodies of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry that followed him. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, becauſe he was ſeen to keep firm upon his Elephant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any appearance of giving back, and was obſerved to look every where about him with an undaunted look, and to make ſigns with his hands to advance and to follow him, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order ſoon ceaſed, every one reſuming his Rank, and advancing in the ſame pace with <hi>Dara.</hi> But he could not reach the Enemy, without receiving another Volley of Cannon-ſhot, which cauſed a ſecond and great diſorder in his Men, and made a good part of them recoyl; yet he, without any change in his countenance, ſtood to it, encouraging his Troops, and gave ſtill ſigns, that they ſhould follow him, and advance with ſpeed without any
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63063:52"/>
loſs of time. Thus preſſing vigorouſly forward, he forced the Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, broke the Chains, entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Camp, and made a Rout in their Camels and Infantry, and in every thing he met with on that ſide; open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo a good paſſage to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry that followed him. Then it was, that the Enemies Cavalry facing him, a ſore Combat began. A ſhowre of Arrows fill'd the Air from both ſides, <hi>Dara</hi> himſelf putting his hand to that work: But, to ſay truth, theſe Arrows do but little execution; more of them are loſt in the Air, or broken on the ground, than hit. The firſt Diſcharges of Arrows being made, they fought hand to hand with their Sables, <hi>peſle meſle,</hi> and the Combat was ſtoutly maintain'd on both ſides. <hi>Dara</hi> is ſtill ſeen to continue firm on his Elephant, encouraging, making a noiſe, and giving ſigns on all ſides; and at laſt advancing with ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and force, againſt all that oppoſed him in his March, that he overthrew the Cavalry, and made them to retire and run away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:63063:52"/>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who was not far from thence, and mounted alſo on an Elephant, ſeeing this great diſorder, was in great trouble, and laboured with all his might to remedy it; but to no purpoſe. He made the Main Body of his beſt Cavalry advance, to try whether he could make head againſt <hi>Dara;</hi> but it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Body alſo was forced to give back, and to retreat in great diſorder, whatever <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> could ſay or do to hinder it. Mean time let us take notice of his courage and reſolution: He ſaw that almoſt the whole Body of his Army was diſordered, and in a flying poſture, in ſo much that he had not a thouſand Men about him that kept their ſtanding; (ſome told me, that there were ſcarce five hundred:) He ſaw, that <hi>Dara,</hi> notwithſtanding the difficulty of the way, which was uneven, and full of holes in divers places, made as if he would ruſh in upon him: Yet, for all this, he loſt no courage, and was ſo far from being ſtruck with fear, or from retreating,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63063:53"/>
that he ſtood firmly to it, and called by name moſt of his Captains that were about him, crying out to them, <hi>Delirane Kodahé,</hi> (theſe are his own words,) that is, <hi>Courage my old Friends, God is:</hi> What hope is there in flying? Know you not, where is our <hi>Decan? Kodahé, Kodahé, God is, God is.</hi> And that none might doubt of his being undaunted, and that he thought on nothing leſs than running away, he commanded before them all (oh ſtrange extremity!) that forthwith Chains ſhould be faſtened to the feet of his Elephant; and was going to faſten them in good earneſt, but that they all declared their courage and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to live and dye with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dara</hi> in the interim endeavoured to advance upon <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> though he was yet at a good diſtance from him, and though the difficulty of the way embaraſſed and retarded him much; he meeting alſo with ſome reſiſtance, even from thoſe diſordered Horſe of the Enemy, that cover'd all high and low places where he was to March.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63063:53"/>
And this Encounter with <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was looked upon as <hi>the</hi> thing, that was to aſſure <hi>Dara</hi> of the Victory, and to decide the Battel. And doubtleſs, he would have overcome all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> with the ſmall number left him, would not have been able to bid head to this victorious Army, if <hi>Dara</hi> had known how to profit of the priſe he had in his hands. But here he failed; of which I ſhall now ſhew the occaſion, and how thereby the Scale was turned to <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>'s advantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dara</hi> perceived that his left Wing was in great diſorder, and he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that <hi>Ruſtam-Kan</hi> and <hi>Chatre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale</hi> were killed; that <hi>Ramſeigne Routlé</hi> had too far advanced, that he had indeed forced the Enemy, and made way through the midſt of them; but that now he was ſurrounded every way, and in very great danger. This it was, which made <hi>Dara</hi> deſiſt from his deſign of making directly towards <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> that he might go to ſuccour his left Wing. There at firſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63063:54"/>
the Battel was alſo very ſharp, but <hi>Dara</hi> at laſt carried it, forcing and routing all, yet ſo, as that there ſtill remained ſomething that reſiſted and ſtopped him. Mean time, <hi>Ramſeigne Routlé</hi> fought with ſo much courage and vigour as was poſſible. He woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> and came ſo near him, that he began to cut the Girdles of his Elephant, to make him fall down; but the valour and good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> gave not time enough for it. In ſhort, never any Man fought and defended himſelf more bravely, than <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> did on this occaſion: All wounded as he was, and preſſed by the <hi>Ragipous</hi> of <hi>Ramſeigne Routlé,</hi> who were round about him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was not daunted, nor gave way in the leaſt, but knew ſo well to take his time, that, although he was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides defending himſelf, to cover with his Shield a Son of his, but of ſeven or eight years of Age, who was ſit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting on his ſide, he made an Arrow ſhot ſo luckily at <hi>Ramſeigne Routlé,</hi> that it made him fall dead to the ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:63063:54"/>
                     <hi>Dara</hi> ſoon heard the ſad News of this Accident; but at the ſame time he underſtood alſo, that <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> was in very great danger; the <hi>Ragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous</hi> fighting furiouſly, and like Lions, to revenge the death of their Maſter. And though he ſaw, on that ſide the way was very difficult, and that he ſtill found ſome ſmall Body oppoſing and retarding him; yet he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ruſh through to <hi>Morad-Bakche:</hi> And doubtleſs this was the beſt he could do, and that, which was capable to repair the fault he had committed in not doing his buſineſs thoroughly with <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi> But his bad fortune kept him from it, or rather, one of the blackeſt Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that ever was imagined, and the greateſt overſight that was ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, did cauſe the entire loſs and ruin of <hi>Dara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calil-ullah-Kan</hi> (he that commanded the Thirty Thouſand <hi>Mogols,</hi> which made the right Wing, and were alone able to defeat the whole Army of <hi>Aureng-Zebe)</hi> did, whilſt <hi>Dara</hi> and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63063:55"/>
his left Wing fought with ſo much courage and ſucceſs, keep off, as idle as if he were not concerned in the fray, not permitting any one of his Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſhoot an Arrow, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that they were for a Reſerve, and that he had expreſs order not to fight but in the laſt extremity. But the true cauſe was, that he reſerved in his breaſt the rancour of an old Affront, done him by <hi>Dara,</hi> when he commanded him to be ſtruck. But after all, this Treachery would have done no great miſchief, if this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Man had contented himſelf with this firſt Effect of his Reſentment: Behold, how far he carried his rage, and revengefulneſs! He cut himſelf off from his Main Body, and taking only a few Men with him, rid with all poſſible ſpeed towards <hi>Dara,</hi> at the ſame time when he was turning to fall on <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> and being come ſo near as to make himſelf be heard, cryed out with all his force; <hi>Mohba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reck-bad, Hazaret, Salamet, Elhamd-ul-ellah;</hi> God ſave your Majeſty, you
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63063:55"/>
have obtained the Victory; what will you do any longer upon your Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant? Is it not enough, that you have expoſed your ſelf ſo long? If the leaſt of thoſe ſhots, that have been made into your <hi>Dais,</hi> had reached your Perſon, what would have become of us Are there Traitors wanting in this Army? In the Name of God come down quickly and take Horſe. What remains more to be done, than to purſue thoſe Run-aways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us do ſo, nor let us ſuffer, that they ſhould eſcape our hands!</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Dara</hi> had had wit enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the cheat, and to conſider upon a ſudden the conſequences of his not appearing any more upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and being no more ſeen by the whole Army, always eying him, or rather, if he had preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to cut off the Head of this Paraſitical Traitor, he had been Maſter of all. But the good Prince ſuffered himſelf to be blinded by theſe ſweet words: He hearkened to this advice, as if it had been very true and very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63063:56"/>
ſincere; he deſcended from his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and took Horſe. But I know not, whether there paſſed one quarter of an hour, but he perceived the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of <hi>Calil-ullah-Kan,</hi> and repented himſelf extremely of the great fault he had committed. He looks about him, he ſeeketh, he asketh where he is; he ſaith, he is a Traitor, he will kill him. But the perfidious Villain is by this time at a good diſtance; the occaſion is loſt. Would it be believed, that as ſoon as the Army perceived <hi>Dara</hi> to be no more upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, they imagined that there was Treaſon, that <hi>Dara</hi> was killed; and all were ſtruck with ſuch a terrour, that every one thought on nothing, but how to eſcape the hands of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and to ſave himſelf. What ſhall I ſay? All the Army disbands and flyeth. A ſudden and ſtrange revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution! He that ſaw himſelf juſt now victorious, finds himſelf in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vanquiſhed, abandoned, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſly himſelf to ſave his life, <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> by holding out firm a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63063:56"/>
quarter of an hour upon his Elephant, ſeeth the Crown of <hi>Indoſtan</hi> upon his Head; and <hi>Dara,</hi> for having come down a little too ſoon, ſeeth himſelf precipitated from the Throne, and the moſt unfortunate Prince of the World. Thus Fortune taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to make the gain or loſs of a Battel, and the deciſion of a great Empire, depend upon a nothing.</p>
                  <p>Theſe great and prodigious Armies, 'tis true, do ſometimes great things; but when once terrour ſeizeth, and diſorder comes among them, what means of ſtopping the Commotion? 'Tis like a great River broke through its Dams; it muſt over-run all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Remedy. Whence it is, that as often as I conſider the condition of ſueh Armies, deſtitute of good order, and marching like flocks of ſheep, I perſwade my ſelf, that, if in theſe parts one might ſee an Army of five and twenty thouſand Men, of thoſe old Troops of <hi>Flandres,</hi> under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Monſieur le Prince,</hi> or of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Turenne,</hi> I doubt not at all,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63063:57"/>
but they would trample under foot all thoſe Armies, how numerous ſoever they were. And this it is, that now maketh me not find it any longer ſtrange or incredible, what we are told of ten thouſand <hi>Greeks;</hi> and of fifty thouſand Men of <hi>Alexander,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſix or ſeven hundred thouſand Men of <hi>Darius;</hi> (if it be true, that there were ſo many, and that the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian did not reckon the Servants, and all thoſe Numbers of Men, which were to follow the Army, to furniſh it with Forage, Cattel, Corn, and all other neceſſaries.) Bear only the firſt brunt, which would be no very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing for us to do; and behold, they are all aſtoniſh'd: Or, do like <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſet vigorouſly upon one place, if that hold not out, (which will be very hard of them to do) you may be ſure the work is done; all the reſt preſently take fright and flight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> encouraged by ſuch a wonderful ſucceſs, is not wanting to turn every ſtone, to employ skill,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63063:57"/>
dexterity, ſubtilty, craft, courage, to profit by all the advantages, which ſo favourable an occaſion puts into his hands. <hi>Calil-ullah-Kan</hi> is preſently with him, offering him his ſervice, and all the Troops he could be Maſter of. He, on his ſide, wants not words of thanks and acknowledgments, nor a thouſand fair promiſes: But he was very cautious to receive him in his own name; he carried him preſently and preſented him to <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> who, as we may eaſily think, received him with open arms; <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> in the mean time congratulating and praiſing <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> for having fought ſo valiantly, and aſcribing to him all the honour of the Victory; treating him with the Title of King and Majeſty before <hi>Calil-uttah-Kan,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him uncommon reſpect, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubmiſſions to him becoming a Subject and Servant. In the interim, he labours night and day for himſelf, he writeth round about to all the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs,</hi> making ſure to day of one, and next day of another. <hi>Chah-heſt-Kan,</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:63063:58"/>
his Uncle, the great and old Enemy of <hi>Dara,</hi> by reaſon of an Affront he had received from him, did the ſame for him on his part; and as he is the Perſon who writeth beſt and ſubtilleſt of the Empire of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little by his Cabals to the advancement of the Affairs of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> making ſtrong Parties every where againſt <hi>Dara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time let us ſtill obſerve the artifice and diſſimulation of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-Zebe:</hi> Nothing of what he doth, treateth, promiſeth, is for himſelf, or in his own Name; he hath ſtill (forſooth) the deſign of living as a <hi>Fakire:</hi> All is for <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> 'tis he that commands; <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; 'tis <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> that doth all, 'tis he that is deſigned to be King.</p>
                  <p>As for the unhappy <hi>Dara,</hi> he comes with all ſpeed to <hi>Agra,</hi> in a deſperate condition, and not daring to go ſee <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> remembring, doubtleſs, thoſe ſevere words which he let fall, when he took leave of him before the Battel, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould remember
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63063:58"/>
not to come before him, if he were overcome. Yet, for all that, the good old Father ſent ſecretly a truſty Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch to him, to comfort him, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him of the continuance of his affection, to declare to him his trouble for his misfortune, and to remonſtrate to him, that the Caſe was not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, conſidering that there was a good Army with <hi>Soliman Chekouh,</hi> his Son, that he ſhould go to <hi>Dehli,</hi> where he ſhould find a thouſand Horſe in the Royal Stables; and <hi>that</hi> the Governour of the Fortreſs had order to furniſh him with Money and Elephants; for the reſt, <hi>that</hi> he ſhould not go further than he needs muſt; <hi>that</hi> he would often write to him: And laſtly, <hi>that</hi> he very well knew how to find out and chaſtiſe <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have been informed, that <hi>Dara</hi> was then in ſuch a confuſion, and ſunk ſo low, that he had not the power to anſwer a word to the Eunuch, nor the courage to ſend any one to <hi>Chah-Jehan;</hi> but that, after having ſent ſeveral times to <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> his Siſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:63063:59"/>
he went away at mid-night, taking with him his Wife, his Daughters, and his Grand-child <hi>Sepe-Chekouh;</hi> and that (which is almoſt incredible) he was attended with not above three or four hundred perſons. Let us leave him in his Voyage to <hi>Dehli,</hi> and ſtay at <hi>Agra,</hi> to conſider the dexterity and craft, wherewith <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to manage Affairs.</p>
                  <p>He well knew, that <hi>Dara,</hi> and thoſe of his Party, could yet place ſome hopes in the victorious Army of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Chekouh,</hi> and therefore he reſolved to take it from him, or to make it uſeleſs to him. To this end, he wrote Letters upon Letters to the <hi>Raja Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne,</hi> and to <hi>Delil-Kan,</hi> who were the chief Heads of the Army of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Chekouh,</hi> telling them, that there was no hope left for <hi>Dara</hi> and his Party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he had loſt the Battel; that his whole Army had ſubmitted to him; that all had abandon'd him; that he was fled alone towards <hi>Dehli;</hi> that he could never eſcape him, and that Orders were diſtributed every
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63063:59"/>
where to ſeize on him. And as for <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> that he was in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hopeleſs of recovery; that they ſhould take good care of what they had to do; and if they were Men of underſtanding, and would follow his fortune, and be his Friends, they ſhould ſeize on <hi>Soliman Chekouh,</hi> and bring him to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſſeigne</hi> found himſelf perplex'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, what he ſhould do, ſtill much apprehending <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> and <hi>Dara,</hi> and more, to lay hands upon a Royal Perſon, well knowing, that ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief might therefore fall on him, ſooner or later, even from <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> himſelf. Beſides, he knew that <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Chekouh</hi> had too much courage to let himſelf be taken after that manner, and that he would rather dye in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelf. Behold therefore, what he at laſt reſolved! After having taken counſel with <hi>Delil-Kan,</hi> his great Friend, and after they had renew'd to one another the Oath of mutual Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, he went directly to the Tent of <hi>Soliman Chekouh,</hi> who with great
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63063:60"/>
impatience expected him, (for he alſo had heard the News of the Defeat of <hi>Dara</hi> his Father) and had already di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times ſent for him. To him he frankly diſcover'd all things, ſhew'd him the Letter of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> told him what courſe was beſt for him to take, repreſented to him the danger he was in; that there was no reaſon he ſhould truſt in <hi>Delil-Kan,</hi> or in <hi>Daoud-Kan,</hi> or in the reſt of his Army; but that, as ſoon as he could, he ſhould gain the Mountains of <hi>Serenaguer;</hi> that that was the beſt Expedient he could take; that the <hi>Raja</hi> of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey being in unacceſſible places, and not apprehending <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> would doubtleſs receive him gladly; and, for the reſt, he would ſoon ſee how things would go, and be always in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come down from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, when he ſhould think good.</p>
                  <p>The young Prince underſtood well enough by this kind of diſcourſe, that there was no ground to truſt hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth in this <hi>Raja,</hi> and that there was no more ſafety for his Perſon; and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63063:60"/>
that the rather, becauſe he knew that <hi>Delil-Kan</hi> was altogether devoted to him, and he ſaw well enough, that there was a neceſſity to take this courſe ſuggeſted. Whereupon he ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that his Baggage ſhould be put up to march towards the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Some of his moſt affectionate Friends, as a good number of <hi>Manſeb-Dars,</hi> of <hi>Sajeds,</hi> and others, put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in order to attend him; the reſt of the Army, altogether aſtoniſh'd, remain'd with the <hi>Raja.</hi> But that, which was very mean for a great <hi>Raja,</hi> and a very ſordid barbarouſneſs, was, that he and <hi>Delil-Kan</hi> ſent under hand ſome to fall upon his Baggage, who alſo took other things, and among them an Elephant laden with Rupies of Gold, which cauſed a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order among thoſe ſmall Troops that follow'd him; and which was an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that many of them return'd and abandon'd him; and invited alſo the Countrey-people to ſet upon his Men, pillaging them, and even kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſome of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet he made a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63063:61"/>
ſhift to gain the Mountains, with his Wife and Children, where the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Serenaguer</hi> received him with all the honour and civilities he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, aſſuring him, that he was in ſafety, as much as if he were King of that Countrey, and that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and aſſiſt him with all his Forces. In the mean time, behold what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on <hi>Agra</hi>'s ſide.</p>
                  <p>Three or four days after the Battel of <hi>Samonguer,</hi> the Victorious <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> together with <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> came directly to the Gate of the Town into a Garden, which may be a little League diſtant from the Fortreſs, and ſent from thence an able Eunuch, and one of thoſe whom he moſt confided in, to <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> to ſalute him with a thouſand fair proteſtations of his affection and ſubmiſſion; that he was exceedingly ſorry for what had paſſed, and for having been obliged, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ambition and evil deſigns of <hi>Dara,</hi> to proceed to all thoſe extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that, for the reſt, he rejoyced extremely to hear, that he began to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63063:61"/>
find himſelf better, and that he was come thither for no other end than to receive his Commands. <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was not wanting to expreſs to the Eunuch much ſatisfaction, as to the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and to receive the ſubmiſſions of this Son with all poſſible appearances of joy; though he ſaw very well, that matters had been carried too far, and ſufficiently knew the reſerved and crafty humour of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and his ſecret paſſion for Reigning; and that therefore he was not much to be truſted, for all his fair words. And yet notwithſtanding he ſuffers himſelf to be circumvented, and in ſtead of playing the ſureſt Chart, <hi>by</hi> uſing his utmoſt power, <hi>by</hi> ſtirring, <hi>by</hi> appearing, <hi>by</hi> cauſing himſelf to be carried through the Town, and <hi>by</hi> aſſembling all his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs,</hi> (for it was yet time to do all this) he goes about to out-wit <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> him that was his Crafts-Maſter, and attempts to draw him into a ſnare, wherein he will be found taken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He then ſends alſo an Eunuch
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63063:62"/>
to this Son, to let him know, that he well underſtood the ill conduct, and even the incapacity of <hi>Dara;</hi> that he could not but call to mind the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inclination he always had and expreſſed towards him, that he could not doubt of his affection; and laſtly, that he ſhould come to ſee him, and to adviſe with him what was fit to be done in theſe diſorders; and that he paſſionately wiſhed to embrace him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> on his ſide, ſaw alſo well enough, that he was not to truſt too much to the words of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> knowing eſpecially, that <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> his Enemy as well as Siſter, was night and day about him, and that 'twas very probable, he acted nothing but by her motion. And he apprehended, that if he ſhould come into the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, he might be ſeized on, and ill treated; as it was ſaid, that the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was indeed taken to do ſo, and ſeveral of thoſe luſty <hi>Tartarian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which ſerve in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> were armed to ſet upon him as ſoon as he ſhould enter. Whatever it be, he
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63063:62"/>
would never hazard himſelf, and yet ſpread a rumour abroad, that the next day he would go to ſee his Father <hi>Chah-Jehan.</hi> But when the day was come, he put it off 'till another, and ſo he delayed it from day to day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever making the Viſit. In the mean time he continued his ſecret Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations and Cabals, and ſounded the mind of all the greateſt <hi>Omrahs,</hi> ſo far, that at laſt, after he had well and cloſely laid his Deſign, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly diſpoſed all things for the ſucceſs thereof, all were amazed to ſee, that one day, when he had ſent <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> his eldeſt Son, to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, under a pretence of ſeeing <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> in his name; this young Prince, bold and undertaking, falls preſently upon the Guards that were at the Gate, and vigorouſly driveth all before him, whilſt a great number of Men appointed, who were there all ready, did enter with fury, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Walls.</p>
                  <p>If ever a Man was aſtoniſh'd, <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was, ſeeing that he was fallen
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63063:63"/>
the ſnare which he had prepared for others, that himſelf was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd and <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> Maſter of the Fortreſs. 'Tis ſaid, that he preſently ſent to ſound the mind of <hi>Sultan Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moud,</hi> promiſing him upon his Crown and upon the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that if he would be faithful to him, and ſerve him in this conjuncture, he would make him King; that he ſhould come preſently to ſee him within, and not loſe this occaſion: Beſides, that it would be an action that would accumulate on him the bleſſings of Heaven, and an immortal Glory; in regard it would be ſaid forever, that <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> had deliver'd <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father out of Priſon.</p>
                  <p>And certainly, if <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> had been reſolute enough to give this ſtroke, and <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> could have come abroad to ſhew himſelf to the Town, and to take the Field, no man doubts, but all his great <hi>Omrahs</hi> would have followed him; nor would <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> himſelf have had the boldneſs nor the ſavageneſs to ſight againſt his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63063:63"/>
own Father in perſon, eſpecially ſince he muſt have apprehended, that all the world would have abandon'd him, and poſſibly <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> himſelf. And 'tis indeed the great fault which <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> is obſerved to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after the Battel, and the flight of <hi>Dara,</hi> not to have come out of the Fortreſs. But yet I have converſed with many, who maintained, that <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> did prudently in it. For this hath been a queſtion much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated among the Politicians, and there are no Reaſons wanting to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the Sentiment of the latter ſort; who alſo add, that Men almoſt always judge of things by the Event; that often very fooliſh Enterpriſes have been obſerved to ſucceed, and which therefore are approv'd by all; that if <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> had proſper'd in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he would have been eſteem'd the moſt prudent and the moſt able Man in the World; but now being taken, he was nothing but a good old Man, that ſuffer'd himſelf to be led by a Woman, his Daughter <hi>Begum,</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:63063:64"/>
which was blinded by her paſſion, and had the vanity to believe, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> would come to ſee her that the Bird of it ſelf would fly into the Cage, or at leaſt, that he would never be ſo bold as to attempt the ſeizure of the Fortreſs, nor have the power to do ſo. Theſe ſame Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners maintaining alſo ftifly, that the greateſt fault that <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> could poſſibly commit, was, that he knew not how to take the occaſion to aſſure himſelf of the Crown, by the rareſt and the moſt generous Action that ever was, to put his Grandfather at liberty, and thus to do himſelf Right and Juſtice, as the Soveraign Umpire of Affairs; whereas, as things now ſtand, he muſt one day go and dye in <hi>Goualeor.</hi> But <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was that he fear'd his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father would not keep his word with him, or that he ſhould be himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd within, or that he durſt not play tricks with his Father <hi>Aureng-Zebe)</hi> would never hearken to any thing, nor enter into the Apartment
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63063:64"/>
of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> anſwering very cloſely, that he had no order from his Father to go and ſee him, but that he was by him commanded not to return, without bringing him the Keys of all the Gates of the Fortreſs, that ſo he might come with all ſafety to kiſs the Feet of his Majeſty. There paſſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two whole days before he could reſolve to ſurrender the Keys; during which time, <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> ſtaid there, unalterable in his reſolutions, keeping himſelf upon his Guard night and day, with all his Troops about him; 'till at length <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> ſeeing that all his People that were upon the Guard at the little Gate, little by little disbanded, and that there was no more ſafety on his ſide, gave him the Keys, with an order to tell <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> that he ſhould come preſently if he were wiſe, and that he had moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things to diſcourſe with him about. But <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was too cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to commit ſo groſs a fault: On the contrary, he made his Eunuch <hi>Etbarkan</hi> Governour of the Fortreſs,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63063:65"/>
who preſently ſhut up <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> together with <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> and all his Women; cauſing divers Gates to be walled up, that ſo he might not be able to write or ſpeak to any body, nor go forth out of his Apartment without permiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> in the mean time writ to him a little Note, which he ſhew'd to every body before he ſealed it; in which, among other things, he told him with dry expreſſions, that he knew from good hands, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe great proteſtations of eſteem and affection he made to him, and of contempt he made of <hi>Dara,</hi> he had, for all that, ſent to <hi>Dara</hi> two Elephants charged with Rupies of Gold, to raiſe him again, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commence the War; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in truth, it was not he that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned him, but <hi>Dara,</hi> and that he might thank him for it, as the cauſe of all theſe misfortunes; and if it had not been for him, he would have come the very firſt day to him, and paid him all the moſt dutiful reſpects he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63063:65"/>
could have looked for from a good Son: That, for the reſt, he begged his pardon, and a little patience; as ſoon as he ſhould have diſenabled <hi>Dara</hi> from executing his evil Deſigns, he would come himſelf and open the Gates to him.</p>
                  <p>I have heard it ſaid concerning this Note, that <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> in very deed, the ſame night that <hi>Dara</hi> departed, had ſent to him theſe Elephants laden with Rupies of Gold, and that it was <hi>Rauchenara-Begum</hi> that found a way to diſcover it to <hi>Aureng-Zebe;</hi> as ſhe alſo had detected to him that Plot which was laid againſt him with thoſe <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Women; and that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> himſelf had intercepted ſome Letters of <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> to <hi>Dara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have converſed with others, that maintain there is no ſuch thing, and that this Writing, which <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſhew'd to all, was only to caſt Sand into the Eyes of the People, and to labour, in ſome degree, to juſtifie himſelf in ſo ſtrange an action, and to devolve the Cauſe of it upon <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:63063:66"/>
and <hi>Dara,</hi> as if he had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuch proceedings. They are things, which are difficult enough well to diſcover. However it be, as ſoon as <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was ſhut up, almoſt all the <hi>Omrahs</hi> were in a manner neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to go and make their Court to <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Morad-Bakche;</hi> and (which is almoſt incredible) there was not one that had the courage to ſtir, or to attempt the leaſt in the behalf of his King, and for him that had made them what they were, and raiſed them from the duſt, and perhaps from ſlavery it ſelf (which is ordinary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in that Court) to advance them to Riches and Honour. Yet ſome few there are, as <hi>Danechmend-Kan,</hi> and ſome others, that took no ſide; but all the reſt declared for <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis notwithſtanding to be noted what I ſaid, that they were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to do what they did. For 'tis not in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as in <hi>France,</hi> or other States of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> where the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees and Nobles have large Poſſeſſions
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63063:66"/>
of Land, and great Revenues, which enables them for a while to ſubſiſt of themſelves. <hi>There</hi> they have nothing but Penſions (as I have already touch'd above) which the King can take away from them at all hours, and thus ruin them in an inſtant; ſo that they ſhall be conſidered no more than if they never had been, nor have any credit to borrow a farthing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> therefore having thus aſſured himſelf of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> and of all the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> took what Sums of Money he thought fit out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; and then having left <hi>Chah-heſt-Kan,</hi> his Uncle, Governour of the Town, he went away with <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> to purſue <hi>Dara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The day that the Army was to march out of <hi>Agra,</hi> the particular Friends of <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> eſpecially his Eunuch <hi>Chah-Abas,</hi> who knew, that the exceſs of civility and reſpect is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily a ſign of impoſture, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled him, that ſince he was King, and every body treated him with the Title of Majeſty, and <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:63063:67"/>
himſelf acknowledged him for ſuch, he ſhould let him go to purſue <hi>Dara,</hi> and ſtay himſelf with his Troops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Dehli.</hi> If he had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this counſel, 'tis certain, that he would have embaraſſed <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> not a little; but 'twas fatal, that he ſhould neglect ſo good advice: <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> is too fortunate; <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> entirely confideth in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and in the Oaths of Fidelity they had ſworn to one another upon the Alcoran. They went away toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and went with the ſame pace towards <hi>Dehli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they were come to <hi>Maturas,</hi> three or four ſmall days Journeys from <hi>Agra,</hi> the Friends of <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> who perceived ſomething, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd again to perſwade him, that he ſhould beware; aſſuring him, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had evil deſigns, and that beyond all doubt ſome miſchief was upon the Anvil; that they had notice of it from all parts, and that by no means, for that day at leaſt, he ſhould go to ſee him; that it would be much
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63063:67"/>
better to prevent the ſtroke the ſooneſt it might be; that he was only to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear going to viſit him that day, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing himſelf with ſome indiſpoſition. But whatſoever could be ſaid to him, he believed nothing of it, his Ears were ſtopp'd to all the good advice that was given him, and as if he had been enchanted by the Friendſhip of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> he could not hold to go to him that very night, and to ſtay at Supper with him. As ſoon as he was come, <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who expected him, and had already prepared all things with <hi>Mirkan,</hi> and three or four of his moſt intimate Captains, was not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in embracements, and in redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his Courtſhip, civilities and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, in ſo much as gently to paſs his handkerchief over his face, and to wipe off his ſweat and duſt, treating him ſtill with the Title of King and Majeſty. In the mean time, the Table is ſerved, they ſup, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation grows warm, they diſcourſe of various things as they uſe to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at laſt there is brought a huge
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63063:68"/>
Bottle of excellent <hi>Chiras</hi> Wine, and ſome other Bottles of <hi>Caboul</hi> Wine, for a Debauch. Then <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> as a grave ſerious Man, and one that would appear a great Mahumetan, and very regular, nimbly riſeth from Table, and having with much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs invited <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> who loved a Glaſs of Wine very well, and who reliſh'd the Wine that was ſerved, ſcrupled not to drink of it to exceſs. In a word, he made himſelf drunk, and fell aſleep. This was the thing that was wiſhed; for preſently ſome Servants of his that were there, were commanded away, under a pretence, to let him ſleep without making any noiſe; and then his Zable and Ponyard were taken from about him: But <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was not long, but came himſelf and waken'd him. He entred into the Chamber, and roughly hit him with his foot, and when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to open a little his Eyes, he made to him this ſhort and ſurpriſing Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: What means this, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> What ſhame and what ignominy is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63063:68"/>
this, that ſuch a King as you are, ſhould have ſo little temper, as thus to make himſelf drunk? What will be ſaid both of you and me? Take this infamous Man, this Drunkard, tye him hand and foot, and throw him into that room to ſleep out his Wine. No ſooner ſaid, but it was executed; notwithſtanding all his appeal and out-cry, five or ſix perſons fall upon him, and fetter his hands and feet. The things could not be done, but ſome of his Men that were thereabout had news of it. They made ſome noiſe, and would enter forcibly; but <hi>Allah-Couly,</hi> one of his chief Officers, and the Maſter of his Artillery, that had been gained long before, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened them, and made them draw back. Without any delay, Men were ſent through the whole Army to calm this firſt Commotion, which alſo might have proved dangerous; they made them believe it was nothing, they having been preſent, that <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> was only drunk, that in that condition he had railed at every body,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63063:69"/>
and <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> himſelf, in ſo much that there had been a neceſſity, ſeeing him drunk and furious, to keep him apart; that the next day they would ſee him abroad, after he had digeſted his Wine. In the mean time, the Preſents walked about all night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the chief Officers of the Army, their Pay was forthwith increaſed, they had great Promiſes made them; and as there was none, that had not long ſince apprehended ſome ſuch thing, there was no great wonder to ſee almoſt all things quieted the next morning; ſo that the very next night this poor Prince was ſhut up in a little cloſe houſe, ſuch an one as is wont to be placed on Elephants to carry Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and he was carried directly to <hi>Dehli</hi> into <hi>Slimager,</hi> which is a little old Fortreſs in the midſt of the River.</p>
                  <p>After that all was thus appeaſed, except the Eunuch <hi>Chah-Abas,</hi> who cauſed difficulty enough, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> received the whole Army of <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> into his Service, and went after <hi>Dara,</hi> who marched apace towards
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63063:69"/>
                     <hi>Lahor,</hi> with an intention well to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie himſelf in that place, and thither to draw his Friends. But <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> followed him with ſo much ſpeed, that he had not time to do any great matter, finding himſelf neceſſitated to retreat, and to take the way of <hi>Multan,</hi> where alſo he could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſiderable, becauſe that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-Zebe,</hi> notwithſtanding the great heat, marched night and day; in ſo much, that to encourage all to make haſte, he ſometimes advanced almoſt all alone two or three leagues before the whole Army, finding himſelf of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obliged to drink ill water like others, to be content with a cruſt of dry bread, and to ſleep under a Tree, ſtaying for his Army in the midſt of the high-way, laying his Head on his Shield like a common Souldier. So that <hi>Dara</hi> found himſelf conſtrained to abandon <hi>Multan</hi> alſo, that he might avoid being near <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> whom he was not able to encounter.

ſaid, that if <hi>Dara,</hi> when he went out of <hi>Lahor,</hi> had caſt himſelf into the Kingdom of <hi>Caboul,</hi> as he was adviſed, he would there have found above ten thouſand warlike Men, deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Augans,</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the <hi>Usbecs,</hi> and for a Guard to that Country, the Governour whereof was <hi>Mohabet-Kan,</hi> one of the moſt potent and the moſt ancient of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> and that had never been <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>'s Friend; that, beſides, he would have been there at the Gate of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Usbec;</hi> that it was likely, that there being no want of Money, all that <hi>Militia,</hi> and <hi>Mohabet-Kan</hi> himſelf, would have embraced his Party, and that further he might have drawn aſſiſtance, not only from <hi>Usbec,</hi> but alſo from <hi>Perſia,</hi> as well as from <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayon,</hi> whom the <hi>Perſians</hi> had reſtored to his Country againſt <hi>Zaher-Kan,</hi> King of the <hi>Patans,</hi> who had driven him thence.

                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſeeing him take this way, found it not fit to follow him further off, being extremely glad that he had not taken the way to <hi>Caboul.</hi> He contented himſelf to ſend after him ſeven or eight thouſand Men, under the Conduct of <hi>Mir-baba,</hi> his Foſter-brother, and turned back with the ſame expedition to the place whence he was come, much appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending left any thing ſhould fall out about <hi>Agra;</hi> leſt ſome or other of thoſe potent <hi>Raja's,</hi> as <hi>Jeſſeigne,</hi> or <hi>Jeſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne,</hi> ſhould make an attempt in his abſence, to free <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> out of Priſon; or leſt <hi>Soliman Chekouh,</hi> together with the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Serenaguer,</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the Hills; or leſt alſo <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> ſhould approach too near <hi>Agra.</hi> Behold a little accident, which one day befel him, for too great precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>When he thus returned from <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> towards <hi>Lahor,</hi> and marched his ordinary ſwift pace, he ſaw the <hi>Raja</hi>

                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:63063:72"/>
made Governour of that place a very underſtanding, gallant, and generous Eunuch, with a very good Garriſon of <hi>Patans</hi> and <hi>Sayeds;</hi> and for Canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, a good number of <hi>Franguis, Portugals, Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who had follow'd him out of great hopes he had given them, (for, if his Affairs had proſpered, and he were become King, we muſt all have reſolved to be <hi>Omrahs,</hi> as many <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis</hi> as we were.) He there left alſo the greateſt part of his Treaſure; he wanted as yet no Gold nor Silver; and ſtaying there but a very few days, he marched away with two or three thouſand Men only, deſcending along the River <hi>Indus</hi> towards <hi>Scindy,</hi> and from thence croſſing with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible celerity all thoſe Territories of the <hi>Raja Katche,</hi> he arrived in <hi>Guza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratte,</hi> and came to the Gates of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devat.</hi> The Father-in-law of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> called <hi>Chah-Navaze-Kan,</hi> was Governour there, with a very good Garriſon, able to reſiſt. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, whether it was that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63063:72"/>
he was ſurpriſed, or that he wanted courage, (for although he was of thoſe ancient Princes of <hi>Machate,</hi> yet he was no great Souldier, though a Man of a very obliging and civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation) he did not oppoſe <hi>Dara,</hi> but rather received him very honourably, and even managed him afterwards with ſo much dexterity, that <hi>Dara</hi> was ſo ſimple as to truſt himſelf with him, and to communicate to him his Deſigns; in ſo much as that he ſhew'd him the Letters which he received from the <hi>Raja Jeſſomſeigne,</hi> and of many other of his Friends, which prepared themſelves to come to him; although it proved too true, what every body told him, and his Friends confirmed by Letters, that certainly this <hi>Chah-Navaze-Kan</hi> would betray him.</p>
                  <p>Never was any Man more ſurpriſed than <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> when he heard that <hi>Dara</hi> was in <hi>Amadevat:</hi> For he well knew, that he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>wanted no Money, and that all his Friends, and all the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Party, which was numerous, would not fail to betake themſelves by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63063:73"/>
little and little to him: And on the other ſide, he found it not ſafe to go and find him out himſelf in that place, by removing himſelf ſo far from <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> to go and embaraſs himſelf in all thoſe Countries of the <hi>Raja's, Jeſſeigne, Jeſſomſeigne,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that are in thoſe Provinces. Beſides he apprehended, leſt <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> ſhould advance with a ſtrong Army, which was already about <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> and leſt the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Serenaguer</hi> ſhould deſcend from the Hills with <hi>Soliman Chekouh:</hi> So that he was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently perplexed and troubled, not knowing which way to turn. At laſt he believed it beſt, to leave <hi>Dara</hi> for a time quiet where he was, and to go thither where his preſence and Army was moſt neceſſary, which was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> who had already paſſed the River <hi>Ganges</hi> at <hi>Elabas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> was come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp in a little Village called <hi>Kadjoue,</hi> and had conveniently ſeized himſelf of a great <hi>Talab,</hi> or Reſervatory of Water, which is there in the way;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63063:73"/>
and <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> came to place him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the ſide of a ſmall Torrent, at the diſtance of a mile and an half from thence, on <hi>Agra's</hi> ſide. Between both was a very fair Campagne, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a Battel. <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was no ſooner arrived, but being impatient to end this War, at break of day he went to face <hi>Sujah,</hi> leaving his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage on the other ſide of the Torrent. He fell upon <hi>Sujah</hi> with an effort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable. <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> Priſoner of of <hi>Decan,</hi> and who arrived juſt on the day of the Combat, fearing <hi>Dara</hi> no more, becauſe his Family was more in ſafety, did there alſo lay out all his force, courage, and dexterity. But ſeeing that <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> had well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified himſelf, and was accompanied with a very good Artillery, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly placed, it was not poſſible for <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> to force him, nor to make him retreat from thence, ſo as to make him loſe thoſe Waters. On the contrary, he was obliged himſelf to draw back ſeveral times, ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly was he repulſed, in ſo much
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63063:74"/>
that he found himſelf in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to advance too far into the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, nor to remove from that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious place where he was, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending only to defend himſelf; which was very prudently done. For he foreſaw, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> could not ſtay there long, and that in that hot ſeaſon he would be abſolutely obliged to turn back towards the Torrent for the Water; and that, when he ſhould do ſo, he would fall upon his Rear. <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> alſo foreſaw well enough the ſame thing, and that was the reaſon why he was ſo forward and preſſing; but behold another more troubleſome accident.</p>
                  <p>In this very time he receiveth intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that the <hi>Raja Jeſſomſeigne,</hi> who in <hi>appearance</hi> had accommodated himſelf with him, was fallen upon his Rear, and plunder'd his Baggage and Treaſure. This News aſtoniſhed him much, and the more, becauſe he perceived that his Army which had heard of it was thereby frighted, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63063:74"/>
fallen into diſorder. Yet he loſes not his judgment for all this; and being well aware, that to turn back was to hazard all, he reſolved, as in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Dara,</hi> to bear up the beſt he could, and to expect with a ſteady foot all Events. In the mean time, the diſorder grew worſe and worſe in his Army: <hi>Sujah,</hi> who was reſolved to profit of the occaſion, taketh his time, and preſſeth him vigorouſly. He that led <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>'s Elephant is killed with the ſhot of an Arrow; he leads the Beaſt as well as he can him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 'till another could be had in that Leaders place. Arrows rain upon him; he returns many himſelf, his Elephant begins to be frighted, and to go back. Behold him now in great extremity, and brought to that point, that one foot of his was out of the ſeat, as if he meant to caſt himſelf to the ground; and no Man knows what in that trouble he had not done, if <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> being nigh, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, like a Great Man as he was, beyond imagination, called to him,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63063:75"/>
in holding up his hand, <hi>Decan-kou, Decan-kou,</hi> where is <hi>Decan?</hi> This ſeems to have been the greateſt extremity, to which <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> could be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. One would have ſaid, 'twas now and here that Fortune had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd him, and there is almoſt no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a poſſibility to eſcape. But his good Fortune is ſtronger than all that: <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> muſt be routed, and take flight, like <hi>Dara,</hi> to ſave his life: <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> muſt remain victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, carry away the Bell, and be King of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are to remember the Battel of <hi>Samonguer,</hi> and that, in appearance, ſlight accident which ruined <hi>Dara:</hi> 'Tis the ſame over-ſight, or rather the ſame Treaſon, which is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying <hi>Sultan Sujah.</hi> One of his chief Captains, <hi>Allah-verdi-Kan,</hi> who (as ſome ſay) had been gained, uſeth the ſame Artifice that <hi>Calil-ullah-Kan</hi> had employ'd towards <hi>Dara;</hi> though there were ſome who believed, that there was no malice in the caſe, and that it was a meer piece of flattery.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63063:75"/>
For ſeeing that the whole Army of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was in diſorder, he ran towards <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> telling him the ſame thing, that <hi>Calil-ullah-Kan</hi> did to <hi>Dara,</hi> and begging of him with folded hands, that he would ſtay no longer in ſo great danger upon his Elephant. Come down, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> in the Name of God, mount on Horſe-back, God hath made you Soveraign of the <hi>Indies,</hi> let us purſue thoſe Fugitives, let not <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> eſcape us.</p>
                  <p>But not to ſtay long from declaring the ſtrange Fortune of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and the incredible conjuncture that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his deſperate condition; <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> not more conſiderate than <hi>Dara,</hi> commits the ſame Fault; and he was no ſooner come down from his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, but his Army ſeeing him no more, was ſtruck with a terrour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving there was Treaſon, and that he was either taken or ſlain. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they disbanded without any more ado, as <hi>Dara</hi>'s Army did in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Samonguer;</hi> and the Defeat was ſo great, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63063:76"/>
fortunate in that he could ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſſomſeigne</hi> hearing this unexpected news, and perceiving it was not very ſafe for him to tarry there, contented himſelf with the Spoil he had got, and with all diligence marched ſtreight to <hi>Agra,</hi> thence to paſs to his Countrey. The noiſe was already in <hi>Agra,</hi> that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had loſt the Battel, that he was taken, together with <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> and that <hi>Sultan Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> brought them both Priſoners. In ſo much, that <hi>Chah-heſt-Kan,</hi> who was Governour of the Town, and Uncle to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Jeſſomſeigne,</hi> whoſe Treachery he had heard of, at the Gates, and deſpairing of his Life, had taken into his hand a Cup of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make himſelf away, and had, as they ſay, in very deed ſwallowed it, if his Women had not fallen upon him and hindred him: So that 'tis thought, if <hi>Jeſſomſeigne</hi> had had the wit and courage to ſtay longer in <hi>Agra,</hi> if he had threatened boldly, and promiſed and acted vigorouſly for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63063:76"/>
the freedom of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> he might have drawn him out of priſon; ſo much the more eaſily, becauſe all <hi>Agra</hi> was for two whole days in that belief, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was overcome. But <hi>Jeſſomſeigne,</hi> who knew how all things went, and who durſt not long ſtay there, nor attempt any thing, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but paſs, returning with all ſpeed homewards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who apprehended miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief from <hi>Agra,</hi> and fear'd left <hi>Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomſeigne</hi> ſhould undertake ſomething for <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> was not long in the purſuit after <hi>Sultan Sujah;</hi> he turn'd ſhort for <hi>Agra</hi> with his whole Army, where he ſtaid a good while, giving order for all things. Mean time he received intelligence, that <hi>Sultan Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> had not loſt many Men in his being routed, for want of farther purſuit; that alſo from the Lands of the <hi>Raja's,</hi> which are in thoſe quarters, on the right and left of <hi>Ganges,</hi> he raiſed great Forces, upon the ſcore of the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he had of being very rich, and very liberal, and that he fortified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63063:77"/>
in <hi>Elabas,</hi> that important and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Paſſage of <hi>Ganges,</hi> which with its Fortreſs is the firſt In-let into <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale.</hi> And then he conſidered alſo, that he had about him two Perſons, which indeed were very capable to ſerve him, <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> his Eldeſt Son, and <hi>Emir-Jemla;</hi> but he well knew, that thoſe who have done good ſervice to their Prince, grow often inſolent, in the belief, that all is due to them, and that they cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced enough. He perceived al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that the former of them began very much to emancipate himſelf, and that every day he became more arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, for having ſeized on the Fortreſs of <hi>Agra,</hi> and by that means had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all the Deſigns which <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> could have formed. And as to the <hi>Latter,</hi> he knew indeed the force of his Underſtanding, his Conduct, and Valour; but that was the very thing which made him apprehend him the more: For knowing that he was very rich, that his reputation was great, that he paſſed for the <hi>Firſt Mover</hi> in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63063:77"/>
Affairs, and for the ableſt Man in all the <hi>Indies,</hi> he doubted not, but that after the Example of <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> he entertain'd himſelf with big hopes. All this certainly would have been able to perplex an ordinary Spirit, but <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> found a Remedy to all. He knew to remove them both with ſo much prudence, and even with ſo much handſomneſs, that neither of them found any cauſe to complain of it. He ſent them both againſt <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> with a puiſſant Army, letting <hi>Emir</hi> ſecretly know, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Bengale,</hi> which is the beſt quarter of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> was deſign'd for him, to hold it during his life, and for his Son after his deceaſe; and that thereby he would begin to expreſs to him his acknowledgments for the great Services he had done him; and that therefore it belonged only to him to defeat <hi>Sujah,</hi> and that as ſoon as he ſhould have compaſſed it, he would make him <hi>Mir-ul Omrahs,</hi> which is the firſt and the moſt honourable place of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> and no leſs than the Prince of the <hi>Omrahs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:63063:78"/>
To <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> his Son, he ſaid only theſe few words: Remember that thou art the Eldeſt of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that 'tis for thy ſelf thou goeſt forth to fight; that thou haſt done much, but yet nothing, if thou over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeſt not <hi>Sujah,</hi> who is our greateſt and powerfulleſt Enemy; I hope, God aſſiſting me, to be ſoon Maſter of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>With theſe words he diſmiſſed them both, with ordinary honours, that is, with rich Veſts, ſome Horſes and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants gallantly harneſſed; making in the mean time <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> to conſent, that his only Son, <hi>Mahmet-Emir-Kan,</hi> ſhould ſtay with him for a good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or rather for a Pledge of his Fidelity; and <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> that his Wife ſhould remain in <hi>Agra</hi> (which was the Daughter of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd King of <hi>Golkonda)</hi> as too trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome a thing in an Army, and in ſuch an Expedition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> who was always in the apprehenſion, leſt the <hi>Raja's</hi> of the lower <hi>Bengale,</hi> which he had ill treated,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63063:78"/>
ſhould be raiſed againſt him, and who feared nothing more than to have to do with <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> had no ſooner received this News, but apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the paſſage to <hi>Bengale</hi> would be obſtructed, and that <hi>Emir</hi> would paſs in ſome other place the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> either lower or higher than <hi>Elabas,</hi> raiſed his Camp, and went down to <hi>Benares</hi> and <hi>Patna,</hi> whence he betook himſelf to <hi>Mogiere,</hi> a ſmall Town ſeated upon the <hi>Ganges,</hi> a place commonly call'd the <hi>Key</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Bengale,</hi> being a kind of Streight between the Mountains and the Woods, which are not far from thence. He thought fit to ſtay in that place, and there to fortifie himſelf; and for greater ſafety, he cauſed a great Trench to be made, which I have ſeen, paſſing that way ſome years after, from the Town and River unto the Mountain, being well reſolved there to attend <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> and to diſpute that paſſage with him. But he was ſufficiently aſtoniſh'd, when he was told, that the Troops of <hi>Emir,</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:63063:79"/>
which ſlowly deſcended along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Ganges,</hi> were certainly for nothing but to amuſe him; that himſelf was not there; that he had gained the <hi>Raja's</hi> of thoſe Mountains, which are on the right hand of the River; and that he and <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> marched apace over their Lands with all the Flower of the Army, drawing ſtraight to <hi>Rage-Mehalle,</hi> to intercept him: So that he was conſtrained to quit, as ſoon as he could, his Fortifications; yet notwithſtanding he made ſo much haſte, that though he was obliged to follow thoſe windings, which the River <hi>Ganges</hi> on that ſide maketh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the left hand, he prevented <hi>Emir</hi> by ſome days, and arrived firſt at <hi>Rage-Mehalle,</hi> where he had time to fortifie himſelf; becauſe <hi>Emir</hi> having heard this News, took his March to the left hand towards <hi>Ganges,</hi> through very ill ways, there to expect his Troops, which came down with the Body of the Artillery and the Baggage along the River. As ſoon as all was come, he went to attaque <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> who
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63063:79"/>
defended himſelf very well for five or ſix days; but ſeeing that the Artillery of <hi>Emir,</hi> which played inceſſantly, ruined all his Fortifications, which were made but of ſandy Earth and Faggots, and that he could not but with much difficulty make reſiſtance in that place, beſides that the Seaſon of the Rain began, he retired himſelf, at the favour of the night, leaving behind two great Peeces of Cannon. <hi>Emir</hi> durſt not follow him in the night, for fear of ſome Ambuſh, putting off the purſuit 'till the next morning: But <hi>Sujah</hi> had the good luck, that at the break of day there began to fall a Rain, which laſted above three days; ſo that <hi>Emir</hi> could not only not ſtir out of <hi>Rage-Mehalle,</hi> but ſaw himſelf obliged to paſs the Winter there, by reaſon of the exceſſive Rains in that Country, which render the ways ſo troubleſome for more than four months, <hi>viz. July, Auguſt, September,</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> that the Armies cannot poſſibly march. And hereby <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> had the means to retire himſelf, and to chuſe what
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63063:80"/>
place he would, having time enough to fortifie his Army, and to ſend out of the inferiour <hi>Bengale</hi> for many Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Cannon, and a good number of <hi>Portugals,</hi> that were retired thither, becauſe of the great fertility of the Countrey: For he much courted all thoſe <hi>Portugal</hi> Fathers, Miſſionaries, that are in that Province, promiſing them no leſs than that he would make them all rich, and build Churches for them whereſoever they would. And they were indeed capable to ſerve him, it being certain, that in the Kingdom of <hi>Bengale</hi> there are to be found no leſs than eight or nine thouſand Families of <hi>Franguis, Portugals,</hi> and theſe either Natives or Meſticks.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> who for the reaſon above-mentioned was grown fierce, and aſpired perhaps to greater things than at that time he ought, did pretend to command the Army abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and that <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> ſhould follow his Orders, letting alſo from time to time fall inſolent words in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Father <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63063:80"/>
if he were obliged to him for the Crown, and uttering Expreſſions of contempt and threat againſt <hi>Emir-Jemla;</hi> which cauſed great coldneſs betwixt them two, which laſted a pretty while, until <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> underſtood, that his Father was very much diſſatisfied with his conduct: And apprehending, leſt <hi>Emir</hi> had order to ſeize on his perſon, he went away to <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> accompanied with a very ſmall number, and to him he made great promiſes, and ſwore fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. But <hi>Sujah,</hi> who feared <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi>'s ſnares, could not truſt him, having always an Eye upon his Actions, without giving him any conſiderable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; which he ſo diſguſted, that ſome months after, not knowing what would become of him, he left <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> and returned to <hi>Emir,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him well enough, aſſuring him, that he would write in his behalf to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and do his utmoſt to make him forget that fault.</p>
                  <p>I think fit here to take notice, on
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63063:81"/>
the by, of what many have told me, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Eſcape of <hi>Sultan Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moud</hi> was altogether made by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who cared not much to hazard this Son of his to try to deſtroy <hi>Sujah,</hi> and who was glad enough, that whatever the Event were, he might have a ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to put him in a place of ſurety. However it be, he afterwards ſhew'd himſelf much diſſatisfied with him, and wrote to him a ſevere Letter, in which he enjoyn'd him to return to <hi>Dehli,</hi> but giving order in the mean time, that he ſhould not come ſo far: For he no ſooner had paſſed the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> but he met with Troops that ſtopp'd him, and put him up in a ſmall Chair, (as was done to <hi>Morad-Bakche)</hi> and carried him to <hi>Goualeor,</hi> whence 'tis thought he will never be ſet at liberty: <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> by this means freeing himſelf from great perplexity; who then alſo let his ſecond Son, <hi>Sultan Mazum,</hi> know, that the point of Reigning is ſo delicate a thing, that Kings muſt be jealous even of their
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63063:81"/>
own ſhadow; adding, that if he be not diſcreet, the like may befall him what had befallen his Brother, and that he ought to think <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was not a Man, that would ſuffer that to be done to himſelf, what <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> did to his Father <hi>Jehan-Guyre,</hi> and what he had alſo lately ſeen done to <hi>Chah-Jehan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed we may on this occaſion ſay, that if this Son continue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf as he hath done hitherto, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> will have no cauſe to ſuſpect him, and to be diſſatisfied with him: For no Slave can be more tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable, and <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> himſelf never appear'd more careleſs of Greatneſs, nor more given to Devotion than he: Yet I have known Men of Parts, who believed, that he is not ſo in good earneſt, but by ſuperlative policy and craft, like that of his Father, which we may have the proof of in time.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt all theſe things were thus tranſacted in <hi>Bengale,</hi> and that <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> reſiſted the beſt he could the Forces of <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> paſſing now
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63063:82"/>
on one ſide of the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> of a Channel, or ſome other River, (for that Countrey is full of them) then on the other; <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about <hi>Agra,</hi> going to and fro; and at length, after he had alſo ſent <hi>Morad-Bakche</hi> to <hi>Goualeor,</hi> he came to <hi>Dehli,</hi> where in good earneſt he took upon him publickly to act the King, giving order for all Affairs of the Kingdom, and eſpecially thinking on means to catch <hi>Dara,</hi> and to get him out of <hi>Guzaratte,</hi> which was a very hard thing, for the Reaſons already mentioned. But the great good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the ſingular dexterity of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſoon drew him thence; which now follows next to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſſomſeigne,</hi> who had retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Countrey, and made the beſt of what he had taken in the Battel of <hi>Kadjoue,</hi> raiſed a ſtrong Army, and wrote to <hi>Dara,</hi> that he ſhould come to <hi>Agra</hi> as ſoon as he could, and that he would joyn with his Forces. <hi>Dara,</hi> who had by this time ſet on foot a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63063:82"/>
pretty numerous Army (though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, for the moſt part, but of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered people) and who hoped, that approaching to <hi>Agra,</hi> many of his old Friends, ſeeing him with <hi>Jeſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne,</hi> would not fail to joyn with him alſo, immediately leaveth <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devad,</hi> and marcheth with great ſpeed to <hi>Aſmire,</hi> ſeven or eight days journey from <hi>Agra.</hi> But <hi>Jeſſomſeigne</hi> kept not his word with him: The <hi>Raja Jeſſeigne</hi> interpoſed to make his peace with <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and to faſten him to his Party; or, at leaſt, to hinder his Deſign, which was capable to ruin himſelf, and to make all the <hi>Raja's</hi> riſe; and wrote to him ſeveral Letters, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to underſtand the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he went to expoſe himſelf to, by eſpouſing a Party in that extremity, as that of <hi>Dara</hi>'s was; that he ſhould well conſider what he was going to do; that he went about wholly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf, and all his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> would never forgive him; that he was a <hi>Raja</hi> as himſelf; that he ſhould think on ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63063:83"/>
the blood of the <hi>Ragipous;</hi> that if he thought to draw the <hi>Raja's</hi> to his Party, he would find thoſe that would hinder him from it. In a word, that it was a buſineſs which concern'd all the Gentry of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> and expoſed them to danger, if way were given to kindle a Fire, which would not be extinguiſh'd at pleaſure. And laſtly, if he would leave <hi>Dara</hi> to himſelf, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> would forget all that had paſſed, and preſent him with all he had taken, and give him that very inſtant the Government of <hi>Guzaratte,</hi> which would be very convenient for him, that Countrey being near his Lands; that he could be there in full liberty and ſafety, and as long as he pleaſed, and that himſelf would be Caution for all. In a word, this <hi>Raja</hi> acted his part ſo well, that he made <hi>Jeſſomſeigne</hi> return to his Land, whilſt <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> approached with his whole Army to <hi>Aſmire,</hi> and encamped in the ſight of that of <hi>Dara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now what could this poor Prince <hi>Dara</hi> do? He ſeeth himſelf
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63063:83"/>
abandoned, and fruſtrated of his hopes. He conſiders, that to turn back ſafe to <hi>Amadevad</hi> was impoſſible, in regard that it was a March of thirty and five days; that it was in the heart of Summer; that water would fail him; that they were all the Lands of <hi>Raja's,</hi> Friends or Allies of <hi>Jeſſeigne</hi> or <hi>Jeſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne;</hi> that the Army of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> which was not haraſſed like his, would not fail to follow him. 'Tis as good, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> to periſh here; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Match be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, let us venture all, and give Battel once more. But alas! what does he mean to do? He is not only abandoned by all, but he hath yet with him <hi>Chab-Navaze-Kan,</hi> whom he truſts, and who betrays him, and diſcovers all his Deſigns to <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi> 'Tis true, that <hi>Chah-Navaze-Kan</hi> was puniſh'd for his perfidiouſneſs, and killed in the Battel, whether it was by the hands of <hi>Dara</hi> himſelf, as many told me, or (which is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) by ſome of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>'s Army, who being ſecret Partiſans of <hi>Dara,</hi>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:63063:84"/>
found means to get to him, and to diſpatch him, fearing leſt he ſhould diſcover them, and have ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Letters they had written to <hi>Dara.</hi> But what did it benefit him at that time, that <hi>Chah-Navaze-Kan</hi> was dead? <hi>Dara</hi> ſhould have ſooner follow'd the advice of his Friends, and never have confided in him.</p>
                  <p>The Fight began between Nine and Ten of the Clock in the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Dara</hi>'s Artillery, which was very well placed on a little eminency, was loud enough; but, as was ſaid, moſt of the Peeces without Bullets; ſo was he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by all! 'Tis needleſs to relate the other particulars of this Battel; it was properly not a Battel, but a Rout. I ſhall only ſay, that hardly the On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet was begun, but <hi>Jeſſeigna</hi> was near and in ſight of <hi>Dara,</hi> to whom he ſent word, that he ſhould fly preſently, unleſs he would be taken. So that this poor Prince, being altogether ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, was conſtrained to run away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and with ſo much diſorder and precipitation, that he had not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63063:84"/>
leiſure to put up his Baggage. It was no ſmall matter, that he was able to get away with his Wife, and the reſt of his Family. And 'tis eertain, that if the <hi>Raja Jeſſeigne</hi> would have done what he could, he could never have eſcaped; but he always had a reſpect to the Royal Family; or rather, he was too crafty and politick, and had too great forecaſt, to venture to lay hands on a Prince of the Blood.</p>
                  <p>This unfortunate Prince, deſerted by almoſt all, and finding himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied but of two thouſand Men at moſt, was forced in the hotteſt of Summer to croſs, without Tents or Baggage, all thoſe Countries of the <hi>Raja's,</hi> that are almoſt from <hi>Aſmire</hi> to <hi>Amadevad.</hi> Mean time the <hi>Koullis,</hi> which are the Countrey People, and the worſt of all the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the greateſt Robbers, follow him night and day, rifle and kill his Souldiers, with ſo much cruelty, that no Man could ſtay two hundred paces behind the Body, but he was preſently ſtripp'd naked, or butcher'd upon the leaſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63063:85"/>
reſiſtance. Yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Dara</hi> made ſhift to get near <hi>Amadevad,</hi> when he hoped, that the next day, or ſoon after, he ſhould enter into the Town to refreſh himſelf, and to try once more to gather again ſome Forces: But all things fall out contrary to vanquiſhed and unfortunate Men.</p>
                  <p>The Governour, whom he had left in the Caſtle of <hi>Amadevad,</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received both menacing and promiſing Letters from <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> which made him loſe courage, and incline to that ſide; in ſo much that he wrote to <hi>Dara,</hi> forbidding him to come nearer, if he did, he would find the Gates ſhut, and all in Arms.</p>
                  <p>Three days before I met this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Prince, by a ſtrange accident, when he obliged me to follow him; having no Phyſitian about him; and the night before that he received this News from the Governour of <hi>Amade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vad,</hi> he did me the favour to make me come into the <hi>Karavan-Serrak</hi> where he was, fearing leſt the <hi>Koullis</hi> ſhould aſſaſſinate me; And (what is hard
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63063:85"/>
enough to believe in <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> where the Crandees eſpecially are ſo jealous of their Wives) I was ſo near to the Wife of this Prince, that the Cords of the <hi>Kanates,</hi> or Wind-ſcreen, which encloſed them (for they had not ſo much as a poor Tent) were faſtened to the Wheels of my Chariot. I relate this circumſtance by the by only, to ſhew the extremity <hi>Dara</hi> was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to.</p>
                  <p>When theſe Women heard this ſad news (which was at the break of day, as I well remember) they broke out upon a ſudden into ſuch ſtrange cryes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, that they forced tears from ones Eyes. And now behold all was in an unexpreſſible confuſion: Every one looks upon his neighbour, and no body knows what to do, or what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him. Soon after we ſaw <hi>Dara</hi> come forth, half dead, now ſpeaking to one, then another, even to the meaneſt Souldiers. He ſeeth all aſtoniſh'd, and ready to abandon him. What counſel? whither can be go? he muſt be gone inſtantly. You
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63063:86"/>
may judge of the extremity he muſt needs be in, by this ſmall accident I am going to mention. Of three great Oxen of <hi>Guzaratte,</hi> which I had for my Chariot, one died the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, another was dying, and the third was tyred out (for we had been forced to march for three days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, almoſt night and day, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable heat and duſt:) Whatever <hi>Dara</hi> could ſay or command, whether he alledged it was for himſelf, or for one of his Women that was hurt in her Leg, or for me; he could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly procure for me, whether Oxe, or Camel, or Horſe: So that he was obliged, to my good fortune, to leave me there. I ſaw him march away, and that with tears in his Eyes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with four or five hundred Cavaliers at moſt, and with two Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, that were ſaid to be laden with Gold and Silver; and I heard them ſay, that they were to take their march towards <hi>Tatabakar;</hi> for he had no other Game to play, though even that ſeem'd in a manner impoſſible,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63063:86"/>
conſidering the ſmall number of people left him, and the great ſandy Deſarts to be waded through in the hotteſt ſeaſon, moſt of them without water fit to drink. And indeed moſt of thoſe that follow'd him, and even divers of his Women, did there periſh, either of drought, or the nnwholeſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or the tireſome ways and ill food, or laſtly, becauſe ſtripped by the <hi>Koul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> above-mention'd. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, <hi>Dara</hi> made hard ſhift to get to the <hi>Raja Katche;</hi> unhappy even herein, that he periſh'd not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this March.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Raja</hi> at firſt gave him a very good reception, even ſo far as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him aſſiſtance with all his Forces, provided he would give his Daughter in Marriage to his Son. But <hi>Jeſſeigne</hi> ſoon wrought as much with this <hi>Raja,</hi> as he had done with <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eſſomſeigne.</hi> So that <hi>Dara</hi> one day ſeeing the kindneſs of this Barbarian cooled upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and that conſequently his Perſon was in danger there, he betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the purſuit of his Expedition to <hi>Tatabakar.</hi>

                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:63063:87"/>
To relate how I got away from thoſe Robbers, the <hi>Koullis,</hi> in what manner I moved them to compaſſion, how I ſaved the beſt part of my ſmall Treaſure, how we became good friends by the means of my profeſſion of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, my Servants (perplexed as well as my ſelf) ſwearing that I was the greateſt Phyſitian of the World, and that the People of <hi>Dara,</hi> at their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, had ill treated me, and taken from me all my beſt things: How, after having kept me with them ſeven or eight days, they had ſo much kindneſs and generoſity, as to lend me an Oxe, and to conduct me ſo far, that I was in ſight of <hi>Amadevad:</hi> And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how from thence after ſome days I returned to <hi>Dehli,</hi> having lighted on an occaſion to go with a certain <hi>Omrah</hi> paſſing thither; in which Journey I met from time to time, on the way, with Carkaſſes of Men, Elephants, Oxen, Horſes, and Camels, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of that unfortunate Army of <hi>Dara.</hi> Theſe are things, I ſay, I muſt not inſiſt upon to deſcribe them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:63063:87"/>
Whilſt <hi>Dara</hi> advanced towards <hi>Tatabakar,</hi> the War continues in <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,</hi> and much longer than was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> putting forth his utmoſt, and playing his laſt Game againſt <hi>Emir-Jemla:</hi> Yet this did not much trouble <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who knew 'twas a great way between <hi>Bengale</hi> and <hi>Agra,</hi> and was ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the prudence and valour of <hi>Emir-Jemla.</hi> That which diſquieted him much more was, that he ſaw <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman Chekouh</hi> ſo near (for from <hi>Agra</hi> to the Mountains 'tis but eight days journey) whom he could not maſter, and who perpetually allarmd him by the rumours that went continually about, as if he were coming down the Mountains with the <hi>Raja.</hi> 'Tis certainly very hard to draw him thence: But behold how he manages the matter to compaſs it.</p>
                  <p>He maketh the <hi>Raja Jeſſeigne</hi> write one Letter after another to the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Serenaguer,</hi> promiſing him very great things, if he would ſurrender <hi>Soliman Chekouh</hi> to him, and menacing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63063:88"/>
War at the ſame time, if he ſhould obſtinately keep him. The <hi>Raja</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that he would rather loſe his Eſtate, than do ſo unworthy an action. And <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> ſeeing his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taketh the Field, and marcheth directly to the foot of the Hills, and with an infinite number of Pike-men cauſeth the Rocks to be cut, and the paſſage to be widen'd. But the <hi>Raja</hi> laughs at all that; neither hath he much cauſe to fear on that ſide. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-Zebe</hi> may cut long enough, they are Mountains inacceſſible to an Army, and ſtones would be ſufficient to ſtop the Forces of four <hi>Indoſtans;</hi> ſo that he was conſtrained to turn back again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dara</hi> in the mean time approacheth to the Fortreſs of <hi>Tatabakar,</hi> and when he was but two or three days journey off, he received News, that <hi>Mir-baba,</hi> who had long held it beſieged, had at length reduced it to extremity: As I afterwards learned of our <hi>French,</hi> and other <hi>Franguis</hi> that were there, a pound of Rice and Meat having coſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63063:88"/>
there above a Crown, and ſo of other Victuals in proportion: Yet the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour held out; made Sallies, which extremely incommoded the Enemy; and ſhew'd all poſſible prudence, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and fidelity; deriding the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the General, <hi>Mir-baba,</hi> and all the menaces and promiſes of <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this alſo I learned afterwards of my Countrey-men, the <hi>French,</hi> and of all thoſe other <hi>Franguis</hi> that were with him; who added, that when he heard that <hi>Dara</hi> was not far off, he redoubled his liberalities, and knew ſo well to gain the hearts of all his Souldiers, and to encourage them to do bravely, that there was not one of them, that was not reſolved to ſally out upon the Enemy, and to hazard all to raiſe the Siege, and to make <hi>Dara</hi> enter; and that he alſo knew ſo well to caſt fear and terrour into the Camp of <hi>Mir-baba,</hi> by ſending Spies about very cunningly to aſſure, that they had ſeen <hi>Dara</hi> approach with great reſolution, and very good Forces;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63063:89"/>
that if he had come, as was believed he would do every moment, the Army of the Enemy was for disbanding upon his appearance, and even in part to go over to him. But he is ſtill too unfortunate, to undertake any thing proſperouſly. Believing therefore, that to raiſe the Siege with ſuch an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Men as he had was impoſſible, he did deliberate to paſs the River <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and to endeavour to get into <hi>Perſia;</hi> although that alſo would have had mighty difficulties and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, by reaſon of the Deſarts, and the ſmall quantity of good waters in thoſe parts; beſides, that upon thoſe Frontiers there are but mean <hi>Rajas</hi> and <hi>Patans,</hi> who acknowledge neither the <hi>Perſian</hi> nor the <hi>Mogol.</hi> But his Wife did very much diſwade him from it, for this weak reaſon, that he muſt, if he did ſo, expect to ſee his Wife and Daughter Slaves of the King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> that that was a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy of the Grandeur of his Family, and 'twas better to dye, than to undergo this infamy.</p>

                     <hi>Dara,</hi> being in great perplexity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that there was thereabout a certain <hi>Patan,</hi> powerful enough, called <hi>Gion-Kan,</hi> whoſe Life he had formerly ſaved twice, when <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> had commanded he ſhould be caſt under the feet of an Elephant, for having rebelled divers times: He reſolved to go to him, hoping that he could give him ſufficient Succours to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Tatabakar;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king account, that thence he would take his Treaſure, and that going from thence, and gaining <hi>Kandahar,</hi> he could caſt himſelf into the Kingdom of <hi>Caboul,</hi> having great hopes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habet-Kan,</hi> who was Governour of it, becauſe he was both potent and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, well beloved of his Countrey, and had obtained this Government by his <hi>(Dara</hi>'s) favour. But his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, <hi>Sepe-Chekouh,</hi> yet but very young, ſeeing his deſign, caſt himſelf at his Feet, intreating him for God's ſake, not to enter into the Countrey of that <hi>Patan.</hi> His Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did the ſame, remonſtrating to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63063:90"/>
him, that he was a Robber, a revolted Governour, that he would infallibly betray him; that he ought not to ſtand upon the raiſing of the Siege, but rather endeavour to gain <hi>Caboul,</hi> that the thing was not impoſſible, foraſmuch as <hi>Mir-baba</hi> was not like to quit the Siege to follow him, and to hinder him from getting thither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dara,</hi> being carried head-long by the force of his unhappy Deſtiny, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected this counſel, and would hearken to nothing of what was propoſed to him, ſaying, as was true, that the March would be very difficult, and very dangerous; and maintaining al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that <hi>Gion-Kan</hi> would not be ſo mean, as to betray him, after all the good he had done him. He departed, notwithſtanding all that could be ſaid to him, and went to prove, at the price of his Life, That no truſt is to be given to a wicked Man.</p>
                  <p>This Robber, who at firſt believed that he had numerous Troops follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, gave him the faireſt rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that could be, and entertained
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63063:90"/>
him with very great kindneſs and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in appearance, placing his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers here and there among his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, with a ſtrict order to treat them well, and to give them what refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Countrey afforded: But when he found that he had not above two or three hundred Men in all, he quickly ſhow'd what he was. It is not known, whether he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome Letters from <hi>Aureng Zebe,</hi> or whether his avarice had not been tempted by ſome Mules ſaid to be laden with Gold; which was all that could be ſaved hitherto, as well from the hands of Robbers, as of thoſe that conveyed it. Whatever it be, on a certain morning, when no body looked for any ſuch thing, all being taken up with the care of refreſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and believing all to be ſafe; behold this Traitor, who had beſtirr'd himſelf all night to get armed Men from all parts, fell upon <hi>Dara</hi> and <hi>Sepe-Chekouh,</hi> killed ſome of their Men that ſtood up to defend themſelves; forgot not to ſeize on the loads of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63063:91"/>
Mules, and of all the Jewels of the Women; made <hi>Dara</hi> to be tyed faſt upon an Elephant, commanding the Executioner to ſit behind, and to cut off his head upon the leaſt ſign given, in caſe he ſhould be ſeen to reſiſt, or that any one ſhould attempt to deliver him. And in this ſtrange poſture he was carried to the Army before <hi>Tata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakar,</hi> where he put him into the hands of <hi>Mir-baba,</hi> the General, who cauſed him to be conducted in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of this ſame Traitor to <hi>Lahor,</hi> and thence to <hi>Dehli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was at the Gates of <hi>Dehli,</hi> it was deliberated by <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> whether he ſhould be made to paſs through the midſt of the City, or no, to carry him thence to <hi>Goualeor.</hi> Many did adviſe, that that was by no means to be done; that ſome diſorder might ariſe; that ſome might come to ſave him; and beſides, that it would be a great diſhonour to the Family Royal. Others maintained the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was abſolutely neceſſary he ſhould paſs through the Town, to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63063:91"/>
aſtoniſh the World, and to ſhew the abſolute Power of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and to diſabuſe the People, that might ſtill doubt, whether it were himſelf, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many <hi>Omrahs</hi> did doubt; and to take away all hopes from thoſe, who ſtill preſerved ſome affection for him. The Opinion of theſe laſt was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; he was put on an Elephant, his Grand-child, <hi>Sepe-Chekouh,</hi> at his ſide; and behind them was placed <hi>Bhadur-Kan,</hi> as an Executioner. This was none of thoſe brave Elephants of <hi>Ceilan</hi> or <hi>Pegu,</hi> which he was wont to ride on, with gilt Harneſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered Covers, and Seats with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopies very handſomely painted and gilt, to defend themſelves from the Sun: It was an old Caitiff Animal, very dirty and naſty, with an old torn Cover, and a pitiful Seat, all open. There was no more ſeen about him, that Necklace of big Pearls, which thoſe Princes are wont to wear, nor thoſe rich Turbants and Veſts em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd. All his Dreſs was a Veſt of courſe Linnen, all dirty, and a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63063:92"/>
of the ſame, with a wretched Scarf of <hi>Kachimere</hi> over his head, like a Varlet; his Grand-ſon, <hi>Sepe-Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kouh,</hi> being in the ſame equipage. In this miſerable poſture he was made to enter into the Town, and to paſs through the greateſt Merchant-ſtreets, to the end that all the People might ſee him, and entertain no doubt any more whether it was he.</p>
                  <p>As for me, I fancied we went to ſee ſome ſtrange Maſſacre, and was aſtoniſh'd at the boldneſs of making him thus paſs through the Town; and that the more, becauſe I knew that he was very ill guarded, neither was I ignorant, that he was very much beloved by the lower ſort of people, who at that time exclaimed highly againſt the cruelty and tyranny of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> as one that kept his Father in priſon, as alſo his own Son <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Morad-Bakche.</hi> I was well prepar'd for it, and with a good Horſe and two good Men I went, together with two others of my Friends, to place
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63063:92"/>
my ſelf in the greateſt ſtreet, where he was to paſs. But not one Man had the boldneſs to draw his Sword, only there were ſome of the <hi>Fakires,</hi> and with them ſome poor people, who ſeeing that infamous <hi>Gion-Kan</hi> ride by his ſide, began to rail and throw ſtones at him, and to call him Traitor. All the ſhops were ready to break for the crowd of Spectators, that wept bitterly; and there was heard nothing but loud Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes and Lamentations, Invectives, and Curſes, heaped on <hi>Gion-Kan.</hi> In a word, Men and Women, great and ſmall (ſuch is the tenderneſs of the hearts of the <hi>Indians)</hi> were ready to melt into tears for compaſſion; but not one there was that durſt ſtir to reſcue him. Now after he had thus paſſed through the Town, he was put into a Garden called <hi>Heider-Abad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were not wanting to tell <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> how the People at this ſight had lamented <hi>Dara,</hi> and curſed the <hi>Patan,</hi> that had deliver'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how the ſame was in danger to have been ſtoned to death, as alſo that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63063:93"/>
there had been a great apprehenſion of ſome ſedition and miſchief. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon another Council was held, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould indeed be carried to <hi>Goualeor,</hi> as had been concluded before; or whether it were not more expedient to put him to death, without more ado? Some were of opinion, that he ſhould go to <hi>Goualeor</hi> with a ſtrong Guard, that that would be enough; <hi>Danechmend-Kan,</hi> though <hi>Dara</hi>'s old Enemy, inſiſting much upon that. But <hi>Rauchenara-Begum,</hi> in purſuance of her hatred againſt this Brother of hers, puſhed <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, without running the danger there was in ſending him to <hi>Goualeor;</hi> as alſo did all his old Enemies, <hi>Calil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ullah-Kan,</hi> and <hi>Chah-heſt-Kan,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a certain Flatterer, a Phyſitian, who was fled out of <hi>Perſia,</hi> firſt called <hi>Hakim-Daoud,</hi> and afterwards being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a great <hi>Omrah</hi> named <hi>Takarrub-Kan:</hi> This Villain boldly roſe up in a full Aſſembly, and cryed out, that it was expedient for the ſafety of the State to put him to death immediately,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63063:93"/>
and that the rather, becauſe he was no <hi>Muſſulman;</hi> that long ſince he was turn'd <hi>Kafire,</hi> Idolater, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that he would charge the Sin of it upon his own head: Of which imprecation he ſoon after felt the ſmart; for within a ſhort time he fell into diſgrace, and was treated like an infamous Fellow, and dyed miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. But <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by theſe inſtances and motives, commanded that he ſhould be put to death, and that <hi>Sepe-Chekouh,</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, ſhould be ſent to <hi>Goualeor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Charge of this Tragical Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was given to a certain Slave, call'd <hi>Nazer,</hi> that had been bred by <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> and was known to have been formerly ill treated by <hi>Dara.</hi> This Executioner, accompanied with three or four Parricides more, went to <hi>Dara,</hi> who was then himſelf dreſſing ſome Lentils with <hi>Sepe-Chekouh</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child. He no ſooner ſaw <hi>Nazer,</hi> but cryed out to <hi>Sepe-Chekouh,</hi> My dear Son, behold thoſe that come to kill us! laying hold at the ſame time of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63063:94"/>
a ſmall Knife, which was all the Arms that were left him. One of theſe Butchers immediately fell upon <hi>Sepe-Chekouh;</hi> the others, upon the arms and legs of <hi>Dara,</hi> throwing him to the ground, and holding him under, 'till <hi>Nazer</hi> cut his throat. His Head was forthwith carried to the Fortreſs to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to be put in a diſh, and that water ſhould be fetch'd; which when brought, he wiped it off with an Handkerchief, and after he had cauſed the Face to be waſhed clean, and the blood done away, and was fully ſatisfied that it was the very head of <hi>Dara,</hi> he fell a weeping, and ſaid theſe words; Ah <hi>Bed-bakt!</hi> Ah unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Man! Take it away, and bury it in the Sepulchre of <hi>Houmayon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At night, the Daughter of <hi>Dara</hi> was brought into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but afterwards ſent to <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> and <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> who asked her of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-Zebe.</hi> Concerning <hi>Dara</hi>'s Wife, ſhe had ended her days before at <hi>Lahor:</hi> She had poyſon'd her ſelf, foreſeeing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63063:94"/>
the extremities ſhe was falling into, together with her Husband. <hi>Sepe-Chekouh</hi> was ſent to <hi>Goualeor.</hi> And after a few days, <hi>Gion-kan</hi> was ſent for, to come before <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: To him were given ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and ſo he was ſent away; but being near his Lands, he was rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to his deſert, being killed in a Wood. This barbarous Man not knowing, or not conſidering, that if Kings do ſometimes permit ſuch Actions for their Intereſt, yet they abhor them, and ſooner or later revenge them.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Governour of <hi>Tatabakar,</hi> by the ſame Orders that had been required of <hi>Dara,</hi> was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſurrender the Fortreſs. It was indeed upon ſuch a compoſition as he would have, but it was alſo with an intention not to keep word with him. For the poor Eunuch, arriving at <hi>Lahor,</hi> was cut in pieces, together with thoſe few Men he had then with him, by <hi>Kalil-ullah-kan,</hi> who was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour thereof. But the reaſon of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63063:95"/>
the non-obſervance of the Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, that there was come intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that he ſecretly prepar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to go directly to <hi>Soliman-Chekouh,</hi> ſparing no Gold, which under-hand he conveyed into the hands of our <hi>Franguis,</hi> and to all thoſe that were come with him out of the Fortreſs to follow him, under pretext of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying him as far as <hi>Dehli</hi> to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who had often ſaid, that he ſhould be very glad to ſee ſo gallant a Man, and who had ſo valiantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf.</p>
                  <p>There remained therefore none of the Family of <hi>Dara,</hi> but <hi>Soliman-Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kouh,</hi> who could not eaſily be drawn away from <hi>Serenaguer,</hi> if the <hi>Raja</hi> had been ſteady to his firſt Declarations. But the ſecret practiſes of the <hi>Raja Jeſſeigne,</hi> the promiſes and threats of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> the death of <hi>Dara,</hi> and the other <hi>Rajas</hi> his Neighbours that had been gain'd, and were prepared by the Orders, and at the coſt of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> to make War againſt him, did at laſt ſhake the Faith of this perfidious
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63063:95"/>
Protector, and made him conſent to their demands. <hi>Sepe-Chekouh,</hi> who was advertiſed of it, fled through the midſt of thoſe horrid Countries and fearful Deſarts, towards the great <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi> But the Son of the <hi>Raja,</hi> ſoon purſuing and overtaking him, cauſed him to be aſſaulted with ſtones. The poor Prince was hurt, ſeized, and carried to <hi>Dehli,</hi> where he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd in <hi>Serenguer,</hi> that little For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, where at firſt they had put <hi>Morad-Bakche.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> to obſerve what he had practiſed towards <hi>Dara,</hi> and that no body might doubt it was <hi>Soliman-Chekouh</hi> himſelf, commanded him to be brought before him in the preſence of all the Grandees of the Court. At the entry of the Gate, the Chains were taken from his feet, leaving thoſe he had about his hands, which ſeemed gilt. When this proper young Man, ſo handſome and gallant, was ſeen to enter, there was a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Omrahs</hi> that could not hold their tears; and, as I was informed, all
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63063:96"/>
the great Ladies of the Court, that had leave to ſee him come in, fell a weeping. <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who appear'd himſelf to be touched at his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, began to ſpeak very kindly to him, and to comfort him; telling him amongſt other things, that he ſhould fear nothing, that no hurt ſhould be done to him; on the contrary, that he ſhould be well treated, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be of good courage; that he had cauſed his Father to be put to death for no other reaſon, than that he was turn'd <hi>Kafer,</hi> and a Man without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Whereupon this young Prince return'd him the <hi>Salem,</hi> and bleſſed him, abaſing his hands to the earth, and lifting them, as well as he could, up to his head, after the cuſtom of the Countrey; and told him with reſolution enough, That if he were to drink the <hi>Pouſt,</hi> he intreated him that he might dye preſently, being very willing to ſubmit to his Fate. But <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> promiſed him publickly, that he ſhould drink none of it; that he ſhould reſt ſatisfied as to that, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63063:96"/>
not entertain any ſad thoughts about it. This being ſaid, he once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the <hi>Salem:</hi> And after they had asked him ſeveral Queſtions, in the Name of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> touching that Elephant which was charged with Roupies of Gold, taken from him when he went to <hi>Serenaguer,</hi> he was ſent to <hi>Goualeor</hi> to the reſt. This <hi>Pouſt</hi> is nothing elſe but Poppy expreſſed, and infuſed a night in water. And 'tis that potion, which thoſe that are kept at <hi>Goualeor,</hi> are commonly made to drink; I mean thoſe Princes, whoſe heads they think not fit to cut off: This is the firſt thing that is brought them in the morning, and they have nothing given them to eat 'till they have drunk a great cup full of it; they would rather let them ſtarve. This emaciates them exceedingly, and maketh them dye inſenſibly, they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing little by little their ſtrength and underſtanding, and growing torpid and ſenſeleſs. And by this very means 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Sepe-Chekouh,</hi> and the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child of <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> and <hi>Soliman-Chekouh,</hi> were diſpach'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:63063:97"/>
As to <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> he was made away by a more violent death. For <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſeeing, that though he was in priſon, yet the generality had an inclination to him, and that many Verſes were ſpread in the praiſe of his Valour and Courage, thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not ſafe enough by putting him to death in private, by giving him <hi>Pouſt</hi> like others; apprehending, that his Death would be ſtill doubted of, and that that might one time or other occaſion ſome commotion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deviſed the following Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                  <p>The Children of a certain <hi>Sayed,</hi> very rich, whom he had cauſed to be put to death in <hi>Amadevad,</hi> to get his Eſtate, when he there made his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for War, and borrowed or took by force great Sums of Money from all the rich Merchants, appeared in full Aſſembly, making their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and demanding Juſtice, and the Head of <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> for the Blood of their Father. Not one of the <hi>Omrahs</hi> durſt contradict it, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:63063:97"/>
he was a <hi>Sayed,</hi> that is, one of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Kindred, to whom great Veneration was paid; and that every body ſufficiently underſtood the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> taking this for a pretence to rid himſelf openly of <hi>Morad-Bakche,</hi> under a ſhew of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. So that the Head of him, that had killed the Father of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs, was granted them without any other form of Proceſs. Whereupon they went, with neceſſary Orders iſſued out for that purpoſe, to cut it off in <hi>Goualeor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There remained no other Thorn in the Foot of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> but <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> who kept himſelf ſtill in <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale;</hi> but he alſo was forced to yield at laſt to the power and fortune of <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi> There were ſent ſo many Troops of all ſorts to <hi>Emir-Femla,</hi> that at laſt he was encompaſſed on all ſides, both on this and that ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Ganges;</hi> ſo that he was neceſſitated to flye to <hi>Dake,</hi> which is the laſt Town of <hi>Bengale</hi> on the Sea ſide; and here comes the concluſion of this whole Tragedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:63063:98"/>
This Prince being deſtitute of Ships to put to Sea, and not knowing whither to flye, ſent his eldeſt Son, <hi>Sultan Banque,</hi> to the King of <hi>Racan</hi> or <hi>Moy,</hi> a Heathen or Idolatrous King, to know whether he would give him leave to make his Countrey his place of refuge only for ſome time, and do him the favour, when the <hi>Mouſons</hi> or the Seaſon-winds ſhould come, to furniſh him with a Veſſel for <hi>Mecha,</hi> from thence to paſs into ſome part of <hi>Turky</hi> or <hi>Perſia.</hi> That King ſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he ſhould be very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and have all poſſible aſſiſtance. So <hi>Sultan Banque</hi> returned to <hi>Dake</hi> with ſome Galeaſſes, manned with <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis</hi> (I mean, with thoſe fugitive <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> and other ſtraggling Chriſtians, that had put themſelves in ſervice to that King, driving no other Trade than to ravage all this lower <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale;)</hi> upon which <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, with his whole Family, <hi>viz.</hi> his Wife, his three Sons, and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. They were well enough recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; whatever was neceſſary for their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63063:98"/>
ſubſiſtence, ſuch as that Countrey would afford, was provided for them, in the name of that King. Some months paſs, the Seaſon of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Winds come in, but not a word of the Veſſel, though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it no otherwiſe than for his Money; for as yet he wanted not Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of Gold, nor Silver, nor Gems: He had too great a plenty of them; his Riches were, in all appearance, the cauſe of his ruin, or at leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed much to it. Thoſe barbarous Kings have no true generoſity, and are not much refrained by the Faith they have given, regarding nothing but their preſent Intereſts, without ſo much as conſidering the miſchiefs that may befall them for their perfidiouſneſs and brutality. To get out of their hands, one muſt either be the ſtronger, or have nothing that may tempt their avarice. <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> may long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſollicit for a Veſſel; all is in vain, he effects nothing: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the King begins to ſhew much coldneſs, and to complain of his not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63063:99"/>
coming to ſee him. I know not, whether <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of himſelf, and too mean a thing to give him a Viſit; or rather, whether he fear'd, that being in the Kings Houſe he might not there be ſeized on, to take away all his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and then be deliver'd into the hands of <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> who for that purpoſe promiſed, in the name of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> great Sums of Money, and many other conſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Whatever the matter was, he would not go thither himſelf, but ſent his Son <hi>Sultan Banque,</hi> who being near the Kings Houſe, began to ſhew liberality to the people, throwing out to them a good quantity of half Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, and whole Rupies, of Gold and Silver. And being come before the King, he preſented him with ſtore of Embroideries, and of rare pieces of Goldſmiths-work, ſet with precious Stones of great value, excuſing his Father, <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> as being indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and beſeeching him in his name, that he would remember the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63063:99"/>
Veſſel, and the promiſe made to him thereof. But all that did not advance his buſineſs; on the contrary, five or ſix days after, this King ſent to <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> to ask of him one of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Marriage; which he could never reſolve to grant him, whereat this barbarous Prince was highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. What then could he do in this caſe? The Seaſon paſſeth away. What ſhall become of him? What other reſolution can he take, but to do a deſperate Action? Behold a ſtrange undertaking, which may give a great Example of what Deſpair can do!</p>
                  <p>Although this King of <hi>Racan</hi> be an Heathen, yet there is in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſtore of <hi>Mahumetans</hi> mingled with the people, that are retired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or have been, for the moſt part, taken Slaves, here and there, by thoſe <hi>Franguis</hi> above-mention'd. <hi>Sultan Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> did under-hand gain theſe <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans;</hi> and with two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, whom he yet had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe that had follow'd him
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63063:100"/>
from <hi>Bengale,</hi> he reſolved, one day to fall unexpectedly upon the Houſe of this Barbarian, to kill all, and to make himſelf proclaim'd King of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> This was a very bold Enterpriſe, and ſuch a one, as had more of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperado</hi> in it, than of a prudent Man. Yet notwithſtanding, as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and by what I could learn from many <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that then were there preſent, the thing was feaſible enough. But the day before the ſtroke was to be given, the Deſign was diſcover'd; which did altogether overthrow the Affairs of <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> and was ſoon after the cauſe of his ruin. For not finding hereafter any way more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf, he attempted to flye towards <hi>Pegu;</hi> which was a thing in a manner impoſſible, by reaſon of the vaſt Mountains and Forreſts to be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Beſides, he was immediately purſued ſo cloſe, that he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the ſame day he fled. It may well be thought, that he defended himſelf with as much courage as was
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63063:100"/>
poſſible. He killed ſo many of thoſe Barbarians, that it will ſcarce be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but he was ſo overpow'red by the multitude of purſuers, that he was obliged to quit the Combat. <hi>Sultan Banque,</hi> who was not ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as his Father, defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo like a Lion; but at length, being all bloody of the wounds, by ſtones poured upon him from all ſides, he was ſeized on, and carried away, with his two little Brothers, his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Mother.</p>
                  <p>As to the Perſon of <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> himſelf, all what could be learnt of it, is this: That he, with one Woman, one Eunuch, and two other perſons, got up to the Top of the Mountain; that he received a wound in his Head by a ſtone, which ſtruck him down, but yet he roſe again, the Eunuch having wound his Head about with his Turbant, and that they eſcaped through the midſt of the Woods.</p>
                  <p>I have heard the Relation three or four other manner of ways, even by thoſe perſons that were upon the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63063:101"/>
place. Some did aſſure, that he had been found among the dead, but was not well known: And I have ſeen a Letter of the Chief of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, confirming this. So that 'tis difficult enough to know aright what is become of him. And this it is, which hath adminiſtred ground to thoſe ſo frequent Allarms, given us afterwards at <hi>Dehli:</hi> For at one time it was rumored, that he was arrived at <hi>Maſlipatan,</hi> to joyn with the Kings of <hi>Golkonda</hi> and <hi>Viſapour;</hi> another time it was related for certain, that he had paſſed in ſight of <hi>Suratte</hi> with two Ships, bearing the Red Colours, which the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> or the King of <hi>Siam</hi> had given him; by and by, that he was in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and had been ſeen in <hi>Chiras,</hi> and ſoon after in <hi>Kan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahar,</hi> ready to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Caboul</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> one day ſaid ſmiling, that <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> was at laſt become an <hi>Agy</hi> or Pilgrim. And at this very day there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of petſons who maintain, that he is in <hi>Perſia,</hi> returned from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:63063:101"/>
whence he is ſaid to have brought with him much Money. But that which confirms more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that there is no ground for any of theſe reports, is that Letter of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and that an Eunuch of his, with whom I travelled from <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi> to <hi>Maſlipatan,</hi> as alſo the Great Maſter of his Artillery, whom I ſaw in the Service of the King of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konda,</hi> have aſſured me, that he is no more in being, though they made diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to ſay any more concerning him; as alſo, that our <hi>French</hi> Merchants, that lately came out of <hi>Perſia</hi> and from <hi>Hiſpahan,</hi> when I was yet at <hi>Dehli,</hi> had in thoſe parts heard no news at all of him; beſides that, I have heard that a while after his Defeat, his Sword and Poynard had been found: So that 'tis credible, that if he was not killed upon the place, he ſoon dyed afterwards, and was the prey of ſome Robbers, or Tygers, or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, of which the Forreſts of that Countrey are full. However it be, after this laſt Action his whole Family
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63063:102"/>
was put in Priſon, Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, where they were treated rudely enough; yet ſome time after they were ſet at more liberty, and they received a milder entertainment: And then the King called for the eldeſt Daughter, whom he married.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt this was doing, ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>Sultan Banque,</hi> joyned with divers of thoſe Mahumetans which I have mentioned, went to plot ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſpiracy like the firſt. But the day appointed for it being come, one of the Conſpirators, being half drunk, began too ſoon to break out. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this alſo I have heard forty different relations, ſo that 'tis very hard to know the truth of it. That which is undoubted is this, that the King was at length ſo exaſperated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this unfortunate Family of <hi>Sujah,</hi> that he commanded it ſhould be quite rooted out. Neither did there remain any one of it, that was not put to death, ſave that Daughter which the King had made his Wife. <hi>Sultan Banque,</hi> and his Brothers, had
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63063:102"/>
their Heads cut off with blunt Axes; and the Women were mured up, where they dyed of hunger and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                  <p>And thus endeth this War, which the luſt of Reigning had kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe four Brothers, after it had laſted five or ſix years, from 1655, or thereabout, to 1660 or 1661; which left <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> in the peaceable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this puiſſant Empire.</p>

                  <p>THe War being ended, the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Usbec</hi> entertained thoughts of ſending Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi> They had ſeen him fight in their Countrey, when he was yet a young Prince; <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> having ſent him to command the Succours, which the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Samarkand</hi> had deſired of him againſt the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Balk.</hi> They had experienced his Conduct and Valour
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63063:106"/>
on many occaſions, and they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with themſelves, that he could not but remember the Affront they did him, when he was juſt taking <hi>Balk,</hi> the Capital Town of the Enemy: For the two <hi>Kans</hi> agreed together, and obliged him to retreat, alledging, that they apprehended he might render himſelf Maſter of their whole State, juſt as <hi>Ekbar</hi> had formerly done of the Kingdom of <hi>Kachimere.</hi> Beſides, they had certain intelligence of all he had done in <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> of his Battels, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and Advantages; whence they might ſufficiently eſtimate, that though <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was yet living, yet <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was Maſter, and the only Perſon that was to be owned King of the <hi>Indies.</hi> Whether then they feared his juſt reſentments, or whether it was, that their inbred avarice and ſordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made them hope for ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Preſent, the two <hi>Kans</hi> ſent to him their Ambaſſadors to offer him their Service, and to congratulate him upon the happy beginning of his Reign. <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſaw very well,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63063:106"/>
that the War being at an end, this offer was out of ſeaſon, and that it was nothing but fear or hope, as we ſaid, that had brought them. Yet for all this, he received them honourably; and, ſince I was preſent at their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, I can relate the particulars of it with certainty.</p>
                  <p>They made their reverence at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance from him, after the <hi>Indian</hi> cuſtom, putting thrice their hands upon their heads, and as often let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them down to the ground. Then they approached ſo near, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> himſelf might very well have taken their Letters immediately from their hands; but yet it was an <hi>Omrah</hi> that took and open'd them, and gave them to him. He forthwith read them with a very grave countenance; and afterwards commanded, there ſhould be given to each of them an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd Veſt, a Turbant, and a Girdle of Silk in Embroidery, which is that which they call <hi>Ser-apah,</hi> that is, an Habit from head to foot. After this, their Preſents were call'd for, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63063:107"/>
conſiſted in ſome Boxes of choice <hi>Lapis Lazulus,</hi> divers Camels with long hair, ſeveral gallant Horſes, ſome Camel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads of freſh Fruit, as Apples, Pears, Raiſins and Melons; (for 'tis chiefly <hi>Usbec</hi> that furniſhes theſe ſorts of Fruit, eaten at <hi>Dehli</hi> all the Winter long;) and in many loads of dry Fruit, as Prunes of <hi>Bokara,</hi> Aprecocks, Raiſins without any ſtones that appeared, and two other ſorts of Raiſins, black and white, very large and very good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was not wanting to declare, how much he was ſatisfied with the Generoſity of the <hi>Kans,</hi> and much commended the beauty and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Fruit, Horſes, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels; and after he had a little enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them of the ſtate of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy of <hi>Samarkand,</hi> and of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of their Countrey, abounding in ſo many rare and excellent things, he deſired them to go and repoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, intimating withall, that he ſhould be very glad to ſee them often.</p>
                  <p>They came away from their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience full of contentment and joy,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63063:107"/>
not being much troubled, that they had been obliged to make their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence after the <hi>Indian</hi> cuſtome, though it have ſomething of ſlaviſh in it; nor much reſenting it, that the King had not taken their Letters from their own hands. I believe if they had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to kiſs the ground, and even to do ſomething of a lower nature, they would have complied with it. 'Tis true, it would have been in vain, if they had deſired to make no other ſalute, but that of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to deliver to the King their Letters with their own hands; for that belongs only to the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Perſia,</hi> nor have theſe this favour granted them, but with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                  <p>They ſtay'd above four months at <hi>Dehli,</hi> what diligence ſoever they could uſe to be diſpatch'd, which did incommode them very much; for they fell almoſt all ſick, and even ſome of them dyed, becauſe they were not accuſtomed to ſuch heats as are in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan,</hi> or rather becauſe they were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63063:108"/>
ſordid, and kept a very ill Diet. I know not whether there be a more avaricious and uncleanly Nation than they are. They laid up the Money, which the King had appointed them for their maintenance, and lived a very miſerable life, altogether unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Ambaſſadors: Yet they were diſmiſſed with great honour: The King, in the preſence of all the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs,</hi> preſented each of them with two rich <hi>Ser-apahs,</hi> and gave order, that eight thouſand Rupies ſhould be carried to their Lodgings, which amounted to near two thouſand Crowns each. He alſo gave them, for Preſents to the <hi>Kans</hi> their Maſters, very handſom <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apahs,</hi> ſtore of the richeſt and beſt wrought Embroideries, a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of fine Cloth, and ſilk Stuffs, wrought with Gold and Silver, and ſome Tapeſtries, and two Poynards ſet about with precious ſtones.</p>
                  <p>During their ſtay, I went thrice to ſee them, being preſented to them as a Phyſitian by one of my Friends, that was Son of an <hi>Usbec,</hi> that had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63063:108"/>
made his Fortune in that Court. I had a deſign to have learned ſomething in particular of their Countrey, but I found them ſo ignorant, that they knew not ſo much as the Confines of their State, much leſs could they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me of any thing concerning the <hi>Tartars</hi> that have conquer'd <hi>China</hi> of late years: In ſhort, they told me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I knew not before. I had once the curioſity to Dine with them, which liberty I obtained eaſily enough. They are not Men of much ceremony; it was a very extraordinary Meal for ſuch a one as I, it being meer Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh; yet for all this I got my Dinner with them; there was a certain Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gou, which I thought paſſable: And I was obliged to expreſs a liking of ſo exquiſit a diſh, which they ſo much luſt after. During Dinner there was a ſtrange ſilence; they were very buſie in carrying in with their whole hands, for they know not what a Spoon is; but after that this Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh had wrought in their ſtomachs, they began to talk, and then they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63063:109"/>
would perſwade me, they were the moſt dextrous at Bows and Arrows, and the ſtrongeſt Men in the World. They call'd for Bows, which are much bigger than thoſe of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> and would lay a wager, to pierce an Oxe or my Horſe through and through. Then they proceeded to commend the ſtrength and valour of their Women, which they deſcribed to me quite otherwiſe than the <hi>Amazons;</hi> telling me very wonderful ſtories of them, eſpecially one, which would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable indeed, if I could relate it with a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Eloquence, as they did: They told me, that at the time when <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> made War in their Countrey, a Party of Twenty five or Thirty <hi>Indian</hi> Horſemen came to fall upon a ſmall Village; whilſt they plundred, and tyed all thoſe whom they met with to make them Slaves, an old Woman ſaid to them: Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, be not ſo miſchievous, my Daughter is not far off, ſhe will be here very ſhortly, retreat if you be wiſe, you are undone if ſhe light upon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63063:109"/>
you. They laughed at the old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and her advice, and continued to load, to tye, and to carry away her ſelf; but they were not gone half a Mile, but this old Woman, looking often backward, made a great out-cry of joy, perceiving her Daughter coming after her on Horſe-back; and preſently this generous She-<hi>Tartar,</hi> mounted on a furious Horſe, her Bow and Arrows hanging at her ſide, called to them at a diſtance, that ſhe was yet willing to give them their Lives, if they would carry back to the Village all they had taken, and then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw without any noiſe. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of this young Woman affected them as little as that of her old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but they were ſoon aſtoniſh'd, when they found her let fly at them in a moment three or four great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, which ſtruck as many of their Men to the ground, which forced them to fall to their Quivers alſo. But ſhe kept her ſelf at that diſtance from them, that none of them could reach her. She laughed at all their effort, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63063:110"/>
at all their Arrows, knowing how to attack them at the length of her Bow, and to take her meaſure from the ſtrength of her Arm, which was of another temper than theirs: So that after ſhe had killed half of them with her Arrows, and put them into diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhe came and fell upon the reſt with the Zable in her hand, and cut them all in pieces.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſadors of <hi>Tartary</hi> were not yet gone away from <hi>Dehli,</hi> when <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> fell exceeding ſick; a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and continued Fever made him ſometimes loſe his underſtanding: His tongue was ſeized with ſuch a Palſie, that he loſt almoſt his ſpeech, and the Phyſitians deſpaired of his recovery; nothing was heard for the time, than that he was gone, and that his Siſter <hi>Rauchenara-Begum</hi> concealed his death out of deſign. It was already bruited, that the <hi>Raja Jeſſomſeigne,</hi> Governour of <hi>Guzaratte,</hi> was on the way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver <hi>Chah-Jehan;</hi> that <hi>Mohabet-Kan</hi> (who had at length obeyed the Orders of <hi>Aureng-Zebe)</hi> quitting the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63063:110"/>
of <hi>Caboul,</hi> and being already on this ſide <hi>Lahor</hi> to come back, made haſt alſo with three or four thouſand Horſe for the ſame end; and that the Eunuch <hi>Etbar-kan,</hi> who kept <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> in the Fortreſs of <hi>Agra,</hi> would have the honour of his delivery. On one ſide we ſee <hi>Sultan Mazum</hi> beſtir himſelf exceedingly with bribes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring by promiſes to aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> ſo far as that one night he went diſguized to the Raja <hi>Jeſſeigne,</hi> entreating him with expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of deep reſpect, that he would engage himſelf for his intereſt.</p>
                  <p>We knew from other hands, that <hi>Rauchenara-Begum,</hi> together with <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-kan,</hi> the Great Maſter of Artillery, and many <hi>Omrahs,</hi> declared for the young Prince <hi>Sultan Ekbar,</hi> the third Son of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> though he was but ſeven or eight years old; both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the mean time pretending, they had no other deſign than to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Chah-Jehan:</hi> So that the people believed, that now he was going to be ſet at liberty, though none of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63063:111"/>
Grandees had any ſuch thing in their thoughts, ſpreading this rumour only to gain credit and concourſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they feared, leaſt by the means of <hi>Etbar-kan,</hi> or ſome other ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, he ſhould one day appear in the Field. And indeed of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there was not one that had reaſon to wiſh for his liberty and reſtoration to the Throne, except <hi>Jeſſomſeigne, Mohabet-kan,</hi> and ſome others, that as yet had done no great matter to his diſadvantage. The reſt had been all againſt him, at leaſt they had vilely abandon'd him. They knew very well he would be like an unchain'd Lyon, if he came abroad: Who then could truſt him? And what could <hi>Etbar-kan</hi> hope for, who had kept him up ſo cloſe? I know not, if by ſome adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or other, he ſhould have come out of priſon, whether he would not have ſtood ſingle, and been alone of his party.</p>
                  <p>But though <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was very ſick, yet for all this he gave order for all things, and particularly for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63063:111"/>
ſure cuſtody of <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> his Father; and though he had adviſed <hi>Sultan Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zum</hi> to go and open the Gates to <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> in caſe he ſhould die, yet he omitted not to have <hi>Etbar-kan</hi> inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly writ to. And the fifth day, in the height of his ſickneſs, he cauſed himſelf to be carried into the Aſſembly of the <hi>Omrahs</hi> to ſhew himſelf, and to diſabuſe thoſe who might believe him to be dead, and to obviate popular tumults, or ſuch accident as might have cauſed <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> to be ſet at liberty. The ſeventh, ninth, and tenth day, he made himſelf to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried again into the ſaid Aſſembly for the ſame reaſon; and, what is almoſt incredible, the thirteenth, after he had recollected himſelf from a fit of ſwounding, which accaſioned a rumor through the whole Town of his being dead, he called for two or three of the greateſt <hi>Omrahs,</hi> and the Raja <hi>Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne,</hi> to let them ſee that he was alive; made himſelf to be raiſed in his bed, called for Ink and Paper to write to <hi>Etbar-kan,</hi> and ſent for the Great Seal;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63063:112"/>
which he had truſted with <hi>Rauchenara-Bagum,</hi> and commonly encloſed in a ſmall bag, ſealed with a Seal he always wore about his arm, fearing leſt ſhe had already made uſe of it for her deſigns. I was nigh my <hi>Agah,</hi> when all this news was told him, and I underſtood, that lifting up his hands to Heaven he ſaid, What a Soul is this? A matchleſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and courage of ſpirit! God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thee <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> for greater things; certainly he will not that thou ſhouldeſt yet die. And indeed after this fit he recover'd by little and little.</p>
                  <p>He had no ſooner recover'd his health, but he ſought to get out of the hands of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> and <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Dara,</hi> to ſecure the marriage of <hi>Sultan-Ekbar,</hi> his third Son, with this Princeſs; on purpoſe thereby to gain him Authority, and to give him the greater right to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; For he it is, who is thought to be by him deſigned for it. He is yet very young, but he hath many near and powerful Relations at the Court, and is born of the Daughter of <hi>Chah-Navaze-kan,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63063:112"/>
and conſequently of the Bloud of the Antient Soveraigns of <hi>Machate;</hi> whereas <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> and <hi>Sultan Mazum</hi> are only Sons of <hi>Ragipontnis,</hi> or Daughters of Raja's. Theſe Kings, though Mahumetans, do, for all that, marry of the Daughters of the Heathen, either for State-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or for extraordinary Beauty. But <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> was diſappointed in this deſign; It will hardly be believed, with what height and fierceneſs of ſpirit <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> and <hi>Begum</hi> rejected the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and the Young Princeſs her ſelf, who in the fear of being carried away, was for ſome days deſperate, and proteſted ſhe would rather kill her ſelf an hundred times over, if it were poſſible, than to marry the Son of him that had murthered her Father.</p>
                  <p>He had no better ſatisfaction from <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> about certain Jewels which he asked of him, in order to finiſh a piece of work which he cauſed to be added to a famous Throne, which is ſo highly eſteemed. For he fiercely anſwer'd, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſhould take
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63063:113"/>
no other care but to rule better then he did; that he ſhould let his Throne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; that he was weary to hear of theſe Jewels, and that the Hammers were ready to beat them to duſt the firſt time he ſhould be importun'd again about them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> would not be the laſt in doing reverence to <hi>Aureng-Zebe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> they had thoughts of ſending an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to him. They pitched upon Monſieur <hi>Adrican,</hi> the Commander of their Factory at <hi>Suratte;</hi> and being a right honeſt man, and of good ſenſe and judgment, not neglecting to take the counſel of his friends, he well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf of this employment. <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> though he carries it very high, and affects to appear a zealous Mahumetan, and conſequently to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the <hi>Franguis</hi> or Chriſtians, yet thought fit to receive them with much reſpect and civility. He even was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous, that this Ambaſſador ſhould complement him in the mode of the <hi>Franguis,</hi> after he had been made to do it the <hi>Indian</hi> way. 'Tis true, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63063:113"/>
his Letters by the hand of an <hi>Omrah;</hi> but <hi>that</hi> was not to be taken for any contempt, he having ſhew'd no more honour to the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Usbec.</hi> After this, he intimated to him, that he might produce his Preſent; and at the ſame time he cauſed him, and ſome of his Train, to be dreſſed with a <hi>Ser-Apah</hi> embroider'd. The Preſent <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oſiſted of ſtore of very fine Scarlet, ſome large Looking-glaſſes, and divers excellent pieces of Chineſe and Japoneſe work, among which there was a <hi>Paleky,</hi> and a <hi>Tackravan,</hi> or a Field-Throne of admirable work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip.</p>
                  <p>This Ambaſſadour was not ſo ſoon diſpatch't as he wiſh'd, it being the cuſtom of the Kings of <hi>Mogol</hi> to detain Ambaſſodours as long as they well can, from a belief they have, that 'tis the intereſt of their Greatneſs, to oblige Strangers to give long attendance at their Court; yet he was not kept ſo long as the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Usbec.</hi> Mean time he had the misfortune, that his Secretary died there, and the reſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63063:114"/>
of his Retinue began to grow ſick. When the King diſmiſſed him, he gave him ſuch another <hi>Ser-Apah</hi> embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, as the firſt was for himſelf; and another, a very rich one, for the General of <hi>Batavia,</hi> together with a Poynard, ſet about with Jewels, all accompanied with a very obliging Letter.</p>
                  <p>The chief aim of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in this Embaſſy was, to make themſelves immediately known to the King, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to gain credit, and to intimidate the Governours of the Sea-ports, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, where they have their Factories; that ſo they may not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, when they pleaſe, to inſult over them, or to trouble them in their Trade; thereby letting them know, that they had to do with a potent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that hath a door open to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves, and to complain immediately to the King. Their end alſo was, to make it appear, what intereſt the King had in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and therefore they ſhew'd long Rolls of Commodities, bought up by them through the whole Kingdom,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63063:114"/>
and Liſts of conſiderable ſums of Gold and Silver, every year brought thither by them; but ſaying not a word of thoſe which they draw thence, from the Copper, Lead, Cinamon, Cloves, Muſcadin, Pepper, Wood of Aloes, Elephants, and other Commodities which they vend there.</p>
                  <p>About this time, one of the moſt conſiderable <hi>Omrah</hi>'s of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> addreſſed himſelf to him, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that this multitude and variety of perplexing affairs, and this perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual attention of mind in him, might ſoon cauſe a great alteration in his temper, and a dangerous inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his health. But <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> ſeeming to take almoſt no notice of what that <hi>Omrah</hi> ſaid, turn'd himſelf another way, and approaching to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the prime <hi>Omrah</hi>'s of the Court, a perſon of great knowledge and judgment, ſpoke to him in this purpoſe (as I was informed by the Son of this Lord, who was my friend.)</p>
                  <p>You other Sages, are you not all of the mind, that there are times and conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63063:115"/>
ſo urgent, that a King ought to hazard his life for his Subjects, and ſacrifice him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for their Defence with Arms in his hands? And yet this Effeminate Man would diſſwade me from taking pains, and dehort me from watching and ſollicitude for the Publick; and carry me by pretences of Health, to the thoughts of an eaſie life, by abandoning the Government of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the management of affairs, to ſome Viſir or other. Doth he not know, that Providence having given me a Royal Extraction, and raiſed me to the Crown of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> hath not made me for my ſelf alone, but for the good and ſafety of the Publick, and for the procurement of tranquility and happineſs to my Subjects, as far as that nay be obtained by Juſtice and Power? He ſeeth not the conſequence of his Counſels, and what miſchiefs do attend Viſirſhips. Doth he think it to be without reaſon what out Grand <hi>Sady</hi> hath ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly pronounced; O Kings, ceaſe, ceaſe to be Kings, or govern your Kingdoms your ſelves? Go tell thy Country-man, that I ſhall well like of the care he is conſtantly to take of the faithful diſcharge of his Place;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63063:115"/>
but adviſe him alſo, not any more to run out himſelf ſo far as he hath done. We have <hi>natural</hi> inclination enough to a long, eaſie, and careleſs life, and there need no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors to ſhake off buſineſs and trouble. Our Wives, that lye in our boſom, do too often, beſides our own genius, incline us that way.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time there happen'd an accident, that made a great noiſe at <hi>Dehli,</hi> eſpecially in the Seraglio, and diſabuſed a great many, that could as hardly believe as my ſelf, that Eunuchs, though they had their Genitals quite cut away, could become amorous as other men. <hi>Didar-kan,</hi> one of the chief Eunuchs of the Seraglio, who had built an houſe, where he came often to divert himſelf, fell in love with a very beautiful Woman, the Siſter of a Neighbour of his, that was an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Scrivener.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Amours laſted a good while before any body blamed them, ſince it was but an Eunuch that made them, which ſort of men have the priviledge to go where they pleaſe; but the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63063:116"/>
familiarity grew ſo great, and ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary betwixt the two Lovers, that the Neighbours began to ſuſpect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and to rally the Scrivener, which did ſo touch him, that he threatned both his Siſters and the Eunuch to kill them if they ſhould continue their commerce. And ſoon after, finding them in the night lying together, he ſtabbed the Eunuch out-right, and left his Siſter for dead. The whole Seraglio, Women and Eunuchs, made a league together againſt him to make him away; but <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> diſſipated all theſe machinations, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have him turn Mahumetan. Mean time 'tis thought, he cannot long avoid the malice and power of the Eunuchs; for 'tis not, as is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying, with Men as with Bruits; theſe latter become gentler and more tractable when they are caſtrated; but men more vicious, and commonly very inſolent, though ſometimes it turneth to an admirable fidelity and gallantry.</p>
                  <p>It was alſo about the ſame time, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63063:116"/>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was ſomewhat diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with <hi>Rauchenara-Begum,</hi> becauſe ſhe was ſuſpected to have given acceſs to two Young Gallants into the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, who were diſcover'd and brought before <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi> Yet this being but a ſuſpicion, he expreſſed to her no great reſentment of it; nor did he make uſe of ſo great rigour and cruelty againſt thoſe poor men, as <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> had done againſt the perſon above ſpoken of. The matter was related to me by an old Portugueſe Woman (that had a long while been ſlave to the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, and went out and in at pleaſure) as followeth: She told me that <hi>Rauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nara-Begum,</hi> after ſhe had drawn from a young man, hidden by her, all his abillty, deliver'd him to ſome Women to convey him away in the night tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſome Gardens, and ſo to ſave him: But whether they were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, or whether they feared they ſhould be ſo, or what elſe might be the cauſe, they fled, and left him there wandring in the midſt of thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, not knowing which way to get
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63063:117"/>
out: And being at laſt met with, and brought before <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined him ſtrictly, but could draw nothing elſe from him, than that he was come in over the walls, he was commanded to get out the ſame way by which he entred: But it ſeems, the Eunuchs did more than <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had given order for, for they caſt him down from the top of the walls to the bottom. As for the other Young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, this ſame Woman aſſured me, that he was found wandring in the Garden like the firſt, and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he was come in by the Gate, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> commanded likewiſe, that he alſo ſhould paſs away again by the ſame Gate; yet reſerving to himſelf a ſevere chaſtiſement for the Eunuchs, ſince not only the honour of the Royal Houſe, but alſo the ſafety of the Kings perſon is herein concerned.</p>
                  <p>Some months after, there arrived at <hi>Dehli</hi> ſeveral Ambaſſadours, almoſt at the ſame time. The firſt was Xerif of <hi>Meccha,</hi> whoſe Preſent did conſiſt in ſome Arabian Horſes: The ſecond
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63063:117"/>
and third Ambaſſador were, he of the King of <hi>Hyeman,</hi> or <hi>Happy Arabia,</hi> and he of the Prince of <hi>Baſſora,</hi> who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſented Arabian horſes. The two remaining Ambaſſadors were ſent from the King of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> To the three firſt no great regard was given; they appear'd in ſo miſerable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed an Equipage, that it was percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they came only to get ſome money by the means of their Preſent, and of the many Horſes and other Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, which under the pretence of Ambaſſadors, entred without paying any duty into the Kingdom, there to be ſold, and to buy for the money a quantity of Indian Stuffs, and ſo to return without paying likewiſe any Impoſt at all.</p>
                  <p>But as to the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Embaſſy, that deſerves to be otherwiſe taken notice of; the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the news of the Revolution of the <hi>Indies,</hi> had a deſign to ſpread his Name in thoſe parts, and there to make known his Grandeur and Magnificence by a ſplendid Embaſſy; or, as malice will
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63063:118"/>
have it, or rather as the very truth is, to reap ſome advantage by a preſent as well as the reſt. Behold therefore this great Embaſſy! He choſe for his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors two perſons, that one would think were the moſt conſiderable in his Court, and the moſt capable to make ſuch a deſign proſper. And who were they? the <hi>one</hi> was a Mahumetan Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, whom I had ſeen ſome years ago at <hi>Moka,</hi> when I paſſed there coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> over the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> where he was to ſell ſome Slaves for that Prince, and to buy of the money, raiſed thence, ſome Indian Commodities. And this is the fine Trade of that Great <hi>Christian</hi> King of <hi>Africa.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> was a Chriſtian Merchant of <hi>Armenia,</hi> born and married in <hi>Aleppo,</hi> known in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> by the name of <hi>Murat.</hi> I had ſeen him alſo at <hi>Moka,</hi> where he had accomodated me with the half of his Chamber, and aſſiſted me with very good advice, whereof I have ſpoken in the beginning of this Hiſtory, as a thing taking me off from paſſing into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> according to my firſt deſign.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63063:118"/>
He alſo came every year to that place, in that Kings Name, for the ſame end that the Mahumetan did, and brought the Preſent which the King made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year, to the Gentlemen of the Engliſh and Dutch Company of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and carried away theirs. Now the King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ſutably to his deſign, and the deſire he had of making his Ambaſſadors appear with great ſplendour, put himſelf to great expences for this Embaſſie: He gave them thirty two young Slaves, of both Sexes, to ſell them at <hi>Moka,</hi> and thence to make a ſum of Money to bear their Charges. A wonderful largeſs! Slaves are commonly ſold there for twenty five or thirty Crowns a piece, one with another. A conſiderable ſum. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he gave them for a Preſent to the <hi>Great Mogol</hi> five and twenty choice Slaves, among which there were nine or ten very young, proper to make Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs of. A very worthy Preſent for a King, and he a Chriſtian, to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan Prince! It ſeems the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> is very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63063:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from ours. He added to that Preſent, twelve Horſes, eſteem'd as much as thoſe of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and a kind of little Mule, of which I ſaw the Skin, which was a very great Rarity, there being no Tyger ſo handſomely ſpeck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor Silken Stuff of <hi>India</hi> ſo finely, ſo variouſly, and ſo orderly ſtreaked, as that was. Moreover, there were for a part of the Preſent, two Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants Teeth, ſo prodigious, that they aſſured it was all that a very able-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died man could do to lift up one of them from the ground. Laſtly, an Horn of an Oxe full of Civett, and ſo big, that the aperture of it being meaſur'd by me, when it came to <hi>Deh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> it had a Diameter of half a Foot, and ſomewhat better. All things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus prepared, the Ambaſſadors depart from <hi>Gondez,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ſituated in the Province of <hi>Dambea,</hi> and came through a very troubleſome Countrey to <hi>Beiloul,</hi> which is a diſpeopled Sea-Port over againſt <hi>Moka,</hi> nigh to <hi>Babel-mandel,</hi> not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to come (for reaſons elſwhere to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63063:119"/>
be alledged) the ordinary way of the <hi>Caravans,</hi> which is made with eaſe in forty dayes to <hi>Arkiko,</hi> and thence to paſs to the Iſle of <hi>Maſoua.</hi> During their stay at <hi>Beiloul,</hi> and expecting a Bark of <hi>Moka,</hi> to waft over the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> there died ſome of their Slaves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Veſſel tarried, and they found not in that place thoſe refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were neceſſary for them. When they came to <hi>Moka,</hi> they ſoon ſold their Merchandiſe to raiſe a ſtock of Money according to order, But they had this ill luck, that that year the Slaves were very cheap; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Market was glutted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Merchants; yet they raiſed a ſum to purſue their Voyage: They embark'd upon an Indian Veſſel to paſs to <hi>Suratte:</hi> Their paſſage was pretty good; they were not above five and twenty daies at Sea; but whether it was that they had made no good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, for want of ſtock, or what elſe the cauſe might be, many of their Slaves and Horſes, as alſo the Mule, whereof they ſaved the Skin, died.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63063:120"/>
They were no ſooner arrived at <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratte,</hi> but a certain Rebel of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> called <hi>Seva-Gi,</hi> came and ranſcked and burned the Town, and in it their houſe, ſo that they could ſave nothing but their Letters, ſome Slaves that were ſick, or which <hi>Seva-Gi</hi> could not light on, their <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Habits which he cared not for, and the Mules Skin, and the Oxes Horn, which was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy emptied of the Civett. They did very much exaggerate their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; but thoſe malicious <hi>Indians</hi> that had ſeen them arrive in ſuch a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition, without proviſions, without habits, without money, or Bills of Exchange, ſaid, that they were very happy, and ſhould reckon the Plunder of <hi>Suratte</hi> for a piece of their beſt Fortune, foraſmuch as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va-Gi</hi> had ſaved them the labour of bringing their miſerable Preſent to <hi>Dehli,</hi> and had furniſht them with a very ſpecious pretence for their beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly condition, and for the ſale they had made of their Civet and of ſome of their Slaves, and for demanding of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63063:120"/>
the Governour of <hi>Suratte</hi> proviſions for their ſubſiſtance; as alſo ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Chariots to continue their voyage to <hi>Dehli.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Adrican,</hi> chief of the Dutch Factory, my friend, had given to the Armenian <hi>Murat</hi> a Letter of recommendation to me, which he deliver'd himſelf at <hi>Dehli,</hi> not remembring that I had been his Hoſt at <hi>Moka.</hi> It was a very pleaſant meeting when we came to know one another, after the ſpace of five or ſix years. I embraced him affectionately, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him that I would ſerve him in whatever I could; but that, though I had acquaintance at the Court, it was impoſſible for me to do them any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable good office there: For ſince they had not brought with them any valuable Preſent, but only the Mules Skin, and the empty Oxes Horn, and that they were ſeen going upon the ſtreets without any Paleky or Horſes, ſave that of our Father Miſſionary, and mine (which they had almoſt killed) cloathed like Beggars, and followed with ſeven or eight Slaves, bare-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63063:121"/>
and bare-foot, having nothing but an ugly Sharſe tyed between their Legs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a ragged Cloth over their left Shoulder, paſſing under their left Arm like a Summer-Cloak; ſince, I ſaid, they were in ſuch a poſture, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I could ſay for them was inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; they were taken for Beggars, and no body took other notice of them. Yet notwithſtanding I ſaid ſo much of the Grandeur of their King to my <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gah Danechmendkan,</hi> who had cauſe to hearken to me, as managing all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign affairs there, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> gave them Audience, received their Letters, preſented them each with an embroider'd Veſt, a ſilken embroider'd Girdle, and a Turbant of the ſame, gave order for their entertainment, and diſpatched them in a little time, and that with more honour than there was ground to expect: For in diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, he preſented them each with an other ſuch Veſt, and with 6000 Rupies for them all, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth to about 3000 Crowns, of which the Mahumetan had four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63063:121"/>
and <hi>Murat,</hi> becauſe a Chriſtian, but two thouſand. He alſo gave them for a Preſent to their Maſter a very rich <hi>Ser-apah</hi> or Veſt, two great ſilver and guilt Trumpets, two ſilver Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, a Poynard cover'd with Jewels, and the value of about twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Francs in Golden and Silver Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, to let their King ſee Money coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as a Rarity he had not in his Countrey: But <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> knew very well that theſe Rupies would not go out of the Kingdom, and that they were like to buy commodities for them: And it fell out ſo; for they laid them out, partly in fine Cotton Cloth, to make ſhirts of for their King, Queen, and their only lawful Son that is to be the Succeſſor; partly in filken ſtuffs ſtreaked with Gold or Silver, to make Veſts and Summer-Drawers of; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Engliſh Scarlet, to make two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian Veſts of for their King alſo; and laſtly, in Spices, and in ſtore of courſer Cloth, for divers Ladies of his Seraglio, and for the children he had by them; all without paying any duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:63063:122"/>
For all my friendſhip with <hi>Murat,</hi> there were three things that made me almoſt repent to have ſerved them. The <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>Murat</hi> having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me to leave with me for 50 Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, a little Son of his, that was very pretty, of a delicate Black, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a ſwelled Noſe, or ſuch thick Lips as commonly the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> have, broke his word with me, and let me know, that he ſhould take no leſs for him than 300 Rupies. For all this, I had thoughts of Buying him, for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities ſake, and that I might ſay, a Father had ſold me his Son. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> becauſe I found, that <hi>Murat,</hi> as well as the <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> had obliged themſelves to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> that they would employ their intereſt with their King, that he might permit in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to rebuild an old <hi>Moſquee</hi> ruined in the time of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and which had been Built for a Tomb of a great <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vich,</hi> which went from <hi>Mecha</hi> into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> for the propagation of <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metaniſm,</hi> and there made great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. They received of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:63063:122"/>

This <hi>Moſquee</hi> had been pulled down by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> when they came with their ſuccors into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> which the then King, who turn'd Catholick, had asked of them againſt a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Prince, Invading his Kingdom. The third, becauſe they deſired <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> in the name of their King, to give them an <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and eight other Books, which I well remember, were of the moſt reputed in the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion: Which proceeding ſeemed to me very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Embaſſadour, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King, and confirmed to me what I had been told at <hi>Moka,</hi> that the <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> muſt needs be ſome odd thing; that it ſavours much of <hi>Mahumetaniſme,</hi> and that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans</hi> increaſe exceedingly in that Empire, eſpecially ſince the <hi>Portugals,</hi> that came in there for the reaſon late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed, were either killed, upon the death of the King, by the Cabal of the Queen Mother, or expelled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with the Patriarch Jeſuite,

whom they had brought along from <hi>Goa.</hi>

                  <p>During the time that the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors were at <hi>Dehli,</hi> my <hi>Agah,</hi> who is more than ordinary curious, made them often come to him, when I was preſent, to inform himſelf of the State and Government of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and principally to learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ſource of the <hi>Nile,</hi> which they call <hi>Ababile,</hi> of which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed to us as a thing ſo well known, that no body doubted of it. <hi>Murat</hi> himſelf, and a <hi>Mogol,</hi> who was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with him, had been there, and told us very near the ſame particulars with thoſe I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of it at <hi>Moka; viz.</hi> That the <hi>Nile</hi> had its Origine in the Country of <hi>Agaus;</hi> that it iſſued out of the Earth by two Springs bubling up, near to one another, which did form a little Lake of about thirty or forty paces long; that coming out of this Lake, it did make a conſiderable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: and that from ſpace to ſpace it received ſmall Rivers increaſing it.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63063:123"/>
They added, that it went on circling, and making as 'twere a great Iſle; and that afterwards it tumbled down from ſteep Rocks into a great Lake, in which there were divers fruitfuls Iſles, ſtore of Crocodiles, and (which would be remarkable enough, if true) abundance of Sea-calves, that have no other vent for their Excrements than that, by which they take in their food; this Lake being in the Country of <hi>Dambea,</hi> three ſmall daies journey from <hi>Gondar,</hi> and four or five dayes journey from the ſource of the <hi>Nile:</hi> And laſtly, that this River did break out of this Lake, being augmented with many River-waters, and with ſeveral Torrents falling into it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Rainy Seaſon (which do regularly begin there, as in the <hi>Indies</hi> about <hi>July,</hi> which is very conſiderable and convincing for the inundation of the <hi>Nile)</hi> and ſo runs away through <hi>Sonnar,</hi> the capital City of the King of <hi>Fungi,</hi> Tributary to the King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and from thence paſſeth to the Plains of <hi>Meſre,</hi> which is <hi>Egypt.</hi>

The Ambaſſadors were not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſay more than was liked on the ſubject of their Kings Greatneſs, and of the ſtrength of his Army; but the <hi>Mogolian</hi> did not over-much agree with them in it; and in their abſence repreſented to us this Army, which he had ſeen twice in the field, with the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> King on the head of it, as the moſt wretched thing in the World.</p>
                  <p>They alſo related to us divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of that Country, which I have put in my Journal, one day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to be digeſted and copied: In the mean time I ſhall inſert here three or four things which <hi>Murat</hi> told me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I eſteem them very extravagant for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Kingdom. He ſaid then, that there were few men in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> who beſides their lawful Wife, had not many others, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf owned that he had two, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reckoning her which he had left at <hi>Aleppo:</hi> That the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Women did not ſo hide themſelves, as they do in the <hi>Indies</hi> among the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:63063:125"/>
nor even as among the <hi>Gentils: That</hi> thoſe of the meaner ſort of People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Maids or Married Women, Slaves or Free, were often together pell-mell, night and day, in the ſame Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without thoſe jealouſies ſo common in other Countries: That the Women of Lords did not ſtick much to go into the Houſe of a ſimple Cavalier, whom they knew to be a man of Execution: <hi>That</hi> if I had gone into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> they would ſoon have obliged me to Marry, as they had done, a few years ſince, to a certain <hi>European,</hi> who named himſelf a <hi>Greek</hi> Phyſician: <hi>That</hi> an ancient man, of about fourſcore years of age, did one day preſent to the King fourſcore Sons, all of age, and able to bear Arms; and that the King asked him, Whether he had no more but them? To whom having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, No, but only ſome Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the King ſent him away with this reproach; Begone, thou Calf, and be aſhamed for having no more Children at that age, as if Women were wanting in my Dominions!
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63063:126"/>
                     <hi>That</hi> the King himſelf had at leaſt four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Sons and Daughters running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout pell-mell in the Seraglio, for whom he had cauſed to be made a number of round verniſhed ſticks, made like a little maze; thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being fond of having that in their hand like a Scepter, diſtinguiſhing them from thoſe that were Children of Slaves, or from others living in that place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſent alſo twice for theſe Ambaſſadors, for the ſame reaſon that my <hi>Agah</hi> did, and eſpecially to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the ſtate of <hi>Mahumetaniſns</hi> in that Country. He had alſo the curioſity of Viewing the skin of the Mule, which remained, I know not how, in the Fortreſs amongſt the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; which was to me a great mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, becauſe they had deſigned it for me for the good ſervices I had done them. I made account to have one day preſented it to ſome very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon in <hi>Europe.</hi> I urged often, that together with the Mules skin, they ſhould carry the great Horn to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:63063:126"/>
to ſhew it him; but they fear'd, leaſt he ſhould make a queſtion, which would have perplexed them; <hi>viz.</hi> how it came to paſs, that they had ſaved the Horn from the plunder of <hi>Suratte,</hi> and loſt the Civet?</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe Ambaſſadors of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> were at <hi>Dehli,</hi> it came to paſs that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> called together his Privy Councel, and the moſt learn'd perſons of his Court, to chuſe a new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for his third Son, <hi>Sultan Eck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> whom he deſign'd for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. In this Councel he ſhew'd the paſſion he hath to have this young Prince well Educated, and to make him a great Man. <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> is not ignorant of what importance it is, and how much 'tis to be wiſhed, that as much as Kings ſurmount others in greatneſs, they may alſo exceed them in Virtue and Knowledge. He alſo well knows, that one of the principal ſources of the Miſery, of the miſ-Goverment, of the un-Peopling, and the decay of the Empires of <hi>Aſia</hi> proceeds from thence,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63063:127"/>
that the children of the Kings thereof are brought up only by Women and Eunuchs, which often are no other than wrecthed Slaves of <hi>Ruſſia, Circaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Mingrelia, Gurgiſtan</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> mean and ſervile, ignorant and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſouls. Theſe Prince become Kings, when they are of age, without being inſtructed, and without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what 'tis to be a King; amazed when they begin to come abroad out of the Seraglio, as perſons coming out of another World, or let out of ſome ſubterraneous Cave, where they had lived all their life time; wondring at every thing they meet, like ſo many Innocents; believing all, and fearing all, like Children, or nothing at all, as if they were ſtupid: And all this, according to their Nature, and ſutable to the firſt Images imprinted upon them; commonly high and proud, and ſeemingly grave, but of that kind of pride and gravity, which is ſo flat and diſtaſteful, and ſo unbecoming them, that one may plainly ſee, 'tis noehing but brutality or barbarouſneſs,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63063:127"/>
and the effect of ſome ill-ſtudied and ill-digeſted Documents; or elſe they fall into ſome childiſh civilities, yet more unſavoury; or into ſuch cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as are blind and brutal; or into that mean and groſs vice of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or into an exceſſive and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unreaſonable Luxury, either rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their bodies and underſtandings with their Concubines, or altogether abandoning themſelves to the pleaſures of Hunting, like ſome carniverous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, preferring a pack of Dogs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the life of ſo many poor people, whom they force to follow them in the purſuit of their Game, and ſuffer to periſh of hunger, heat, cold, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. In a word, they alwayes run into ſome extreme or other, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether irrational and extravagant, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are carried by their natural temper, or by the firſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are given them; thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, almoſt all, in a ſtrange ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of what concerns the ſtate of the Kingdom; the reins of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being abandoned to ſome
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63063:128"/>
Viſir, who entertains them in their ignorance and in their paſſions, which are the two ſtrongeſt ſupports he can have to rule alwayes according to his own mind, with moſt aſſurance, and the leaſt contradiction; and given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alſo to thoſe Slaves their Mothers, and to their Eunuchs, who often know nothing but to continue plots of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, whereby they ſtrangle and baniſh one another, and ſometimes the Viſirs, and even the Grand Signors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo that no man whatſoever, that hath any Eſtate, can be in ſafety of his life.</p>
                  <p>But to return; after all theſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, which we have ſpoken of, there came at laſt news, that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>Perſia</hi> was upon the fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Omrah's, that are at the ſervice of the <hi>Mogol,</hi> ſpred a rumor that he came for affairs of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; though intelligent perſons much doubted of a Commiſſion of that nature, conſidering that the time of great conjunctures was paſſed, and that thoſe <hi>Omrahs,</hi> and the other <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:63063:128"/>
did what they did, rather to make a ſhow, than for any thing elſe. Mean time, on the day of the Entry, this Ambaſſador was received with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible reſpect: The <hi>Bazars,</hi> through which he paſſed, were all new-paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Cavalry attending on the way for above the length of a whole League. Many <hi>Omrah's</hi> accompanied him with Muſick, Tymbals and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and when he entred into the Fortreſs, or the Palace of the King, the Guns went off. <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with much civility, and was content he ſhould make his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to him after the <hi>Perſian</hi> mode, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving alſo, without any ſcruple, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> from his hands the Letters of his King; which, out of reſpect, he lifted up even to his head, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards read them with a grave and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious countenance: Which done, he cauſed an embroider'd Veſt to be brought, together with a rich. Turbant and Girdle, commanding it to be put on him in his preſence. A little after, it was intimated to him, that he might
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63063:129"/>
order his Preſent to be brought in, which conſiſted of five and twenty as handſome Horſes as ever I ſaw, led, and cover'd with embroider'd trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings; and of twenty very ſtately and luſty Camels, as big as Elephants: Moreover, of a good number of Boxes, ſaid to be full of moſt excellent Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water; and of a certain diſtilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, very precious, and eſteemed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cordial; beſides, there were diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five or ſix very rich and very large Tapiſſeries, and ſome embroider'd pieces exceeding Noble, wrought in ſmall flowers, ſo fine and delicate, that I know not whether in all <hi>Europe</hi> any ſuch can be met with. To all this were added four Damaskin'd Swords, with as many Poynards, all cover'd with Jewels; as alſo five or ſix Harnaſſes of Horſes, which were much eſteem'd, being alſo very fine and rich, the ſtuff being raiſed with rich Embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſet with ſmall Pearls, and very fair Turcoiſes of the old Rock.</p>
                  <p>It was obſerv'd, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> beheld this Preſent very attentively;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63063:129"/>
that he admired the beanty and rarity of every piece, and that ſeveral times he extolled the Generoſity of the King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> aſſigning to the Ambaſſador a place among his chief <hi>Omrahs.</hi> And after he had entertained him a while with a diſcourſe about the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies and hardſhips of his Voyage, he diſmiſt him, and made inſtance, that he ſhould come every day to ſee him.</p>
                  <p>During the four or five Months that the Ambaſſador ſtaid at <hi>Dehli,</hi> he was always ſplendidly treated at <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>'s charge; and the greateſt <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> preſented him one after another; and at laſt he was very honourably diſmiſſed: For <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had him apparell'd with another rich <hi>Serapah</hi> or Veſt, to which he added conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſents for himſelf, reſerving thoſe he intended for his King, 'till he ſhould ſend an Ambaſſador expreſly; which ſometime after he did.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of honour and reſpect which <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had ſhew'd to this Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63063:130"/>
the ſame <hi>Perſians,</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken of, gave out, that their King had ſenſibly reproached him in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with the Death of <hi>Dara,</hi> and the impriſonment of <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> as actions unworthy of a Brother, and a Son, and a Muſulman; and that he had alſo hit him with the word <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m-Guire,</hi> or Conquerour of the World, which <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had cauſed to be engraven on his Coyn. But 'tis hard to believe, that the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſhould do any ſuch thing to provoke ſuch a Victorious Prince, ſince <hi>Perſia</hi> is not in a condition to enter into a War with <hi>Indoſtan;</hi> I am rather apt to believe, that <hi>Perſia</hi> hath work enough to keep <hi>Kandahar</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> and the Frontiers on the ſide of <hi>Turky:</hi> Its Forces and Riches are known; it produceth not always ſuch great Kings as the <hi>Chah-Abbas,</hi> Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, Intelligent, and Politick, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make uſe of every thing, and to do much with ſmall expences. If it were in a condition of undertaking any thing againſt <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> or really
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63063:130"/>
ſenſible of Piety and the Muſal-Man Faith, why was it that in theſe laſt troubles and Civil Wars, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long in <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſat ſtill and looked on, when <hi>Dara, Chan-Jehan, Sultan Sujah,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Governour of <hi>Caboul</hi> deſired their aſſiſtance; and they might with no very great Army, nor great expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have ſeized on the faireſt part of <hi>India,</hi> beginning from the Kingdom of <hi>Caboul,</hi> unto the River <hi>Indus,</hi> and beyond it, and ſo made themſelves Umpires of all things? yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there muſt needs have been ſome offenſive expreſſions in thoſe <hi>Perſian</hi> Letters, or elſe the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor muſt have done or ſaid ſomething that diſpleaſed <hi>Aureng-Zebe;</hi> becauſe two or three daies after he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed him, he made a rumour to be ſpread-abroad, that the Ambaſſador had cauſed the Ham-ſtrings of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Horſes to be Cut; And the Ambaſſador being yet upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, he made him return all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Slaves which he carried along
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63063:131"/>
with him, of which he had a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious number.</p>
                  <p>Mean while, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was not ſo much concern'd, nor troubled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much with this Ambaſſador, as <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> upon a like occaſion, did with him, that was ſent to him from the Great <hi>Chah-Abbas.</hi> When the <hi>Perſians</hi> are in the humor of Ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying againſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> they relate theſe three or four little Stories of them: They ſay, that <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> ſeeing that the Courtſhip and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to their Ambaſſador were not able to prevail with him, ſo as to make him perform his ſalute after the <hi>Indian</hi> Mode, he deviſed this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice; he commanded to ſhut the great Gate of the Court of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kas,</hi> where he was to receive him, and to leave only open the Wicket, through which one man could not paſs but very difficultly, by ſtooping and holding down his Head, as the faſhion is when one maketh an <hi>Indian</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to the end that it might be ſaid, he had made the Ambaſſador put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63063:131"/>
in a poſture which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lower than the <hi>Indian</hi> Salam or Salute; but that that Ambaſſador be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aware of this trick, came in with his Back fore-moſt: And that <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> out of indignation to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf catch'd, told him, <hi>Eh-Bed-bakt,</hi> Thou Wretch, doſt thou think thou comeſt into a Stable of Aſſes, ſuch as thou art? And that the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, without any alteration, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; Who would not think ſo, ſeeing ſuch a little Door?</p>
                  <p>Another ſtory is this; That at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> taking ill ſome courſe and fierce anſwers return'd to him by the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ambaſſador, could not hold to tell him; What, hath <hi>Chah-Abbas</hi> no other men at his Court, that he muſt ſend to me ſuch a Fool as thy ſelf? And that the Ambaſſador anſwer'd; He hath many better and wiſer men than me, but <hi>to ſuch a King, ſuch an Ambaſſador:</hi> They add, that on a certain day <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> who had made the Ambaſſador to Dine in his Preſence, and ſought ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63063:132"/>
to affront him, ſeeing that he was buſie in picking and gnawing of Bones, asked him ſmiling, <hi>Eh Eltchy-Gi,</hi> My Lord Ambaſſador, <hi>What ſhall the Dogs eat?</hi> And that he anſwer'd readily, <hi>Kichery,</hi> that is, a diſh of Pulſe, which is the Food of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſort of People, and which he ſaw <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> eat, becauſe he loved it.</p>
                  <p>They ſay alſo, that <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> once asked him, What he thought of his new <hi>Dehli</hi> (which he was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) in compariſon of <hi>Hiſpahan?</hi> and that he anſwer'd aloud, and with an oath, <hi>Billah, Billah, Hiſpahan doth not come near the duſt of Dehli;</hi> which <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> took for a high commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though the Ambaſſador mocked him, becauſe the duſt is ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome at <hi>Dehli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, they relate that <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> one day preſſing him to tell him, What he thought of the Grandeur of the Kings of <hi>Indostan,</hi> compared to that of the Kings of <hi>Perſia?</hi> He anſwer'd, That, in his opinion, one could not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63063:132"/>
better compare the Kings of <hi>India</hi> than to a large Moon of 15 or 16 daies old, and thoſe of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to a ſmall Moon of 2 or 3 dayes. And that this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer did at firſt pleaſe <hi>Chah-Jehan;</hi> but that ſoon after he perceived, that that compariſon did him but little honour, the Ambaſſadors ſenſe being, that the Kings of <hi>Indoſtan</hi> were decreaſing, and thoſe of <hi>Perſia</hi> increaſing.</p>
                  <p>Whether theſe points are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and ſuch marks of wit, every one is free to judge, as he ſeeth cauſe. My opinion is, that a diſcreet and reſpectful gravity is much more becoming Ambaſſadors, than rallery and roughneſs, eſpecially, when they have to do with Kings, who will not be rallied with, witneſs an accident that befell this very Ambaſſador; for <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was at length ſo weary of him, and his freedom, that he called him no otherwiſe than Fool; and one day gave ſecret order, that when he ſhould enter into a pretty long and narrow Stree, that is near the Fortreſs, to come to the Hall of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> they

ſhould let looſe upon him an ill-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and fierce Elephant; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if the Ambaſſador had not nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lept out of his <hi>Paleky,</hi> and, together with his dextrous attendants, ſhot ſome Arrows into the Trump of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, which forced him to turn back, he had been utterly ſpoiled.</p>
                  <p>It was at this time, upon the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ambaſſador, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> received with that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wiſdome his Tutor <hi>Mallah-Sale,</hi> the Hiſtory of which is rare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. This old man, who long ſince had retired himſelf towards <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boul,</hi> and ſetled himſelf on ſome Lands, which <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> had given him, had no ſooner heard of the great fortune of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> his Diſcipline, who had overcome <hi>Dara</hi> and all his other Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and was now King of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> but he came in haſt to the Court, ſwelled with hopes of being preſently advanced to no leſs than the dignity of an <hi>Omrah.</hi> He maketh his Court, and endeavours to engage all his friends, and <hi>Rauchenara-Begum,</hi> the

Kings Siſter employs her ſelf for him. But yet there paſs three whole Months, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> does not ſo much as ſeem to look upon him; till at length wearied to have him always at his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and before his Face, he ſent for him to a plaee apart, where there was no body but <hi>Hakim-lul-Mouluk, Danech-mend-kan,</hi> and three or four of thoſe <hi>Omr ahs,</hi> that pretend to Science, and then ſpoke to him to this effect (as I was informed by my <hi>Agah.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is it you would have of me Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor? Can you reaſonably deſire I ſhould make you one of the chief <hi>Omrahs</hi> of my Court? Let me tell you, if you had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed me as you ſhould have done, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be more just: For I am of this perſwaſion, that a Child well educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and inſtructed, is as much, at leaſt, obliged to his Maſter as to his Father: But where are thoſe good Documents you have given me? In the firſt place you have taught me, that all that <hi>Frangiſtan (ſo it ſeems they call</hi> Europe) was nothing, but I know not what little Iſland, of which the greateſt King was he of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63063:134"/>
next to him he of <hi>Holland,</hi> and after him he of <hi>England;</hi> and as to the other Kings, as thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> you have repreſented them to me as our petty <hi>Raja's;</hi> telling me, that the Kings of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan</hi> were far above them all together, and that they were the true and only <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>majons,</hi> the <hi>Ekbars,</hi> the <hi>Jehan-Guyres,</hi> the <hi>Chah-Jehans,</hi> the <hi>Fortunate</hi> ones, the <hi>Great</hi> ones, the <hi>Conquerors</hi> and <hi>Kings of the World;</hi> and that <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Usbec, Kach-guer, Tatar</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tay, Pegu, China,</hi> and <hi>Matchina</hi> did tremble at the name of the Kings of <hi>Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan:</hi> Admirable Geography! You ſhould rather have taught me exactly to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh all thoſe different States of the World, and well to underſtand their ſtrength, their way of fighting, their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Religions, Governments &amp; Intereſts; and by the peruſal of ſolid Hiſtory, to obſerve their Riſe, Progreſs, Decay, and whence, how, and by what accidents and errors, thoſe great Changes and Revolutions of Empires and Kingdoms have happened. I have ſcarce learnt of you the name of my Grandſires, the famous Founders of this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63063:134"/>
Empire; ſo far were you from having taught me the Hiſtory of their Life, and what courſe they took to make ſuch great Conqueſts. You had a mind to teach me the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue, to read and to write, I am much obliged to you (forſooth) for baving made me loſe ſo much time upon a Language, that requires ten or twelve years to attaein to its perfection; as if the Son of a King ſhould think it to be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, to be a Grammarian or ſome Doctor of the Law, and to learn other Languages than thoſe of his Neighbors, when he cannot well be without them; he, to whom Time is ſo precious for ſo many weighty tbings, which he ought by times to learn. As if there were any ſpirit that did not with ſome reluctancy, and even with a kind of debaſement, employ it ſelf in ſo ſad and dry an exerciſe, ſo longſom and tedious, as is that of learning Words.</p>
                  <p>Thus did <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> reſent the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick Inſtructions of his Tutor; to which 'tis affirmed in that Court, that after ſome entertainment which he had with others, he further added the following reproof.</p>

                     <q>Know you not, that Childhood well govern'd, being a ſtate which is ordinarily accompanied with an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py memory, is capable of thouſands of good Preceps and Inſtructions, which remain deeply impreſſed the whole remainder of a mans life, and keep the mind alwayes raiſed for great actions? The Law, Prayers, and Sciences, may they not as well be learned in our Mother-Tongue, as in Arabick? You told my Father <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> that you would teach me Philoſophy. 'Tis true, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber very well, that you have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd me for many years with airy Queſtions, of things that afford no ſatisfaction at all to the mind, and are of no uſe in humane ſociety, emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Notions, and meer Phancies, that have only this in them, that they are very hard to underſtand, and very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to forget, which are only capable to tire and ſpoil a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to breed an Opinion that is inſupportable. I ſtill remember, that after you had thus amuſed me, I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63063:135"/>
know not how long, with your fine Philoſophy, all I retained of it, was a multitude of barbarous and dark words, proper to bewilder, perplex, and tire out the beſt wits, and only invented, the better to cover the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ignorance of men like your ſelf, that would make us believe, that they know all and that under thoſe obſcure and ambiguous words, are hid great myſteries, which they alone are capable to underſtand: If you had ſeaſon'd me with that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, which formeth the mind to ratiocination, and inſenſibly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms it to be ſatisfied with nothing but ſolid reaſons; if you had given me thoſe excellent precepts and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which raiſe the Soul above the aſſaults of Fortune, and reduce her to an unſhakeable and always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual temper, and permit her not to be lifted up by proſperity, nor deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by adverſity; if you had taken care to give me the knowledge of what we are, and what are the firſt principles of things; and had aſſiſted
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63063:136"/>
me in forming in my mind a fit Idea of the greatneſs of the Univerſe, and of the admirable order and motion of the parts thereof; if, I ſay, you had inſtilled into me this kind of Philoſophy, I ſhould think my ſelf incomparably more obliged to you than <hi>Alexander</hi> was to his <hi>Aristotle;</hi> and believe it my duty to recompence you otherwiſe, than he did him. Should not you, inſtead of your flattery, have taught me ſomewhat of that point ſo important to a King, which is, what the reciprocal duties are of a Soveraign to his Subjects, and thoſe of Subjects, to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign? And ought not you to have conſider'd, that one day I ſhould be obliged with the Sword to diſpute my Life and the Crown with my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Is not that the deſtiny almoſt of all the Sons of <hi>Indoſtan?</hi> Have you ever taken any care to make me learn, what 'tis to beſiege a Town, or to ſet an Army in array? For theſe things I am obliged to others, not at all to you. Go, and retire to the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,

whence you are come, and let `no body know who you are, or what `is become of you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At that time there aroſe a kind of Tempeſt againſt <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> which did not diſpleaie me. Moſt people of <hi>Aſia</hi> are ſo infatuated by <hi>Judiciary Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> that they believe there is nothing done here below, but 'tis written above (for ſo they ſpeak.) In all their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings therefore they conſult Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers. When two Armies are ready to give Battel, they beware of falling on, till the Aſtrologer hath taken and determined the moment he fancies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious for the beginning of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. And ſo, when the matter is about electing a Captain-General of an Army, of diſpatching an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, of concluding a Marriage, of beginning a Voyage, and of doing any other thing, as buying a Slave, putting on new Apparel, &amp;c. nothing of all that is done without the ſentence of Mr. Star-Gazer; which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible vexation, and a cuſtom draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it ſuch important conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63063:137"/>
that I know not how it can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſo long. For the Aſtrologer muſt needs have knowledge of all that paſſeth, and of all that is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken from the greateſt Affairs to the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>But behold, it happen'd, that the Prime Aſtrologer of the King was drown'd, which occaſioned a great noiſe at Court, and was a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit to Aſtrology: For he being the perſon that determined the moments of all enterprizes and actions for the King, and the Omrahs, every one wondred, how a man ſo experienced, and that for ſo long time had diſpenſed good adventures to others, could not foreſee his own misfortune. There were not wanting thoſe, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be wiſer than others, and ſaid, that in <hi>Frangiſtan,</hi> where Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences did flouriſh, the Grandees do ſuſpect all ſuch kind of people, and that ſome hold them even no better than Mountebanks, that 'tis much doubted, whether this Knowledge is grounded upon good and ſolid
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63063:137"/>
reaſons, and that it may very well be ſome fancy of Aſtrologers, or rather an artifice to make themſelves neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Great ones, and to make them in ſome meaſure to depend on them.</p>
                  <p>All theſe diſcourſes very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the Aſtrologers; but nothing angred them ſo much as this Story, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very famous, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Great <hi>Chah-Abas</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> commanded to be digged and prepared a little place in his Seraglio to make a Garden; that the young Trees were all ready, and that the Gardner made account to plant them the next day. Mean time the Aſtrologer taking upon him, ſaid, that a good nick of time was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for planting them, to make them proſper. <hi>Chah-Abas</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it ſhould be ſo, the Star-gazer took his Inſtruments, turned over his Books, made his Calculation, and concluded, that by reaſon of ſuch and ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and Aſpect of the Planets, it was neceſſary they ſhould be ſet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. The Maſter-Gardner, who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63063:138"/>
minded nothing leſs than this Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, was not then at hand; yet for all that, they fell to work immediately, making holes, and planting the Trees, <hi>Chah-Abas</hi> himſelf ſetting them, that it might be ſaid, that they were Trees ſet with <hi>Chah-Abas</hi>'s own hands. The Gardner returning at night, was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently amazed when he ſaw the work done; and finding that the right place and order deſigned by him, was not taken; that, for example, an Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock-tree ſtood where an Apple-tree ſhould ſtand, and a Pear-tree where all Almond-tree; being heartily angry with the Aſtrologer, cauſed all the Trees to be plucked up again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and laid them down, with ſome Earth about them, for next morning, the time choſen by himſelf. The news hereof came ſoon to the Ears of the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who preſently told <hi>Chah-Abas</hi> of it: He forthwith ſent for the Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with ſome indignation asked him; What had made him ſo bold as to pull up thoſe Young Trees he had planted with his own hand; that the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63063:138"/>
time had been ſo exactly taken for them, that ſo good an one would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be had again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ſo he had marred all. The rude Gardner, who had a Cup of <hi>Chiras</hi>-wine in his head, look'd aſide upon the Aſtrologer, and grumbling and ſwearing, ſaid to him theſe words, <hi>Billah, Billah,</hi> that muſt needs be an admirable point of time which thou haſt taken for theſe Trees; unhappy Aſtrologer! They were planted this day Noon, and this Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they have been plucked up again. When <hi>Chah-Abas</hi> heard this, he fell a laughing, turned his back upon the Aſtrologer, and went away.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall here add two particulars, though hapned in the time of <hi>Chah-Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> becauſe ſuch things fall out often enough, and do withal give occaſion to obſerve that ancient and barbarous cuſtom, which makes the Kings of <hi>India</hi> Heirs of the goods of thoſe that die in their ſervice: The firſt was of <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>knamkan,</hi> one of the moſt ancient Omrahs of the Court, and who for the ſpace of 40 or 50 years, wherein
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63063:139"/>
had alwayes been employ'd in confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Offices, had heaped up great ſtore of Gold and Silver. This Lord ſeeing himſelf near his end, and thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this unreaſonable cuſtom, which often renders the Wife of a great man, upon his deceaſe, poor and miſerable in an inſtant, and neceſſitates her to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a Petition begging ſome ſmall pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for her ſubſiſtence and for that of her Children, who are conſtrained to liſt themſelves for common Souldiers under ſome Omrah; who, I ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering this with himſelf, ſecretly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed all his Treaſure to indigent Knights and poor Widows, filled his Trunks with old pieces of Iron, old ſhoes, rags and bones, and locked and ſealed them, telling every body that they were goods belonging to <hi>Chah-Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> the King. Theſe Trunks, after his Death, were brought before <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> when he was in the Aſſembly, and by his command inſtantly opened in the preſence of all the Omrahs, that ſaw all this fine Stuff, which ſo provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and diſcompoſed <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63063:139"/>
he roſe in great fury, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>other</hi> is only a piece of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. A rich <hi>Banean,</hi> or Heathen Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, being a great Uſurer (as moſt of them are) who had alwayes been in employment, and in the pay of the King, came to die. Some years after his death, his Son did extremely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune the Widow, his Mother, to let him have ſome Money: She finding him to be a prodigal and debauched Youth, gave him as little as ſhe could. This young Fool, by the perſwaſion of others like himſelf, made his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> and was ſo ſilly, as to diſcover to him all the goods his Father had left, which amounted to two hundred thouſand Crowns. <hi>Chah-Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> who ſoon got an itch for this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſent for the Widow, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her in the open Aſſembly to ſend him an hundred thouſand Rupies, and to give fifty thouſand to her Son, giving order at the ſame time to put her away.

                  <p>The <hi>firſt,</hi> that though <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> made <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> his Father, to be kept in the Fortreſs of <hi>Agra</hi> with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable care and caution; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he ſtill left him in his old Apartment with <hi>Begum-Saheb,</hi> his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Daughter, his other Women, Singers, Dancers, Cooks, and others; nothing of that kind was wanting to him. There were alſo certain <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lahs,</hi> that were permitted to come and to read the <hi>Alceran</hi> to him (for he was become very devout.) And when he thought fit, there were brought before him brave Horſes, and tamed <hi>Gazelles</hi> (which is a kind of Goat) to make them fight with one another; as alſo
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63063:142"/>
divers ſorts of Birds of prey, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other rare Animals, to divert him as formerly. <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> himſelf uſed an art to overcome at laſt his fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obſtinacy, which he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto kept, though a priſoner. And this was the effect of the obliging Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, full of reſpect and ſubmiſſion, which he often wrote to his Father, conſulting him often as his Oracle, and expreſſing a thouſand cares for him; ſending him alſo unceſſantly ſome pretty Preſent or other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Chah-Jehan</hi> was ſo much gained, that he alſo wrote very often to <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> touching the Government and State-affairs, and of his own accord ſent him ſome of thoſe Jewels, which before he had told him of, that Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were ready to beat them to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt time he ſhould again ask for them. Beſides, he conſented that the Daughter of <hi>Dara,</hi> which he had ſo peremptorily denied, ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to him; and granted him at length that pardon and paternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which he had ſo often deſired
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63063:142"/>
without obtaining it. Yet, under all this, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> did not alwayes flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; on the contrary, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times return'd ſharp anſwers, when he met with ſtrains in his Fathers Letters that were pregnant, or expreſſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his former height and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Of this we may judge by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I know from a very good hand was once written to him by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-Zebe,</hi> to this effect:</p>
                  <p>Sir, You would have me indiſpenſably follow thoſe ancient Cuſtoms, and make my ſelf Heir to all thoſe that are in my pay with the wonted rigour: An Omrah, and even a Merchant can no ſooner die, and ſometimes even before his death, but we ſeal up his Trunks, and ſeize on his goods, and make a ſtrict enquiry into his Eſtate, impriſoning and ill-treating the Officers of the Houſe to diſcover to us all he hath, even to the leaſt Jewels. I will believe that there is ſome policy in doing ſo, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that 'tis very rigorous, and ſometimes very unjuſt; and to ſpeak the very truth, we may deſerve well enough, that the ſame ſhould befal us every day,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63063:143"/>
what hapned to you from your <hi>Neikman kan,</hi> and from the Widow of your rich In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Merchant. Moreover <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> it ſeems, I am by you reputed proud and haughty now I am King: As if you knew not by the experience of more than forty years of your Reign, how heavy an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Crown is, and how many ſad and reſtleſs nights it paſſeth through: as if I could forget that excellent paſſage of <hi>Mir-Timur</hi> (commonly called <hi>Tamberlan)</hi> which is ſo ſeriouſly delivered to us by that Great Granfather of ours, <hi>Ekbar,</hi> to the end that we might the more weigh the importance and value of it, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether we have cauſe to pride our ſelves ſo much in a Crown. You well know, that he ſaid, that the ſame day when <hi>Timur</hi> took <hi>Bajazet,</hi> he made him come before him, and having fixed his eyes on him, fell a laughing; at which <hi>Bajazet</hi> being highly offended, fiercely ſaid to him, <hi>Laugh not at my Fortune,</hi> Timur; <hi>know that 'tis God that is the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of Kingdoms and Empires; and that the ſame can befal you to morrow, that hath befallen me to day.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63063:143"/>
                     <hi>Timur</hi> made this ſerious and brave Anſwer; <hi>I know as well as you,</hi> Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet, <hi>that 'tis God that diſtributeth Kingdomes and Empires; I laugh not at your ill Fortune; God forbid I ſhould do ſo: But beholding your face, I ſmiled, and had this thought, That certainly theſe Kingdomes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires muſt in themſelves be very little and contemptible things in the eyes of God, ſince he giveth them to perſons ſo ill made as You and I both are; a deformed one-eyed man, as you; and a lame wretch, as my ſelf.</hi> You require alſo, that abandoning all my other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which I believe very neceſſary for the eſtabliſhment and happineſs of this State, I ſhould think on nothing but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and the enlargement of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. I muſt confeſs that this is indeed the buſineſs of a great Monarch, and of a Soul truly Royal, and that I ſhould not deſerve to be of the Blood of the Great <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> if I were not of that mind, and had not ſuch inclinations. Mean time, I think I ſit not idle, and my Armies are not uſeleſs in the Kingdoms of <hi>Decan</hi> and

                     <hi>Bengale:</hi> But we muſt alſo aver, that the greateſt Conquerors are not alwayes the greateſt Kings; that we too often ſee a Barbarian making Conqueſts, and that thoſe great Bodies of Conqueſts do ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall of themſelves, and by their own weight. <hi>He</hi> is a great King, that knows to acquit himſelf worthily of that Great and Auguſt Employment and Charge of Kings, which is to diſpence Juſtice to their Subjects, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The reſt is not come to my hands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is in regard of the <hi>Emir-Jemla.</hi> It were to injure this great Man, to paſs by with ſilence his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment to <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> after the War, and the manner of ending his dayes. This eminent perſon after he had diſpatched the Affair of <hi>Bengala,</hi> with <hi>Sultan-Sujah</hi> (the ſecond of theſe four Brothers) not like <hi>Gionkan,</hi> that infamous <hi>Patan</hi> with <hi>Dara;</hi> nor like the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Serenaguer</hi> with <hi>Soliman-Chekouh;</hi> but like a Great Captain and dextrous Polititian, purſuing him as far as the Sea-ſide, and neceſſitating him to fly and to eſcape out of his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63063:144"/>
hands; after, I ſay, he had done theſe things, he ſent an Eunuch to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> intreating him, that he would give him leave to tranſport his Family to <hi>Bengale;</hi> that now that the War was at an end and he broken with Age, he hoped he would grant him the advantage of ending his life in the company of his Wife and Children.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> is too ſharp-ſighted, not to pierce into the deſigns of <hi>Emir.</hi> He ſeeth him triumphing over <hi>Sujah;</hi> he knows his great credit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that he hath the eſteem of a very wiſe, undertaking, valiant and rich man; and that the Kingdom of <hi>Bengale</hi> is not only the beſt of all <hi>Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> but ſtrong of it ſelf, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that this <hi>Emir</hi> is in the head of a well diſciplin'd Army, which both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and fears him. Beſides, he is not ignorant of his ambition, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth well enough, that if he ſhould have with him his Son <hi>Mahmet-Emir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan,</hi> he would aſpire to the Crown, and at leaſt take full poſſeſſion of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,</hi> if he ſhould not be able to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63063:145"/>
vance things further. At the ſame time he is alſo well aware, that there is danger in refuſing him, and that he may poſſibly prove ſuch a man, as in caſe of denial, may run into ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous extream, as he had done in <hi>Golkonda.</hi> How then, think ye, did he carry himſelf in this conjuncture? He ſends to him his Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all the Children of his Son: He maketh the <hi>Emir</hi> a <hi>Mir-Ul Omrah,</hi> which is in that Empire the greateſt degree of honour that a Favourite can be raiſed to: And as to <hi>Mahmet-Emir-kan,</hi> he maketh him the <hi>Great Bakchis,</hi> which is a dignity and charge like that of our Great Maſter of the Horſe, the ſecond or third Office in the State, but ſuch an one as abſolutely obligeth the poſſeſſor of it to be alwayes at the Court, not ſuffering him, but very difficultly, to be abſent from the perſon of the King.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Emir</hi> ſoon perceived, that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-Zebe</hi> had skilfully put by the ſtroke, that it would be in vain the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to ask of him his Son; that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63063:145"/>
he could not do it without offending him; and that therefore the ſafeſt way would be to reſt contented with all the teſtimonies of Friendſhip, and with all the Honours, together with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Bengale;</hi> being in the mean time alwayes upon his guard, and in ſuch a poſture, that ſince he could attempt nothing againſt <hi>Aureng-Zebe, Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſhould not be able to attempt any thing againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we ſeen theſe two Great Men carry themſelves to one another: And in this condition did affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for almoſt a year; till <hi>Aureng-Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,</hi> too well knowing that a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cannot be long at reſt, and that, if he be not employed in a Forreign War, he will at length raiſe a Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick one; propoſed to him to make War upon that rich and potent Raja of <hi>Acham,</hi> whoſe Territories are on the North of <hi>Dake,</hi> upon the Gulf of <hi>Bengale.</hi> The <hi>Emir,</hi> who in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance had already deſigned this ſame thing of himſelf, and who believed, that the Conqueſt of this Countrey,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63063:146"/>
would make way for his Immortal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and be an occaſion of carrying his Arms as far as <hi>China,</hi> declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ready for this Enterprize. He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked at <hi>Dake</hi> with a puiſſant Army, upon a River which comes from thoſe parts; upon which having gone about an hundred Leagues North-Eaſtward, he arrived at a Caſtle called <hi>Azo,</hi> which the Raja of <hi>Acham</hi> had uſurped from the Kingdom of <hi>Bengale,</hi> and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for many years. He attacked this place, and took it by force in leſs than fifteen dayes; thence marching over Land towards <hi>Chamdara,</hi> which is the Inlet into the Countrey of that Raja; he entred into it after 26 dayes journey, ſtill Northward: There a Battel was fought, in which the Raja of <hi>Acham</hi> was worſted, and obliged to retreat to <hi>Guerguon,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, four miles diſtant from <hi>Chamda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> The <hi>Emir</hi> purſued him ſo cloſe, that he gave him no time to fortifie himſelf in <hi>Guerguon:</hi> For he arrived in ſight of that Town in five dayes, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the <hi>Raja,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Emir</hi>'s
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63063:146"/>
Army, to fly towards the Mountains of the Kingdom of <hi>Laſſa,</hi> and to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Guerguon,</hi> which was pillaged, as had been <hi>Chamdara.</hi> They found there vaſt riches, it being a great, very fair and Merchant-like Town, and where the Women are extraordinarily beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Mean time, the ſeaſon of the Rains came in ſooner than uſually; and they being exceſſive in thoſe parts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing all the Countrey, except ſuch Villages as ſtand on raiſed ground, the <hi>Emir</hi> was much embaraſſed. For the <hi>Raja</hi> made his people of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains come down from all parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and to carry away all the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Field; whereby the <hi>Emir</hi>'s Army (as rich as 'twas) before the end of the rains fell into great ſtreights, without being able to go forward or backward. It could not advance, by reaſon of the Mountains very difficult to paſs, and continually peſter'd with great Rains; nor retreat, becauſe of the like Rains and deep wayes; the <hi>Raja</hi> alſo having cauſed the way to be digged up as far as to <hi>Chamdara:</hi> So
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63063:147"/>
that the <hi>Emir</hi> was forced to remain in that wretched condition during the whole time of the Rain; after which, when he found his Army diſtaſted, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, and half ſtarved, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to give over the Deſign he had of advancing, and to return the ſame way he was come. But this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat was made with ſo much pains, and ſo great inconveniencies, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the dirt, the want of victuals, and the purſuit of the <hi>Raja</hi> falling on the Rear, that every body (but he) that had not known how to remedy the diſorder of ſuch a March, nor had the patience to be ſometimes five or ſix hours at one paſſage to make the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery get over it withont confuſion, would have utterly periſh'd, himſelf, Army, and all; yet he, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe difficulties and obſtacles, made a ſhift to come back with great honour and vaſt riches. He deſign'd to return thither again the next year, and to purſue his undertaking, ſuppoſing that <hi>Azo,</hi> which he had fortified, and where he left a ſtrong
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63063:147"/>
Garriſon, would be able to hold out the reſt of the year againſt the <hi>Raja.</hi> But he was no ſooner arrived there, but Fluxes began to rage in his Army: Neither had himſelf a body of Steel more than the reſt; he fell ſick and died, whereby Fortune ended the juſt apprehenſions of <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi> I ſay, the <hi>Juſt</hi> apprehenſions; for there was none of thoſe that knew this great man, and the ſtate of the affairs of <hi>Indostan,</hi> who did not ſay, 'Tis this day that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> is King of <hi>Benga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.</hi> And himſelf could not forbear to expreſs ſome ſuch thing; for he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſaid to <hi>Mahmet-Emir-kan;</hi> You have loſt your Father, and I the greateſt and the moſt dangerous Friend I had; yet notwithſtanding he comforted this Son, and withal aſſured him, that he would ever be a Father to him. And whereas 'twas thought, that he would at leaſt cut off his Salary, and make Inquiſition into his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, he confirmed him in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Bakehis,</hi> augmented his Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a thouſand Rupies a moneth,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63063:148"/>
and left him Heir of all the Eſtate of his Father, although the Cuſtom of the Country empowred him to ſeize on all.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> is concerning <hi>Chah-heſt-kan,</hi> whom <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> made firſt Governour of <hi>Agra,</hi> when he went out to the Battel of <hi>Kadjoue</hi> againſt <hi>Sultan Sujah;</hi> and afterward, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and General of the Army in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can;</hi> and at laſt, after the death of <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> Governour and General of the Army in <hi>Bengale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> together with the charge of <hi>Mirul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Omrah</hi> which <hi>Emir-jemla</hi> had poſſeſſed. This <hi>Chah-heſt-kan</hi> is he, whom in our Hiſtory we have mention'd as Uncle to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and one that hath ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his happineſs by his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and skilful pen, as well as by his intrigues and counſels. It would be injurious to his Renown alſo, to be ſilent of the important enterpriſe, which he undertook preſently when he entred upon his Government; and that the rather, becauſe <hi>Emir-jemla,</hi> whether out of policy, or for another
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63063:148"/>
cauſe, had no mind to tempt him; as alſo, becauſe the particularities, which I am going to relate, will ſhew not only the paſſed and preſent ſtate of the Kingdoms of <hi>Bengale</hi> and <hi>Rakan,</hi> which hitherto hath not been well deſcribed to us by any; but alſo ſome other things that are worth kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing.</p>
                  <p>To the end therefore that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of <hi>Chah-heſt-kan</hi>'s attempt may be well underſtood, and a good Idea be had of what paſſeth about the Gulf of <hi>Bengale,</hi> we are to know, that the e many years there have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been in the Kingdom of <hi>Rakan</hi> or <hi>Moy,</hi> ſome <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> and with them a great number of their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves, and other <hi>Franguis,</hi> gather'd from all parts. <hi>That</hi> was the refuge of the Run-aways from <hi>Goa, Ceilan, Cochin, Malague,</hi> and all thoſe other places, which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> formerly held in the <hi>Indies;</hi> and they were ſuch as had abandoned their Monaſteries, men that had been twice or thrice Married, Murtherers: In a word,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63063:149"/>
ſuch as had deſerved the Rope, were moſt welcome and moſt eſteem'd there, leading in that Country a life that was very deteſtable, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unworthy of Chriſtians, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they impunely butchered and poyſoned one another, and aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated their own Prieſts, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were not better than themſelves. The King of <hi>Rakan</hi> in the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath ever had of the <hi>Mogol,</hi> kept them for a guard of his Frontiers, in a Port-Town called <hi>Chategon,</hi> giving them Land, and liberty to live as they pleaſed. Their ordinary Trade was Robbery and Piracy. With ſome ſmall and light Gallies they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but coaſt about that Sea, and entring into all Rivers thereabout, and into the Channels and Arms of <hi>Ganges,</hi> and between all thoſe Iſles of the lower <hi>Bengale,</hi> and often penetrating even ſo far as forty or fifty leagues up into the Countrey, ſurprized and carried away whole Towns, Aſſemblies, Markets, Feaſts and Weddings of the poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and others of that Countrey,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63063:149"/>
making Women Slaves, great and ſmall, with ſtrange cruelty; and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all they could not carry away. And thence it is, that at preſent there are ſeen in the mouth of <hi>Ganges</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fine Iſles quite deſerted, which were formerly well peopled, and where no other Inhabitants are found but wild Beaſts, and eſpecially Tygers.</p>
                  <p>This great number of Slaves, which thus they took from all quarters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what uſe they made of. They had boldneſs and impudence enough, to come and ſell to that very Country the old people, which they knew not what to do with; where it ſo fell out, that thoſe who had eſcaped the danger by flight, and by hiding themſelves in the Woods, labour'd to redeem to day their Fathers and Mothers, that had been taken yeſterday. The reſt they kept for their ſervice to make Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them; and ſuch Chriſtians as they were themſelves, bringing them up to robbing and killing; or elſe they ſold them to the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> of <hi>Goa, Cei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and others; and even
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63063:150"/>
to thoſe that were remaining in <hi>Benga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> at <hi>Ogouli,</hi> who were come thither to ſettle themſelves there by the favour of <hi>Jehan-Guyre,</hi> the Grandfather of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-Zebe,</hi> who ſuffered them there upon the account of Traffick, and of his having no averſion to Chriſtians, as alſo becauſe they promiſed him to keep the Bay of <hi>Bengale</hi> clear from all Pyrats. And it was towards the Iſle of <hi>Galles,</hi> near the Cape of <hi>Palmes,</hi> where this fine Trade was. Theſe Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates lay there in wait at the paſſage for the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who filled their Ships with them at a very eaſie rate; this infamous Rabble impudently brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that they made more Chriſtians in one year, then all the Miſſionaries of the <hi>Indies</hi> in ten; which would be a ſtrange way of enlarging Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Pyrates that made <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> who was a more zealous Mahumetan than his Father <hi>Jehan-Guyre,</hi> to expreſs at laſt his paſſion, not only againſt the Reverend Fathers the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> Miſſionaries of <hi>Agra,</hi> in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63063:150"/>
that he cauſed to be pulled down the beſt part of a very fair and large Church that had been built, as well as that of <hi>Lahor,</hi> by the favour of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han-Guyre,</hi> who, as I ſaid, did not hate Chriſtianity; and upon which there ſtood a great Steeple with a great Bell in it, whoſe ſound might be heard over all the Town; not only, I ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> but alſo againſt the Chriſtians of <hi>Ogouli:</hi> For being impatient to ſee them connive at the Pyrates, to make the name of the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis</hi> formidable, and to fill their houſes with Slaves that were his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he waſted and utterly ruined them, after he had both with fair words and menaces drawn from them as much money as he could: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were indiſcreetly obſtinate, in refuſing what he demanded of them, he beſieged them, and cauſed them all to be brought to <hi>Agra,</hi> even their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Children, their Prieſts and Friers. This was a miſery and a deſolation not to be parallell'd; a kind of <hi>Babilonian</hi> tranſmigration. There they were all
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63063:151"/>
made Slaves: The handſom Women were ſhut up in the Seraglio; the old Women and others, were diſtributed among divers <hi>Omrahs.</hi> The young Lads were circumciſed, and made Pages; and men of age renounced for the moſt part their Faith, either terrified by the threatnings they heard daily, that they ſhould be trampled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Elephants, or drawn away by fair Promiſes. 'Tis true, that there were ſome of thoſe Friers, who perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and that the Miſſionaries of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi> who notwithſtanding all this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, remained in their houſes, found means afterwards, partly by Friends, partly by Money, to get ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them away, and to have them conveyed to <hi>Goa,</hi> and to other places belonging to the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They were alſo the ſame Pyrates, who ſome time before the deſolation of <hi>Ogouli,</hi> offered to the Vice-Roy of <hi>Goa</hi> to put the whole Kingdom of <hi>Rakan</hi> into their hands for the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;</hi> but he refuſed, they ſay, this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, out of arrogance and jealouſie,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63063:151"/>
and would not ſend the ſuccours, which for that end was demanded of him by a certain <hi>Baſtian Conſalve,</hi> who had made himſelf head of thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and was become ſo potent and conſiderable, that he married one of the Kings Daughters; being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that it ſhould be ſaid, that a man of ſo mean Extraction as this <hi>Bastian</hi> was, had done ſuch a Maſter-piece. But it may be ſaid on this occaſion, that this is not much to be wondred at, conſidering that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> in the <hi>Indies</hi> by ſuch a conduct have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times been faulty on the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in <hi>Japan,</hi> in <hi>Pegu,</hi> in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and other places; not to mention, that by this way, and that perhaps by a juſt Divine chaſtiſement (as they all frankly confeſs themſelves) they are become a prey to their Enemies, and fallen ſo low in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that I know not whether they will ever recover there; whereas formerly, before they were corrupted by vice, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated through pleaſure, they made all others tremble in thoſe parts; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63063:152"/>
as then they were brave and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous men, zealous for the Chriſtian Religion, conſiderable for gallant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits and for riches; all the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings ſeeking their friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, the ſame Pyrates ſeized at that time on the Iſle of <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ondiva,</hi> an advantageous Poſt to command a part of the Mouth of <hi>Ganges:</hi> In which Iſle a cettain <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Frier, a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous man, acted the King for many years, having taken a courſe, God knows how, to rid himſelf of the Commander of that place.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the ſame Robbers took <hi>Sultan-Sujah</hi> at <hi>Daka,</hi> to carry him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in their Galeaſſes to <hi>Rakan,</hi> as we related above, and found means to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his Coffers, and to rob him of good ſtore of Jewels, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were ſecretly, and at a very cheap rate, ſold in <hi>Rakan,</hi> moſt of them being fallen into the hands of people that had no skill in them, and afterwards into the hands of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> and others, who knew how to buy them up quickly, making thoſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63063:152"/>
fellows believe, that they were ſoft Diamonds, and that they would pay them according to the <hi>degrees</hi> of their hardneſs.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They are they that for many years have given exerciſe to the Great <hi>Mogol</hi> in <hi>Bengale;</hi> having obliged him there to keep alwayes Garriſons every where upon the Paſſes, and a great Militia, and a Fleet alſo of Galeaſſes to oppoſe their courſes, and who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, have made ſhift to make ſtrange devaſtations, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to enter far into the Country, and to laugh at all the Souldiery of the <hi>Mogols;</hi> in regard they were become ſo bold, and ſo dextrous at their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and ſo skilful in piloting their Galeaſſes, that four or five of them ſtuck not to ſet upon fourteen or fifteen <hi>Mogolians,</hi> which they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo actually worſted, and took, or run aground. And upon theſe Pyrates <hi>Chah-heſt-kan</hi> caſt his eyes as ſoon as he came into <hi>Bengale,</hi> taking a reſolution to deliver the Countrey of this plague of people, that had ſo long waſted it; and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63063:153"/>
afterwards to paſs on, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the King of <hi>Rakan,</hi> according to the order of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who at any price had a mind to revenge the blood of <hi>Sultan-Sujah,</hi> and all his Family, that had been ſo cruelly handled, and to teach that Barbarian, how the Blood Royal was to be regarded and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on any occaſion whatſoever, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now with what dexterity <hi>Chah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſt-kan</hi> carrieth on his deſign!</p>
                  <p>Knowing that 'tis impoſſible to paſs any Cavalry by Land, no not ſo much as any Infantry, from <hi>Bengale</hi> into <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan,</hi> becauſe of the many channels and rivers upon the Frontiers; and alſo that on the other ſide, thoſe Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of <hi>Chatigon,</hi> whom we juſt now were ſpeaking of, would be powerful enough to hinder him from tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by Sea; he thought upon this experiment, <hi>viz.</hi> to engage the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in his deſign. He therefore ſent a kind of Ambaſſador to <hi>Batavia,</hi> empowering him to treat upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conditions, with the General of that Company, joyntly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63063:153"/>
the whole Kingdom of <hi>Rakan;</hi> as formerly <hi>Chah-Abbas</hi> ſubdued that of <hi>Ormus,</hi> in conjunction with the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.</hi> The General of <hi>Batavia</hi> ſeeing the thing to be poſſible, and that it was a means more and more to break the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and that it would turn to a very good account to the Company, diſpatcht away two Men of War for <hi>Bengale,</hi> to favour the tranſportation of the <hi>Mogolian</hi> Troops in ſpight of thoſe Pyrates. But obſerve what <hi>Chah-heſt-kan</hi> did before theſe Men of War arrived: He equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a great number of Galeaſſes, and many large Veſſels to tranſport the Army; threatned the Pyrates, utterly to ſpoil and ruine them; acquainted them with the deſign of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> upon <hi>Rakan;</hi> that a potent Army of the <hi>Dutch</hi> was near; that they ſhould think on themſelves and their families, if they were wiſe; and in a word, if they would abandon the ſervice of the King of <hi>Rakan</hi> and take that of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> he would procure very good conditions for them, diſtribute amongſt

them as much Land in <hi>Bengale</hi> as they deſired, and pay them the double of what they had now.</p>
                  <p>'Tis doubtful, whether theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces and Promiſes made impreſſion upon them, or whether it was not an accident that moved them; they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving about that time aſſaſſinated one of the chief Officers of the King of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan,</hi> and apprehending a puniſhment for that crime: However it be, they were caught, and they were one day ſtruck with ſuch a panick terror, that they ſhipp'd themſelves all at once in forty or fifty of their Galeaſſes, and wafted over to <hi>Bengale</hi> to <hi>Chah-heſt-kan,</hi> and that with ſo much precipitation, that they hardly took time to embark their Wives and Children, and what elſe was moſt precious to them. <hi>Chah-heſt-kan</hi> received them with open arms, courted them exceedingly, gave them very conſiderable pay, and without let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them cool, made them, joyntly with his whole Army, to attack and take the Iſle of <hi>Sondiva,</hi> which was fallen into the hands of the King of

                     <hi>Rakan;</hi> and thence to paſs with all his Horſe and Foot to <hi>Chatigon.</hi> About this time the two <hi>Holland</hi>-Veſſels arrived; but <hi>Chah-heſt-kan,</hi> who thought that henceforth it would be eaſie for him to compaſs his deſign, thanked them.

After this manner did <hi>Chah-heſt-kan</hi> put an end to this Rabble, which, as I ſaid, have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined and diſpoiled all the lower <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale.</hi> Time will ſhew whether he will be as happy in the remainder

                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> particular is concerning the two Sons of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> viz. <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> and <hi>Sultan Mazum.</hi> He ſtill keeps the firſt of them in <hi>Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aleor,</hi> but (if one may believe the common report) without making him take the <hi>Pouſt,</hi> which is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Drink of thoſe that are put into that place. As to the <hi>other,</hi> though he hath alwayes been a pattern of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs and moderation, yet one knows not whether he was not too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in making a party, when his Father was ſo extreamly ſick; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> have not upon other occaſions perceived ſomething that might give him cauſe of jealouſie; or whether he had not a mind to make an authentick proof of both his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Courage. However it be, one day he commanded him in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned manner, in a full Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> to go and kill a <hi>Lyon,</hi> that was come down the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and had made great havock
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63063:155"/>
and waſte in the Countrey; and this he did without giving order to furniſh him with thoſe ſtrong and large Nets, which they are wont to employ in this dangerous kind of hunting in a real mood; telling the great Hunting-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who preſently called for thoſe Nets, that when he was Prince, he did not look for ſuch Formalities. It was the good fortune of <hi>Sultan Mazum,</hi> that he proſper'd in this attempt, not loſing any more than two or three men, and ſome horſes that were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, although, on the other hand, the matter went not off ſo pleaſantly, the wounded <hi>Lyon</hi> having leapt up to the head of the Sultan's Elephant. Since that time, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> hath not been backward to expreſs much affection to him; he hath given him even the Government of <hi>Decan,</hi> though with ſo little power and treaſure, that there is no great cauſe to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any thing upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> thing toucheth <hi>Mohabet-kan,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Kaboul,</hi> whom

                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> took from his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and generouſly pardoned; not willing, as he ſaid, to loſe ſo brave a Captain, and that had ſtuck ſo cloſe to his Benefactor <hi>Chah-Jehan.</hi> He made him even Governour of <hi>Guzuratte,</hi> in the place of <hi>

                     <hi>Kandahar,</hi> that ſtrong and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant place, which is the Capital and the ſwaying City of this Noble and Rich Kingdom of the ſame Name, hath in theſe latter Ages been the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of grievous Wars between the <hi>Mogols</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> each of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a right thereto. <hi>Ekbar,</hi> that great King of the <hi>Indies,</hi> took it by force from the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and kept it during his life. And <hi>Chah-Abbas,</hi> that famous King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> retook it from <hi>Jean-Guyre,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ekbar.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it return'd to <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> Son of <hi>John Guyre,</hi> not by the Sword, but by the means of the Governour <hi>Aly-Merdan-kan,</hi> who ſurrendred it to him, and went over to live at his Court, apprehending the Artifices of his Enemies, who had brought him into disfavour with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that ſent for him to make him give an accompt, and to deliver up his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The ſame City was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged and retaken afterwards by the Son of <hi>Chah-Abbas,</hi> and ſince that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged twice again, yet without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63063:157"/>
taken, by <hi>Chah-Jehan.</hi> The firſt time it was ſaved from being taken by the ill underſtanding and jealouſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Perſian</hi> Omrahs, that are Penſioners of the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> and the moſt powerful of his Court, as alſo by the reſpect they bear to their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral King: For they all behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very effeminately in the Siege, and would not follow the <hi>Raja Roup,</hi> who had already planted his Standards upon the Wall on the ſide of the Mountain. The ſecond time it was ſaved by the jealouſie of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> who would not fall into the breach of the Wall, that our <hi>Franguis,</hi> the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, Portugueſes, Germans,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> had made by their Canon, though it was a large one; being unwilling to have it ſaid, that in the time of <hi>Dara,</hi> who was in a manner the firſt mover of that Enterpriſe, and was then in the City of <hi>Caboul,</hi> with his Father <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> the Fortreſs of <hi>Kandahar</hi> was taken. <hi>Chah-Jehan,</hi> ſome years before the late trouble, was alſo ready to beſiege it the third time, had not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63063:157"/>
                     <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> diverted him from it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing him to turn his Forces towards <hi>Decan,</hi> (as hath been ſaid;) with whom <hi>Aly-Merdan-kan</hi> himſelf concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who was ſo earneſt in his diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him from it, as to ſay to him theſe words, which I ſhall punctually relate, as having ſomething extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant in them:</p>
                  <p>Your Majesty will never take <hi>Kanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har,</hi> unleſs you had ſuch a Traytor there as my ſelf; except you were reſolved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to bring a <hi>Perſian</hi> into it, and to make the Bazars or Markets wholly free, that is, to lay no Impoſt on thoſe that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Army with proviſion.</p>
                  <p>At length, <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> like the others, had prepared himſelf in theſe latter years to beſiege it alſo; whether it was that he was offended at the tart Letters, written to him by the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> or by reaſon of the affronts and ill treatment which he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to <hi>Tarbiet-kan</hi> his Ambaſſador; that hearing of the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s death, he turned back, ſaying, (which yet is not very credible) that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63063:158"/>
he would not meddle with a Child, a new King; although <hi>Chah-Soliman,</hi> who hath ſucceeded his Father, is, in my opinion, about 25 years of age.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſixth</hi> particular we purpoſed to ſpeak of, concerns thoſe that have faithfully ſerved <hi>Aureng-Z be.</hi> Thoſe he hath almoſt all raiſed to great pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For firſt, as we have already related, he made <hi>Chah-heſt-kan,</hi> his Uncle, Governour and General of the Army of <hi>Decan,</hi> and afterwards, Governour of <hi>Bengale.</hi> Next, he made <hi>Mir-kan</hi> Governour of <hi>Kaboul;</hi> Then <hi>Kalilullah-kan,</hi> of <hi>Lahor;</hi> and <hi>Mirhaba,</hi> of <hi>Elubas;</hi> and <hi>Lasker-kan,</hi> of <hi>Patna.</hi> The Son of that <hi>Allah-Verdi-kan</hi> of <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi> he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Governour of <hi>Scimdy;</hi> and <hi>Fazel-kan,</hi> who had conſiderably ſerved him both by his counſels and dexterity, he made <hi>Kane-ſaman,</hi> that is, Great Steward of the Houſe Royal: And <hi>Danechmend-kan,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dehli,</hi> with this particular grace and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſince he is perpetually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſtudies and forreign affairs,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63063:158"/>
he ſo diſpenſeth with him for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice a day (after the ancient cuſtom) to wait on the King in the Aſſembly, as not to retrench any thing of his penſion for his abſence, as he doth to the other Omrahs, if they fail. He hath given to <hi>Dianet-kan</hi> the Government of <hi>Kachmire</hi> (aliàs <hi>Caſſimere)</hi> that little, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner inacceſſible Kingdom, which <hi>Ekbar</hi> ſeized on by craft, that Earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of the <hi>Indies;</hi> which hath its Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories written in its peculiar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; whereof I have an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue, made by the command of <hi>Jehan Guyre,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a large Catalogue of many very ancient Kings, that often were ſo powerful, that they ſubdued the <hi>Indies</hi> as far as <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed <hi>Nejabat-kan,</hi> who did very well in the two Battels of <hi>Samonguer</hi> and <hi>Kadjoue,</hi> but then 'tis not fit at all, that a Subject ſhould ever reproach his King, as he did, with the ſervices done him.</p>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:63063:159"/>
As to thoſe infamous men, <hi>Gion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan</hi> and <hi>Nazer,</hi> 'tis known, that the former hath been recompenced as he deſerved; but the other no man knows what is become of him.</p>
                  <p>What concerns <hi>Jeſſomſeigne</hi> and <hi>Jeſſeigne,</hi> there is ſomething as to them that is intricate, which I ſhall endeavour to unfold. There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Heathen revolted from the King of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> who knew how to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf of many important For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and of ſome Sea-ports of that King. His name is <hi>Seva-Gi,</hi> that is, Lord <hi>Seva.</hi> He is a ſtout man, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, bold, and undertaking in the higheſt degree, who gave <hi>Chah-heſt-kan</hi> more work and trouble in <hi>Decan,</hi> than the King of <hi>Viſapour</hi> with all his forces, and all his <hi>Raja</hi>'s joyned with him for their common defence: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that having deſigned to take away <hi>Chah-heſt-kan</hi> and his Treaſures out of the midſt of his Army and of the Town <hi>Aurenge-Abad,</hi> he carried on his deſign ſo far, that he had effected it, if he had not been diſcovered a little
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63063:159"/>
too ſoon; for one night, accompanied with a number of reſolute Fellows he hath about him, he was got into the very apartment of <hi>Chah-heſt-kan,</hi> where his Son, who was forward in the defence, was killed, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf grievouſly wounded; <hi>Seva-Gi</hi> in the mean time getting away as well as he came: Who for all this was ſo far from being daunted, that he undertook another very bold and very dangerous enterpriſe, which ſucceeded much better. He took two or three Thouſand choſen men of his Army, with whom he took the Field without noiſe, ſpreading a report by the way, that it was a <hi>Raja</hi> going to the Court. When he was near <hi>Suratte,</hi> that Famous and Rich Port of the <hi>Indies,</hi> inſtead of Marching further (as he made the Great Provoſt of that Country, whom he met, believe) he fell into that Town, where he ſtaid about three Dayes, cutting off the Arms and Legs of the Inhabitants, to make them confeſs where were the treaſures;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63063:160"/>
ſearching, digging, and loading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or burning what he could not carry with him. Which done, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, none oppoſing his return, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with millions of Gold, Silver, Pearls, Silken Stuffs, Fine Linnen, and other rich Merchandiſe. <hi>Jeſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne</hi> was ſuſpected to have had ſince intelligence with this <hi>ſeva-Gi,</hi> which was the cauſe that <hi>Aureng Zebe</hi> called him away from <hi>Decan;</hi> but he, inſtead of going to <hi>Dehli,</hi> went to his own Territory.</p>
                  <p>I forgot to mention, that in the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Suratte,</hi> that Ring-leader <hi>Seva-Gi,</hi> like a Saint, had ſo much reſpect to the Houſe of the Reverend Father <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> a Miſſionary <hi>Capucian,</hi> that he gave order it ſhould not be plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; becauſe, ſaid he, I know that the Fathers <hi>Franguis</hi> are good men. He had alſo regard to the Houſe of the Deceaſed <hi>De Lale,</hi> becauſe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he had been Great Almoner. He alſo conſider'd the Houſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> not from Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, as he did the former, but becauſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63063:160"/>
they were in a good poſture of defence; eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who having had time to ſend for aſſiſtance from ſome of their ſhips that lay near the Town, behaved themſelves gallantly, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, beſides their own, ſeveral other houſes near them. But a certain <hi>Jew</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who had brought Rubies of a very great value, to ſell them to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> carried away the Bell from all, by ſaving himſelf from the hands of <hi>Seva-Gi;</hi> for, rather than to confeſs that he had any Jewels, he was brought thrice upon his knees, and the knife held up to cut his throat: But it became none ſave a <hi>Jew,</hi> hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in avarice, to eſcape in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>Touching <hi>Jeſſeigne,</hi> King <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> made him content to go General of the Army in <hi>Decan,</hi> ſending <hi>Sultan-Mazum</hi> with him, without any power. He preſently and vigorouſly beſieged the principal Fortreſs of <hi>Seva-Gi,</hi> and knowing more than all the reſt in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Negotiation and Treaty, he ſo ordered the buſineſs, that <hi>Seva-Gi</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63063:161"/>
rendred before it came to extremity; and then he drew him to <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>'s party againſt <hi>Viſapour,</hi> King <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> declaring him a <hi>Raja,</hi> taking him under his protection, and giving the penſion of a very conſiderable <hi>Omrah</hi> to his Son. Some time after, <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> deſigning to make War againſt <hi>Perſia,</hi> wrote to <hi>Seva-Gi</hi> ſuch obliging Letters touching his Generoſity, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Conduct, that he made him reſolve, upon the faith of <hi>Jeſſeigne,</hi> to come to him to <hi>Dehli.</hi> There a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Chah-heſt-kan</hi> (who was then at Court) by the influence ſhe had upon the ſpirit of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> perſwaded him to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt him that had murdered her Son, wounded her Husband, and ſacked <hi>Suratte:</hi> So that one evening <hi>Seva-Gi</hi> ſaw his Pavilions beſet with three or four <hi>Omrahs;</hi> but he made ſhift to get away in the night. This eſcape made a great noiſe at Court, every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing the Eldeſt Son of the Raja <hi>Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne</hi> to have aſſiſted him in it. <hi>Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne,</hi> who preſently had news that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63063:161"/>
                     <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was very angry with him and his Son, and was adviſed no more to go to the Court, was day and night upon his guard, apprehending leſt <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ſhould take this for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to fall upon his Lands, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf of them. Whereupon he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſoon left <hi>Decan</hi> to ſecure his Eſtate; but when he was at <hi>Brampour,</hi> he died. Yet notwithſtanding <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> was ſo far from expreſſing any coldneſs or reſentment to the Son of <hi>Jeſſeigne,</hi> that he ſent to condole with him for the Death of his Father, and continued to him his Penſion; which confirms what many ſay, that it was by the conſent of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> himſelf, that <hi>Seva-Gi</hi> eſcaped, foraſmuch as he could retain him no longer at Court, becauſe all the Women there had too great a ſpleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and looked upon him as a man that had embroiled his hands in the blood of his Kinſmen.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Decan,</hi> we are to conſider, that that is a Kingdom, which theſe forty years hath conſtantly been the Theater of War, and upon the

                  <p>All this great Peninſule of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> cutting it from the Bay of <hi>Cambaja</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of <hi>Bengale,</hi> near <hi>Jaganrate,</hi> and paſſing thence to Cape <hi>Comori,</hi> was ſearce two hundred years ſince entirely (ſome mountanous parts excepted) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of one only Prince, who conſequently was a very great and very potent Monarch: But now it is divided among many different Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, that are alſo of different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. The cauſe of this diviſion was, that the King <hi>Ramras,</hi> the laſt of thoſe that have poſſeſſed this mighty State entirely, did imprudently raiſe three Slaves, <hi>Gurgis,</hi> he had about him too high, ſo as to make them all three Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of places: The <hi>first,</hi> of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of thoſe Countries, which at

Theſe three Slaves and their poſterity have alwayes defended themſelves very well in their Kingdoms, whilſt they kept a good mutual correſpondence, and aſſiſted one another in their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous wars againſt the <hi>Mogols.</hi> But when they once came to think every one to defend their Lands apart, they ſoon found the effects of their diviſion. For the <hi>Mogol</hi> ſo well knew to take his time upon that occaſion (which is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty five or forty years ſince) that he poſſeſſed himſelf within a little time of all the Countrey of <hi>Nejam-Chah,</hi> or King <hi>Nejam,</hi> the fifth or ſixth of the family of the firſt Slave, and at laſt took him priſoner in <hi>Daulet-Abud,</hi> the Capital, where he died.</p>
                  <p>After that time, the Kings of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konda</hi> have maintained themſelves well enough; not as if they could compare with the power of the <hi>Mogol,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Mogol</hi> hath alwayes been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt the two others; from whom he was to take <hi>Amber, Paranda, Bider,</hi> and ſome other places, before he could conveniently march towards
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63063:164"/>
                     <hi>Golkonda.</hi> And becauſe they have always been ſo politick, being very opulent, as to furniſh under hand the King of <hi>Viſapour</hi> with Money, and thereby to help him to maintain a War againſt the <hi>Mogol:</hi> Beſides that, they ever have a conſiderable Army on foot, which is alwayes ready, and never fails to take the Field, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Frontiers, at the time when there is news that that of the <hi>Mogol</hi> marches againſt <hi>Viſapour;</hi> to let the <hi>Mogol</hi> ſee, not only that they are alwayes ready to defend themſelves, but alſo that they could eaſily aſſiſt the King of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> in caſe he ſhould be reduced to any extremity. Next, which is very conſiderable, they know alſo how to convey Money un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand to the Chieftains of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golian</hi> Army; who thereupon adviſe the Court, that it is more to purpoſe to attack <hi>Viſapour,</hi> as being nearer to <hi>Daulet-Abad.</hi> Further, they ſend eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year very conſiderable Preſents to the Great <hi>Mogol,</hi> by way of Tribute; which conſiſt partly in ſome rare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63063:165"/>
of the Countrey; partly in Elephants, which they ſend for from <hi>Pegu, Siam,</hi> and <hi>Ceilan,</hi> partly in fair ready money. Laſtly, the <hi>Mogol</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that Kingdom as his own, not only becauſe he looks upon the King thereof as his Tributary, but chiefly ſince that agrement heretofore ſpoken of, which the preſent King made with <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> when he beſieged <hi>Golkon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> and there being alſo no place able to reſiſt, even from <hi>Daulet-Abad</hi> unto <hi>Golkonda,</hi> he judgeth, that when he ſhall think fit to puſh for it, he may take in the whole Kingdom in one Campagne; which in my opinion, he would certainly have done, if he did not apprehend, leſt ſending his Forces towards <hi>Golkonda,</hi> the King of <hi>Viſapour</hi> ſhould enter into <hi>Decan;</hi> as, no doubt, he would do, knowing it to be very important to his conſervation, that that Kingdom may alwayes ſubſiſt as now it is.</p>
                  <p>From all which, ſomething may be underſtood of the Intereſts and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the King of <hi>Golkonda</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:63063:165"/>
with the <hi>Mogol,</hi> and what way he taketh to ſupport himſelf againſt him. Yet notwithſtanding all this, I find this ſtate much ſhaken, in regard that the King that now is, ſince that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py affair of <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> and <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> ſeems to have loſt heart, and as 'twere abandoned the reins of the Kingdom, not daring any more to go forth of this Fortreſs of <hi>Golkonda,</hi> nor ſo much as appear in publick to give Audience to his People, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Juſtice according to the cuſtom of the Country: Which diſcompoſeth things very much, and occaſions the Grandees to tyrannize over the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſort of People, and to loſe even their reſpect to the King, often ſlighting his Commands, and conſidering him no more than a Woman; and the People, weary of the injuſtice and ill treatment, breathing after nothing but <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi> 'Tis eaſie to judge of the ſtreights this poor King is in, by four or five particulars I am about to relate.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, that <hi>An.</hi> 1667. when I was
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63063:166"/>
at <hi>Golkonda,</hi> King <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent an Ambaſſador Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to declare War to that King, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he would furniſh him with 10000 Horſe againſt <hi>Viſapour,</hi> he did extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary honour, and give exceſſive preſents to that Ambaſſador, as well for him in particular, as for <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and made an agreement with him, to ſend him, not 10000 Horſe, but as much Money as is neceſſary to maintain ſo many; which was all that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> looked for.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>'s Ambaſſador in Ordinary, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at <hi>Golkonda,</hi> commands, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, ſtriketh, gives Paſs-ports, and ſaith and doth whatſoever he will, no man daring with the leaſt word to croſs him.</p>
                  <p>The third is, that <hi>Mahmet-Emir-kan,</hi> the Son of <hi>Emir-Jemla,</hi> though he be no more than a ſimple Omrah of <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> is yet ſo much reſpected through that whole Kingdom, and eſpecially in <hi>Maſlipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> that the <hi>Taptata,</hi> his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63063:166"/>
is as 'twere Maſter thereof, buying and ſelling, bringing in and ſending abroad his Merchants Ships, no body daring to contradict him in any thing, not to demand any Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms. So great was once the power of <hi>Emir-Jemla</hi> his Father in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which time hath not yet been able to root out.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſcruple not to threaten him ſometimes, to lay an Embargo upon all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships of the Country that are in that Port, and not to let them go out, untill their demands be granted; as alſo to put in proteſtations againſt him: which I have ſeen actually done, upon the account of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel, which they had a mind to take by force in the Port of <hi>Maſlipatan</hi> it ſelf, the Governour having hindred it, by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the whole Town againſt them, and threatning to put fire to their Factory, and to put them all to death.</p>
                  <p>A fifth is, that the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> as poor, and miſerable, and decayed as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63063:167"/>
they are in the <hi>Indies,</hi> yet ſtick not to threaten that King alſo with War; and that they will come and ſack <hi>Maſlipatan,</hi> and all that Coaſt, if he will not render them that place of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> which ſome years ago they choſe to put into his hands, rather than to be conſtrained to yield it up to the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet for all this, I have been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Golkonda,</hi> by very intelligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that this King is a Prince of very great judgment, and that whatever he ſo does and ſuffers, is only in policy, to the end to provoke no body, and principally to remove all ſuſpition from <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> and to give him to underſtand, that he hath in a manner no ſhare any more in the Kingdom: But that in the mean time a Son of his, that is kept hid, grows up, the Father watching for a fit time to declare him King, and ſo to laugh at the agreement made with <hi>Aureng-Zebe.</hi> Of this, time will ſhew us more; in the mean time, let us conſider ſomewhat of the Intereſts of <hi>Viſapour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:63063:167"/>
The Kingdom of <hi>Viſapour</hi> hath alſo not been wanting to ſupport it ſelf, though the <hi>Mogol</hi> do almoſt continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make war againſt it; not ſo much as if he of <hi>Viſapour</hi> were able to bid head to the <hi>Mogolian</hi> Forces, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is never any great effort u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt him. For it is not very frequent there, no more than 'tis elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, for Generals of Armies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the end of a War; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo charming, as to be in the head of an Army, commanding like little Kings, remote from the Court. It is alſo grown to a Proverb, that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> is the Bread and Life of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Indoſtan.</hi> Beſides, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Viſapour</hi> is on the ſide of the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Dominions of a very difficult acceſs, upon the account of the ſearci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of good Waters, Forrage, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals; and becauſe <hi>Viſapour,</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City, is very ſtrong, and ſituate in a dry and ſteril Countrey, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt no good Water but in the Town. And laſtly, becauſe there are many Fortreſſes in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63063:168"/>
ſeated on Hills hard to climb.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, that State is much ſhaken, if conſidering that the <hi>Mogol</hi> hath taken <hi>Paranda,</hi> the Key, as 'twere, of that Kingdom; as alſo that fair and ſtrong Town <hi>Bider,</hi> and ſome other very important places: But principally becauſe the laſt King of <hi>Viſapour</hi> died without Heirs Males, and he that now calls himſelf King, is a Youth, whom the Queen, Siſter of the King of <hi>Golkonda,</hi> hath raiſed, and taken for her Son (a favour for which he hath made an ill return, having ſhew'd no eſteem for this Queen after her return from <hi>Mecca,</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of ſome ill demeanour in her on a <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel that carried her to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka:)</hi> Laſtly, becauſe that in the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that Kingdom, the Heathen Rebel, <hi>Seva-Gi,</hi> above diſcourſed of, found means to ſeize on many ſtrong Holds, moſtly ſeated on ſteep Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, where he now acteth the King, laughing at the <hi>Viſapour</hi> and the <hi>Mogol,</hi> and ravaging the Countrey every where, from <hi>Suratte</hi> even to the gates
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63063:168"/>
of <hi>Goa.</hi> This notwithſtanding, if he wrongs <hi>Viſapour</hi> one way, he helps to ſupport it another, foraſmuch as he is reſolutely bent againſt the <hi>Mogol,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring alwayes ſome Ambuſh, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo much work for his Army, that there is no diſcourſe, no apprehenſion but of <hi>Seva-Gi;</hi> inſomuch that he hath come and ſacked <hi>Suratte,</hi> and pillaged the Iſle of <hi>Burdes,</hi> which belongs to the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and is near the Gates of <hi>Goa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſeventh</hi> particular, which I learn'd at <hi>Golkonda,</hi> when I was come away from <hi>Dehli,</hi> is the death of <hi>Chah-Jehan;</hi> and that <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> had been exceedingly affected therewith, having diſcover'd all the marks of grief, that a Son can expreſs for the loſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: That at the very hour of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that news, he went towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra;</hi> that <hi>Begum-Saheb</hi> cauſed the Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quee, and a certain place, where he was at firſt to ſtop, before he entred the Fortreſs, to be hung with richly embroider'd Tapiſſeries: That at his entring into the Seraglio, ſhe preſented
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63063:169"/>
him with a great Golden Baſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were all her Jewels, and all thoſe of <hi>Chah-Jehan;</hi> and in ſhort, that ſhe knew to receive him with ſo much Magnificence, and to entertain him with that dexterity and craft, that ſhe obtained his pardon, gain'd his favour, and grew very confident with him.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I doubt not, but moſt of thoſe, who ſhall have read my Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, will judge the wayes taken by <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> for getting the Empire, very violent and horrid. I pretend not at all to plead for him, but deſire only, that before he be altogether condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reflexion be made on that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py cuſtom of this State, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſucceſſion of the Crown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided, for want of good Laws, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, as amongſt us, upon the eldeſt Son, expoſeth it to the Con queſt of the ſtrongeſt, and the moſt fortunate, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting at the ſame time all the Princes born in the Royal Family, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Birth, to the cruel ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity either to overcome, or to reign, by deſtroying all the reſt, for the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63063:169"/>
of their power and life, or to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh themſelves, for the ſecurity of that of others: For I am apt to believe, that upon this conſideration the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wil not find <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi>'s conduct ſo ſtrange as at firſt it appear'd. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I am perſwaded, that thoſe who ſhall a little weigh this whole Hiſtory, will not take <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> for a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, but for a great and rare Genius, a Great States-man, and a Great King.</p>

I ſhall doubtleſs pleaſe you better, by endeavouring to give you ſome <hi>Idea</hi> of the ſtate of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63063:171"/>
I have engaged my ſelf to give you an account of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> you may have ſeen before this, by the Maps of <hi>Aſia,</hi> how great every way is the extent of the Empire of the Great <hi>Mogol,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd <hi>India</hi> or <hi>Indoſtan.</hi> I have not meaſur'd it Mathematically; but to ſpeak of it according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry journeys of the Country, after the rate of three whole Months March, traverſing from the Frontiers of the Kingdom of <hi>Golkonda,</hi> as far as beyond <hi>Kazni</hi> near <hi>Kandahar,</hi> which is the firſt Town of <hi>Perſia,</hi> I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf otherwiſe, but that it is at leaſt five times as far as from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Lyons,</hi> that is, about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred common Leagues.</p>
                  <p>Next, you may pleaſe to take notice, that of that vaſt extent of Land, there are large Countries that are very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, and ſome of them to that degree (for example, that whole great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Bengale)</hi> that they exceed thoſe of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not only upon the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63063:172"/>
account of the abundance of Rice, Corn, and all other things neceſſary for life, but alſo upon the ſcore of all thoſe Commodities ſo conſiderable, which <hi>Egypt</hi> is deſtitute of, as Silks, Cottons, Indigo, and ſo many others, ſufficiently related by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that of theſe ſame Countries there are many that are well enough peopled and cultivated, and where Trades-men, though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally very lazy there, are not wanting, either from neceſſity or other Cauſes, to apply themſelves to work, as to Tapiſſeries, Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries, Cloth of Gold and Silver, and to all thoſe kinds of Silk and Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Manufactures, that are uſed in the Countrey, or tranſported to other parts.</p>
                  <p>You may further obſerve, how that Gold and Silver circulating as it were upon the Earth, comes at laſt in part to be ſwallowed up in this <hi>Indoſtan.</hi> For of that which comes
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63063:172"/>
out of <hi>America,</hi> and is diſperſed through the ſeveral Kingdoms of our <hi>Europe,</hi> we know, that one part is carried into <hi>Turky</hi> many wayes, for the Commodities drawn thence; and that another part is conveyed into <hi>Perſia,</hi> by the way of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> for the Silks afforded there: That all <hi>Turky</hi> generally needs <hi>Coffee,</hi> which comes out of <hi>Hyeman</hi> or <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Arabia,</hi> and is the common Drink of the <hi>Turks:</hi> That the ſame <hi>Turky</hi> as well as <hi>Hyeman</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> cannot be without the Commodities of <hi>India;</hi> and that thus all thoſe Countries are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to carry to <hi>Moka</hi> over the Red-Sea, near <hi>Babelmandel;</hi> and to <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſora</hi> the utmoſt part of the <hi>Perſian-Gulf;</hi> and to <hi>Bandar-Abbaſi,</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moron</hi> near to <hi>Ormus,</hi> a part of that Gold and Silver, that had been brought into their Country, to be thence tranſported into <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> in Veſſels, that yearly, in the ſeaſon of the <hi>Mounſons,</hi> come purpoſely to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63063:173"/>
thoſe three famous parts: That on the other hand, all thoſe Ships of <hi>India,</hi> whether they be <hi>Indian</hi> ones, or <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> that every year Tranſport Merchandiſe out of <hi>Indostan</hi> to <hi>Pegu, Tanaſſeri, Siam, Ceilan, Achem, Macaſſer,</hi> the <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dives, Moſambic,</hi> and other places, bring back alſo much Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from all thoſe Countries, which meets with the ſame Deſtiny, that the other doth: That of that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Gold and Silver which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> draw from <hi>Japan</hi> (which is ſtored with Mines) a part alſo comes to be at length diſcharged in this <hi>Indoſtan;</hi> And that laſtly what is carried thither directly by Sea, whether from <hi>Portugal, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> ſeldom comes back from thence but in Merchandiſe, the reſt remaining there, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>I very well know, that it may be ſaid, that this <hi>Indoſtan</hi> needs Copper, Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinamon, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and ſundry other things,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63063:173"/>
which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> carry thither from <hi>Japan,</hi> the <hi>Molucques, Ceilan,</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> as alſo that it hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for Lead, which in part, it is furniſh'd with out of <hi>England;</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for Scarlet, which it hath from <hi>France;</hi> Moreover, that it ſtands in need of a good number of Horſes, it being certain, that from the ſide of <hi>Usbec</hi> it receives yearly more than 2500. That out of <hi>Perſia</hi> alſo it is furniſhed with abundance of the ſame; as alſo out of <hi>Ethiopia, Arabia,</hi> the Ports of <hi>Moka, Baſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and <hi>Bander-abbaſy:</hi> Beſides that it needs that ſtore of freſh Fruit, which comes thither from <hi>Samar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kand, Ball-bocara,</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> as Melons, Apples, Pears, and Grapes, that are ſpent at <hi>Dehli,</hi> and bought at great Rates, almoſt all the Winter long; as well as dry Fruit, which are had there all the year long, and come from the ſame Countries, as Almonds, Piſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Nuts, Prunes, Abricots, Raiſins, and the like: And that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63063:174"/>
laſtly, it wants thoſe little ſea-cockles of the <hi>Maldives,</hi> which ſerve for common Coyn in <hi>Bengale,</hi> and in ſome other places; as alſo Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griece, carried thither from the ſaid <hi>Maldives</hi> and <hi>Moſambic,</hi> Rhinoceros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns, Elephants-teeth, Musk, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na-diſhes, Pearls of <hi>Baharen,</hi> and <hi>Tutucoury</hi> near <hi>Ceilan;</hi> and, I know not of how many other things of this kind.</p>
                  <p>But all this makes not the Gold and Silver to go out of that Empire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Merchants at their return freight their ſhips with the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the Country, finding a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account by ſo doing, than if they ſhould bring back Money, ſo that that hinders not, but that <hi>Indoſtan</hi> proves, as we have ſaid, a kind of abyſs for a great part of the Gold and Silver of the World, which finds many ways to enter there, and almoſt none to iſſue thence.</p>
                  <p>In a word, you may take notice, that this <hi>Great Mogol</hi> makes himſelf heir of the <hi>Omrahs</hi> or Lords, and of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63063:174"/>
the <hi>Manſeb-dars,</hi> or petty Lords, that are in his Pay; and (which is of very great conſequence) that all the Lands of that Expire are his propriety, excepting ſome Houſes and Gardens, which he giveth leave to his Subjects to ſell, divide, or buy amongſt them, as they ſhall think fit.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the things, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhow, <hi>both</hi> that there muſt needs be a very great ſtore of Gold and Silver in <hi>Indostan,</hi> though there be no Mines; <hi>and</hi> alſo that the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> the Soveraign of the ſame, at leaſt, of the beſt part of it, hath immenſe Revenues and Riches.</p>
                  <p>But on the other hand, there are alſo many things to be obſerved, which are a poiſe to theſe Riches. The <hi>firſt,</hi> that among thoſe vaſt tracts of Land there is much, which is nothing but ſand and ſterill Mountains, little Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or Peopled: That even of thoſe that would be fertile, there is much, that is not uſed for want of Workmen, ſome of which have periſh'd by the too evil treatment of the Governours,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63063:175"/>
who often take from them their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary lively-hood, and ſometimes their very Children whom they make ſlaves when they are not able, or are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pay: Others have abandoned the Field for the ſame reaſon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding out of the conſideration that they labour'd only for others, have caſt themſelves into Towns or into Armies, to ſerve there for Porters, or waiting men, and many have fled to the lands of the <hi>Rajas,</hi> becauſe there they found leſs tyranny, and more kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, That in this ſame extent of Country there are ſundry Nations, which the <hi>Mogol</hi> is not full Maſter of, moſt of them retaining yet their particular Sovereigns and Lords, that obey him not, nor pay him tribute but from conſtraint; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that do little; ſome that do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; and ſome alſo, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive tribute from him, as we ſhall ſee anon. Such are thoſe petty Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, that are ſeated on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who almoſt never pay him any thing, no more than they do
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63063:175"/>
to the King of <hi>Perſia:</hi> As alſo the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louches</hi> and <hi>Augans,</hi> and other Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers, of whom alſo the greateſt part pay him but a ſmall matter, and even care but very little for him: witneſs the affront they did him, when they ſtopp'd his whole Army by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Water, which they kept back within the Mountains, when he paſſed from <hi>Atek</hi> on the River <hi>Indus</hi> to <hi>Caboul,</hi> to lay ſiege to <hi>Kandahar;</hi> not ſuffering the Water to run down into the Fields, where was the High-way, 'till they had received preſents, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they asked them by way of Alms. Such are alſo the <hi>Patans,</hi> a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> People, iſſued from the ſide of the River <hi>Ganges</hi> towards <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale;</hi> who before the Invaſion of the <hi>Mogols</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> had taken their time to make themſelves potent in many places, and chiefly at <hi>Dehli,</hi> and to render many <hi>Rajas</hi> thereabout their Tributaries. Theſe <hi>Patans</hi> are fierce and warlike, and even the meaneſt of them, though they be waiting men and porters, are ſtill of a very
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63063:176"/>
high ſpirit, being often heard to ſay by way of ſwearing; <hi>Let me never be King of</hi> Dehli, <hi>if it be not ſo:</hi> A Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that deſpiſe the <hi>Indians, Heathen,</hi> and <hi>Mogols,</hi> and mortally hate the laſt, ſtill remembring what they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, before they were by them dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away from their large Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and conſtrained to retire hither and thither, far from <hi>Dehli,</hi> and <hi>Agra,</hi> into the Mountains, where now they are ſetled, and where ſome of them have made themſelves petty Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, like <hi>Rajas,</hi> but of ſmall ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Such an one alſo is the King of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> who pays to the <hi>Magol</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and is always in War with him; maintaining himſelf in his Country, partly by his own forces, partly becauſe he is very remote from <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Dehli,</hi> the ordinary places of Reſidence of the Great <hi>Mogol;</hi> partly alſo becauſe his Capital City <hi>Viſapour</hi> is ſtrong and of difficult acceſs to an Army, by reaſon of the ill Waters and the want of Forrage on the way;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63063:176"/>
and partly becauſe many <hi>Rajas</hi> joyn with him for their common defence, as did the famous <hi>Seva-gi,</hi> who not long ſince came pillaging and burning that rich Sea-port, <hi>Suratte,</hi> and who ſometimes will pay little or no Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</p>
                  <p>Such is likwiſe that potent and rich King of <hi>Golkonda,</hi> who under-hand gives Money to the King of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> and hath always an Army ready on the Frontiers for his own defence, and for the aſſiſtance of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> in caſe he find him too much preſſed.</p>
                  <p>Of the like ſort are more than an hundred <hi>Rajas,</hi> or conſiderable <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Sovereigns, diſperſed through the whole Empire, ſome near to, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers remote from <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Dehli:</hi> amongſt whom there are about fifteen or ſixteen that are very rich and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; ſuch as is <hi>Rana</hi> (who formerly was, as 'twere, Emperour of the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jas;</hi> and who is ſaid to be of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny of King <hi>Porus;) Jeſſeignae</hi> and <hi>Jeſſom ſeignae,</hi> which are ſo great and powerful, that if they three alone
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63063:177"/>
ſhould combine, they would hold him tack; each of them being able, in a very ſhort time to raiſe and bring into the Field Twenty five thouſand Horſe, better Troops than the <hi>Mogols.</hi> Theſe Caveliers are called <hi>Ragipouts,</hi> or the Children of <hi>Rajas.</hi> They are men, who, as I have elſewhere ſaid, carry Swords from Father to Son, and to whom the <hi>Rajas</hi> allot Land, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be always ready to appear on Horſeback, when the <hi>Raja</hi> commands. They can endure much hardſhip, and they want nothing to make them good Souldiers, but good Order and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing to be noted is, that the <hi>Mogol</hi> is a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> not of the Sect called <hi>Chias,</hi> who follow <hi>Aly</hi> and his off-ſpring, (ſuch as the <hi>Perſians</hi> are, and conſequently the greateſt part of his Court;) but of that, which follows <hi>Oſman,</hi> and thence are called <hi>Oſmanlys,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Turks</hi> are. Beſides, that he is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, being of the Race of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who was the head of thoſe <hi>Mogols,</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:63063:177"/>
that about the year 1401, over-ran <hi>India;</hi> where they made themſelves Maſters: ſo that he is in a Country, almoſt all hoſtile; and that the more, becauſe not only for one <hi>Mogol,</hi> but in general, for one <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> there are hundreds of <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Heathen;</hi> which obligeth him, conſtantly to entertain (for his defence among ſo many Domeſtick and Potent Enemies, and againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Usbecks,</hi> his Neighbours) very great Armies, whether in time of Peace or War, as well about his Perſon as in the Field; as well of the People of the Countrey, <hi>(Rajas</hi> and <hi>Patans,)</hi> as chiefly <hi>Mogoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or at leaſt eſteemed ſuch becauſe they are White, and <hi>Mahumetans;</hi> which ſufficeth at preſent; his Court being no more now as 'twas at firſt, conſiſting altogether of true <hi>Mogols;</hi> but a mixture of all ſorts of ſtrangers, <hi>Usbecks, Perſians, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> or their Children; but with this diſtinction, that the Children of the third or fourth generation, and that have taken the Brown colour,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63063:178"/>
and the ſoft humour of the Countrey, are not ſo much eſteem'd as the new comers; being alſo ſeldom raiſed to publick Offices; but counting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy, if they may ſerve as ſimple Horſemen or Foot.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe Armies I am now going to give you ſome deſcription, that thereby knowing the great expences, which the Grand <hi>Mogol</hi> is obliged to be at, you may the better judge of his true Riches; let us firſt take a view of the Field Militia, he is neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to maintain.</p>
                  <p>The chief thereof are the <hi>Rajas,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Jeſſeignae, Jeſſomſeignae,</hi> and many others, to whom he allows very great penſions to have them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready with a certain number of <hi>Ragipouts,</hi> eſteeming them like <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs,</hi> that is, like other Strangers, and <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Lords; both in the Army, that is always about his perſon, and in thoſe alſo, that are in the Field. Theſe <hi>Rajas</hi> are generally obliged to the ſame things, that the <hi>Omrahs</hi> are, even to the point of keeping guard;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63063:178"/>
yet with this diſtinction, that they keep not the guard within the Fortreſs, as thoſe, but without, under their Tents; they not liking to be ſhut up twenty four hours in a Fortreſs, nor ſo much as ever to go thither but well attended with Men reſolute to be cut in pieces for their ſervice; as hath appeared, when they have been ill dealt withal.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> is obliged to keep theſe <hi>Rajas</hi> in his ſervice for ſundry reaſons. The <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe the Militia of the <hi>Rajas</hi> is very good (as was ſaid above,) and becauſe there are <hi>Rajas,</hi> (as was intimated alſo) one of whom can bring into the Field above 25000 men. The <hi>Second,</hi> the better to bridle the other <hi>Rajas,</hi> and to reduce them to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when they cantonize, or when they refuſe to pay tribute, or when out of fear or other cauſe they will not go out of their Country to the Army, when the <hi>Mogol</hi> requireth it. The <hi>third,</hi> the better to nouriſh jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and keenneſs amongſt them, by Favouring and Careſſing the one
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63063:179"/>
more than the other, which is done to that degree, that they proceed to fight with one another very frequently.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth,</hi> to employ them againſt the <hi>Patans,</hi> or againſt his own <hi>Omrahs</hi> and Governours, in caſe any of them ſhould riſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fifth,</hi> to employ them againſt the King of <hi>Golkonda,</hi> when he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to pay his tribute, or when he will defend the King of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> or ſome <hi>Rajas</hi> his neighbours, which the <hi>Mogol</hi> hath a mind of rifle, or to make his tributaries; the <hi>Mogol</hi> in the thoſe caſes not daring to truſt his <hi>Omrahs</hi> overmuch, who moſt are <hi>Perſians,</hi> and not of the ſame Religion with him, but <hi>Chias,</hi> like the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Golkonda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſixth,</hi> and the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all, is, to employ them againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> upon occaſion; not daring then alſo to confide in his <hi>Omrahs,</hi> who for the greateſt part, as was juſt now ſaid, are <hi>Perſians,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have no ſtomach to Fight againſt their natural King; and the leſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63063:179"/>
they believe him to be their <hi>Imam,</hi> their <hi>Caliph</hi> or high Prieſt, deſcended from <hi>Aly,</hi> and againſt whom therefore they believe they cannot make War without a crime or a great ſin.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> is farther obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſome <hi>Patans</hi> for the ſame, or ſomewhat like reaſons, that he doth the <hi>Rajas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At laſt he muſt entertain that ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Militia of the <hi>Mogols,</hi> that we have taken notice of: And as this is the main ſtrength of his State, and which obliges him to incredible char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, me thinks it will not be amiſs to deſcribe to you, of what nature it is, though I ſhould be ſomewhat long in doing it.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore conſider, if you pleaſe, this ſtranger Militia, both Cavalry and Infantry, as divided into two; the <hi>one</hi> being always near the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol</hi>'s Perſon; the <hi>other,</hi> diſperſed up and down in the ſeveral Provinces. And in the Cavalry that is about his Perſon, let us firſt take notice of the <hi>Omrahs;</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:63063:180"/>
then, of the <hi>Manſebdars;</hi> next, of the <hi>Rouſindars;</hi> laſt of all, of the ſimple Horſemen. From thence let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Infantry, in which we ſhall conſider the Muſquetiers, and all thoſe men on foot that attend the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; where ſomething will occur to be ſaid of their Artillery.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be thought, that the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> or Lords of the <hi>Mogol's</hi> Court are Sons of great Families, as in <hi>France;</hi> All the Lands of that Empire being the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s propriety, it follows, that there are neither Dutchies, nor Marquiſats, nor any Family Rich in Land, and ſubſiſting of its own income and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And often enough they are not ſo much as <hi>Omrahs</hi> Sons, becauſe the King being Heir of all their Eſtates, it is conſequent that the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes cannot ſubſiſt long in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; on the contrary, they often fall and that on a ſudden, inſomuch that the Sons, or at leaſt the Grandſons of a Potent <hi>Omrah</hi> are frequently, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of their Father, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a manner to Beggery, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63063:180"/>
obliged to liſt themſelves under ſome <hi>Omrah</hi> for ſimple Horſemen. 'Tis true, that ordinarily the <hi>Mogol</hi> leaves ſome ſmall penſion to the Widow, and often alſo to the Children; or, if the Father liveth too long, he may by particular favour advance them ſooner, eſpecially if they be proper men, white of Face, having as yet not too much of the <hi>Indian</hi> Complexion and temper, and ſo paſſing yet for true <hi>Mogols:</hi> Though this advancement by favour do always proceed in a ſlow pace; it being almoſt a general cuſtom, that a man muſt paſs from ſmall Pays and ſmall Places to great ones. Theſe <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> then are commonly but Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers and Strangers of all ſorts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuch as I have ſaid; which draw one another to this Court; men of a mean deſcent, ſome of them ſlaves; moſt of them without inſtruction, which the <hi>Mogol</hi> thus raiſeth to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities as he thinks good, and degrades them again, as he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt theſe <hi>Omrahs,</hi> ſome are <hi>Hazary,</hi> others <hi>Dou Hazary,</hi> others
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63063:181"/>
                     <hi>Penge, Hecht,</hi> and <hi>Deh Hazary,</hi> and even (ſuch as was the the Kings eldeſt Son) <hi>Dovazdeh Hazary,</hi> that is to ſay, Lord of a thouſand Horſe, of two thouſand, five thouſand, ſeven, ten, and tweive thouſand; their pay being leſs or more in proportion to the number of Horſes; I ſay, of Horſes, becauſe they are not paid in reſpect of the Horſemen, but of the Horſe; the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> having power to entertain Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of two Horſes a man, to be the better able to ſerve in the hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, where 'tis a common ſaying, that the Horſeman that hath but one Horſe, is more than half a Footman. Yet we muſt not think, that they are obliged to entertain, or that the King effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pays ſo many Horſe, as theſe great names of <hi>Dovazdeh</hi> or <hi>Hecht Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zary</hi> do impart, that is, 12000 or 8000 Horſe. Theſe are ſpecious Names, to amuſe and attract Strangers; the King determines the number of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in actual ſervice, which they are bound to entertain, pays them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this number; and beſides
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63063:181"/>
that, he payes them a certain number which they are not bound to entertain; and this is that which ordinarily makes the principal part of their penſions; not to ſpeak of what they finger out of the pay of every Horſeman, and of the number of the Horſes; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly amounts to very conſiderable Penſions; eſpecially if they can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good <hi>Jah-ghirs,</hi> that is, good Lands for their Penſion. For I ſaw, that the Lord, under whom I was, that was a <hi>Penge-hazary,</hi> or one of five thouſand Horſe, and who was only obliged to entertain five hundred in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, had, after all his Cavalry was paid, remaining for his Penſion near five thouſand Crowns a Month; though he was <hi>Nagdy,</hi> that is, paid in Money drawn out of the Treaſury, as all thoſe are, that have not Lands. Yet notwithſtanding all theſe great Penſions, I ſee none but very few that are rich, but many that are uneaſie and indebted: Not that they are ruined by keeping too plentiful Tables, as elſewhere great Lords frequently are;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63063:182"/>
but that which exhauſteth them, are the great Preſents which they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to make to the King at certain Feſtivals of the year, every one after the rate of his pay; next, the vaſt expences they muſt be at for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Wives, Servants, Camels, and many Horſes of great value, which they keep in their particular Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
                  <p>The number of the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> as well of thoſe, that are in the Field in the Provinces and Armies, as of thoſe that are at the Court, is very great. I I never could precifely learn it; nor is it determined: But I have never ſeen leſs of them at Court, than twenty five or thirty, that are thus Penſionaries according to a greater or leſſer num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Horſes to be entertain'd by them, from 12000 downward to 1000. Theſe are the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> that arrive to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments and principal Offices of the Court and Armies; that are, as they ſpeak, the Pillars of the Empire, and that keep up the ſplendor of the Court; never going abroad, but richly deck'd,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63063:182"/>
ſometimes riding on Elephants, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on Horſeback, ſometimes carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a <hi>Paleky</hi> or Chair, commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a good number of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to wit, of thoſe that have the guard at that time, as alſo by many Foot-men, marching before and on his ſides, to make way, to drive away the Flies, to take off the duſt with Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks-tails, to carry water for drink, and ſometimes Books of Accounts, or other Papers.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe that are at Court, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, under a conſiderable penalty, to come twice every day to ſalute the King in the Aſſembly, once about ten or eleven a Clock in the morning, when he renders Juſtice; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, about ſix hours at night. They are alſo obliged by turns to keep the guard in the Caſtle once a week, during twenty four hours. Thither they carry at that time their Beds, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſſeries and other Moveables, the King furniſhing them with nothing but proviſions of Meat and Drink, which they receive with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63063:183"/>
making a treble obeiſance, with their face turned to his Apartment, their hands down to the ground, and then lifted up upon their heads. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they are obliged on horſeback to follow the King whitherſoever he marcheth in any weather, rainy or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, whether he be carried in his Chair, or on an Elephant, or a Field-Throne, which laſt is done by eight men carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him on their ſhoulders, eight others marching on his ſide, to relieve the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; himſelf being in all Marches well cover'd from the inconveniencies of the weather, whether he go to war, or to hunt, or to exerciſe his Souldiery. And this attendance thoſe <hi>Omrahs</hi> are to give, except ſome of them be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Mogol</hi> becauſe of their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Offices, or upon the account of ſickneſs or old age, or to avoid emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſment, as commonly 'tis practiſed, when he goeth only to ſome neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Town to hunt, or to ſome houſe of pleaſure, or to the Moſquee, there being then ſeldom any about him but thoſe that keep the Guard that day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:63063:183"/>
                     <hi>Manſebdars</hi> are Cavaliers of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb,</hi> which is particular and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pay; not ſo great indeed as that of the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> but much greater than that of the others; they being eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as little <hi>Omrahs,</hi> and of the rank of thoſe, that are raiſed to that dignity.</p>
                  <p>Theſe acknowledge alſo none for their Head but the King, and they are generally obliged to whatever we have ſaid the <hi>Omrahs</hi> are. In a word, they would be true <hi>Omrahs,</hi> if they had, as divers heretofore have had, ſome Horſemen under them; whereas they have ordinarily but two, four, or ſix Horſes having the Kings mark, and their pay goes no higher than from 200, to 600 or 700 <hi>Roupies</hi> a Month. Their number alſo is not fixed, but much exceeds that of the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> there being of them at the Court al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways two or three hundred, beſides thoſe that are in the Provinces and Armies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rouzindars</hi> are alſo a ſort of Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, but ſuch as have their pay by the day, (as the word it ſelf imports)
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63063:184"/>
which yet ſometimes is greater than that of many <hi>Manſebdars,</hi> but not ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; but then they are not bound, as the <hi>Manſebdars,</hi> to take at a ſet price (which ſometies is not too reaſonable) of thoſe Tapiſſeries and other Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuff, that hath ſerved for the Kings Pallace. Their number is very great; they enter into the meaner Offices, many of them being Clerks, under-Clerks, Signet-men, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simple Cavaliers,</hi> are thoſe, that are under the <hi>Omrahs;</hi> amongſt whom the moſt conſiderable and having moſt Pay are thoſe, that have two Horſes marked on the Leg with the mark of their <hi>Omrah.</hi> Their Pay is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely fixed, but depends chiefly from the generoſity of the <hi>Omrah,</hi> who may favour whom he pleaſeth. Yet the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s intention is, that the Pay of a ſimple Cavalier or Horſeman be no leſs than twenty five <hi>Roupies</hi> or thereabout a Month, ſtating his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cound with the <hi>Omrahs</hi> upon that Foot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:63063:184"/>
The pay of the Foot is the leaſt; and their Muſquetiers are pitiful men, unleſs they diſcharge when their Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket leans on that ſmall woodden fork hanging to it; yet even then they are afraid of ſingeing their great Beards, and of burning their Eyes, but moſt of all, leaſt ſome <hi>Dgen</hi> or evil ſpirit burſt their Musket. Some of theſe have 20 <hi>Roupies</hi> a Month, ſome 15, ſome 10. But yet there are ſome Gunners, that have great Pay, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the <hi>Franguis</hi> or <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as <hi>Portugueſes, Engliſh, Dutch, Germans, French,</hi> that retire thither from <hi>Goa,</hi> flying from <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies. Heretofore when the <hi>Mogols</hi> did not yet know how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage Artillery, their Pay was very great. And there are yet ſome of that time, who have 200 <hi>Roupies</hi> a Month; but now they will recieve none for more than thirty two.</p>
                  <p>Their Artillery is of two ſorts; the one is the great and heavy Artillery; the other the light. As for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63063:185"/>
I remember, that when the King after his Sickneſs went with his whole Army abroad into the Country, diverting himſelf every day in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſometimes of Cranes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the gray Oxen (a kind of Elks) ſometimes of Gazels, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards and Lions, and making his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs towards <hi>Lahor</hi> and <hi>Kachemire</hi> (that little paradiſe of <hi>India)</hi> there to paſs the Summer, the Army had ſeventy pieces of Cannon, moſt of them caſt, not counting the two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or three hundred Camels, carrying each a ſmall Field-piece of the bigneſs of a good double Musket, faſtned to thoſe Animals. The other light Artillery is very brave and well order'd, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of fifty or ſixty ſmall Field-pieces all of Braſs, each mounted on a little Chariot, very fine and well painted, with a ſmall Coffer before and behind for the Powder, drawn by two very fair Horſes, driven by a Coachman like a <hi>Caleche,</hi> adorned with a number of ſmall red Streamers, each having a third Horſe, led by the Chariot for relief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:63063:185"/>
The great Artillery could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes follow the King, who often left the High-way, and turn'd ſometimes to the right, ſometimes to the left hand, croſſing the fields, to find the true pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Game, and to follow the courſe of the Rivers. <hi>That</hi> therefore was to keep the High way to go the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, and to avoid the embaraſments, which it would have met with in the ill paſſages, eſpecially in thoſe Boat-Bridges made to paſs Rivers. The light Artillery is inſeparable from the perſon of the King, it marcheth away in the morning, when the King comes out of his Tent, and whereas he common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goes a little aſide into the places for game, this Artillery paſſeth on ſtraight with all poſſible ſpeed, to be in time at the Rendez-vous, and there to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Kings Tent, which is there made ready the day before; as are alſo the Tents of the great <hi>Omrahs:</hi> And this whole Artillery giveth a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley juſt when the Kihg enters into his Tent, thereby to give notice to the Army of his arrival.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:63063:186"/>
The Militia of the Field is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which is about the King: There are every where <hi>Omrahs, Manſebdars, Rouſindars,</hi> ſimple Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Foot and Artillery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any War is made. The difference is only in the number, which is much greater in the Field-Army, than in the other. For that Army alone, which the <hi>Mogol</hi> is conſtrained perpetually to maintain in <hi>Decan,</hi> to bridle the potent King of <hi>Golkonda,</hi> and to make War upon the King of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> and upon all the <hi>Raja's</hi> that joyn with him, muſt conſiſt at leaſt of twenty or twenty five thouſand Horſe, ſometimes of thirty.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Kaboul,</hi> for its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Guard againſt the <hi>Perſians, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Balouches,</hi> and I know not how many Mounteniers, requireth at leaſt fifteen thouſand. The Kingdom of <hi>Kachmire,</hi> more than four thouſand; and the Kingdom of <hi>Bengale,</hi> much more; not counting thoſe that are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the War, which muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt alwayes be maintained on that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63063:186"/>
ſide; nor thoſe which the Governors of the ſeveral Provinces do need for their defence, according to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular extent and ſituation of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments; which maketh an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible number.</p>
                  <p>Not to mention the Infantry (which is inconſiderable) I am apt to believe with many others, well informed of theſe matters, that the number of the Horſe in actual ſervice about the Kings perſon, comprehending the Cavalry of the <hi>Raja's</hi> and <hi>Patans,</hi> mounteth to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five or forty thouſand; and that this number, joyned to thoſe that is abroad in the Field, may make two hundred thouſand, and better.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, that the Infantry is inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; for I can hardly believe, that in the Army which is about the King, compriſing the Muſquetiers, and all the Gunners and their Mates, and whatever ſerves in this Artillery, can amount to much more than fifteen thouſand; whence you may make a near gueſs, what the number of the Foot muſt be in the Field. So
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63063:187"/>
that I know not whence to take that prodigious number of Foot, which ſome do reckon in the Armies of the Great <hi>Mogol,</hi> unleſs it be, that with this true Souldiery they confound all the Serving-men and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualers, that follow the Army; for in that ſence I ſhould eaſily believe, that they had reaſon to reckon two or three hundred thouſand men in that Army alone which is with the King, and ſometimes more; eſpecially when 'tis certain, that he is to be long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Capital City: which will not ſeem ſo ſtrange to him, that conſiders the multitude and confuſion of Tents, Kitchens, Baggage, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Elephants, Camels, Oxen, Horſes, Waiting-men, Porters, Forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Victualers, Merchants of all ſorts, that muſt follow the Army; nor to him, that knows the State and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Government of that Countrey, wherein the King is the ſole proprietor of all the Lands of the Kingdom; whence it neceſſarily follows, that a whole Metropolitan City, ſuch as <hi>Deh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:63063:187"/>
and <hi>Agra,</hi> liveth of almoſt nothing but of the Souldiery, and is conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to follow the King when he taketh the Field; thoſe Towns being nothing leſs than <hi>Paris,</hi> but indeed no otherwiſe governed than a Camp of Armies a little better and more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently lodged than in the open Field.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all theſe things, you may alſo conſider, if you pleaſe, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all this Militia, which I have been repreſenting to you, from the greateſt <hi>Omrah,</hi> to the meaneſt Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is indiſpenſably paid every two months; the Kings pay being its ſole refuge and relief; nor can its pay be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred there, as 'tis ſometimes with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where, when there are preſſing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the State, a Gentleman, an Officer, and even a ſimple Cavalier, can ſtay a while, and maintain himſelf of his own Stock, Rents and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his Land. But in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol</hi>'s Countrey, all muſt be paid at the time prefix'd, or all disbands and ſtarves, after they have ſold that little they have; as I ſaw in this laſt War,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63063:188"/>
that many were going to do, if it had not ſoon ceaſed. And this the more, becauſe that in all this Militia there is almoſt no Souldier that hath not wife and children, ſervants and ſlaves, that look for this pay, and have no other hope of relief. And hence it is, that many wonder, conſidering the huge number of perſons living of pay (which amounts to millions) whence ſuch vaſt Revenues can be had for ſuch exceſſive Charges: Although this need not to be ſo much wondred at, conſidering the Riches of the Empire, the peculiar Government of the State, and the ſaid univerſal propriety of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
                  <p>You may add to all this, that the Grand <hi>Mogol</hi> keeps nigh him at <hi>Dehly</hi> and <hi>Agra,</hi> and thereabout, two or three thouſand brave Horſes, to be always ready upon occaſion; as alſo eight or nine hundred Elephants, and a vaſt number of Mules, Horſes, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to carry all the great Tents and their Cabinets, to carry his Wives, Kitchens, Houſhold-ſtuff,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63063:188"/>
                     <hi>Ganges</hi>-Water, and all the other Neceſſaries for the Field, which he hath always about him as if he were at home; things not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in our Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>To this may be added thoſe incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expences upon the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> more indiſpenſable than will be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed; that vaſt ſtore of fine Linnen, Cloth of Gold, Embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Silks, Musk, Amber, Pearls, ſweet Eſſences, &amp;c. conſumed there.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Charges being put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and compared with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues the <hi>Mogol</hi> may be thought to have, it will be eaſie to judge, whether he be indeed ſo very rich, as he is made to be. As for me, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well know, that it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that he hath very great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; I believe, he hath more alone than the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> and the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> both together: But then, to believe all thoſe extravagant Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries made of the vaſtneſs of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, is a thing I could never do: And if I ſhould believe the beſt part
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63063:189"/>
of them, yet ſhould I not believe him in effect and truly ſo rich, as the World rings of him; unleſs a man would ſay, that a Treaſurer, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth great ſums of Money from one hand at the ſame time when he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to disburſe them to another, were therefore truly rich. For my part, I ſhould count that King rich indeed, who, without oppreſſing and impoveriſhing his People too much, ſhould have a Revenue ſufficient to keep a Great and Gallant Court (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of that of ours, or otherwiſe) and a Militia ſufficient both to guard his Kingdom, and to make an important War for divers years againſt his Neighbours; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſhew liberality, to build ſome Royal Edifices, and to make thoſe other Expences which Kings are wont to make according to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Inclinations; and who, beſides all this, ſhould be able to put up in his Treaſury, for a Reſerve, Sums big enough to undertake and maintain a good War for ſome years. Now I
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63063:189"/>
am apt enough to believe, that the Great <hi>Mogol</hi> enjoyeth very near theſe Advantages, but I cannot perſwade my ſelf, that he hath them in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as is thought and pretended. Thoſe vaſt and unevitable Expences, that I have taken notice of, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly incline you to my opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other conſideration; but you will doubtleſs be altogether of my mind, when I ſhall have repreſented to you theſe two things, which I am very well informed of.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>one</hi> is, that the Great <hi>Mogol,</hi> now reigning, about the end of this laſt Revolution, though the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was every where in peace (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in <hi>Bengale,</hi> where <hi>Sultan-Sujah</hi> yet held out) was much perplexed where to find means for the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of his Armies, though they were not ſo well paid as at other times, and the War laſted no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than five years or thereabout, and though alſo he had laid hold of a good part of the Treaſury of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chah-Jehan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:63063:190"/>
The <hi>other</hi> is, That all this Treaſure of <hi>Chah-jehan,</hi> who was very frugal, and had Reigned above forty Years without conſiderable Wars, never mounted to ſix <hi>Kourours</hi> of <hi>Roupies.</hi> A <hi>Roupy</hi> is about twenty nine pence. An hundred thouſand of them make a <hi>Lecque,</hi> and an hundred <hi>Lecques</hi> make one <hi>Kourour.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">So that the ſix <hi>Kourours</hi> would make about ſeven Millions and an half <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> 'Tis true, I do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in this great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gold-ſmiths work, ſo variouſly wrought in Gold and Silver; nor that vaſt ſtore of precious Stones and Pearls of a very high value. I doubt, whether there be any King in the World that hath more. The Throne alone, cover'd with them, is valued at leaſt three <hi>Kourours,</hi> if I remember aright; But then, it is to be conſider'd alſo, that they are the ſpoils of thoſe ancient Princes, the <hi>Patans</hi> and <hi>Rajas,</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and piled up from Immemorial times, and ſtill increaſing from one King to another, by the Preſents which
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63063:190"/>
the <hi>Omrahs</hi> are obliged yearly at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Feſtival-days to make him; and which are eſteemed to be the Jewels of the Crown, which it would be criminal to touch, and upon which a King of <hi>Mogol</hi> in caſe of neceſſity would find it very hard to procure the leaſt Sum.</p>
                  <p>But before I conclude, I ſhall take notice, whence it may proceed, that though this Empire of <hi>Mogol</hi> be thus an Abyſs of Gold and Silver, (as hath been ſaid,) yet notwithſtanding there appears no more of it among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than elſewhere; yea, rather that the People is there leſs Monied than in other places.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> reaſon is, that much of it is conſumed in melting over and over all thoſe Noſe and Ear-rings, Chains, Finger-rings, Bracelets of Hands and Feet, which the Women wear, but chiefly in that incredible quantity of Manufactures, wherein ſo much is ſpent, which is loſt, as in all thoſe Embroideries, Silk-ſtuffs, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with Gold and Silver, Cloath,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63063:191"/>
Scarf, Turbants, &amp;c. of the ſame: For generally all that Militia loveth to be guided from the <hi>Omrahs</hi> to the meaneſt Souldiers with their Wives and Children, though they ſhould ſtarve at home.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond,</hi> That all the Lands of the Kingdom being the Kings proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are given either as Benefices, which they call <hi>Jah-ghirs,</hi> or, as in <hi>Turky, Timars,</hi> to men of the Militia for their Pay or Penſion (as the word <hi>Jah-ghir</hi> imports:) Or elſe they are given to the Governours for their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the entertainment of their Troops, on condition that of the ſurplus of thoſe Land-revenues they give yearly a certain ſum to the King, as Farmers; Or, laſtly, the King reſerveth them for himſelf as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Domaine of his Houſe, which never or very ſeldom are given as <hi>Jah-ghirs,</hi> and upon which he keeps Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who alſo muſt give him a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſum; which is to ſay, that the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariots, Governours</hi> and <hi>Farmers</hi> have an abſolute Authority over the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63063:191"/>
and even a very great one over the Tradeſ-men and Merchants of the Towns, Boroughs, and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, depending from them: ſo that in thoſe parts there are neither great Lords nor Parliaments, nor Preſidial Courts, as amongſt us, to keep theſe People in awe; nor <hi>Kadis</hi> or Judges powerful enough to hinder and repreſs their violence; Nor, in a word, any perſon; to whom a Country-man, Tradeſ-man, or Merchant, can make his complaints to, in caſes of extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tyranny, often practiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, by the Souldiery and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, who every where do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punely abuſe the Authority Royal, which they have in hand, unleſs it be perhaps a little in thoſe places that are near to Capital Cities, as <hi>Dehly</hi> and <hi>Agra,</hi> and in great Towns, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Sea-ports of the Provinces, whence they know that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints can be more eaſily conveyed to the Court. Whence it is, that all and every one ſtand in continual fear of theſe People, eſpecially of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63063:192"/>
Governours more than any Slave doth of his Maſter: that ordinarily they affect to appear poor and Money-leſs, very mean in their Apparel, Lodging, Houſhold-ſtuff, and yet more in Meat and Drink; that often they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend even to meddle with Trade, leſt they ſhould be thought Rich, and ſo fall into the danger of being ruined: So that at laſt they find no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſecure their Wealth, than to hide and dig their Money deep under Ground, thus getting out of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary commerce of Men, and ſo Dying, neither the King nor the State having any benefit by it. Which is a thing not only happens among the Peaſants and Artizans, but (which is far more conſiderable) amongſt all ſorts of Merchants, whether <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> except ſome that are in the Kings, or ſome <hi>Omrahs</hi> Pay, or that have ſome particular Patron and ſupport in power: But principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the only Maſters of the Trade and Money, infatuated with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:63063:192"/>
that the Gold and Silver, which they hide in their life-time, ſhall ſerve them after death. And this, in my opinion, is the true reaſon, why there appears ſo little Money in Trade among the People.</p>
                  <p>But thence ariſeth a Queſtion very conſiderable, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it were not more expedient, not only for the Subjects, but for the State it ſelf, and for the Sovereign, not to have the Prince ſuch a Proprietor of the Lands of the Kingdom, as to take away the <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> amongſt private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; as 'tis with us? For my part, after a ſtrict comparing the State of our Kingdoms, where that <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> holds, with that of thoſe other Kingdoms, where it is not, I am thoroughly perſwaded, that it is much better and more beneficial for the Sovereign himſelf, to have it ſo as 'tis in our parts. Becauſe that in thoſe parts where 'tis otherwiſe, the Gold and Silver is loſt, as I was juſt now obſerving: There is almoſt no perſon ſecure from the violences of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63063:193"/>
thoſe Timariots, Governours, and Farmers: The Kings, how well ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they be diſpoſed toward their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are never almoſt in a condition (as I lately noted) to get Juſtice admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to them, and to hinder tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; eſpecially in thoſe great Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in the Provinces remote from the Capital Towns; Which yet ought to be, as doubtleſs it is, one of the chief employments and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of a King. Beſides, this tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny often grows to that exceſs, that it takes away what is neceſſary to the life of a Peaſant or Tradeſ-man, who is ſtarved for hunger and miſery, who gets no Children, or if he does, ſees them die young for want of food; or that abandons his Land, and turns ſome Cavalier's man, or flies whither he may to his neighbours, in hopes of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a better condition. In a word, the Land is not tilled but almoſt by force, and conſequently very ill, and much of it is quite ſpoiled and ruined, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none to be found, that can or will be at the charge of entertaining the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63063:193"/>
ditches and channels for the courſe of waters to be conveyed to neceſſary places; nor any body that care to build Houſes, or to repair thoſe that are rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; the Peaſant reaſoning thus with himſelf: Why ſhould I toil ſo much for a Tyrant that may come to morrow to take all away from me, or at leaſt all the beſt of what I have, and not leave, if the fancy taketh him, ſo much as to ſuſtain my life even very poorly? And the Timariot, the Governour and the Farmer, will reaſon thus with himſelf; Why ſhould I beſtow Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and take pains of bettering or maintaining this Land, ſince I muſt every hour expect to have it taken from me, or exchanged for another? I labour neither for my ſelf nor for my Children; and that place which I have this year, I may perhaps have no more the next. Let us draw from it what we can, whilſt we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it, though the Peaſant ſhould break or ſtarve, though the Land ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a deſert, when I am gone!</p>
                  <p>And for this very reaſon it is, that we
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63063:194"/>
ſee thoſe vaſt Eſtates in <hi>Aſia</hi> go ſo wretchedly and palpably to ruin. Thence it is, that throughout thoſe parts we ſee almoſt no other Towns but made up of earth and dirt; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ruin'd and deſerted Towns and Villages, or ſuch as are going to ruin. Even thence it is, that we ſee (for Example) thoſe <hi>Meſopotamia's, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia's, Palestina's,</hi> thoſe admirable plains of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and ſo many other Lands, anciently ſo well tilled, ſo fertile, and ſo well peopled, at the preſent half deſerted, untill'd, and bandon'd, or become peſtilent and uninhabitable bogs. Thence it is alſo, that of thoſe incomparable Lands of <hi>Egypt</hi> it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that within leſs than <hi>four-ſcore</hi> years, more than the <hi>tenth</hi> part of it is loſt, no people being to be found, that will expend what is neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the Channels, and to reſtrain the River <hi>Nile</hi> from violently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing on one hand, and ſo drowning too much the low Lands, or from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them with Sand, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be removed from thence but
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63063:194"/>
with great pains and charges. From the ſame root it comes, that Arts are languiſhing in thoſe Countries, or at leaſt flouriſh much leſs than elſe they would do, or do with Us. For what heart and ſpirit can an Artizan have to ſtudy well, and to apply his mind to his work, when he ſees, that among the people, which is for the moſt part beggerly or will appear ſo, there is none that conſiders the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and neatneſs of his Work, every body looking for what is cheap? and that the Grandees pay them but very ill and when they pleaſe? The poor Tradeſmen often thinking himſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that he can get clear from them without the <hi>Korrah,</hi> which is that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whip, that hangs nigh the gate of the <hi>Omrahs:</hi> Further, when he ſeeth that there is no help at all ever to come to any thing, as to buy an Office, or ſome Land for himſelf and Children, and that even he dares not appear to have a peny in caſh, or to wear good cloaths, or to eat a good meal, for fear he ſhould be thought rich. And indeed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63063:195"/>
the beauty and exactneſs of Arts had been quite loſt in thoſe parts long ago, if it were not that the Kings and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees there did give wages to certain Workmen, that work in their Houſes, and there teach their Children, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make themſelves able in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be a little more conſidered, and to eſcape the <hi>Korrah;</hi> and if alſo it were not, that thoſe great and rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Towns, who are protected by good and powerful Patrons, pay'd thoſe workmen a little better: I ſay, <hi>a little Better;</hi> for, what fine ſtuffs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſee come from thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, we muſt not imagine, that the workman is there in any honour, or comes to any thing; 'tis nothing but meer neceſſity or the cudgel, that makes him work, he never grows rich; it is no ſmall matter, when he hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to live and to cloath himſelf nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly. If their be any Money to gain of the work, that is not for him, but for thoſe great Merchants of Towns, I was juſt now ſpeaking of; and even theſe themſelves find it often difficult
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63063:195"/>
enough to maintain themſelves, and to prevent extorſion.</p>
                  <p>'Tis from the ſame cauſe alſo, that a groſs and profound ignorance reigns in thoſe States. For how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, there ſhould be Academies and Colleges well founded, where are ſuch Founders to be met with? And if there were any, whence were the Schollars to be had? Where are thoſe that have means ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Children in Colleges? And if there were, who would appear to be ſo rich? And if they would, where are thoſe Benefices, Preferments and Dignities that require knowledge and abilities, and that may animate young men to ſtudy?</p>
                  <p>Thence it is likewiſe, that Traffick languiſhes in all that Country, in compariſon of ours. For how many are there, that care to take pains, to run up and down, to write much, and to run danger for another, for a Governour, that ſhall extort, if he be not in league with ſome conſiderable ſword-man, whoſe ſlave he in a manner is, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63063:196"/>
that makes his own conditions with him?</p>
                  <p>It is not there, that the Kings find for their ſervice, Princes, Lords, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſons of rich and good Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Officers, Citizens, Merchants and even Tradeſ-men well-born, well-edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and well-inſtructed; men of courage, that have a true affection and reſpect for their King, that often live a great while at the Court and in the Army at their own expences, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining themſelves with good hopes, and content with the favourable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the Prince; and who upon occaſion fight manfully, covetous to uphold the honour of their Anceſtors and Families. Thoſe Kings, I ſay, never ſee about them but men of nothing, Slaves, Ignorants, Brutes, and ſuch Courtizans as are raiſed from the duſt to dignities, and that for want of good education and inſtruction almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways retain ſomewhat of their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, of the temper of beggars, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, proud, unſufferable, heartleſs, inſenſible of honour, diſ-ingenuous,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63063:196"/>
and void of affection and regard for the honour of their King &amp; Countrey. Here it is, where thoſe Kings muſt ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine all, to find means to defray all thoſe prodigious Charges, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid for entertaining their great Court, which hath no other ſource to ſubſiſt but their Coffers and Treaſure, and for maintaining conſtantly the vaſt number of Souldiers, neceſſary for them to keep the People in ſubjection, to prevent their running away, to make them work, and to get what is exacted from them, they being ſo many Deſperado's, for being perpetually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hatches, and for labouring only for others.</p>
                  <p>Thence it is alſo, that in an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant War that may happen (which may be almoſt at all times) they muſt almoſt of neceſſity ſell the Government for ready Money and immenſe Sums; whence chiefly that ruine and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes to paſs which we ſee. For the Governour, which is the Buyer, muſt not he be re-imburſed of all thoſe great Sums of Money, which he hath
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63063:197"/>
taken up, perhaps the third or fourth part, at high intereſt? Muſt not a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour alſo, whether he have bought the Government or not, find means as well as a Timariot and a Farmer, to make every year great Preſents to a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir,</hi> an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> a Lady of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and to thoſe other perſons, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him at Court? Muſt he not pay to the King his uſual Tributes, and withal enrich himſelf, that wretched Slave, half famiſh'd and deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted when he firſt appeared, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Goods, Lands, and revenues of his Houſe; ſuch as they all are? Do not they ruin all, and lay all waſte; I mean thoſe, that in the Provinces are like ſo many ſmall Tyrants with a boundleſs and unmeaſured Authority, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no body there, as hath been already ſaid, that can reſtrain them, or to whom a Subject can have refuge, to ſave himſelf from their tyranny and to obtain juſtice?</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that in the Empire of the <hi>Mogol</hi> the <hi>Vakea-nevis,</hi> that is, thoſe Perſons, whom he ſends into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63063:197"/>
to write to him whatever paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth there, do a little keep the Officers in awe, provided they do not collude together (as it almoſt always hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) to devour all; as alſo that the Governments are not there ſo often ſold, nor ſo openly as in <hi>Turky;</hi> I ſay, <hi>not ſo openly</hi> (for thoſe great Preſents, they are from time to time obliged to make, are almoſt equivalent to Sales) and that the Governors ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main longer in their Governments; which maketh them not ſo hungry, ſo beggarly, and ſo deep in debt, as thoſe new Comers, and that conſequently they do not always tyrannize over the people with ſo much cruelty; even ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, leſt they ſhould run away to the <hi>Raja's;</hi> which yet falls out very often.</p>
                  <p>'Tis alſo true, that in <hi>Perſia</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are not ſo frequently nor ſo publickly ſold as in <hi>Turky;</hi> the Sons of the Governors alſo ſucceding often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to their Fathers; which is alſo the cauſe, that the people there is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not ſo ill treated as in <hi>Turky,</hi> and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63063:198"/>
occaſions withal, that there is more politeneſs, and that even ſome there are that addict themſelves to ſtudy. But all that is really but a ſlight mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; thoſe three States of <hi>Turky, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> and <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> foraſmuch as they have all three taken away the <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> as to Land and Propriety of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions (which is the foundation of whatever is good and regular in the world) cannot but very near reſemble one another: they have the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they muſt at laſt, ſooner or later, needs fall into the ſame inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which are the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, <hi>viz,</hi> Tyranny, Ruine, and Deſolation.</p>
                  <p>Far be it therefore, that our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould thus be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of all the Lands which their Subjects poſſeſs. Their Kingdoms would be very far from being ſo well cultivated and peopled, ſo well built, ſo rich, ſo polite and flouriſhing as we ſee them. Our Kings are otherwiſe rich and powerful; and we muſt avow that we are much better and more roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63063:198"/>
ſerved. There would be Kings of Deſarts and Solitudes, of Beggars and Barbarians, ſuch as thoſe are whom I have been repreſenting; who, becauſe they will have all, at laſt loſe all; and who, becauſe they will make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too rich, at length find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without riches, or, at leaſt, very far from that which they covet after, out of their blind ambition and paſſion of being more abſolute than the Laws of God and Nature do permit. For, where would be thoſe Princes, thoſe Prelates, thoſe Nobles, thoſe rich Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens and great Merchants, and thoſe famous Artizans, thoſe Towns of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Lyons, Thoulouſe, Rouën, London,</hi> and ſo many others? Where would be that infinite number of Burroughs and Villages, all thoſe fair Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and Fields, and Hillocks tilled and maintained with ſo much indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, care and labour? And where would conſequently be all thoſe vaſt Revenues drawn thence, which at laſt enrich the Subjects and the Sovereign both? We ſhould find the great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63063:199"/>
and the great Burroughs rendred inhabitable becauſe of the ill Air, and to fall to ruine without any bodies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care of repairing them; the hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks abandoned, and the fields over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpred with the buſhes, or filled with Peſtilential Mariſhes, as hath been already intimated.</p>
                  <p>A word to our dear and experienc'd Travellers: They would not find thoſe fair conveniencies of travelling; they would be obliged to carry all things with them, like the <hi>Bohemians;</hi> and all thoſe good Inns, for example, that are found between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> would be like ten or twelve wretched <hi>Caravans-ſerrahs,</hi> that is, great Barns, raiſed and paved, ſuch as our <hi>Pont-neuf</hi> is, where hundreds of men are found pel-mel together with their Horſes, Mules and Camels, where one is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with heat in Summer, and ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of cold in Winter, if it were not for the breathing of thoſe Animals, that warm the place a little.</p>
                  <p>But it will be ſaid, we ſee ſome States, where the <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> is
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63063:199"/>
not (as for example, that of the Grand <hi>Seignor,</hi> which we know better than any, without going ſo far as the <hi>Indies)</hi> that do not only ſubſiſt, but are alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry powerful, and encreaſe daily.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that that State of the Grand <hi>Seignor,</hi> of ſuch a prodigious extent as it is, having ſo vaſt a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Lands, the Soil of which is ſo excellent, that it cannot be deſtroyed but very difficultly, and in a long time, is yet rich and populous; but it is certain alſo, that if it were cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and peopled proportionably to ours (which it would be, if there were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety among the Subjects throughout) it would be a quite different thing; it would have people enough to raiſe ſuch prodigious Armies as in old times, and rich enough to maintain them. We have travelled through almoſt all the parts of it; we have ſeen how ſtrangely it is ruin'd and unpeopled; and how in the Capital City there now need three whole Months to raiſe five or ſix thouſand men. We know alſo, what it would have come to ere this,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63063:200"/>
if it had not been for the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſtian Slaves, that are brought into it from all parts. And no doubt but that, if the ſame Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were continued there for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years, that State would deſtroy it ſelf, and at laſt, fall by its own weakneſs, as it ſeems that already it is hardly maintained but only by that means, I mean, by the frequent change of Governors; there being not one Governor, nor any one man in the whole Empire, that hath a penny to enable him to maintain the leaſt thing, or that can almoſt find any men, if he had Money. A ſtrange manner to make States to ſubſiſt! There would need no more for making an end of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, than a <hi>Brama</hi> of <hi>Pegu,</hi> who killed the half of the Kingdom with hunger, and turned it into Foreſts, hindring for ſome years the Lands from being tilled, though yet he hath not ſucceeded in his Deſign, and the State have afterwards been divided, and that even lately <hi>Ava,</hi> the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Town, was upon the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63063:200"/>
taken by an handful of <hi>China</hi>-fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. Mean time we muſt confeſs, that we are not like to ſee in our dayes that total ruine and deſtruction of this Empire we are ſpeaking of (if ſo be we ſee not ſomething worſe) becauſe it hath Neighbors, that are ſo far from being able to undertake any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that they are not ſo much as in a condition to reſiſt him, unleſs it be by thoſe ſuccours of ſtrangers, which the remoteneſs and jealouſie would make ſlow, ſmall, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
                  <p>But it might be yet further objected, that it appears not, why ſuch States as theſe might not have good Laws, and why the people in the Provinces might not be enabled to come and make their complaints to a Grand <hi>Viſir,</hi> or to the King himſelf. 'Tis true, that they are not altogether deſtitute of good Laws, and that, if thoſe which are amongſt them were obſerved, there would be as good living there, as in any part of the world. But what are thoſe Laws good for, if they be not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63063:201"/>
and if there be no means to make them to be executed? Is it not the Grand <hi>Viſir,</hi> or the King that appoints for the people ſuch beggarly Tyrants, and that hath no others to ſet over them? Is it not He that ſells thoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments? Hath a poor Peaſant or Tradeſman means to make great jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and to come and ſeek for Juſtice in the Capital City, remote perhaps 150 or 200 Leagues from the place of his abode? Will not the Governour cauſe him to be made away in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (as it hath often hapned) or catch him ſooner or later? And will he not provide his Friends at Court, to ſupport him there, and to repreſent things quite otherwiſe than they are? In a word, this Governour, hungry as well as the Timariots and Farmers (that are all men for drawing Oyl out of Sand, as the <hi>Perſian</hi> ſpeaks, and for ruining a world, with their heap of Women-harpies, Children and Slaves) this Governor, I ſay, is he not the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter, the Super-intendant of Juſtice, the Parliament, the Receiver, and all?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:63063:201"/>
It may perhaps be added, that the Lands, which our Kings hold in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> are no leſs well tilled and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, than other Land. But there is a great difference between the having in propriety ſome Lands here and there in a great Kingdom (which changes not the Conſtitution of the State and Government) and the having them all in propriety, which would alter it altogether. And then we in theſe parts have Laws ſo rational, which our Kings are willing to be the firſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and according to which they will that their particular Lands ſhall be governed as thoſe of their Subjects are, ſo as to give way, that Actions of Law may be laid againſt their own Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and Officers, ſo that a Peaſant or Tradeſman may have means to obtain Juſtice, and to find remedy againſt the unjuſt violence of thoſe that would oppreſs him: Whereas in thoſe parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> I ſee almoſt not any refuge for thoſe poor people; the Cudgel and the Hammer of the Governour being in a manner the only Law that rules,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63063:202"/>
and decides all Controverſies there.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It may be ſaid, that 'tis at leaſt certain, that in ſuch States there is not ſuch a multitude of long-laſting ſutes of Law, as in theſe parts, nor ſo many Lawyers of all ſorts, as amongſt us. It is in my opinion, very true, that one cannot too much applaud that old <hi>Perſian</hi> Saing, <hi>Na-hac Kouta Beter-Ez hac Deraz,</hi> that is, <hi>Short Injustice is better than long Juſtice;</hi> and that the length of Law-Sutes is unſufferable in a State, and that it is the indiſpenſable duty of the Sovereign, by all good means to endeavour a remedy againſt them. And 'tis certain, that by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away this <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> the root would be cut of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Law-proceſſes, and eſpecially of almoſt all thoſe, that are of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and long and perplexed; and conſequently there would not need ſo great a number of Magiſtrates, which our Sovereigns do employ to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Juſtice to their Subjects, nor that ſwarm of men, which ſubſiſt only by that way. But 'tis alſo manifeſt,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63063:202"/>
that the remedy would be an hundred times worſe than the Diſeaſe, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe great inconveniences that would follow thereupon, and that in all probability the Magiſtrates would become ſuch as thoſe of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> States, who deſerve not that Name; for in a word, our Kings have yet cauſe to glory upon the account of good Magiſtracy under them. In thoſe parts, ſome Merchants excepted, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is only among the meaneſt ſort of people, that are poor and of an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual condition, who have not the means of corrupting the Judges, and to buy falſe Witneſſes, that are there in great numbers, and very cheap, and never puniſhed. And this I have learn'd every where by the experience of many years, and by my ſolicitous enquiries made among the people of the Country, and our old Merchants that are in thoſe parts, as alſo of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, Conſuls and Interpreters; whatever our common Travellers may ſay, who, upon their having ſeen by chance, when they paſſed by, two or
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:63063:203"/>
Porters, or others of the like Gang, about a <hi>Kady,</hi> quickly diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one or other of the parties, and ſometimes both, with ſome laſhes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſole of their feet, or with a <hi>Maybalé Baba,</hi> ſome mild words, when there is no wool to ſheer; who, I ſay, upon ſight of this, come hither, and cry out, O the good and ſhort Juſtice! O what honeſt Judges are thoſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ours! Not conſidering in the mean time, that if one of thoſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that is in the wrong, had a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Crowns to corrupt the <hi>Kady,</hi> or his Clerks, and as much to buy two falſe witneſſes, he might either win his proceſs, or prolong it as long as he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>In concluſion, to be ſhort, I ſay, that the taking away this Propriety of Lands among private men, would be infallibly to intoduce at the ſame time Tyranny, Slavery, Injuſtice, Begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Barbariſm, Deſolation, and to open a high way for the ruine and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mankind, and even of Kings and States: Aud that on the contrary;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63063:203"/>
this <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> accompanied with the hopes that every one ſhall keep, what he works and labours for, for himſelf and his Children, as his own, is the main foundation of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is regular and good in the World: Inſomuch that whoſoever ſhall caſt his eyes upon the different Countries and Kingdoms, and taketh good notice of what follows upon this Propriety of Sovereigns, or that of the People, will ſoon find the true ſource and chief cauſe of that great difference we ſee in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral States and Empires of the world, and avow, that this is in a manner that which changes and diverſifieth the Face of the whole Earth.</p>
