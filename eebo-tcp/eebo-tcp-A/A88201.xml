         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN Anſwere to your late Letter I can make no other Propoſition beſides what is in my Letter to Mr. <hi>Hevening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> of the 20 preſent, then this:</p>
            <p>That ſeeing my ſelfe, and the Principles I Profeſſe are a burthen to the Men in preſent Power; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (for Peace and quietneſſe ſake only) I will engage, (enjoying my Money, and my immediate Liberty) that I will within ſix Moneths time tranſplant my ſelfe into ſome part of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Provided, that all thoſe that are free, and willing to goe along with me, of what quality ſoever, may have free Liberty, at their pleaſure to goe, and</p>
            <p>Provided, ſeeing many of thoſe I know willing to undertake the Journey are made very poore, by reaſon of their ſufferings in the preſent Diſtractions, may have all ſuch Monies, juſtly paid unto them as is owing them, either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Arreares, for faithfull ſervice already done, or for Monies lent to the Publique, that ſo they may be the better, enabled for their Journey, they ingaged thereupon to goe. And,</p>
            <p>Provided, That others that are willing to goe, and are ſo very poore, that they cannot transplant themſeles, may have from the Publique ſome reaſonable allowance for that end, this being the land of their Nativitie, where, by the Law of nature, they may challenge a ſubſiſtance, and therefore it is but juſt, ſeeing their company and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are a burthen and trouble to the men in preſent Power, that they ſhould make their willingneſſe (for Peace ſake) able to transplant themſelves into a Deſart, where, with induſtry and the bleſſing of God thereupon, they may expect a livelihood; and this with the ingagement of the preſent Power, for a peaceable protection while wee ſtay in <hi>England,</hi> and for their aſſiſtance for a reaſonable convoy in ſome part of our Journey, I will ingage in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, I will not act againſt their Power during my ſtay in <hi>England,</hi> directly nor indirectly; but for mee to ingage ſingly to goe alone, ſeeing I know noe Plantation already planted but I would ſooner chooſe to bee cut in peeces in <hi>England</hi> then ingage to goe to it, therefore particularly I ſhall not engage without the tearmes above ſaid, come life, come death, to which I ſhall ſtand: Witneſſe my hand;</p>
