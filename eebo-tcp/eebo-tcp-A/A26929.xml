            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My dearly beloved in our deareſt Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Will ſo far conſent to your troubled thoughts of this unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come day as to confeſs that to me as well as you, it ſomewhat reſembleth the day of death. 1. Death is the ſeparation of the deareſt conſorts, Soul and Body: And how near the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is betwixt us, both that of <hi>Relation,</hi> and that of <hi>Affection,</hi> which muſt admit this day of ſome kind of diſſolution, I will rather tell to ſtrangers then to you. 2. Death is unwelcom both to <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> of itſelf; (though it deſtroy not the <hi>Soul</hi> it doth the <hi>body.</hi>) So dear Companions part not willingly. Your hearts and Mine are here ſo over forward in the application, that words may be well ſpared where ſenſe hath taken ſo deep poſſeſſion. 3. Death is the end of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane converſe</hi> here on earth. We muſt ſee and talk with our friends here no more. And this our ſeparation is like to end that converſe between you and me, which formerly we have had in the duties of our Relations. We muſt no more go up together as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the houſe of God; I muſt no more ſpeak to you publickly in his name, nor ſolace my own ſoul in opening to you the Goſpel of Salvation, nor in the mention of his Covenant, his Grace, or Kingdom: Thoſe Souls that have not been convinced and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, are never like to hear more from <hi>me,</hi> for their conviction or converſion. I have finiſhed all the inſtruction, reproof, exhortation and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erſwaſion, which ever I muſt uſe in order to their ſalvation. I muſt ſpeak here no more to inform the ignorant, to reform the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59411:4"/>
wicked, to reduce the erroneous, to ſearch the hypocrite, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the proud, to bow the obſtinate or to bring the worldly, the impenitent and ungodly to the knowledge of the world, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and God. I muſt ſpeak no more to ſtrengthen the weak, to comfort the afflicted, nor to build you up in faith and holineſs. Our day is paſt, our night is come when we cannot work as formerly we have done! My opportunities here are at an end. 4 Death is the end of <hi>earthly comforts</hi>: And our ſeparation is like to be the end of that comfortable communion, which God for many years hath granted us. Our publick and private communion hath been ſweet to us: The Lord hath been our Paſtour, and hath not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to want: He made us lye down in his pleaſant paſtures, and hath led us by the ſilent ſtreams! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1, 2. He reſtored our Souls, and his very Rod and Staff did comfort us. But his ſmiting &amp; ſcattering time is come. Theſe pleaſures now are at an end. 5. Death is the end of humane <hi>labours:</hi> There is no plowing or ſowing, no building or planting in the grave. And ſo doth our Separation end <hi>the works</hi> of <hi>our mutual relation</hi> in this place. 6 Death is the effect of painful ſickneſs, and uſually of the folly, intemperance or overſight of our ſelves. And, though our conſcience reproach us not with groſs unfaithfulneſs, yet are our failings ſo many, and ſo great, as force us to juſtify the ſeverity of our father, and to confeſs that we deſerve this rod. Though we have been cenſured by the world, as being over ſtrict, and doing too much for the ſaving of our own and others Souls, yet it is another kind of charge that conſcience hath againſt us: How earneſtly do we now wiſh that we had done much more? that I had preached more fervently, &amp; you had heard more diligently, and we had all obeyed God more ſtrictly, and done more, for the Souls of the ignorant, careleſs, hardened ſinners that were among us? It is juſt with God that ſo dull a preacher ſhould be put to ſilence, that could ever ſpeak without tears and fervent importunity, to impenitent ſinners, when he knew that it was for no leſs than the ſaving of their Souls, and foreſaw the joys which they would loſe, and the torment which they muſt endure, if they repented not. With what ſhame &amp; ſorrow do I now look back upon the cold and lifeleſs Sermons which I preached? and upon thoſe years neglect of the duty of private inſtructing of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, before we ſet upon it orderly and conſtantly? Our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of our ſelves! Our undervaluings and neglects have forfeited our opportunities. As good <hi>Melancthon</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>In vulneri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59411:4"/>
noſtris proprias agnoſcimus pennas</hi>; The arrow that woundeth us, was feathered from our own wings. 7. Death uſeth to put ſurviving friends into a dark and mourning habit. Their lamentations are the chief part of funeral Solemnities. And in this alſo we have our part: The compaſſion of condolers is greater than we deſire. For ſorrow is apt to grow unruly, and exceed its bounds, and bring on more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings by lamenting one; and alſo to look too much at the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to be more offended at them than at our ſins. 8. But Death is the end of all the living. The mourners alſo muſt come after us: And, alas, how ſoon! It maketh our fall more grievous to us, to foreſee how many muſt ere long come down! How many hundred Paſtors muſt ſhortly be ſeparated from their flocks. If there were no Epideicmal malady to deſtroy us, our Miniſtry hath its mortality. Your Fathers where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.5. This made us the more importunate with you, in our Miniſtry, becauſe we knew that we muſt preach to you, and pray with you, and inſtruct you, and watch over you, but a little while. Though we knew not what inſtrument death would uſe, we knew our final day was coming when we muſt preach and exhort and pray our laſt with you! we knew that it behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to work while it was day, (and O that we had done it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!) becauſe the night was coming when none could work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.4.9. And as it is appointed to all men once to die, ſo after death there followeth Judgment. And we alſo have our further judgment to undergo. We muſt expect our hour of temptation: We muſt be judged by men, as well as chaſtened by God: We muſt prepare to bear the reproach and ſlanders of malicious tongues, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous cenſures of thoſe that know us not, and of thoſe who think it <hi>their intereſt</hi> to condemn us. And we muſt alſo call our ſelves to judgment: We are like to have unwelcom leiſure, to review the daies and duties which are paſt! It will then be time for us to call our ſelves to account of our preaching and ſtudies, and other miniſterial works, and to ſentence our labours and our lives: And it will be time for you to call your ſelves to account of your hearing and profiting, and to ask, How have we uſed the mercies which are taken from us? Yea God himſelf will judge us according to our works! He will not juſtifie us, if we have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in our Little, and have been ſuch as Satan and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the accuſers of the Brethren, do report us. But if we have been <hi>faithful</hi> we may expect his double juſtification. 1 <hi>By pardon</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59411:5"/>
he will juſtify us from our ſins. 2. By Plea and righteous ſentence he will juſtify us againſt the falſe accuſations of our enemies. And that's enough. How ſmall a thing ſhould it ſeem to us, to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of man, who muſt ſtand or fall to the final ſentence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God? 10. The ſeparated Soul and Body do retain their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and the Soul its inclination to a re-union with its Body. And though our <hi>neareſt</hi> obligations may be now diſſolved, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our communion hindered, yet I know we ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get each other, nor ſhall the bond of Love which doth unite us, be ever looſed and made void. And ſo much of our Relation ſhall ſtill continue, as is intimated in thoſe texts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15, 16.12.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 11. And the power of Death, will not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting. A Reſurrection and re-union there will be at laſt. But whether in this world I cannot propheſy. I am apter to think that moſt of us muſt die in the wilderneſs; and that our <hi>night</hi> muſt bear ſome proportion with our <hi>day.</hi> But things unrevealed belong only unto God. It ſufficeth me to be ſure of this, that as our kingdom ſo our comforts are not of this world, and that as Chriſt ſo his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants under him, may ſay, Behold, I and the Children which God hath given me, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. and that we ſhall preſent you as chaſt Virgins unto Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. And <hi>therefore we have preached, taught and warned, that we might preſent you perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Col. 1.28. <hi>For what is our hope, or joy, or Crown of rejoycing? are not even ye in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his Coming? For ye are our glory and our joy,</hi> 1 Theſſalonians 2.19, 20.</p>
            <p>But yet the Reſemblance between Death and this our ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, holdeth not in all things. 1. It is not I nor any Paſtour, that is the Churches Soul or life. This is the honour of Chriſt the Head. Being planted into him you may live, though all his Miniſters were dead,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.20.</note> or all your Teachers driven <hi>into corners.</hi> 2.

Though this be not meant (direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) in the text, yet is it too conſtant a foregoer of our comforts. It is not the joys of Innocency that are our portion, but the joys of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59411:6"/>
Reſtoration: And the pains of our diſeaſe go before the eaſe and comfort of our recovery: we have our <hi>worldly ſorrows,</hi> and our <hi>paſſionate</hi> and <hi>pieviſh ſorrows</hi>; like <hi>Jonas</hi>'s for the withering of his gourd. According to the degree of our remaining corruption, we have our ſorrows, which muſt be ſorrowed for again. Sometimes we are troubled at the providences of God, and ſometimes at the dealings of men; at the words or doings of enemies, of friends, of all about us: we are grieved if we have not what we would have, and when we have it, it becomes our greater grief: nothing well pleaſeth us, till we ſo devote our ſelves to pleaſe our God, as to be pleaſed in the pleaſing of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And we have our ſorrows which are ſinful through our <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> &amp; <hi>imperfection</hi> when through the languiſhing feebleneſs of our Souls, we are overmuch troubled at that which we may lawfully ſorrow for with moderation. When impatience cauſeth us to make a greater matter of our afflictions than we ought. If God do but try us with wants or Croſſes; if we loſe our friends, or if they prove unkind; we double the weight of the Croſs by our impatiency. This cometh from the remnants of unmortified <hi>ſelfiſhneſs, carnality</hi> and <hi>overloving earthly things.</hi> Were they leſs loved, they would be leſs ſorrowed for. If we had ſeen their vanity and mortification had made them nothing to us, we ſhould then <hi>part with them</hi> as with <hi>vanity and nothing.</hi> It's ſeldom that God or men afflict us, but we therefore afflict our ſelves much more.

            <p n="5">5. There are honourable and gainful ſufferings from blind ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious wicked men, for the cauſe of Chriſt and righteouſneſs. Such as the Goſpel frequently warneth believers to expect. Theſe are the ſorrows that have the promiſes of fulleſt joy. Not that the meer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in itſelf is acceptable <hi>to God.</hi> But the Love which is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuffering for him, is that which he cannot but accept. So that the ſame meaſure of ſufferings are more or leſs aceptable, as there is more or leſs Love to God expreſſed by them! and as the honor of Chriſt is more or leſs intended in them. For to give the body to be burned, without Love, will profit us nothing. But when the <hi>cauſe</hi> is Chriſts,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.3.</note> and the <hi>heart</hi> intendeth him as the end of the ſuffering,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.10, 11, 12.</note> then, <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There are <hi>penitential</hi> and <hi>medicinal ſufferings,</hi> for the killing of ſin, and helping on the work of grace, which are made our <hi>duty.</hi> In the former we are to be but <hi>ſubmiſſive patients</hi>; but in theſe we muſt be <hi>obedient agents,</hi> and muſt inflict them on our ſelves. Such are the ſorrows of contrition and true repentance. The exerciſes of faſting, abſtinence and humiliation. The grief of the Soul for Gods diſpleaſure, for the hiding of his face, and the abatement of his graces in us. And all the works of mortifying ſelf-denyal (and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing all forbidden pleaſures) which God doth call his ſervants to: Though in the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Principal</hi> part of Holyneſs, there is nothing but what is ſweet and pleaſant to a Soul, ſo far as it is holy: (As the Love of God and the Love of others, and worſhipping God and doing good, and joy, and thanks, and praiſe, and obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Yet the Medicinal parts of grace, or holineſs, have ſomething neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily in them that is bitter, even to nature as nature, and not only as <hi>corrupt,</hi> ſuch as are contrition, ſelf-denyal, mortification, abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p n="7">7. There are Charitable ſorrows for the diſhonour of God, and for the ſin and hurt and miſeries of others. Theſe alſo are our <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and we muſt be Agents in them as well as Patients. As we muſt firſt pray for the Hallowing <hi>of the name of God, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his kingdom, and the doing of his will, on earth as it is done in heaven</hi>! So we muſt moſt grieve for the abuſe &amp; diſhonor of Gods name, the hindering of his Kingdom, and the breaking of his Laws, that ſo many Nations ſee not the Peril, and know not God, and have not the Goſpel or will not receive it; but live in rebellion againſt

their maker, and in blindneſs, obſtinacy and hardneſs of heart,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.18, 19.</note> and are given up to commit uncleanneſs with greedineſs: that ſo many nations which are called Chriſtians, are captivated in ignorance and ſuperſtition, by the blindneſs, pride, carnality and covetouſneſs of their uſurping, ſelf-obtruding <hi>Guides.</hi> That ſo many men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtianity have ſo little of the knowledge, or power of what they generally and ignorantly profeſs, and live to the ſhame of their profeſſion, the great diſhonour and diſpleaſure of their Lord, and the grief or hardening of others; that the Church of Chriſt is broken into ſo many ſects and fractions, poſſeſſed with ſuch an uncharitable deſtroying zeal againſt each other, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting their Brethren as cruelly as Turks and Heathens do! that the beſt of Chriſtians are ſo few and yet ſo weak and lyable to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages; All theſe are the matter of that ſorrow which God hath made our duty. And all theſe ſorts of ſorrow do go before a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans fulleſt joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. God will have ſome conformity between the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and of Grace. Non-entity was before created entity: The evening before the morning: Infancy before maturity of age: weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before ſtrength: The buried ſeed before the plant, the flower and fruit: And infants cry before they laugh; weakneſs is ſoon hurt, and very querulous! No wonder then if our ſorrows go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our joys.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sin goeth before grace,</hi> and therefore our ſorrows are before our joys. The ſeed is firſt fruitful which was firſt ſown. Joy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath the elder Parent <hi>in eſſe reali &amp; abſoluto,</hi>

And where Satan goeth before Chriſt it is equal that ſorrow be before joy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our gracious Father and wiſe Phyſician, doth ſee that this is the fitteſt method for our cure. That we may <hi>deny our ſelves,</hi> we muſt know how little we are beholden to our ſelves; and muſt ſmart by the fruit of our ſin and folly before we are eaſed by the fruit of Love &amp; grace. It is the property of the <hi>fleſh</hi> to judg by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſenſe</hi> ſhall help to mortify it. The frowns of the World ſhall be an antidote againſt its flatteries. It <hi>killeth</hi> by <hi>Pleaſing</hi> and therefore it may help our cure by <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> us. Loving it is mens undoing; and <hi>hurting us</hi> is the way to keep us from overloving it. Theſe wholſom ſorrows do greatly diſable our moſt dangerous

temptations; and preſerve us from the pernicious poyſon of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity! They rowze us up when we are lazy and ready to ſit down: They awake us when we are ready to fall aſleep: They drive us to God when we are ready to forget him, and dote upon a deceiver: They teach us part of the meaning of the Goſpel: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them we know not well, what [a <hi>Saviour,</hi> a <hi>promiſe,</hi> a <hi>pardon, grace</hi>] and many other Goſpel terms, do ſignify. They teach us to <hi>pray,</hi> and teach us to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>read</hi> with underſtanding; They tell us the value of all our Mercies, and teach us the uſe of all the means of grace. They are needful to fix our flaſhy, light, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant minds. Which are apt to be gazing upon every baite, and to be touching or taſting the forbidden fruit; and to be taken with thoſe things, which we had lately caſt behind our backs, till medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal ſorrow doth awake our reaſon and make us ſee the folly of our dreams. Yea if ſorrow check us not and make us wiſe, we are ready to lay by our grace and wit, and to follow any goblin in the dark,<note place="margin">Prov. 7.22, 23.</note> and like men bewitched, to be deceived by we know not what, and to go on as a bird to the fowlers ſnare, as an ox to the ſlaughter, and as a Fool to the correction of the ſtocks.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Moreover precedent ſorrows, will raiſe the price of <hi>following Joys.</hi> They will make us more deſirous of the day of our deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and make it the welcomer to us when it comes. Heaven will be ſeaſonable after a life of ſo much trouble, and they that come out of great tribulation,<note place="margin">Rev. Luke 14.28, 33. Rom. 8.17, 18.

            <p n="5">5. And God will have the members conformed to their <hi>Head:</hi> This was Chriſts method, and it muſt be ours. We muſt take up the Croſs and follow him if ever we will have the Crown; and we muſt ſuffer with him if we will be glorifyed with him.

Sure you do not ſet light by the <hi>Love of God</hi>! Why then do you complain ſo much againſt the ſigns &amp; products of it? Is it not becauſe you have yet much unbelief, and judge of Gods Love as the fleſh directeth you, inſtead of judging by the effects &amp; prognoſticks which he himſelf hath bid you judge by? We will grant to the fleſh, that <hi>no chaſtiſement for the preſent ſeemeth joyous, but grievous</hi>; If you will believe the Spirit, that <hi>nevertheleſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs, to them that arexerciſed thereby</hi>; and that <hi>whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth, Heb.</hi> 12.6, 11. Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not then the prognoſticks of your preſent ſorrows! Think how they will work as well as how they taſt. They <hi>boden</hi> good, though they are unpleaſant. If you were baſtards and reprobates you might feel leſs of the Rod.

Think it not ſtrange if he threſh and grind you, if you would be bread for your maſters uſe. He is not drowning his ſheep when he waſheth them; nor killing them when he is ſhearing them. But by this he ſheweth that they are his own! And the new ſhorn ſheep do moſt viſibly bear his name or mark, when it is almoſt worn out, and ſcarce diſcernable, on them that have the longeſt fleece. If you love the world and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity beſt, rejoice moſt in it, &amp; grieve moſt for the want of it: But if you love God beſt, and take him for your part and treaſure, rejoyce in him, and in that condition which hath the fulleſt ſignifications of <hi>his</hi> love, and grieve moſt for his diſpleaſure, and for that condition which either ſignifieth it, or moſt enticeth you to diſpleaſe him.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.18.

And would you not go to Heaven in the common way, that the Saints of old have gone before you in. Read the Scripture and all Church hiſtory, and obſerve which is the beaten path of life; and whether even among believers and the Paſtors of the Church, it was the perſecuted or the proſperous that moſt honoured their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! &amp; which of them it was that corrupted the Church with pride &amp; domination, &amp; kindled in it thoſe Flames of contention which are conſuming it to this day.

If it have not, you may thank your ſelves: For I am ſure Gods rod hath a healing virtue, and others have received a cure by it. How much is mankind beholden to the Croſs? When <hi>David</hi> went weeping up mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> he was in a ſafer caſe, than when he was gazing on <hi>Bathſheba</hi> from his battlements? And when Chriſt was ſweating blood upon mount <hi>Olivet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 22.44.</note> it was a ſign that mans Redemption was in hand: and when he was bleeding on the Croſs, and drinking vinegar and gall, it was almoſt finiſhed. And if the Croſs hath born ſuch happy fruit, what reaſon have we to be ſo much againſt it? If it have proved good for you that you were afflicted, and no part of your lives have been more fruitful, why ſhould your deſires ſo much contradict your own experience? If bitter things have proved the moſt wholſom, and a full and luſcious dyet hath cauſed your diſeaſe, what need you more, to direct your judgment, if you will judge as men, and not as bruits?</p>

And the corrections which are not improved by us to our amendment and reformation.</p>
            <p>But the promiſe belongeth 1. to thoſe ſorrows which in ſincerity we undergo for the ſake of Chriſt and righteouſneſs. 2.

ſuffer more than other men. Think it not a diſhonour to them to be in poverty, priſons, baniſhment, or reproach, unleſs it be for a truly diſhonourable cauſe. Call not men miſerable, for that which God maketh the token of his love, and the Prognoſtick of their joy. Methinks he that hath once read the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. &amp; 73. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. &amp; 15. &amp; 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. and well believeth them, ſhould never err this old condemned Errour any more. And yet it is common among carnal men, to do as ſome beaſts do, when one of their fellows is wounded they all forſake him: ſo theſe ſtand looking with pity, or fear, or ſtrangeneſs upon a man that is under ſufferings and ſlanders, as if it muſt needs be a deſerved thing; and think it a great diſhonour to a man how innocent ſoever, when they hear that he is uſed as offendours &amp; malefactours are; forgetting how by this, they condemn their Saviour, and all his Apoſtles and Martyrs, and the wiſeſt, beſt, and happyeſt men that the earth hath born. And all this is but the blind and haſty judgment of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>unbelief,</hi> which hath neither the wit to judge by the <hi>word of God,</hi> nor yet the patience to ſtay the end, and ſee how the ſorrows of the godly will conclude, and where the triumph of the hypocrite will leave him.</p>
            <p>And yet ſome there be that are apt to err on the other extream, and to think that every man is happy that is afflicted, and that ſuch have all their ſorrow in this life; and that the ſuffering party is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the right, and therefore they are ready to fall in with any deluded ſect, which they ſee to be under reproach and ſuffering. But the cauſe muſt be firſt known, before the ſuffering can be well judged of.</p>

            <p>This is plain in the words [<hi>Ye Now therefore have ſorrow; but I will ſee you again.</hi>] And the cauſes of this ſorrow were theſe three conjunct. 1. That their dear Lord whom they loved, and whom they had heard, and followed, and put their truſt in, muſt now be taken from them.

That deluded Sinners ſhould put to death the Lord of life, and ſpit in the face of ſuch a Majeſty, and haſten deſtruction to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and themſelves; and that all Chriſts diſciples muſt thus be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the followers of a crucifyed uſurper, judg if we had been in their caſe our ſelves, whether this would have been matter of ſorrow to us, or not. Had it not been enough for Chriſt to have ſuffered the pain, but he muſt alſo ſuffer the diſhonor, even the imputation of ſin, which no man was ſo far from being guilty of? and of that <hi>particular ſin,</hi> uſurpation of <hi>Dominion,</hi> and Treaſon againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which his heart and life were as contrary to, as light to darkneſs? And was it not enough for Chriſtians to ſuffer ſo great calamities of bodies for righteouſneſs ſake, but they muſt alſo ſuffer the reproach of being the ſeditious followers of a crucifyed malefactour whom they would have made a King? No! our Lord would ſtoop to the loweſt condition for our ſakes, which was conſiſtent with his innocency and perfection! Sin is ſo much worſe than ſuffering, that we may take this for the greateſt part of his condeſcenſion, and ſtrangeſt expreſſion of his Love, that he ſhould take not only the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the ſufferings of a man, but alſo the <hi>nature</hi> and the <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of ſinners. Though <hi>ſin</hi> itſelf was inconſiſtent with his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet ſo was not the falſe accuſation and imputation of it: He could not <hi>become a</hi> ſinner for us; but he could be <hi>reputed</hi> a ſinner for us, and die as ſuch. And when our Lord hath ſubmitted to this moſt ignominious kind of ſuffering, it is not fit that we ſhould be the chooſers of our ſufferings, and ſay, Lord we will ſuffer any thing except the Reputation of being offenders, and the falſe accuſations of malicious men! If in this we muſt be made conformable to our head, we muſt not refuſe it, nor repine at his diſpoſal of us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And their ſorrow for Chriſts departure was the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had ſo little foreſight of his Reſurrection and return. It is ſtrange to ſee how dark they were in theſe articles of the faith, for all their long converſe with Chriſt, and his plain foretelling them his death and reſurrection: and how much of their teaching Chriſt reſerved to the Spirit after his departure from them, Joh. 12 16. Luk. 18.31.32.33.34. <hi>Then took he unto him the twelve, and ſaid unto them, behold we go up to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and all things that are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59411:11"/>
written by the prophets concerning the Son of man ſhall be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For he ſhall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and ſhall be mocked and ſpightfully, entreated, and ſpit upon, and they ſhall ſcourge him and put him to death, and the third day he ſhall riſe again.</hi> And <hi>they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood none of theſe things, and this ſaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were ſpoken.</hi> Had they known all that would follow, and clearly foreſeen his Reſurrection and his Glory they would then have been troubled the leſs for his death. But when they ſaw him dye, and foreſaw him not revive and riſe and reign, then did their hearrs begin to fail them, and they ſaid, Luk. 24.21. <hi>We truſted that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.</hi> Even as we uſe to lament immoderately when we lay the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of our friends in the grave, becauſe we ſee not whither the Soul is gone, nor in what triumph and joy it is received unto Chriſt; Which if we ſaw it would moderate our griefs. And even ſo we over-pity our ſelves &amp; our friends in our temporal ſufferings, becauſe we ſee not whither they tend, and what will follow them. We ſee <hi>Job</hi> on the dunghil, but look not ſo far as his reſtoration, Jam. 5.11. <hi>Behold we count them happy which endure: Ye have heard of the patience of</hi> Job, <hi>and have ſeen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy.</hi> There is no judging by the preſent, but either by ſtaying the end, or believing Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> It is allowable in Chriſts diſciples to grieve (in faith and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately) for any of his departure from them: They that have had the comfort of communion with him in a life of faith and grace, muſt needs lament any loſs of that communion: It is ſad with ſuch a Soul, when Chriſt ſeemeth ſtrange, or when they pray and ſeek, and ſeem not to be heard! It is ſad with a believer when he muſt ſay, I had once acceſs to the Father by the Son; I had helps in prayer and I had the lively operations of the Spirit of grace, and ſome of the joy of the holy Ghoſt, but now, alas, it is not ſo. And they that have had experience of the fruit and comfort of his Word, and Ordinances, and Diſcipline, and the Communion of ſaints, may be allowed to lament the loſs of this, if he take it from them. It was no unſeemly thing in David, when he was driven from the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God, to make that lamentation, Pſal. 42, and 43. <hi>As the hart panteth after the Water brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O God: My Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God: When ſhall I come and appear before God?

When ſin provoketh him to hide his face, and withdraw his mercies, if we can ſenſleſly let them go, it is a contempt which provoketh him much more: If we are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent what he giveth us, it is juſt with him to be indifferent too, and to ſet as little by our helps and happineſs, as we ſet by them our ſelves. But we little know the miſery which ſuch contempt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth for, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Be thou inſtructed O Jeruſalem, leſt my Soul depart from thee! leſt I make thee deſolate; a Land not Inhabited.</hi> Hoſ. 9.12. <hi>Yea, Wo alſo unto them when I depart from them.</hi> When God goeth, all goeth: Grace and Peace, Help and Hope, and all that is good and comfortable is gone, when God is gone! won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not therefore if Holy Souls cry after God, and fear the loſs of his Grace and Ordinances; and if they lament the loſs of that, which dead-hearted Senſualiſts are a weary of, and would drive away; it will be the damning ſentence,<note place="margin">Luk. 8.37.

               </gap>ct, can be but ſhort: You read of their Victories and Perſecutions in the News-books one year, and quickly after of their death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Hence therefore you may learn how injudicious they are, that think Religion is diſparaged by ſuch ſhort and ſmall afflictions of Believers; and how unexcuſable they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who yield unto tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and venture upon ſin, and comply with the ungodly, and forſake the truth, through the fear of ſo ſhort and momentary ſorrows: When there is none of them but would endure the prick of a Pin, or the ſcratch of a Briar, or the biting of a Flea to gain a Kingdom, or the opening of a Vein, or the griping of a Purge to ſave their Lives. O how deſervedly are ungodly men forſaken of God: For how ſhort a pleaſure do they forſake him, and the everlaſting pleaſures? And how ſhort a trouble do they avoid, by running into everlaſting trouble? If ſin had not firſt ſubdued rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, men would never make it a matter of queſtion, whether to eſcape ſo ſmall a ſuffering they ſhould break the Laws of the moſt righteous God; nor would they once put ſo ſhort a pain or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into the ballance againſt the endleſs pain and pleaſure? Nor would a temptation bring them to <hi>deliberate</hi> on a matter, which ſhould be paſt deliberation with a man that is in his Wits. And yet alas, how much do theſe <hi>ſhort concernments</hi> prevail through all the World! Unbelievers are ſhort ſighted; they look only or chiefly to things near and preſent! A leaſe of this empty World for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59411:13"/>
a few years, yea an uncertain tenure of it, is preferred before the beſt ſecurity for eternal life. Its <hi>preſent pleaſures</hi> which they muſt have, and its <hi>preſent ſorrows</hi> which they take care to eſcape. As Chriſt hath taught us to ſay about theſe worldly things, ſo the Devil hath taught them to ſay about everlaſting things, <hi>Care not for to morrow, the morrow ſhall take thought for the things of it ſelf; ſufficient to the day is the evil thereof,</hi> Math. 6.34. Therefore when the day of their calamity ſhall come, a deſpairing Conſcience will perpetually torment them, and ſay, This is but the ſorrow which thou choſeſt to endure, or the miſery which thou wouldſt venture on, to eſcape a preſent inconſiderable pain.</p>
            <p>If there be any of you that ſhall think that preſent ſufferings are conſiderable things, to be put into the ſcales againſt eternity, or that are tempted to murmuring and impatience under ſuch ſhort afflictions, I deſire them but to conſider, 1. that your <hi>ſuffering</hi> will be no <hi>longer</hi> than your ſin. And if it endure but <hi>as long,</hi> is it any matter of wonder or repining. Can you expect to keep your <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> and yet to be wholly freed from the pain? Can <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> be perfectly ſeparated? Do you think to continue <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> and in ſo much remaining <hi>unbelief, carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, worldlineſs</hi> and <hi>ſloth,</hi> and yet <hi>never</hi> to <hi>feel</hi> the Rod or Spur, nor ſuffer any more than if you had been innocent? Deceive not your ſelves, it will not be. <hi>Sin lieth at the door,</hi> and be ſure at laſt it <hi>will find you out,</hi> Prov. 11.31.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.7. Numb. 32.23.</note> 
               <hi>Behold the righteous ſhall be recompenſed in the Earth, much more the ungodly and the ſinner. Judgment muſt begin at the Houſe of God, and the righteous are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with much ado,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.17, 18. God is not reconciled to the ſins of any man: And as he will ſhew by his dealings, that he is reconciled to their perſons, ſo will he ſhew that he is not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to their ſins. If God continue your ſufferings any longer than you continue your ſin, and if you can truly ſay, I am afflicted though I am innocent, then your impatience may have ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your ſorrows ſhall be no longer than you make them <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> and will you grudge at your own <hi>benefit</hi>? Or at the trouble of your Phyſick while you continue your diſeaſe? It is but [<hi>if need be</hi>] that <hi>now for a ſeaſon ye are in heavineſs through manifold temptations,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6, And who maketh the <hi>Need</hi>? Is it God or you? Who maketh you <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>ſloathful,</hi> and <hi>ſenſual</hi>? Who turneth your hearts to earthly things, and deprives you of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59411:14"/>
ſweetneſs of things ſpiritual and heavenly? Who maketh you proud and unbelieving, and uncharitable? It is he that doth this, that cauſeth the need of your afflictions, and is to be blamed for the bitterneſs of them; but it is your Phyſician that is to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and praiſed for fitting them ſo wiſely to your Cure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your ſorrows ſhall not be ſo long as you deſerve. It is ſtrange ingratitude, for that man to grudge at a ſhort affliction that is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from everlaſting miſery, and confeſſeth he hath deſerved the pains of Hell. Confeſs with thankfulneſs, <hi>That it is his mercy that you are not conſumed</hi> and condemned, <hi>becauſe his compaſſions fail not</hi>: If <hi>God be your portion, hope in him: For the Lord is good to them that wait for him; to the Soul that ſeeketh him: It is good that you both hope and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord: It is good for a man that he bear the yoak in his youth: He ſitteth alone and keepeth ſilence, becauſe he hath born it upon him: He putteth his mouth in the duſt, if ſo be there may be hope. He giveth his Cheek to him that ſmiteth him, he is filled full with reproach: For the Lord will not caſt off for ever, but though he cauſe grief, yet will he have compaſſion, according to the multitude of his mercies,</hi> Lam. 3.22. to 33. Ezr. 9.13. <hi>All that is come upon us is for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſſes, and God hath puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Your ſorrows ſhall not be ſo long as the <hi>ſorrows of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> nor as thoſe that <hi>you muſt endure,</hi> if you will chuſe ſin to eſcape theſe <hi>preſent</hi> ſorrows. <hi>Abels</hi> ſorrow is not ſo long as <hi>Cains:</hi> Nor <hi>Peters</hi> or <hi>Pauls</hi> ſo long as <hi>Judas</hi>'s. If the Offering of a more <hi>acceptable Sacrifice</hi> do coſt a righteous man his life, alas what is that to the puniſhment that malignant envious <hi>Cainites,</hi> or treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Judas</hi>'s muſt endure. What is the worſt that man can do, or the moſt that God will here inflict, to the Reprobates endleſs helliſh torments? O had you ſeen what <hi>they</hi> endure, or had you felt thoſe pains but a day or hour, I can hardly think that you would ever after make ſo great a matter of the ſufferings of a Chriſtian here for Chriſt, or that you would fear ſuch ſufferings more than hell. It is diſingenuous to repine at ſo gentle a Rod, at the ſame time whilſt millions are in the flames of Hell, and when theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings tend to keep you thence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Your ſorrows ſhall not be ſo long as your following joys, if you be perſevering conquering believers.</hi> What is a ſickneſs, or a ſcorn, or a Priſon, or baniſhment, or ſhame, or death, when it muſt end
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59411:14"/>
in the endleſs joys of Heaven. O do but <hi>believe theſe</hi> with a lively, ſound, effectual Faith, and you will make light of all the ſufferings in the way. <hi>Nihil crus ſentit in nervo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>cum animus eſt in Coelo</hi>: The mind that is in Heaven, and ſeeth him that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, will eaſily bear the Bodies pains. Miſtake not in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and you will reckon <hi>that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us,</hi> Rom. 8.18. 2 Cor. 4.17, 18. <hi>For our light affliction which is but for a moment, doth work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: For the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. And if it be but for a [<hi>Now</hi>] that you muſt have ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, how reaſonable is it that thoſe ſorrows be moderated and mixt with joy? And how juſt are thoſe commands, <hi>Rejoice ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.16. Math. 5, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Rejoice and be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad, for great is your reward in Heaven,</hi> Rom. 12.12. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in hope, patient in tribulation,</hi> Act. 5.42. How rational was their joy, who being <hi>beaten</hi> and <hi>forbidden</hi> to Preach, <hi>departed from the preſence of the Council, rejoicing that they were counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer ſhame for the name of Chriſt</hi>; 1 Pet. 4.13, 14. <hi>Rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings. — If ye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for the name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the ſpirit of glory and of God reſteth upon you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On their part he is evil ſpoken of, but on your part he is glorified:</hi> It is a ſhame to be dejected under a ſhort and tolerable pain, which is ſo near to the eternal pleaſure; and to ſuffer as if we believed not the end, and ſo to ſorrow as men that are without hope.</p>
            <p>Doct. 4. <hi>Chriſt will again viſit his ſorrowful Diſciples.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth not from them with an intent to caſt them off. When he hideth his face, he meaneth not to forſake them: When he taketh away any ordinances or mercies, he doth not give them a Bill of divorce. When he ſeemeth to yield to the powers of darkneſs, he is not overcome, nor will he give up his Kingdom or Intereſt in the World. When he letteth the Boar into his Vineyard, it is not to make it utterly deſolate, or turn it common to the barren wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He hath conquered the greateſt enemies already; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there remaineth none to conquer <hi>him.</hi> He hath triumphed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59411:15"/>
over Satan; Death and Hell: He hath conquered ſin, and what is there left to depoſe him from his Dominion?</p>
            <p n="2">2. He retaineth ſtill his Relation to his Servants: Whether he be corporally preſent or abſent, he knoweth his own! and it is <hi>their care</hi> alſo, that whether <hi>preſent or abſent, they may be accepted of him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7, 8, 9. He is their <hi>Head</hi> while they are ſuffering on Earth; and therefore he feeleth their ſufferings and infirmities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. And hence it is that he thus rebuketh a perſecuting Zealot, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> Act. 9, 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He hath not laid by the leaſt meaſure of his love; he loveth us in Heaven as much as he did on Earth; <hi>Having loved his own which were in the World, to the end he loved them,</hi> Joh. 13.1. And as <hi>Joſephs</hi> love could not long permit him to conceal himſelf from his Brethren, but broke out the more violently after a ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, ſo that he fell on their Necks and wept; ſo will not the more tender love of Chriſt permit him long to hide his face, or eſtrange himſelf from the People of his Love: And when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth, it will be with redoubled expreſſions of endearment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His Covenant with his Servants is ſtill in force; his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſure, and ſhall never be broken, though the performance be not ſo ſpeedy as we deſire, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth Covenant and Mercy with them that love him, and keep his Commandments to a thouſand generations, and repayeth them that hate him to their face to deſtroy them: He will not be ſlack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face,</hi> 1 King. 8.23. <hi>He keepeth Covenant and Mercy with his Servants that walk before him with all their heart,</hi> So Dan. 9.4. Neh. 1.5. and 9.32. And it is the promiſe of Chriſt when he departed from his Servants, That <hi>he will come again and take them to himſelf, that where he is, there they may be alſo,</hi> Joh. 14.3. and 12.26.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His own <hi>intereſt,</hi> and <hi>honor,</hi> and <hi>office,</hi> and <hi>preparations,</hi> do engage him to return to his diſconſolate Flock: His <hi>Jewels</hi> and <hi>peculiar Treaſure</hi> are his intereſt, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. 1 Pet. 2.9. Exod. 19.5. He that hath choſen but a <hi>little Flock</hi> (Luk. 12.32.) and confined his <hi>intereſt</hi> and treaſure into ſuch a narrow compaſs, will not forſake that <hi>little Flock,</hi> but ſecure them to his Kingdom. He that hath made it his office to Redeem and Save them, and hath ſo dearly bought them, and gone ſo far in the work of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will loſe none of all his coſt and preparations, but for his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59411:15"/>
               <hi>People,</hi> and his <hi>Blood,</hi> and his <hi>Honour,</hi> and his <hi>Fathers Will,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> will certainly finiſh what he hath undertaken. And therefore his withdrawings ſhall not be everlaſting.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is for <hi>their ſakes</hi> that he withdraweth for a time: Though the bitter part be for their ſin, it is intended as Medicinal for their benefit; ſometimes he doth it to awake and humble them, and ſtir them up to ſeek him, and call after him: To ſhew them what they have done in provoking him to withdraw and hide his face, that renewed repentance may prepare them for the comforts of his return. Sometimes he hath ſuch work for them to do, which is not ſo agreeable to his preſence; as <hi>faſting,</hi> and <hi>mourning,</hi> and confeſſing him in ſufferings, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.15. And ſometimes he hath comforts of another kind to give them in his ſeeming abſence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7. <hi>I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away: For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart I will ſend him to you.</hi> As there were comforts which the Diſciples were fitteſt for in Chriſts Bodily abſence, ſo when he will take away his ordinances, or our proſperity or friends, there are comforts of another ſort, in ſecret Communion with him, and in ſuffering for him, which his people may expect: Not that any can expect it, who on that pretence do <hi>reject</hi> theſe Ordinances and Mercies, no more than the Diſciples could have expected the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> if they had <hi>rejected</hi> the corporal preſence of Chriſt: But God hath ſuch ſupplies for thoſe that mourn for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Miſunderſtand not then the departings of your Lord! It is too bad to ſay with the evil ſervant, My Lord delayeth his coming; and worſe to ſay, he will never return. 1. He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn at his appointed day to Judge the World; to juſtifie his Saints whom the World condemned; to anſwer the deſires, and ſatisfie all the expectations of Believers; and to comfort, and everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reward the faithful that have patiently waited for his return.

            <p n="2">2. And he will return alſo to the ſeemingly <hi>forſaken Flocks</hi> of his Diſciples: He hath his times of trial, when the Shepherds being ſmitten, the Sheep are ſcattered; and he hath his times of gathering the ſcattered ones again together, <hi>and giving them Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors after his own heart, that ſhall feed them with knowledge and underſtanding,</hi> Jer. 3.14, 15. And ſhall ſay, <hi>What is the Chaff unto the Wheat,</hi> Jer. 23.28. When we cry, <hi>Wo is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous</hi>! We muſt alſo ſay, <hi>Truly this is a grief, and I muſt bear it: My Tabernacle is ſpoiled, and all my Cords are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: My Children are gone forth of me, and they are not, there is none to ſtretch forth my Tent any more, and to ſet up my Curtains; for the Paſtors are become bruitiſh, and have not ſought the Lord. — O Lord correct me, but with judgment, not in thine anger, leſt thou bring me to nothing,</hi> Jer. 10.19, 20, 21.24. <hi>Many Paſtors have deſtroyed my Vineyard, they have trodden my Portion under foot, they have made my pleaſant Portion a deſolate Wilderneſs, and being deſolate it mourneth to me; the whole Land is made deſolate, becauſe no man layeth it to heart,</hi> Jer. 12.10, 11. <hi>But wo be unto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors that deſtroy and ſcatter the Sheep of my Paſture, ſaith the Lord. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord againſt the Paſtors that feed my People, ye have ſcattered my Flock, and driven them away, and have not viſited them: Behold I will viſit upon you the evil of your doings, and I will gather the remnant of my Flock. — And I will ſet up Shepherds over them which ſhall feed them, and they ſhall fear no

more, nor be diſmayed, neither ſhall they be lacking, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 34. <hi>Wo to the Shepherds of</hi> Iſrael <hi>that feed themſelves; ſhould not the Shepherds feed the Flocks? Ye eat the fat, and cloath you with the Wool, ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the Flocks. The diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthened, neither have ye healed that which was ſick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye ſought that which was loſt; but with</hi> FORCE <hi>and with</hi> CRUELTY <hi>have ye ruled them. — Thus ſaith the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am againſt the Shepherds, and I will require my Flock at their hands, and cauſe them to ceaſe from feeding the Flock, neither ſhall the Shepherds feed themſelves any more; for I will deliver my Flock from their mouth. — Behold I, even I, will both ſearch my Sheep and ſeek them out, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been ſcattered in the Cloudy and dark day. —And as for you, O my Flocks, behold I judge between Cattel and Cattel, between the Rams and the Hee-Goats? Is it a ſmall thing to you, to have eaten up the good Paſture, but ye muſt tread down with your Feet the reſidue of your Paſtures, and to have drunk of the deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but ye muſt foul the reſidue with your Feet? And as for my Flock, they eat that which you have trodden with your Feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your Feet. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God unto them, behold I, I will judge between the fat Cattel and the lean?

Anſ. 1. <hi>Be not contented and pleaſed with his abſence.</hi> You muſt <hi>bear</hi> it, but not <hi>deſire</hi> it. Elſe you are either <hi>Enemies,</hi> or Children that have run themſelves into ſuch <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> that they take their <hi>Father</hi> for <hi>their</hi> Enemy. 2.

He may well take it ill, when you can let him go, and be as merry without him, as if his abſence were no loſs to you. If you care no more for him, he will <hi>make</hi> you care, before you ſhall feel the comforts of his preſence. Such contempt is the way to a worſe forſaking: Call after him till he return, if he hide his face. 3. Turn not aſide to the creature for content, and ſeek not to make up the loſs of his preſence, with any of the deceitful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the World. Let him not ſee you take another in his ſtead, as if <hi>Riches,</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Worldly friends,</hi> or <hi>fleſhly pleaſure,</hi> would ſerve your turn inſtead of Chriſt: If once you come to this, he may juſtly leave you to your vain contents, and let them ſerve your turn as long as they can; and ſee how well they will ſupply

O how quickly will it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed! ſink not into deſpondency of mind! be not diſmayed in the duties or ſufferings to which you are called. <hi>Lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees, and make ſtraight paths for your feet, leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed,</hi> Heb. 12.12, 13. <hi>Be ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.58. <hi>Be ſober and hope unto the end,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.13.

            <p>Doct. 5. <hi>When Chriſt ſhall again appear to his Diſciples, their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſhall be turned into joy: When Chriſt returneth, Joy returneth,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Thou hideſt thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> But <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>Thou haſt turned for me my mourning into dancing: Thou haſt put off my Sackcloth, and girded me with gladneſs, to the end that my glory may ſing praiſe to thee, and not be ſilent: O Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</hi> When the Sun ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it is day, and its approach diſpelleth the Winter Froſts, and reviveth the almoſt dying Creatures, and calleth up the Life which was hidden in the ſeed, or retired unto the root, after a ſharp and ſpending Winter, how quickly doth the Suns return recover the verdour and beauty of the Earth, and cloth it in green, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59411:18"/>
ſpangle it with the ornaments of odoriferous Flowers, and enrich it with ſweet and plenteous fruits: The Birds that were either hid or ſilent, appear and ſing, and the face of all things is changed into joy. So is it with the poor deſerted Soul, upon the return of Chriſt; unbelieving doubts and fears then vaniſh: The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſadneſs are laid aſide, and thoſe of gladneſs are put on: The language of diſtruſt and deſpairing lamentations are firſt turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into words of hope, and then into words of peace, and then into joyful thankfulneſs and praiſe. The Soul that was skilled in no ſpiritual diſcourſe, but complaining of a dead and frozen heart, of dull and cold and lifeleſs duties, is now taken up in the rehearſals of the works of infinite love, and ſearching into the myſteries of redemption, and reciting the great and precious promiſes, and magnifying the name and grace of its Redeemer, and expatiating in the praiſes of the everlaſting Kingdom, the heavenly glory, the bleſſed Society, and eſpecially of the Lamb, and of the eternal God. You would not think that this is the ſame Perſon, that lately could ſcarce think well of God, or that dwelt in tears and duſt, and darkneſs, and could think of nothing but Sin and Hell, and from every text and every Providence, concluded nothing, but [<hi>undone</hi>] or <hi>damned:</hi> Would you think this joyful, thankful Soul, were the ſame that lately was crying on the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me</hi>! that could find nothing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the tables of his heart, but <hi>forſaken, miſerable</hi> and <hi>undone</hi>; that daily cried out, <hi>It is too late, there is no hope, I had a day of grace, but it is paſt and gone.</hi> When Chriſt returneth, and cauſeth his face to ſhine upon them, all this is turned into [<hi>Praiſe and honour and glory unto the Lamb, and to the Almighty and moſt Holy God, that liveth for ever, and is the everlaſting Joy and Portion of his Saints.</hi>] And ſooner or later, thus will it be with all the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that wait on God in the day of trial, and deal not falſly in his Covenant: The Son who was <hi>brought up with</hi> the Father, <hi>and was daily his delight, rejoycing always before him, rejoycing alſo in the habitable parts of the Earth, whoſe delights were with the Sons of Men,</hi> doth bleſs the Children of Wiſdom with a participation of his delights: For <hi>bleſſed are they that keep his ways. — Bleſſed is the Man that heareth him, watching daily at his Gates, waiting at the Poſts of his Doors: For he that findeth him findeth life, and ſhall obtain favour of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 8.30. to the 36. Though Chriſt had left his Diſciples ſo lately under fears and trouble, guilty of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59411:18"/>
deſerting him, and ſeemingly now deſerted by him, yet early on the third day, he ariſeth for their conſolation, and preſently ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them theſe joyful words, in the firſt ſpeech he uttereth, and that by a Woman that had been ſorrowful and a ſinner, [<hi>Go to my Brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend to my Father and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to my God and your God</hi>] Joh. 20.17. Thoſe that his Miniſters have long been comforting in vain, when Chriſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he will revive and comfort them in a moment, and with a word. The Soul that now Crieth [<hi>O it is impoſſible, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be</hi>] doth little know how eaſie it is with Chriſt. It is but ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Lazarus ariſe</hi>: Or, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> and there will be <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> immediately at his command.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And ſo when he reſtoreth his <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Church, and reſtoreth their holy opportunities and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of grace, what gladneſs and praiſing their Redeemer will there be? As it was with the Churches upon the death of <hi>Julian,</hi> and after the Heathen and the Arrian perſecutions, in the happy Reign of <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Marcian,</hi> &amp;c. How joyfully did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Exiles return to Worſhip God in their Native Land, upon the death of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; and ſee the fall of <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Gardiner,</hi> that had ſacrificed ſo many holy Chriſtians in the Flames? How gladly did they grow in the Soil that was manured with the Blood and Aſhes of their faithful Brethren, and reap the fruit of their fortitude and ſufferings? When Chriſt whipt the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, and would not let them make the Houſe of Prayer a place of Merchandize, what <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s were ſounded in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Math. 21.15, 16. <hi>When the Salvation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>cometh out of</hi> Zion, <hi>and the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people,</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall rejoyce, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be glad,</hi> Pſal. 14, 7. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in his houſe, for they will be ſtill praiſing him! For a day in his Courts is better than a thouſand,</hi> Pſal. 84.4.10. <hi>Bleſſed is the people that know the joyful ſound; they ſhall walk, O Lord, in the Light of thy countenance; in thy name ſhall they rejoyce all the day, and in thy righteouſneſs ſhall they be exalted: For the Lord is our defence, and the holy One of</hi> Iſrael <hi>is our King,</hi> Pſal. 89.15, 16, 17, 18. What gladneſs was there at a private meeting of a few Chriſtians that met to pray for <hi>Peter,</hi> when they ſaw him delivered and come among them, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.12.5.14. When the Churches had <hi>Reſt,</hi> they <hi>were edified and walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Act. 9.31.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59411:19"/>3. But the <hi>great joy</hi> will be when Chriſt returneth in his Glory at the laſt day! what a multitude of ſorrows will there be ended? And what a multitude of Souls will then be comforted? What a multitude of deſires and prayers, and expectations will then be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered! How many thouſand that have <hi>ſowed in tears, ſhall then reap in everlaſting joy</hi>! When the Creature ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. When all the faith and labour, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all the Saints from the beginning of the World, ſhall be rewarded with the Rivers of celeſtial pleaſure, and the juſt ſhall <hi>enter into their Maſters joy,</hi> Mat. 25.21.</p>
            <p>That you may the better underſtand the ſweetneſs of all theſe ſorts of joy, which Chriſts return will bring to Saints, obſerve theſe following ingredients in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is <hi>Chriſt himſelf that is the object of their joy</hi>: He that is the dearly beloved of their Souls; that for their ſakes was made a man of ſorrows. It is he who is their <hi>hope</hi> and help: with whom they are in covenant as their only Saviour. In whom they have truſted, with whom they have deponed their Souls! If <hi>he</hi> ſhould fail them, all would fail them; and they were of all Men moſt miſerable: They would be comfortleſs if he ſhould not come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and were not their comfort. The <hi>World cannot</hi> help and comfort them, for it is empty, vain, a tranſient ſhadow: It <hi>will not,</hi> for it is <hi>malignant,</hi> and our profeſſed enemy. <hi>For we know that we are of God, and the whole World is</hi> in maligno poſitus, <hi>ſet on wickedneſs,</hi> (or as ſome think becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is put for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the foregoing Verſe, and the Article here alſo uſed) is as it were <hi>planted into the Devil,</hi> or <hi>put under the Devil</hi> to War againſt Chriſt and the holy Seed: And indeed Satan ſeemeth in this War againſt the Church, to have ſomewhat like ſucceſs as he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt himſelf: As Chriſt muſt be a Man of ſorrows and ſcorn, and be crucified as a Blaſphemer and a Traitour, before he rejoice the hearts of his Diſciples by his reſurrection, ſo the Church was a perſecuted, ſcorned handful of Men, for the firſt three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and then it roſe by Chriſtian Emperours to ſome repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, till Satan by another game overcame them by <hi>Judas</hi> his Succeſſours; that for [<hi>what will you give me</hi>] by Pride and Worldlineſs betrayed them into that deplorate ſtate, in which they have continued theſe 900 Years at leaſt: So that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian name is confined to a ſixth part of the World; and ſerious
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59411:19"/>
ſanctified Believers are perſecuted more by the Hypocrites that wear the Livery of Chriſt, than by Heathens and Infidels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And when the Church is ſo low, almoſt like Chriſt on the Croſs and the Grave, will not a Reſurrection be a joyful change? When it crieth out on the Croſs, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Will not Chriſt appearing for its deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance be a welcome ſight?</p>
            <p>It was when <hi>Adam</hi> had brought a Curſe on himſelf and his Poſterity, and all the Earth, that Redemption by the holy Seed was promiſed; and when Satan had conquered Man, that Chriſt was promiſed to conquer him. It was when the World was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the deluge that its reparation was promiſed to <hi>Noah</hi>: It was when <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Sojourner in a ſtrange Land, that the peculiar promiſes were made to him and his Seed. It was when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were enſlaved to extremity, that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. And it was when the Scepter was departing from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and they and the World were gone from God, that Chriſt the Light of the World was ſent. And when the Son of Man cometh, ſhall he find faith on the Earth? When we ſee how vaſt the Heathen and Infidel Kingdoms are, and what a poor deſpiſed People thoſe are that ſet their chief hopes on Heaven, and how Satan ſeemeth every where to prevail againſt them, and moſt by falſe and Worldly Chriſtians, what a trial is this to our Faith and Hope? As the Diſciples ſaid of a Crucified Chriſt, <hi>We truſted it had been he that ſhould have Redeemed</hi> Iſrael; we are almoſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the hour of temptation to ſay, <hi>We truſted that Gods Name ſhould</hi> have been Hallowed, and his Kingdom come, and his Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven? And O how ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and how joyful will the Churches Reſurrection be after ſuch low and ſad diſtreſs? Many a ſad Chriſtian under the Sentence of Death, is going hence with fear and trouble: When a Moment ſhall tranſmit them into the joyful preſence of their Lord, and the poſſeſſion of that which with weakneſs and fear they did but believe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And Chriſt will not come or be alone: With him will come the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>: He will put glory on each Member, but much more on the whole O how many of our old Companions are now there? Not under temptation, or any of the tempters power? Not under the darkneſs of ignorance, error, or unbelief? Not under the pains of a languid, diſeaſed, corruptible Body?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59411:20"/>
Not under the fear of Sin, or Satan, or wicked Men: Not under the terror of Death or Hell, of an accuſing Conſcience, or the wrath of God: O with what joy ſhall we ſee and enjoy that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Society? To be tranſlated thither from ſuch a World as this, from ſuch temptations, ſins, ſuch fears and ſorrows, ſuch perfidious malignant wickedneſs, what will it be but to be taken as from a Goal unto a Kingdom, and from the Suburbs of Hell, unto the Communion of Bleſſed Saints and Angels, and into the Joy of our Lord.</p>
            <p>Doct. 6. <hi>Your Joy ſhall no Man take from you: The Joy that cometh at Chriſts return will be a ſecure everlaſting joy.</hi> Impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Heaven it ſelf: Chriſt and his Church will be Crucified no more: Nor any more deſpiſed, ſcorned, perſecuted, or falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed and condemned: Look not then for Chriſt or his Church in the Grave; <hi>he is not here, he is riſen</hi>: Who can we fear will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of that joy?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not our ſelves</hi>: And then we need to fear no other: Our folly and ſin is our Enemies ſtrength: They can do nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, without our ſelves. The Arrows that wound us are all feathered from our own Wings. But our trying time will then be paſt, and confirmation will be the reward of Conqueſt. He that hath kept us in the day of our trial, will keep us in our ſtate of reſt and triumph. How the (now) fallen Angels came to loſe their firſt innocency and wellfare, is unknown to us: But we have a promiſe of being for ever with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor ſhall Devils deprive us of that joy</hi>: Neither by thoſe malicious temptations wherewith they now moleſt and haunt us: Nor by the unhappy advantages which we have given them by our ſin, to corrupt our imaginations and thoughts, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or to diſturb our paſſions, or pervert our underſtandings. Nor by any terror or violence to moleſt us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Nor ſhall any Men take from us that joy</hi>: The bleſſed will increaſe it: Their Joy will be ours; and the wicked will be utterly diſabled: They will be miſerable themſelves in Hell. They will no more endanger us by flattering tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations; nor terrify us by threats; nor tread us down by their power; nor hurt us in their malice; nor render us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious by falſe accuſations; nor triumph over us with pride and falſe reproach. They that ſaid of the Church as of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59411:20"/>
Chriſt, <hi>He truſted in God, let him deliver him now if he will have him; for he ſaid, I am the Son of God</hi>;<note place="margin">Mat. 27.43.</note> they ſhall ſee that God hath delivered his Church, and he will have it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> And will not a firm belief of all this, rejoyce the Soul under all diſappointments and ſufferings on Earth? And doth not our dejectedneſs and want of Joy declare the ſinful weakneſs of our faith? O Sirs, our ſadneſs, our impatience, our ſmall deſire to be with Chriſt, the little comfort that we fetch from Heaven do tell us that Chriſtianity, and a life of Faith, is a harder work than moſt imagine: And the <hi>Art and Form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Words</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs are much more common than a holy Heavenly mind and life. Chriſt ſpeaketh many words of pity, to his Servants under ſorrows and ſinking grief, which ſome miſtake for words of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or command. <hi>Why are ye afraid, O ye of little faith,</hi> were words both of compaſſion and reproof. I am ſure the great unbelief that appeareth in much of our dejectedneſs and ſorrow, deſerveth more reproof than our ſufferings deſerve to be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe ſorrows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. I will therefore take my farewel of you, in adviſing, and charging you as from God, that you be not deceived by a flattering World, nor dejected by a frowning World, but place your hopes on thoſe Joys which no Man can take from you. If you cannot truſt the Love of God, and the Grace and Promiſes of our Saviour, and the witneſs of the Holy Spirit, you muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; for there is no other truſt.</p>
            <p>So many of you ſeem to have choſen this good part, the one thing neceſſary which ſhall never be taken from you, that in the midſt of our ſorrows, I muſt profeſs that I part with you with thankfulneſs and joy. And I will tell you for what I am ſo thankful, that you may know what I would have you be for the time to come.</p>
            <p n="1">I I thank the Lord that choſe for me ſo comfortable a ſtation, even a People whom he purpoſed to bleſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I thank the Lord that I have not laboured among you in vain, and that he opened the Hearts of ſo great a number of yours, to receive his Word with a teachable and willing mind.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I thank the Lord that he hath made ſo many of you as helpful to your Neighbours in your place, as I have been in mine; and that you have not been uncharitable to the Souls
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59411:21"/>
of others, but have with great ſucceſs endeavoured the good of all.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I rejoyce that God hath kept you humble, that you have not been addicted to proud oſtentation of your Gifts or Wiſdom, nor inclined to invade any part of the Sacred Office, but to ſerve God in the capacity where he hath placed you.</p>
            <p n="5">V. I rejoyce that God hath made you Unanimous, and kept out Sects and Hereſies, and Schiſms, ſo that you have ſerved him as with one Mind and Mouth: And that you have not been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to proud wranglings, diſputings, and contentions, but have lived in Unity, Love and Peace, and the practice of known and neceſſary truths.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. I rejoyce that your frequent meetings in your Houſes, ſpent only in Reading, Repeating your Teachers Sermons, Prayer and Praiſe to God, have had none of thoſe effects which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles of proud Opiniators, and Self-conceited Perſons uſe to have, and which have brought even needful converſe, and godly communication into ſuſpicion at leaſt with ſome, that argue againſt duty from the abuſe.</p>
            <p>Yea, I rejoyce that hereby ſo much good hath been done by you. You have had above Forty years experience of the great benefit of ſuch well ordered Chriſtian converſe, increaſing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, quickening holy deſires, prevailing with God, for marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, if not miraculous anſwers of your earneſt prayers, keeping out errors and Sects.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. I am glad that you have had the great encouragement of ſo many ſober, godly, able, peaceable Miniſters, in all that part of the Country round about you, and moſtly through that and the Neighbour Countries: Men that avoided vain and bitter conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that engaged themſelves in no Sects or Factions, that of a multitude not above two that I know of, in all our Aſſociation had ever any hand in Wars: But their principles and practices were reconciling and pacificatory: They conſented to Catechize all their Pariſhioners, Houſe by Houſe, and to live in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able practice of ſo much Church Diſcipline, as good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of ſeveral parties were all agreed in. And you have lived to ſee what that Diſcipline was, and what were the effects of ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. I am glad that you were kept from taking the Solemn League and Covenant, and the Engagement, and all conſent to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59411:21"/>
the change of the conſtituted Government of this Kingdom. I took the Covenant my ſelf, of which I repent, and I'le tell you why: I never gave it but to one Man (that I remember) and he profeſſed himſelf to be a Papiſt Phyſician newly turned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, and he came to me to give it him: I was perſwaded that he took it in falſe diſſimulation, and it troubled me to think what it was to draw multitudes of men by carnal intereſt ſo falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take it: And I kept it and the engagement from being taken in your Town and Country. At firſt it was not impoſed but taken by Volunteers: But after that it was made a teſt of ſuch as were to be truſted or accepted. Beſides the illegality, there are two things that cauſe me to be againſt it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Men ſhould make a meer dividing engine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it a means of Unity: We all knew at that time when it was impoſed, that a great part, if not the greateſt, of Church and Kingdom were of another mind: And that as Learned and Worthy Men were for Prelacy, as moſt the World had (ſuch as <hi>Uſher, Morton, Hall, Davenant, Brownrig,</hi> &amp;c.) And to make our terms of Union to be ſuch as ſhould exclude ſo many and ſuch Men, was but to imitate thoſe Church Dividers and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, who in many Countries and Ages, have ſtill made their own Impoſitions the engines of diviſion, by pretence of Union. And it ſeemeth to accuſe Chriſt, as if he had not ſufficiently made us <hi>terms</hi> of Concord, but we muſt deviſe our own Forms as neceſſary thereto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it was an impoſing on the Providence of God, to tye our ſelves by Vows to that as unchangeable which <hi>we</hi> knew not but God might after change, as if we had been the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his Providence. No Man then knew but that God might ſo alter many circumſtances, as might make ſome things ſins that were then taken for duty, and ſome things to be duty which then paſt for ſin: And when ſuch changes come, we that ſhould have been content with Gods Obligations, do find our ſelves enſnared in our own raſh Vows.</p>
            <p>And I wiſh that it teach no other Men the way of dividing Impoſitions either to cut the Knot, or to be even with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. I greatly rejoyce that Family Religion is ſo conſcionably kept up among you, that your Children, and Apprentices,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59411:22"/>
ſeem to promiſe us a hopeful continuation of piety among you.</p>
            <p n="10">X. And I thank God that ſo great a number of Perſons Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for holineſs, temperance, humility and charity, are ſafely got to Heaven already, ſince I firſt came among you, and being eſcaped from the temptations and troubles of this preſent evil World, have left you the remembrance of their moſt imitable Examples.</p>
            <p>And having all this comfort in you as to what is paſt, I ſhall once more leave you ſome of my Counſels and Requeſts, for the time to come, which I earneſtly intreat you not to neglect.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Spend moſt of your ſtudies in confirming your belief of the Truth of the Goſpel, the Immortality of the Soul, and the Life to come, and in exerciſing that belief, and laying up your treaſure in Heaven; and ſee that you content not your ſelves in talking of Heaven, and ſpeaking for it; but that your Hopes, your Hearts, and your Converſation be there; and that you Live for it, as worldlings do for the Fleſh.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Flatter not your ſelves with the hopes of long Life on Earth, but make it the ſumm of all your Religion, Care and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, to be ready for a ſafe and comfortable Death: For 'till you can fetch comfort from the Life to come, you can have no comfort that true reaſon can juſtify.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Live as in a conſtant War againſt all fleſhly luſts, and love not the World as it cheriſheth thoſe luſts: Take heed of the love of Mony, as the root of manifold evils: Think of Riches with more <hi>Fear</hi> than <hi>Deſire</hi>: Seeing Chriſt hath told us, how hard and dangerous it maketh our way to Heaven. When once a Man falls deeply in love with Riches, he is never to be truſted, but becomes falſe to God, to all others, and to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Be furniſhed before hand with expectation and patience, for all evils that may befal you: And make not too great a matter of ſufferings, eſpecially Poverty, or wrong from Men. It is ſin and folly in poor Men, that they over-value Riches, and be not thankful for their peculiar Bleſſings. I am in hopes that God will give you more quietneſs than many others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are none of you rich: Its a great means of ſafety to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59411:22"/>
have nothing that tempteth another Mans deſire, nor that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieth you for: Deſpiſed Men live quietly, and he that hath an empty Purſe can ſing among the Robbers. He that lieth on the ground feareth not falling. When <hi>Judea</hi> (and ſo when <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> &amp;c.) was Conquered, the poor were let alone to poſſeſs and Till the Land, and had more than before: It was the Great and Rich that were deſtroyed, or carried, or driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Is it not a great benefit to have your Souls ſaved from rich Mens temptations, and your Bodies from the envy, aſſaults and fears, and miſeries that they are under?</p>
            <p n="5">V. Take heed of a Self-conceited unhumbled underſtanding, and of haſty and raſh concluſions; it is the Fool that rageth and is confident: Sober Men are conſcious of ſo much darkneſs and weakneſs, that they are ſuſpicious of their apprehenſions; Proud ſelf conceitedneſs, and raſh haſty concluding, cauſeth moſt of the miſchiefs in the world; which might be prevented, if Men had the humility and patience to ſtay till things be throughly weighed and tried. Be not aſhamed to profeſs uncertainty where you are indeed uncertain: Humble <hi>doubting</hi> is much ſafer than confident erring.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Maintain Union and Communion with all true Chriſtians on Earth; and therefore hold to Catholick principles of <hi>meer Chriſtianity</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without which you muſt needs crumble into Sects. Love Chriſtians as Chriſtians, but the beſt moſt: Locally ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from none, as accuſing of them further than they ſeparate from Chriſt, or deny you their Communion unleſs you will ſin. The zeal of a Sect as ſuch is partial, turbulent hurtful to Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and maketh men as Thorns and Thiſtles: But the zeal of Chriſtianity as ſuch, is pure and peaceable, full of mercy and good fruits, mellow and ſweet, and inclineth to the good of all. If God give you a faithful or a tolerable publick Miniſter, be thankful to God, and love, honour and encourage him; and let not the Imperfections of the Common-Prayer make you ſeparate from his Communion; prejudice will make all Modes of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip different from that which we preferr, to ſeem ſome hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinful Crime: But humble Chriſtians are moſt careful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the frame of their own Hearts, and conſcious of ſo much faultineſs in themſelves and all their ſervice of God, that they are not apt to accuſe and aggravate the failings of others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59411:23"/>
in matters, which God has left to our own determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Whether we ſhall pray with a Book or without, in divers ſhort Prayers, or one long one, whether the People ſhall ſing Gods praiſe in Tunes, or ſpeak it in Proſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is left to be determined by the general rules of Concord, Order, and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Yet do not withdraw from the Communion of Sober, Godly Nonconformiſts, though falſly called Schiſmaticks by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Be ſure that you maintain due honour and ſubjection to your Governours: <hi>Fear the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change,</hi> Prov. 24.21. and that <hi>in regard of the Oath of God,</hi> Eccl. 8.2. <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought, and curſe not the Rich in thy Bed-chamber; for a Bird of the Air ſhall carry the voice, and that which hath Wings ſhall tell the matter,</hi> Eccl. 10.20. Obey God with your firſt and abſolute obedience, and no man againſt him, but obey the juſt commands of Magiſtrates, and that out of Obedience to God; and ſuffer patiently when you cannot obey. And if God ſhould ever caſt you under oppreſſing and perſecuting Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, in your patience poſſeſs your Souls; truſt God and keep your innocency, and abhor all thoughts of Rebellion or Revenge: He that believeth will not make haſte: Do nothing but what God will own, and then commit your ſelves and your way to him: Repreſs wrath, and hate unpeaceable Counſels: Our way and our time muſt be only Gods way and time. Self-ſaving men are uſually the deſtroyers of themſelves and others: <hi>Peter</hi> that drew his Sword for Chriſt, denied him the ſame Night with Oaths and Curſes. Fools truſt themſelves, and Wiſe Men truſt God: Fools tear the Tree by beating down the Fruit that's unripe and harſh; and Wiſe men ſtay till it is ripe and ſweet, and will drop into their hands: Fools rip up the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an untimely Birth; but Wiſe Men ſtay till Maturity give it them. Fools take red hot Iron to be Gold, till it burn their Fingers to the Bone: They ruſh into Seditions and Blood, as if it were a matter of jeſt; but Wiſe Men ſow the fruit of righteouſneſs in peace, and as much as in them lieth live peaceably with all men. All men are mortal, both oppreſſours and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Stay a little and mortality will change the Scene; Gods time is beſt. Martyrdom ſeldome killeth the hundredth part ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59411:23"/>
many as Wars do. And he is no true believer, that taketh Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom to be his loſs: And Chriſt is more intereſſed in his Goſpel, Church and Honour than we. Queen <hi>Maries</hi> cruelties, and the Biſhops bonefires, made Religion univerſally received the more eaſily when her ſhort Reign was ended. We may learn wit of the Fool, that ſeeing great Guns, and Muſquets, ask'd what they were to do; and the anſwerer ſaid, <hi>to kill men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Do not men die here without killing? In our Country they will die of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Be ſure that you keep up Family Religion; eſpecially in the careful Education of youth. Keep them from evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and from temptations, and eſpecially of idleneſs, fullneſs and baits of luſt. Read the Scripture and good Books, and call upon God and ſing his Praiſe: And recreate youth with reading the Hiſtory of the Church, and the Lives of Holy Men and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; inſtruct them in Catechiſms and Fundamentals.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Above all, live in Love to God and Man; and let not <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>worldlineſs</hi> prevail againſt it. Think of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as equal to his Greatneſs and Wiſdom, and take your ſelves as Members of the ſame Body with all true Chriſtians. Bleſſed are they that faithfully practiſe thoſe three grand principles which all profeſs, <hi>viz..</hi> 1. To love God as God above all, (and ſo to obey him.) 2. To love our Neighbours as our ſelves. 3. And to do as we would be done by. Love is not envious, malignant, cenſorious, it ſlandereth not, it perſecuteth not, it oppreſſeth not, it defraudeth not, it ſtriveth not to gain by anothers loſs: Get Men once to love their Neighbours as themſelves, and you may eaſily prognoſticate peace, quietneſs and concord, happineſs to the Land, and Salvation to the peoples Souls.</p>
            <p>Finally, Brethren live in love, and the God of love and peace ſhall be among you. The Lord ſave you from the evils of which I have here and often warned you: Remember with thankfulneſs the many years of abundant mercy which we have enjoyed (tho too much mixt with our ſins, and vilified by ſome) 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. <hi>Comfort your ſelves together, and edify one another, even as alſo ye do; and I beſeech you Brethren, to know them which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour among you, and are over you in the Lord and admoniſh you, and to eſteem them very highly in Love for their work ſake, and be at peace among your ſelves.</hi> And the Lord deeply write on all your
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59411:24"/>
Hearts theſe bleſſed words, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. <hi>We have known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Love that God hath to us. God is Love, and he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> And remember, 2 Pet. 3.11, 12, 13. <hi>Seeing all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of Perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, looking for and haſting to the coming of the day of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Heavens being on fire ſhall be diſſolved, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat: Nevertheleſs we according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, look for new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not lengthen my Counſels further to you now, having been called by the Will and Providence of God, to leave behind me a multitude of Books, which may remember you of what you heard, and acquaint the world what Doctrine I have taught you: And if longer ſtudies ſhall teach me to retract and amend any fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the writings or practice of my unripe and leſs experienced age, as it will be to my ſelf, as pleaſing as the cure of any Bodily Diſeaſe, I hope it will not ſeem ſtrange or ungrateful to you: Though we muſt hold faſt the truth which we have received, both you and I are much to be blamed, if we grow not in knowledge, both in Matter, Words and Method; The Lord grant that alſo we may grow in Faith, Obedience, Patience, in Hope, Love and deſire to be with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that great ſhepherd of the ſheep through the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be Glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi> Heb. 13.20, 21.</p>
