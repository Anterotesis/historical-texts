            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All these are not wrought, so much by any power that is in us, as by the Almighty power of God working in us; for the sinner would not see his sin, but the Lord forceth him, as the holy <hi>Prophet</hi> saith:<note place="margin">Psal. 74.4.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest my eyes waking, I am so troubled that I cannot speake,</hi> the Lord holds sinne to a carnall sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wretch, so that his sinne walkes, and sleepeth, and goeth with him; nay the soule of a poore sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner would beat backe the blow, and would not have the word to touch him, he labours to shift off the arrowes of the Almighty, which the Lord shooteth into the soule; but the Lord will not suffer him so to doe; <hi>Thy arrowes sticke fast in me<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and thy hand presseth me sore.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 38.2.</note> Psalm. 38.2. As if the


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21378:6"/>
Prophet had said, I would faine have beate backe thine arrowes, but they sticke fast in me; and I would have shaken off the burden, that lay upon me, but thine hand presseth me sore, so then at last, when the sinner sees, hee cannot shake off the arrowes, then he is content to bee separate from his corruptions.</p>
            <p>This is in generall in the text, wherin you shall plainly see these three particulars fully expressed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the sight of sinne by the hearing of <hi>Peters</hi> words, and it was not by the bare hearing of his words onely, but when <hi>Peter</hi> came somewhat roundly home to them, and said; This is <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> whom ye have crucified, then followes the former worke, namely, the acknowledgement of their sinnes, and the first cause that made them see their sinne, was a particular application of their sinnes, hee came punctually and particularly to them, and said, you are they that have crucified the Lord Christ, this touched them and made them see their sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the daily and serious meditation and apprehension of their sinnes, and of those truths, which were delivered in the word: <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that is, daily pondering and considering of the evills, that were committed by them and shewed to them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>they were pricked,</hi> they did not pricke themselves, but the Lord followed that truth that was delivered, and by his Almighty hand did make that word prosperous to their soules; and


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21378:7"/>
though they would not pierce themselves, yet the Lord pierced them.</p>
            <p>The second part of it is in these words, <hi>They were pricked in their hearts,</hi> not in their hands or eyes, but in their <hi>hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third part is the separation from sin in these words, <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>brethren, what shall we doe?</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you would have us to doe, we will doe it, and whatsoever sinne is forbidden, wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be rid of it; nay, nothing was too hard, or too much for them.</p>
            <p>Give mee leave to take a doctrine by the way from the words; they when <hi>they heard this,</hi> who were these (<hi>they?</hi>) see this in the 36. verse, <hi>them that had crucified the Lord of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What will some say, is it possible that ever they should be so pierced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> their sinnes? it was said of <hi>Iudas</hi> that betrayed Christ, <hi>it had been good for that man that he had not beene borne,</hi> What shall we thinke of those that murther Christ. If <hi>Iudas</hi> was damned for betraying of Christ? then much more they for killing of him. Is it possible the Lord should doe good unto them, yes, even they came to be pricked in their hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Doctrine</note>From these words this doctrine ariseth; It is possible for the most stubborne sinners upon earth to get a broken heart. <hi>They that stoned the Prophets and killed them that were sent unto them,</hi> and sleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the meanes of grace, they that refused Christ, and would not heare him; they are now brought upon their knees, and are resolved now, if any course might bee taken to get Christ and

yet it may be good: God hath not set the scale of condemnation upon your sinnes, he hath not yet sent you to hell.

In conclusion then, why may not my prophane sinfull heart be humbled and pierced?

               </note> First, consider in thy see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, a little mercy will not serve the turne; thou that hast been an old weather-beaten sinner, and hast wallowed in thy filthinesse, when thou goest to God for grace, consider it is not a little grace, or a small worke, that will doe the deed: it is not a few spoonfulls or buckets-full, that will cleanse a fouleskinne; so if thou hast had a filthy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan

heart which hath been a through-fare to all wickednesse, and thou hast thus given thy selfe liberty thereunto, and hast continued therein; there must be a well of mercy to purge such a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable wretch as thou art.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note>When <hi>David</hi> had committed those two sins of adultery &amp; murther, &amp; had continued in them long, he was forced to beg for much mercy, and to say, <hi>purge me, wash me, cleanse me.</hi> O Lord these staines are marvelous deepe, therefore purge me with hisope; nay he had never done with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his sinnes were more then ordinary; So, it will cost a great deale of worke before a loose prophane drunkard can be made cleane.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, thou must expect it with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and hardnesse in thy selfe, thou that hast beene rivetted in thy base lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A man that hath had a bone long out of joynt, &amp; it is now festred, it will make him cry many an <hi>oh,</hi> before it be brought into his right place againe; So it is with a man whose heart is full of filthines, it will cost him much paines and difficulty and heart-smart, before the Lord will bring the soule to a right set againe. <hi>Manasses</hi> humbled himselfe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily before the Lord, because he had bin a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proud rebellious man, the Lord made his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation as miraculous as his sinnes had beene,

and so <hi>David</hi> when he had given his sinnes ease in bedding with them, the Lord brake all his bones and did awaken him with a witnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Lastly, you must resolve to bestow the utmost of your endeavour to get this mercy at the hands of the Lord: It is not a dipping of a foule cloth in water will cleanse it, but it must be soaked and rinced in it: so you must not thinke to have the foule staines of sinne washed away with a few teares; No, no; you must rub your hearts over &amp; over, and awake your consciences againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; it is not a little examination, nor a little sorrow will serve the turne; the Lord will pull downe those proud hearts of yours, and (it may be,) let you goe a begging for mercy all your dayes, and well you may have it at your last gasp when all is done.</p>
            <p>The maine point in hand is this, It is for the first part of contrition for the sight of sinne; This <hi>hearing</hi> is not barely the sound of a mans words, but the sense and meaning of the words, by which the mind is inlightned, and he begins seriously to ponder the nature of his sinnes, that were so layed open unto him: thus <hi>hearing</hi> they came to be <hi>pierced.</hi>

            <p>Now for the better clearing of this doctrine, I will handle these three things: First, I will shew what this true sight of sinne is: Secondly, I will shew the reason why there must be a true sight of sinne, before the soule can be broken for it: thirdly, I will make use of the point.</p>
            <p>First, it is not every sight of sinne will serve the turne, nor every apprehension of a mans vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;<note place="margin">What the true sight of sin is.</note> but it must have these two properties in it, First, he must see sinne clearely; Secondly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victingly.


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21378:11"/>
First, he that will see sinne clearly, must see it truly and fully, &amp; be able to fadome the compasse of his corruptions and to dive into the depth of the wretchednesse of his vile heart,<note place="margin">The property of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No, this is the ground why we mistake our evils, and reforme not our waies, because we have a slight and an overly sight of sinne: a man must prove his wayes as the goldsmith doth his gold in the fire, a man must search narrowly, and have much light to see what the vilenesse of his owne heart is, and to see what his sinnes are, that doe procure the wrath of God against him, as the prophet <hi>David</hi> saith:<note place="margin">Psal. 119.36. opened.</note>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we must looke on the nature of sin in the venome of it, the deadly hurtfull nature that it hath for plagues and miseries it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to our soules; and that you may doe partly if you compare it with other things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and partly if you looke at it in regard of your selves; First, compare sinne with those things that are most fearefull and horrible; As suppose any soule here present were to behold the damned in hell, and if the Lord should give thee a little peepe hole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, that thou didst see the horror of those damned soules, and thy heart begins to shake in the consideration thereof; then propound this to thy owne heart, what paines the damned in hel doe indure for sinne, and thy heart will shake and quake at it, the least sinne that ever thou didst commit, though thou makest a light matter of it, is a greater evill then the paines of the damned in hell setting aside their sinne, all the torments in hell are not so great an evill, as the least sinne is: men begin to shrink at this, &amp; loath to go downe to hell, and to be in endlesse torments.</p>
            <p>Now I will make it good by three reasons that sinne is a greater evill then those torments and plagues which the damned in hell do indure.<note place="margin">What a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing sinne is.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The first reason is this, That which deprives a man of the greatest good must needs be the greatest evill,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </note> nature saies so much, that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives a man of all that comfort and happinesse wherein the soule finds most content, that must needs be the greatest euill of all, but sinne onely deprives a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the greatest good: for the good


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21378:13"/>
of the soule is, to have an heart united unto God and to have fellowship with him, to have him &amp; salvation through him, to be one with the Lord: this is the chiefest good of the soule: All things here below are made for the good of the body, and the body is made for the good of the soule, and the soule is made for God; and these things here below are only so farre good to us, as they are meanes to make us enjoy a nearer communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God; and contrarily, riches, and honours, and profits, and pleasures, are as so many curses to us, if by them our hearts be withdrawne from God: The reason why God is estranged from us, it is not because we are poore, or pursued, or imprisoned, or the like; but it is sin that breakes the union betweene God and us, as the prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith, <hi>Your sinnes have separated betweene you and your God:</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> Now that which separates from God which is the chiefest good, it is our sinnes; it is not punishment, that takes away the mercy of God from us; but a proud rebellious heart, and the contempt of Gods ordinances; Therefore sinne is farre worse then all the plagues that the damned doe or can suffer.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2.</note>Secondly, because there is nothing so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and opposite against the Lord as sinne &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and this is the reason why God is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicter of all the punishments of the damned in hell: it is through the Iustice of God that they are damned, because God is of such a pure nature that sinne cannot be in him, nor practised by him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3.</note>Thirdly, because it is sinne that doth procure


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21378:13"/>
all plagues and punishments to the damned, and therefore being the cause why they suffer, it must needs be greater then all punishments: for all punishments are made miserable by reason of sin, therefore sinne is a greater evill then all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of the damned. If a man were in prison and had the peace of a good Conscience, his prison would be a pallace unto him, and though a man were in shame and disgrace, and yet have the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, there were no misery in him, so it is with sinne; if no man suffer but for sinne, then sin is a greater evill then all other punishments, as being the fountaine from whence they flow.</p>
            <p>Now let us looke upon sinne through these things, and when our corrupt heart provokes us, and the world allure us, &amp; the devill tempts us to take any contentment in a sinfull way; suppose we saw hell fire burning before us, and the pit of hell gaping to swallow us, and sinne inticing of us, and let us say thus to our soules. It is better for a man to be cast into the torments of hell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the damned, then to be ouercome with any sin, and so to rebell against the Lord. Now therefore if those plagues and punishments make the soule shake in the consideration of them; Oh then blesse thy selfe so much the more from sinne which is the cause all plagues whatsoever; Were a man in hell and wanted his sinnes, the Lord would love him in hell, and deliver him from all those plagues: But if any man were free from all punishments, and in honour, and wealth, if he were a sinfull and wretched creature, the Lord


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21378:14"/>
would hate him in the height of all his prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and throw him downe to hell for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we must see sinne simply as it is in it selfe, in regard of the proper worke of it; it is nothing else but a profest opposing of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; a sinfull creature joynes side with the devill and the world, and comes in battaile array a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord, and flies in the face of the God of hosts;<note place="margin">Psal. 83.2.</note> they are called <hi>haters of God,</hi> Psam. 83. That is when they see grace in another man, in such a man, and in such a woman, and hate them for it; little doe they thinke that they <hi>hate</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>heaven</hi> and his holy nature; and if it were possible, they would have no God in heaven, to take notice of their sins, &amp; call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to account for them, as the wise man <hi>Gamaliel</hi> said to the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies</hi> and <hi>elders, refraine your selves from these men, and let them alone, for if this Counsell</hi> or worke <hi>be of men, it will come to nothing, but if it be of God, you cannot destroy it, lest you be found fighters against God</hi>; you make nothing of opposing the Gospell, and preaching thereof, I tell you that there is never a creature that lives in any such sinfull course, but he is a fighter against God, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the Lord as really as one man doth another; And as <hi>Stephen</hi> saith, <hi>You stifnecked and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in heart, you have resisted against the holy Ghost:</hi> You must not thinke that you resist men onely, no (poore creatures) you resist the Spirit, and so aime at the Almighty in opposing of the meanes of grace; What a fearefull condition is this, I pray you in cold blood consider this, and


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21378:14"/>
say thus, Good Lord! What a sinfull wretch am I? that a poore damned wretch of the earth should stand in defia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce against the God of hosts, and that I should submit my selfe to the devill, and oppose the <hi>Lord</hi> of hostes.</p>
            <p>And as you resist the Lord, so you doe also passe the sentence of condemnation upon your selves, and seale up that doome which one day shall be executed upon the wicked in hell at that great day of accompt; that looke what God shall do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, the same thou dost now by sinning; this is the doome, or (as I may say) the necke verse of the wicked and the last blow; as now thou doest depart from God by sinning, so then thou shalt depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> God for ever. A wicked man forsakes God, and pluckes his heart from under the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God that should inform him in the way of life; and the soule saith, God shall not blesse me, God shall not be God unto me; but I will live as I list, and I will run down post hast to hell, and when our hearts beginne to rise against God and his ordinances, and your soules beginne to goe against the Lord, I tell you what I would thinke with my selfe; suppose I heard the voice of the <hi>Archangell</hi> crying; <hi>Arise yee dead and come to Iudgement</hi>; and the last trumpet sounding, and the Lord Jesus comming in the heavens with his glorious Angells and did see the <hi>Goats</hi> standing <hi>

lamentation and woe your poore soules would make in those dayes, and therefore consider it well, and say that I doe that in sinning which the Lord will doe in the day of Judgement; shall I depart from the Lord and withdraw my selfe from mercy, and say Christ shall not rule over me and save me? shall I doe that against my selfe which the Lord shall doe in that day?

               </label> To this I answer, the reason why men see not their sinnes,<note place="margin">Why men see not the vilenes of sinne.</note> though it be so vile, it is mainely upon these two grounds.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because we judge not of sinne according to the word and verdict of it, but either in regard of the profit that is therein, or the pleasure that we expect there from; The Usurer lookes on his profit, that comes by sinne, and the adulterer his pleasure; and <hi>Iudas</hi> saw the money, but he did not see the malice of his owne heart, nor the want of love to his <hi>Master,</hi> and this made him take up that course which he did, but when he threw away his thirtie pence, the Lord made him see the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his sinne; it came cleerly to his sight, and therefore he cryed out: <hi>I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.</hi> As bribes blind the eyes of the wise and pervert judgment, so sin bribes the eyes of the soule, and therefore the Tradseman seeth much profit come by cozening &amp; false measures,


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21378:15"/>
and so gives way to himselfe therein, but he sees not the sin; so the oppressor seeth the morgages, &amp; pawnes that come in, but he cannot see his sin, till he be laid on his death bed, and then the Lord sheweth him all the wrong that he hath done.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, another reason why we see not the vilenesse of sinne, is, because we judge the nature of sinne according to Gods patience towards us, as thus, a man commits a sin &amp; is not plagued for it, and therefore he thinkes God will not execute judgements upon him at all, <hi>all things continue a like,</hi> (saith the wicked man) as if he had said, you talke of the wrath of God that shall be revealed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> heaven against all ungodlines, &amp; where is the promise of his comming? doe you not see that such a man is an oppressor, &amp; a prophane perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>? yet growes rich and thrives in the world; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God spares a wicked man still for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, therefore he thinkes all are but words, he shall be free from the punishment to come (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> saith in the name of the Lord) <hi>These things hast thou done and I kept silence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm. 50.2.</note> when thou wast upon thy Ale-bench, and there thou didst speake against holinesse and purity, and because I did beare yet, and say nothing, therfore thou speakest wickedly that <hi>I was even such a one as thy selfe</hi>; The wicked man takes Gods patience to be a kinde of allowance to him in his sinne, (as the wise man saith) <hi>because sentence against an evill worke is not speedily executed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 8.11.</note> 
               <hi>therefore the hearts of the sonnes of men are wholy set in them to doe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,</hi> &amp; as the Prophet saith, they call the proud


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21378:16"/>
happy,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.45.</note> 
               <hi>ye that worke wickednesse are set to doe evill, &amp; they that tempt God are delivered.</hi> As who should say, you say that the wrath of God is incensed against swearers, and drunkards, and the like; but we see them prosper, and because they doe pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thus, their hearts are set to worke wickednes, but howsoever, it is true the Lord doth sometime beare with wicked men; the longer God staies, the greater account they shall make, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier judgements they shall receive from God; See what <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>thou sealest up my transgressions in a bagge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 14.17.</note> 
               <hi>and thou sowest up mine iniquities</hi>; Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men doe treasure up vengeance against the day of the Lord, the profane person treasures up wrath, and in the eighteenth verse he saith: The mountaines falling come to nothing: as if he had said, good Lord, who can beare all those sinnes, that I have committed? Are they all sealed up, and shall all the judgements due unto them fall upon me heavier then the mountaines? Good Lord, what rock or mountaine can beare the weight of my sinnes thus sealed up &amp; setled, and laid close to my heart. And so God seales up an hundred thousand oathes in one bagge, and an ocean of pride and mischiefes done to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Church are barrelled up, in another: and the <hi>Lord</hi> shall one day lay all these upon thy necke; Who is able to beare all these sinnes?</p>
            <p>Now it falles out with a sinner as it is with a banckrout debtor, one man throwes him into prison, and when he is there, every one comes against him, and so he shall never come out, but


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21378:16"/>
die and rotte in the prison, so though the Lord will not execute judgement on thee speedily, yet in the end the Lord will be paid for all thy sins; and when thou art in hell, then mercy, and justice, and patience will cry all to heaven for justice and vengeance; then happily a drunkard is cast into prison for his drunkennesse, and for his blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and then all his filthinesse comes in as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bills of inditement against him: Oh therefore labour to see sinne alive: we play with sinne as if it were dead: when children see the picture of a dead lyon upon a wall, they labour to pull him in pieces, but if there were a live lyon in the place, it would make the strongest to runne. So thou paintest thy sinne, and sayest it is thy infirmity, &amp; God forgive your swearing, &amp; the like; and thus you dally with your sinnes: but brethren, labour to see sinne alive, and to see sinne roaring upon you, see the pawe of sinne and the condemnation that shall be throwne upon the soule by it, and this will awake the soule in the apprehension of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">How to see our sinnes convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctingly.</note> we must see sinne convictingly, that it may be so to us as it is in it selfe; that looke what sinne is in it selfe, we may so conceive of it in our soules being guilty of it, and this discovers it selfe in these two particulars.</p>
            <p>First, when we have a particular apprehension in our owne person, that looke what we confesse to be in sinne in generall, we confesse the same in our owne soules; and that our sinnes are as bad as the sinnes of any: this is the cursed distemper of


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21378:17"/>
our hearts, howsoever we hold it to be truth in generall, yet when we come to our owne sinnes, the case is altered, and we never come to the right seeing of them as they concerne our owne particular. As the adulterer can easily confesse the danger and filthynesse of that sinne in others, but he thinkes not his sinne to be so vile; as the Wise man saith, <hi>He that enters into the house of an harlot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 2.19.</note> 
               <hi>doth he ever returne againe, doth he ever take hold of the path of life?</hi> The Lord is pleased to set such a heavy stamp on this sinfull distemperature. These are truths, and a man in his cold blood wil easily confesse it in the generall, that he <hi>never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes againe.</hi> Take the words as they are in the letter of them, and howsoever they have some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpretations, yet in the letter it is thus read, <hi>he is euer hardly recovered.</hi> Howsoever it may be, yet with much difficulty. <hi>David</hi> had let his soule loose in that, &amp; he did hardly recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe againe, scarce one of a thousand yet ever tooke hold of the way of life. And the drunkard will confesse the danger of his sinne in generall, when he sees his drunken mates lie grovelling in the dust, he will be ashamed of it, and say, Now no adulterer or drunkard shall ever come into the kingdome of heaven; but here is the wound of it, when he comes to his owne particular drunkennesse and uncleannesse, that he must looke into them, then the sight of a mans know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath not so much power as to judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe rightly; or to make a particular application to himselfe; but he thinkes his adultery and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21378:17"/>
is not like to another mans, or else his knowledge is but weake, or else he seeth as a man in the twylight, when the sun is downe and the heavens begin to withdraw their light, though a man can see to read abroad, yet he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not see to read in the house, or in the chamber; So it is with a weake knowledge and with a feeble understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a wicked man, he is notable to see the vile nature of sinne in himselfe, when he comes to read his owne closet sinnes, and his bosome abominations, then he hath not so much light as to perceive them so fully in himself as he thought to doe; therefore the rule is this; Arest thy soule in a speciall maner of those sinnes whereof thou standest guilty; that phrase in <hi>Iob</hi> is to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,<note place="margin">Iob 13.27.</note> 
               <hi>thou lookest narrowly to my pathes thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet,</hi> so God followed <hi>Iob</hi> to the hard heeles, and did narrowly observe his waies; so deale thou with thy owne soule, and set a print upon the heele of thy heart, arest thy heart in particular for thy sins, and I would have you perceive your owne particular sinnes and follow them to your hearts, and make huy and cry after your sinnes, and dragge your hearts before the Lord, and say, Is murther, pride, drunkennesse, and uncleannesse, such horrible sinnes, and doth God thus fearefully plague them? Lord, it was my heart that was proud and vaine, it was my tongue that did speake filthily &amp; blasphemously, my hand hath wrought wickednesse, my eye was wanton, and my heart was uncleane and filthy, Lord here they are, it is my affections that are


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21378:18"/>
disorderly, and it is I that doe delight too much in the world; Thus bring thy heart before the Lord; you shall observe the same in <hi>David,</hi> so long, as <hi>Nathan</hi> spake of sinne in generall, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of it truly, and confessed the vilenes of it, and the heart of this good King did rage against the man, saying, It is the <hi>Sonne of death:</hi> but as soone as the prophet had said, <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> though he never saw his sinne kindly before, yet now his heart yeelded, and he began to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his sinne in the naturall colours of it. So the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> saith; <hi>Hee that hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a man-slayer, and you know no man-slayer hath eternall life abiding in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then play thou the part of <hi>Nathan,</hi> and say, <hi>I am the man</hi>; it is this wretched heart of mine that hath hated the Saints of God, and therefore if I be a murtherer, will not my sinne keepe me from the kingdome of heaven as well as another mans? Yes that it will, if pride and stubbornnes be such vile sins in others, then they are so in me, and as there must be a sight of our personall particular sinnes; so,</p>
            <p>Secondly, the soule must be set downe with the audience of truth, and the conscience of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner should be so convicted as to yeeld and give way to that which is knowne, as not seeking any shift or way to oppose that truth which is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, his particular apprehension of sin is like the inditement of a sinner before God, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is that which brings the soule to such a passe, that the heart will not, nay it dares


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21378:18"/>
not, nay (which is more) it cannot escape from the truth revealed: As when a man is only arested and no more, he may escape, therefore it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough particularly to arest the soule, and bring it under command that it cannot shift from the truth revealed: When the Lord comes to make rackes in the hearts of such as he meanes to doe good unto, the text saith, he will <hi>reprove the world of sinne,</hi> that is, he will <hi>convince</hi> the world of <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,</hi> he will set the soule in such a stand, that it shall have nothing to say for it selfe, he cannot shift it off; for there is in every mans heart natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally such corrupt carnall pleading, that it labors to defeat, and put by the worke of the word, that it may not come home to the heart. As a man in battaile array labours to put by the blow that it may not hit his body, so it is with a corrupt heart when the word comes home to the soule, as it doth sometimes into the heart of a drunkard, or an adulterer, or a murtherer, and the word of God seemes to stabbe the heart, they put by the word of God by carnall shifts, and so breake the power of it that it cannot have its full blow upon the soule, and so the word takes no place to any purpose in them.</p>
            <p>Now this kind of knowledge takes away all shifts, that the soule hath nothing to say for it selfe, and pluckes away all defence, that the edge of the word cannot be blunted, but that it will fall flat on the heart, this is that I would put to your consideration punctually; When there is that wisedome and knowledge revealed to the

soule so powerfully, that it prevailes with the heart, and it gives way thereto, so that all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and pleas of the soule be taken away, and the soule falls under the stroke of the word, not quarrelling, but yeelding it selfe, that the word may worke upon it, and withall there is a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse amasement put into the heart of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a kind of dazeling the eye, so that the soule is not content now before it see the worst of his sinne that is revealed, and then it lies under the power of that truth which is made knowne, these two make it plaine; The minister saith, God hates such and such a sinner; and the Lord hates me too, saith the soule, for I am guilty of that sin. Many times when a sinner comes into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and attends unto the ordinary meanes of salvation, if now the Lord be pleased to work mightily, at last the mind is enlightned, and the Minister meets with his corruptions, as though he were in his bosome, and he answereth all his cavills, and takes away all his objections; With that the soule begins to be amased to thinke that God should meet with him in this manner, and saith, If this be so, as it is for ought I know, and if all be true that the Minister saith, then the Lord be mercifull unto my soule, I am the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinner that ever was borne.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to open a passage or two this way; Suppose there be an ignorant creature, that knoweth nothing, and he thinkes God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him because he is so, &amp; he need not consider of this or that which the minister calls upon him

This is right conviction, and though his carnall neighbours come to him, and beginne to cheere him up, and say, The Lord is more merciful then men are, ministers must say something, &amp;c. If the heart be truly convicted, it returnes this answere, and saith; I have thought as you doe, but now I see there is no such matter, these are but figtree-leaves, and will not cover my nakednesse; It is true, Christ came to save sinners, and he came to humble sinners too, he came to bind up the heart, and he came to break the heart too.

            <p>There are two things in the soule;<note place="margin">Why God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth men of their sinnes.</note> First, you conceive and understand a thing. Secondly, you will, and choose it.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first is the inlet of the heart, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can affect the heart, but so farre as reason conceiveth it, and ushers it home to the soule; thereupon the heart, as the King hath his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors which call all matters before them, and consult about businesse, &amp; then they bring them before the King, to have a finall sentence from him, to know what he will have and what he will not have; So the understanding is like the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, and the will is the Queene; the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing saith, this or that is good, then the will saith, let me have it; the understanding saith, these and these duties are required, and the will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth them; the understanding conceives what sinne is, and the will saith, these and these evills have I done, and they will cost me my life if I

repent not: As it was with <hi>Iob,</hi> when his <hi>Oxen</hi> and <hi>Cattell</hi> were taken, it never troubled him, because he never knew it, but when he heard of it by the messengers, he said, <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers wombe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There must be a messenger before he can be grieved for the evill; So it is with the soule of a sinfull creature, the Devill hath made a prey and a spoile of him; thou camest into the world in <hi>Adam,</hi> wise, holy, and gratious; but he hath made thee unholy and ignorant, and thou considerest not this till God by his Ministers opens thy eyes, and makes thee see plainely, that the Image of sinne and Satan is upon thee, and that God is now become thy enemie, and that now thou goest on in the way to destruction, and art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the heire apparant of hell; And when these evill-tydings come to the understanding, that leaves them upon the heart and will of a man, and so lets it worke effectually upon it as God doth blesse the same; as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I know that through ignorance they did it,<note place="margin">Acts. 3.17.</note> if they had knowne the Lord of life they would never have crucified him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the cause why we commit sin, because we see it not, and therefore we sorrow not for it; As it is with some hot Clymates in the world, though there be never so much heat in the sun, yet if there bee no entrance for the heat into the house, it will not scorch nor heat any, so the understanding is like the doore or entrance into the house, and sin is of a fiery &amp; scorching nature, if there be no passage, and if the minde know not,


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21378:21"/>
and if the will affect not sin, it will never scorch his conscience; though a man carry sin enough in his bosome to sinke his soule for ever, yet wee suffer it not to worke upon us, and wee attend not to it, because the brazen wall keepes it off: (as the proverb is) that the eye never sees, the heart never rues. Because we see not our evills, and discern not our sinnes so clearly as we should, therefore it is impossible we should be touched for them as we ought to be.</p>
            <p>The first use is for instruction;<note place="margin">

               </note> from the former truth delivered we may learne that an ignorant heart is a naughty heart, and a miserable wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched heart, whether it be out of ignorance that cannot, or out of wilfulnesse that men will not apprehend their conditions, both are marvelous sinfull and miserable; I desire to deale plainly in this point, because I know there are many that doe flatter themselves in their conditions, and thinke all is well with them; I will say nothing of the cause, but I appeale to the hearts of all that heare me this day, &amp; your selves shall be judges in these particulars; Imagine you did see a poore sinner come before you, and lay open his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bewaile it with bitternesse, saying, that for his owne part he never did find his heart touched for his sinnes, nor sorrow for his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did ever enter into his soule, but he hath lived senselesse and carelesse; &amp; for this woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of spirit he counted it a wonder; for this humblenes of heart it was ever a ridle unto him: let any one passe sentence upon this man now


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21378:22"/>
and tell me seriously what do you thinke of such a person: I heare (me thinkes) every man reason thus, (and every mans heart shakes at it) &amp; saith, Good Lord, what a senselesse poore ignorant creature is this? If no humbling for sinne, no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning for sinne, and no share in Christ, no salvation? What, is this a good heart that is not in the way to receive any good? If a man be never broken for sinne, God will never bind him up, and if never humbled, and burthened for his sinne, God will never ease him of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore woe to that soule that is thus mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and accursed. I beseech you passe this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against your selves, Oh brethren, the hearts of men are past this brokennesse of spirit, nay, they are enemies to it, they never had their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cleared and convicted of their sinnes, and therefore their hearts were neuer broken, and this brokennesse is so farre from their heart as it never came into the head; we thinke not of the foule nature of sinne: Doest thou thinke this to be a good heart that was never humbled &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Christ? alas, it is so farre from being truly wrought upon, that it was never in any way to pertake of mercy from God; therefore thy condition is marvellous miserable; thy misery is as great as thy sinne, if not greater, because when a sinfull creature is wounded and gauled for his sinne, there is some hope he may be cured and helped, but an ignorant soule is not capable of it, he is in hell and seeth it not; he is under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan and thinkes himselfe at liberty, nay


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21378:22"/>
for the present, he is uncapable of any good from the meanes appointed to that end.</p>
            <p>It is with an ignorant soule as it befell the drunkard that was asleepe on the toppe of the mast who feares no harme, because he sees it not. So it is with a sinfull heart, he is resolved to goe on still in his sinne, because he seeth not the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; take a man that hath his heart stabbed with a stilletto and the wound is so narrow that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be searched, there is no meanes to come to it; Just so it is with a blind ignorant heart, there is much meanes whereby good might be done to it, but an ignorant heart barres all out, so that nothing can doe good to the soule. All counsels, admonitions, reproofes cannot prevaile, all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies allure not, because they find no sweetnesse in them; a Minister is as able to teach the stoole whereon he sits as to doe them good. Me thinks it is with a world of men that live in the bosome of the Church, as it is with such as have suffered shipwracke, they are cast upon the waves, and their friends are standing upon the shoare, and see them, and mourne for them, there they see one sinking, and another floating upon the waves even labouring for his life; and they sigh and mourne, but cannot helpe him; Just so it is with ignorant people that are swallowed up with the floods of iniquitie, here is one man going, and there another in the broad way to destruction, &amp; we pitty them, and pray for them, that God would open their eyes, and give them the sight of their sinnes: but alas, they are not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, we must goe to God for knowledge; the Lord knowes our hearts, therefore we must goe to him, that he would make us able to know them too; the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> thought none like her selfe, as it is the fashion of many in this age so to doe; and therefore the Lord said, thou <hi>thoughtst thy selfe rich</hi> and <hi>full,</hi> and that thou <hi>didst want nothing</hi>; It is an argument of a proud sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart that he is alwaies wel conceited of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and of his owne wit, grace, and sufficiency, but marke what the Lord saith to this Church, I counsell thee, to buy of me <hi>eye-salve:</hi> She thought all her compters to be good gold, &amp; all her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances to be good Religion, but the Lord bids her buy of him <hi>eye-salve</hi>; As if he had said, you see not your sinnes, and therefore goe to God, and beseech him that dwels in endles light, to let in some light into your soules.</p>

sees it prepared, and gives direction what is for every one. The words of a faithfull minister are like arrowes, which if they be shot a cocke height they fall down againe and do nothing: but when a man levels at a marke, then, if ever, he wil hit it. So, many ministers can tell a grave faire tale, and speake of sinnes in generall, and these common reproofes, these intimations of sinne, are like arrowes shot a cocke height, they touch no man<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but when a minister makes application of sin in particular, and saith, O all you drunkards and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, this is your portion, and let this be as venome in your hearts to purge out your lusts.

hast thou got of Gods mercy? and what canst thou say for heaven? Then men beginne to looke about them. There was never any convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Ministery nor any man that did in plainnes apply the word home, but their people would be reformed by it, or else their consciences would be troubled and desperately provoked to oppose God and his ordinances, that they may be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by it. The word of God is like a sword, the explanation of the text is like the drawing out of this sword, and the florishing of it: and so long it never hits: But when a man strikes a full blow at a man, it either wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds or puts him to his fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce: so the application of the word is like the striking with the sword, it will worke one way or other, if a man can fence the blow, so it is: I confesse it is beyond our power to awaken the heart, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily this way doth good.</p>

Oh saith he, this is he that seekes my life, he will make my necke cracke; so it is with this soule saving ministery, it is that which brings in a bill of inditement against a man. Now a man can be content to come, and heare though it be never so many sermons; but if a minister comes in for a witnes against him, and begins to arraigne him, and to indite him, for his pride, and malice, and covetousnesse, and to convince him of them, and to lay him flat before the Lord, &amp; his conscience,

Oh then he is not able to beare it. What is the reason of this? He can heare others quietly, and say, oh they are sweet men, they deale kindly and comfortably. Why? The masse bites not; (as the proverbe is) such a kind of ministery workes not at all, and this is the reason why they are not troubled, but goe away so well contented. I have sometime admired at this: why a company of Gentlemen, yeomen, and poore women, that are scarcely able to know their A. B. C. Yet they have a minister to speake Latine, Greeke, and Hebrew, and to use the Fathers, when it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, they know nothing at all. The reason is, because all this stings not, they may sit and sleep in their sinnes, and go to hell hoodwinckt, never awakened, and that is the reason they will well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come such to their houses, and say, oh he is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man, I would give any thing I might live under his ministery. It is just <hi>Ahabs</hi> old humour, he could sute seasonably with <hi>foure hundred false Prophets,</hi> and if there had beene five thousand more, they should all have been accepted of him, but when <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> said, Is there never another <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Lord; Oh yes (saith <hi>Ahab</hi>) <hi>there is one Micaiah, but I hate him, he never spake good to me</hi> that is, he never soothes me up.

And it is certaine, if he could prevaile, no other course should be taken up: if a great man be present, or a patron that we looke for a living from, (if my eares had not heard it, I could not have beleeved it) it is strange to thinke how they daube this over. If their sinnes be so grosse that all the Congregation would cry shame, if he did not reproofe them, what will they say? reprove you we will not, we dare not, but beseech you and desire you as every man hath his infirmitie, a word to the wise is sufficient, &amp;c. I blame my selfe so farre as my base feare possesseth me, but brethren, what will become of preaching in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, if this may take no place in the hearts of people; and yet notwithstanding all this, there is one thing to be considered, if there be but any upright hearted minister, or sincere Christian that is more exact then ordinary, what will the carnall ministers doe, though they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

When a man hath taught men what they should doe, he is but come to the walls of the Castle; the fort is in the heart, the greatest worke of the ministery is to pull downe the wills of men, that know the <hi>truth of God</hi> and <hi>hold</hi> it <hi>in unrighteousnesse</hi>: Nay, they that doe know it, how dull are they in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of these duties God calles for at their hands, so that we had not onely need to mince their meat for them, but even to put it into their mouthes; nay, they sleepe with meat in their mouthes; I appeale to you that are inlightned in the knowledge of the truth, doe you not finde dulnesse of minde, and indisposednesse of spirit in the performances of those duties God calls for at your hands?

For if a man be bidden to a Feast, he is not content only to have the meate set before him, but if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the feast will carve for him, he will take it kindly; Every faithfull minister is the father of the people, and they are his children, they are the Stewards of the Lords house, and give to every one their portion, terrour to whom terrour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and comfort to whom comfort belongs.</p>
            <p>Therefore when you come into the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and see the minister giving and parting to every one his doale; reproofe here, and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there; looke up to heaven and labour to get some thing to thy owne particular, and say as <hi>Esay</hi> did in another case, <hi>something for me,</hi> Lord <hi>something for me,</hi> instruct me, reprove me, make

            <p>You that are at the lower end of the table, thinke with your selves; will the dish never come to the lower end? Oh that the Lord would now guide the minister, to lay his hand on the sore of this cursed infidelitie of minde?

            </p>
            <p>So if thou hast a good heart, thou wilt not goe away repyning and fretting at the word, and say, the minister meant me, &amp; crosseth me; Take heed of this tempter of heart, and if God bee pleased to carve out to any man those particular fruits that concerne his good; goe away and blesse the Lord, &amp; say, <hi>blessed be his good word,</hi> and his poore servant that met this day with my sins, I never observed that pride, I never observed that malice, I never discovered that carelesse<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> what became of Christ I cared not; what became of his ministers I respected not; what became of his name I regarded not; but the Lord hath shewed me my sinnes; and blessed be God for

that good worke which hath beene communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my soule by his servant.</p>
            <p>And observe this, so farre as the heart is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that the minister should meet with his sins,<note place="margin">A naughty heart discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> so farre the heart is naught, Nay, if it be thus, if your consciences testifie against you that you are loath to have your sinnes dealt roundly withall; you thinke the ministers should be mild, and not use such bitter reprehensions, and sharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes: I beseech you thinke of it seriously, you deale with your sinnes in this kind as <hi>David</hi> did with <hi>Absalon</hi>:<note place="margin">2.

            </p>
            <p>Dost thou deale so with thy sinnes? thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest have the minister deal kindly with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and adultery and malice; do not kill drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, but only take him prisoner, keep him in, reforme the outward face of drunkennesse, that we may not be drunken in the open streets, but in a corner, and so that men may not sweare at every turne, but when they come among gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that they doe it cunningly.</p>
            <p>The case is cleare, thy soule if it be of this temper, it never hated sinne, it never sorrowed for sinne, it never found the word of God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it for the subduing of sinne.</p>
            <p>Imagine there were a traytor or rebell come into the towne, that sought to take away the Kings life, nay, suppose he were thy enemy or

No sure, but he loves him, he covers him, he hides him, and would not have him knowne, he is a lover of a traitor, and a traitor himselfe? else why doe you harbour a traitor; you cover him that he cannot come to judgment, and therefore you are a friend unto him: so it is in this case, Canst thou say that thou hatest sinne, thou hatest malice, and covetousnesse, and loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and prophanesse, and in the meane time, thy soule saith, I cannot endure that the minister should discover these, I cannot endure that he should attach them, and arrest my soule for my covetousnesse and adultery and the like? My heart riseth and I would cover it, and hide it, nay I can beare it out sometimes and say, the traytor is not here, I am not the drunkard, I am not the adulterer you talke of; but if the minister will pursue thy soule, then thou shuttest the doore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: If it be thus with thee, I tell thee thou art a friend to the traytor, thou never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedst thy sinne, thou wert never yet brought to a true sight or sorrow for it.</p>
            <p>Wee will now proceed: <hi>When they heard this</hi> saith the text, the word in the originall caryeth a continual act, when they had heard, there was not an end, but the sting of the word did still stick in their hearts. When they walked on the way, <hi>that</hi> sounded in their eares, <hi>I have crucified the Lord of life</hi>; and when they lay downe, <hi>that</hi> came into


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21378:45"/>
their mindes, I have shed the blood of the Lord; and when they arose, this was their first thought, I have consented thereunto and imbrewed my hands therein, this stucke upon the spirits of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, and the sting of the truth would not away, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had heard it, it remained still in their hearts.</p>
            <p>The doctrine is this,<note place="margin">

               </note> that serious meditation of our sinnes by the word of God is a speciall meanes to breake our hearts for our sinnes. <hi>After they had heard,</hi> (this notes a continuall action,) the truth of God still stuck in their stomackes, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of God would not out, the <hi>Apostle</hi> shot some secret shot into their soules, which came home to their hearts and consciences, <hi>when they heard this</hi>: that is, the musing and meditating and pondering of this, when they could hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they could beare no more, but came to the <hi>Apostles and said, what shall we doe</hi>? Sometimes God brings a man into the Church to carpe at the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and to see what he may have against him; now if the Lord sting the conscience of that man, he will heare you all the weeke after, and say, me thinkes I see the man still, he aymed at me, he intended me, and me thinkes, I heare the word still sounding in mine eares; he is alwaies medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on the word in this kind.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
               </label> I answere, meditation is nothing else, but a setled exercise of the mind for the further inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a truth, and so the affection of the heart therewith.</p>
            <p>There are foure things to be considered in it,<note place="margin">What medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, it is an exercise of the mind: it doth not barely close with a truth and apprehend it, and see it, and assent unto it, and there rest, but it lookes on every side of the truth. It is a fine phrase of <hi>Davids,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm. 119.59.</note> 
               <hi>I thought upon my waies, and turned my feet into thy testimonies.</hi> The originall carryeth it, I <hi>looked</hi> upon my waies <hi>on both sides,</hi> it is taken from curious workes which are the same on both sides; they that work the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> must ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> turn them on every side: so it was with the prophet <hi>David,</hi> I turned my waies upside downe, and looked eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way on them.<note place="margin">Dan. 12.4.</note> And so againe, <hi>Many shall runne too and fro and knowledge shall be increased.</hi> Runne too and fro, what is that? It is not the bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the man so much as the busie stirring of the mind from one truth to another; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds one, and gathers another, so that it sees the whole silvage of the truth. I use to compare meditation to perambulation, when men goe the bounds of the parish, they goe over every part of it, and see how farre it goes; so meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21378:47"/>
is the perambulation of the soule; when the soule lookes how far sinne goeth, and considers the punishment of it, and the plagues that are threatned against it, and the vilenesse in it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is setled exercise of the minde, it is not a sudden flash of a mans conceit upon the sudden; But it dwels and staies upon a truth, it setles againe and againe, that it hath bestowed it selfe upon; When a man is deepe in meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a thing, he neither seeth nor heareth any other thing, else the streame of the heart is set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the truth conceived.</p>
            <p>A man that hath beene offered an injury by another, when he eares and walkes, still he thinkes of his injury; his heart is setled on it: So your hearts ought to be on the truth. The <hi>Apostle</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> saith,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.14.</note> 
               <hi>Continue in the things thou hast learned</hi>; the word in the originall is, Be in them; that is, let a mans mind be moulded into the truth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is a setled exercise for two ends; first, to make a further inquiry of the truth: and secondly, to make the heart affected therewith<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for this is the nature of meditation, not to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it selfe upon a thing knowne; but it would either know more in those truthes that are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to it, or else labours to gather something from them; It is with the truth, as it is with a man which goeth into the house, and puls the latch, when he was without, he might see the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the house, but he could not see the roomes within, unlesse he drawes the latch, and comes in,


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21378:47"/>
and goe about the house: meditation puls the latch of the truth, and sees, this is my sinne, this is the cause, here is the misery, this is the plague: and thus meditation searcheth into every corner of the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Lastly, meditation labours to affect the heart, not only to know a thing, but to bring it home to the soule,<note place="margin">Iob. 5. last</note> 
               <hi>these things are so, know it for thy good</hi>; So when a man hath viewed all and considered all, then meditation brings all to the heart, and labours to affect the heart therewith; this is that which brings sorrow and compunction for sinne, a setled exercise of the heart that meditates on sinnes, that makes inquiry after them: and the grounds are two,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ground</hi> 1.</note> and very remarkeable they are.</p>
            <p>The first is this, meditation makes all a mans sinnes, and any truth belonging thereunto more powerfully and plainly to be brought home unto the heart. It is the action of the understanding when a man doth gather all reasons, and musters up force of arguments, and labours to presse the soule, and lay them heavy upon the heart, and bring it under the power of the truth. It is with meditation as it is with usurers that will grate upon men, and grinde the faces of the poore; and sucke the blood of the needy, they will exact upon men and take use upon use, they will not be contented to take the principall, but they will have consideration for all the time, until they have sucked the blood of a poore man that is under such a muckworme; A poore man could be content to pay the principall, but to exact use


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21378:48"/>
upon use, this killes him; So doth meditation, it exacts and slayeth the soule of a poore sinner, you have committed adultery in a corner, but you shall not so carry it away. This you did against the knowledge of God revealed, against many mercies received, against many Judgements threatned, against checks of conscience, against many vowes and promises remembred: and Item for this, and Item for that; and thus meditation oppresseth the soule: But then the soule will say, happily it is but a trick of youth, or it is my infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: No, no, saith meditation, this hath been your course from time to time continually, that hath beene your haunt, it hath beene a riveted corruption that hath fastened upon your bones, and will goe to your graves with you, and it will bring you to hell. But then the soule saith, I will repent; No, no, saith meditation, your heart is hardened in this sinne, you have a heart that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repent nor yeeld, the word of God workes not, it prevaileth not, the minister hath flung hell fire in your face, and told you, that no drunkard, nor adulterer shall goe to heaven, and yet you goe away no more moved then the seat whereupon you sate, you have continued in sin, and are hardened in sinne. Thus marke how me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation exacts use upon use: But then the soule replies, I will goe to the word, and wait upon the meanes, and it may be the word will provaile. No, saith meditation, you have despised the word, and God will take away his word from you, or you from his word, or his blessing from


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21378:48"/>
both. What, is it a matter of infirmity? No, it is your continuall course. And you repent; No you cannot, you cannot, you are hardened. And you hope the word will worke upon you; No, no, it is cursed unto you. Thus meditation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts use upon use, until the blood of the soule be sucked up. Meditation breakes the soule, and layeth waight upon the soule, in this case. It is a passage remarkable of <hi>Peter,</hi> the text saith, when our Saviour told <hi>Peter,</hi> that before the cock crew twice, he should deny him thrice; in the last verse of the chapter, the second time <hi>the cocke crew, &amp; Peter remembred the words of our Saviour,</hi> &amp; when he thought therupon, <hi>he went out and wept bitterly:</hi> the word in the originall is this, the holy man catcht all together, and heaped all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances together, and reasoned thus; the cocke crowes, now I remember the words of Christ: oh what a wretch am I, that should deny such a master that called me; such a master as found me, such a master as was mercifull unto me? when I never saw my selfe, nor my sinnes, he pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me out from my sinnes: It is that master I have denyed, he came to doe me good, &amp; to save me, and I have denyed him: Nay, even at a dead lift, if ever I should have defended him, I should have defended him now, if ever stood for him, I should have stood for him now, but to deny my master, and forsweare him, that I should do it, an Apostle beloved, an Apostle thus honored, that I should doe it, when I professed the contrary, what, such a master denied by me such an Apostle


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21378:49"/>
at such a time, before such persons, and forced to it by such a silly maiden. All these sinfull circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, the manner of them, the nature of them, the haynousnesse of them, the holy Apostle laid all these to his heart, and his heart sunck under these circumstances thus gathered together, and <hi>he went out and wept bitterly.</hi> Looke as it is in war, were there many scores that came against an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they might be conquered, or many hundreds might be resisted; but if many thousands should come against a small army, it would be in danger to be overcome. Meditation leadeth as it were an army of arguments, an army of curses, and miseries, and judgements, against the soule, how ever one misery or plague will not downe, but a man may brooke it, and goe away with it, yet meditation brings an army of arguments, and tells the soule, God is against thee wherever thou art, &amp; what ever thou dost. And then the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to cry out as <hi>Elisha's</hi> servant did, <hi>Master what shall I doe?</hi> what, so many sinnes, and so haynous, and so many judgements denounced, and shall fall upon me for them. Lord, how shall I doe? how shall I be delivered from these, &amp; pardoned for these: thus meditation brings home sin more powerfully to the heart.</p>
            <p>The second argument is this: as meditation brings in all bills of account, so secondly, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation fastens sinne upon the consciences of those to whom the word of God is spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, more stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in so much that the soule cannot make escape from the truth of God delivered, and from the


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21378:49"/>
judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God denounced against him: Some<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times when men heare the word and threatnings denounced, then their hrarts are touched, and they goe away resolved not to commit sinne as they have done: But when they are gone, it workes not, but the heart recoyles againe, and goeth to his owne course againe. The reason is, because you meditate not on the word.</p>
            <p>It is with the word as with a Slave, if a man have never so good a salve, which will helpe a soare in foure and twentie houres, if a man shall doe nothing but lay this salve to the wound, and take it off, it would never heale the wound, and no wonder: Why? he will not let it lie on; the best salve under heaven will not heale a sore, and eate out a corruption, unlesse it be bound on, and let lie: So it is with the good word of God: many a soule heareth the word of God, and his heart is touched for his sinne, and his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence beginnes to be awakened, but when he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the Church, all is gone, his affections die, and his heart dies, and his conscience is not touched: no wonder, you will not hold the word to your soules, you heare sinne, and not heare it: you wil see sinne, and not apprehend it; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that the word over-powers not your corruptions: Do you thinke the salve will work when you keepe it not on? The word of God is the salve, conviction of Conscience is like the binding on of the salve, meditations like the binding of it to the sore, remember the truth which touched thee first, and keep that on, let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21378:50"/>
take it away from thy minde, hold that good word close to the soule; and it will keepe thy heart in the very same temper, after the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thereof; as it was in the delivery. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Iames</hi> compares, a slight hearer to a man that lookes his face in a glasse slightly,<note place="margin">Iames 1 2.3.</note> that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets himselfe what visage he had; but saith, Who so looketh unto the law of liberty, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therein, he being not a forgetfull hearer, but a doer of the word, this man shall be blessed in his deeds: the Law of liberty is the Law of God; and this Law being a glasse; You must not onely heare, and be gone, and slight and neglect it, but you must continue in looking, and then you shall see the complexion of your sinnes, and the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your corruptions: when the drunkard heareth the basenesse of his sinnes, and the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer the basenes of his abominations, they looke themselves slightly in the glasse of the Law; But they must carry away the glasse with them, and looke themselves still, &amp; the adulterer must say, I am a prophane creature, and my heart is pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Conscience defiled, and this soule hardned, and I shal be damned; if a man should thus looke, and view his sinnes, and carry away the glasse with him continually, he would see his life so ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his heart so base, that he could not be able to beare it; If the pills be never so bitter, yet if a man swallow them suddenly, there is no great distast, but if a man chaw a pill, it wil make a man deadly sicke, because it is against the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, so our sinnes are like these pills, they

goe downe somewhat pleasantly; because we swallow downe our oathes &amp; prophannes, &amp; our malice, and contempt of God and his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and we make it nothing to mocke at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of God, and the professors of it: you swallow downe pills now, but God will make you chaw those pills one day, and then they will be bitter; Though the swearer swallowes down his oathes now, yet at last the Lord will make him remember, that he will not hold him guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, but araigne him at the day of judgement: and make him cry guilty at the barre, and againe will make you chaw over your malice: you hated the Lords word, and the workes of his Spirit: and this will condemne you.</p>
            <p>Againe, meditation doth beset the heart of a man, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not escape; wheresoever he is, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation brings those things to his minde, &amp; the plagues due thereunto; so that he cannot escape the dint therof. It is the nature of our own hearts that we are loath to read our owne destiny, which will be our bane and confusion: medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion calls over the thoughts of a man, tells him the reasons are good, the arguments found, the Scripture plaine, thy sinnes evident: Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you know it, therefore heart you must doe it, (saith meditation) take heed of drunkennesse, saith meditation, you heard what the minister said; these sinnes are against God, and the wrath of God is gone out against you for these sinnes, these will be your bane, and will bring you to everlasting destruction. And when meditation


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21378:51"/>
doth thus yawle at the heart, the minde still mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and the heart still pondering of sin, at last it is weary, therefore unburdened therewith, the issue of the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts is this, if meditation brings in sin more powerful, more plainely to the soule; if it be that, which binds and fastneth it, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it upon the soule; then the point is cleare, that serious meditation of sinne is a special meanes to bring a soule to the sight and sorrow for sinne.</p>
            <p>The uses are three: the third is the maine: we will presse on unto it. If it be so, that meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thus powerfull and profitable, both for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the heart, and to bring in consolation to the heart, then what shall we thinke of those men that are unwilling to practice this dutie? nay, what shall we thinke of that untowardnesse of heart which is in us against the command of this duty? It is a word of reproofe against this practice, and it falls marvelous heavy upon us all more or lesse in this kinde: for we are marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous guiltie in this kinde, that we are tardy in this duty: a man had as good bring a Beare to the stake, as a carnall heart to the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his owne wayes, much more loath is he to ponder seriously and meditate continually upon his sinnes; no, men are so farre from musing of their sinnes, that they disdaine this practice, and scoffe at it: what say they, if all were of your minde, what should become of us? shall we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be poring on our corruptions? so we may hap to runne mad, if we were of your opinion: thus we slight and put it off, and trample on this


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21378:51"/>
duty, which is so profitable: the poore will not meditate on his sinnes, he hath no time: the rich they need it not: the wicked dare not: and so no man will in this case. What, shall a man set his soule on a continuall racke? (say they) shall a man drive himselfe to a desperate stand, and trouble himselfe unprofitably? cannot men keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when they are well? this is the course and frame of the world, and wee may complaine of this carelesse and heedlesse age, as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> did of his time, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.6. <hi>No man repenteth him of his wickednesse, saying, What have I done?</hi> there is no questioning, nor searching, no musing: no man saith, <hi>What have I done?</hi> no man saith, these are my sinnes, these are my wayes: no man lookes over his course and conversation, he doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his sinne; and that is the reason we heare of no humbling, of no repenting: but every man runneth into sinne as the horse rusheth into the battell, hence it is, that there are so ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>y uncleane beasts in the Arke. In the old Law, if there were any beasts that chewed not the cud, he was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted uncleane, the chewing of the cud is serious meditation of the mercies of God to comfort us, and of our sinnes, to humble us: there are many ungodly persons in the bosome of the Church; that muse not of their sinfull wayes, the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> saith;<note place="margin">Ier. 8.12.</note> 
               <hi>Were they ashamed when they had committed abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s?</hi> nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush, he adds a reason in the eleventh verse. <hi>They could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed</hi>: why? because they cry, <hi>peace, peace,</hi> let the


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21378:52"/>
minister speake what he can, and denounce what judgement he will, they promise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selves peace, &amp; quietnes, they consider not their wayes, and therefore their hearts are not distempered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, nor troubled at the consideration thereof, nay, there are many that count it an excellencie, a cunning skill, if they can drive away and shake off the sight of sinne, if they can put off the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any thing the word reveales, they make it a marvelous excellent piece of skill, and what they doe themselves they would have others doe also: but they that now will not see, nor consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor meditate of their sinnes, the truth is, they shall see them as the Lord saith by <hi>Esay.</hi> 26.11. <hi>When thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see and be ashamed:</hi> So I say, you that will not see your sins, but say, What needs all this stirre, let the minister say what hee will, shall we be mad men, to be troubled, and shall we be fooles, to be disquieted with the consideration of our sinnes? well, you will not muse upon your sinnes now, but the time will come, that the Lord will set all your sinnes in order before you, and you shall not be able to looke off them.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that when a man hath lived wickedly all his dayes, and comes to lye on his death bed, then all his sinnes come to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and then conscience flies in his face, and sayes, here is a cup for a drunkard and for an adulterer: now he seeth nothing but sinne; and hell, and damnation, due to him for his sinne, and then he cries out he is damned. You might have


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21378:52"/>
seene something before then, if you had seene them to be humbled for them, you should never have seene them to be damned for them. If there be but any occasion of basenesse offered to the view of the drunkard, which way doth he not use to compasse his carnall delights? and shall the drunkard and prophane wretch be so eager in lingering after sinne, that he may commit it, and be damned for it, and shall not a man so labour to see his iniquities, that he may be humbled for them before God, and receive mercy from God in the pardon of the same? Shall the reprobate hale judgements on their soules, and bend all their meditations that way, and shall not they that desire to see God in glory, doe the same?</p>
            <p>The Second use is for instruction: from the former doctrine delivered, we may collect, that loose, vaine, joviall company is the greatest hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> for Christ, and the greatest obstacle to the worke of grace that can be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: this is not forced, but followeth clearly from the former truth, in this manner: thus I reason.</p>
            <p>That course which takes away the minde from musing, and the understanding from medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his evill way, that course is the greatest hindrance why the heart is not humbled, and fitted for the Lord, for meditation brings in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and that prepares the heart for Christ: but your joviall company and ryoting persons, there is nothing under heaven that takes off the minde more from musing, and the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from waighing a mans evill throughly,


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21378:53"/>
therefore this must needs be a marvelous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, and hinderance to those that indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to walke uprightly before God in any measure, <hi>Amos.</hi> 6.5. There are rules of their revaldry set downe, they thrust and put away the day of the Lord farre from them: that is the first law they make, the first statute they enact, thinke not of sinne now, and meditate not of judgement now, but come (say they) cast care away, fling away and casheer those melancholly imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: we have many failings, let us not therefore be pondering of them, and make our selves so much the more miserable, this day shall be as yesterday, and to morrow as to day, no sorrow nor judgement, no sinne now considered. And this is remarkable, and if a poore soule in that drunken distemper should be smitten by the hand of God, and should suggest these words to his drunken companions; We are all here mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Jolly, and let out our hearts in delight, but for all this, God will bring us to judgement, the eyes of God seeth our now drinking and beze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the eare of God heareth our blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and swearing; and for these we shall one day be plagued: why? this should spoyle all the sport and jollity, they could not be able to beare him, but they would prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly fling him out of doores: this is that which baneth many a soule, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take notice of it, if any of you have had a sight of sin, marke if a drunkard go aside &amp; hang the winge a little, marke what men doe, if they can but once get him into their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pany, &amp; make


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21378:53"/>
him shake off those dumps, and runne on in his former course, then this hinders him from medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on his sinnes, and from being prepared for Christ, and hence it is, that many a poore soule that hath had the fire kindled, the terrour that the Lord hath let into his soule, would have hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his proud stomacke, &amp; melted his stubborne heart; but partly drunkennesse on the one side, and merriness on another, tooke away all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement whereby the soule might have beene wrought upon, and he have received everlasting salvation: Therfore thinke of it. It was the course the Scripture observed in the lamenting Church <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.12. The house of <hi>David</hi> apart, and their wives apart, the house of <hi>Nathan</hi> apart, and their wives apart: There is no casting up of account in a crowd; but if a man will cast up his account, if he will see his sins, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sider his base practices, he must go aside by himselfe, loose occasions and vaine occasions withdraw the minde, and plucke off the soule from seeing the evill, and affecting the heart with it. Therefore the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> a little beyond my text, when he saw the Jewes were affected with that he had delivered, and that their hearts were touched, when they asked him what they should doe, he saith, <hi>save your selves from this untoward generation,</hi> God hath now touched your hearts, suffer not Satan by these wicked Instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts of his, to steale the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of God out of your harts; for your drunken companions are like nothing else, but those rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous foules spoken of by Christ, that deuoured


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21378:54"/>
the seed that fell by the way side, the foule is the Devill, the seed is the word of God, now the Devill doth not plucke this out of the soule him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe alone; but often by cursed companions: the ale-house is the bush, that harbours those rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous beasts, and drunken companions are those: The Devill useth to pluck out this good seed out of the heart: &amp; therefore as you love your soules, suffer not your selves to be drawne away by these cursed wretches, do not suffer them to steale the worke of Gods spirit away which he hath wrought in your hearts: this I observe to checke that cursed practice of men, who when a man is troubled, send him to play at cards, or dice, or the like, which is the greatest meanes to hinder the worke of God in their hearts.</p>

               </note>Thirdly, seeing meditation brings marvelous comfort and profit to our soules, then what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines? if I were silent, the word it selfe would speake, and the profit of the duty would speake, and bring your hearts to addresse your soules to this: you are therefore to be exhorted, since you see what it is that God requires, that with speed, you set upon it, and that with care and conscience you labour to persevere in the performance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I beseech you thinke of it, what is more usuall in the world then this, that men should make sleight and little account of their sinnes? nay, to goe boult upright under those execrable abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations wherfore they stand guilty before God. Looke as it was with <hi>Sampson</hi> he went away with the gates of <hi>Gaza</hi> and made nothing of them: so


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21378:54"/>
there are many, that carrie the gates of hell upon their backes, as drunkennesse &amp; adultery, and yet they feare not, nor are affrighted thereat, nay; Gods owne servants, that desire to looke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Zion.</hi> Is not this your complaint many times? I cannot finde sinne heavy, I confesse the word discovers it, and reveales it, but I cannot be troubled for it, I cannot finde my soule burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it: sinne is not heavy unto me, but I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it away easily, and make no bones of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though proud, and leud, and carelesse, and untoward, yet my hart is not apprehensive of the weight of it: Let me speake unto you: Are you not therfore here hindred in the way God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of you, because you weigh not &amp; ponder not those evill wayes you sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d guiltie of before God, but you are better content to see them and slight the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, then to remember them &amp; lay them aside: I beseech you to take notice of it. Looke as it is with men in the world, if five hundred pound weight bee laid on the ground, if a man never plucke at it, he shall not feele the weight of it; your sinnes are not many hundreds, but many thousand weights, the least vaine thought you ever imagined, the least idle word that ever you uttered, are weight enough to presse your soules downe into everlasting perdition, and therefore so many sinnes, so great, and so constantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against so much knowledge, against so many comforts, and incouragements, against so many vowes and protestations, are much more heavy, and yet you see them nor: the reason is, you


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21378:55"/>
see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> not, you weigh not pride, you weigh not malice, you weigh not dead heartednesse; if you would weigh them seriously, and consider of them thoroughly, you would find that they were heavier then the sand on the sea shore; but you will say, how should we come to meditate on our sinnes, that we may be comforted? for this is the onely way: But what course shall we take? that we may be burdened? here lies the skill.</p>
            <p>Now for the opening of the point, I will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover three things: First the ground on which our meditation must be raised: Secondly, the maner how to follow it home to the heart. Thirdly, how to put life and power, to it that it may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, and worke that end in our soules which we would have it.</p>
            <p>First, concerning the former, we must consider the grounds whereupon meditation must be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and them I referre to these foure heads. First, labour to see the mercy, goodnesse, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God, that have beene abused and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by that unkinde dealing of ours, and that marvelous carelesnesse, those duties, God hath required of us, the height of Gods goodnesse to us lays out the height of all our iniquities co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: The greater the kindnesse and mercy of God is, the greater are our sinnes, that esteeme not of this mercy, but abuse it, and despise it; This adds to our rebellions, this makes our sinnes out of measure sinfull, because God hath beene out of measure mercifull.</p>
            <p>There are many sinnes in one, when a man sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21378:55"/>
against many mercies, and walkes not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of them,<note place="margin">Iudg. 1.12.</note> we may observe, that this is the course that God takes to breake the hearts of the Israelites, when they had neglected his wayes, and broken his commandements: what was his message, when the Lord humbled the people and brake them kindly? The Lord by the Angell thus speakes, I made you to goe out of Aegypt and brought you to the land which I sware to your fathers, and I said, I would never breake my covenant with you, and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of the land, But ye have not obeyed my voice; why have you done this worke?</p>
            <p>Now the Lord presseth this his kindnesse upon them, and labours to melt their hearts in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of his goodnesse to them, and their unthankefulnesse to him; in the eight verse, the text saith. When they heard this, the people lift up their voice, and wept. The consideration of Gods kindnesse to them, and their unkindnes to God.</p>
            <p>He did all for them, and they did all against him, the Lord was gratious to them, for their comfort, but they did not walke worthy of it: Why have you done this saith the Lord? Why was my mercy despised? Why was my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse slighted? Why was my patience and long suffering abused? When they heard this, they wept in the consideration of their unnaturall dealing: Nay, this is the thing remarkeable in <hi>Moses,</hi> he stabs the heart, and workes effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21378:56"/>
upon the Israelites by this meanes? <hi>Doe you thus requite the Lord O foolish people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32.6.</note> 
               <hi>and unwise? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? Hath not he made thee, and established thee?</hi> and will you thus reward the Lord? Thus carelesly, and thus proud, and disobedient? Why, <hi>Remember,</hi> saith he, <hi>the dayes of old,</hi> and then he reckons upon Gods gratious dealing with them.</p>
            <p>I applie this in particular: there is never a soule here present, there is never a man in the basest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and lowest condition, but hath had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods goodnesse, and mavelous loving kindnesse this way. Were you ever in want, but God supplied you? were you ever in weakenesse, but God strengthened you? in sicknesse, who cured you? in misery, who succoured you? in povertie who relieved you? hath not God been a gratious God unto you? every poore soule can say, never a poore sinner hath had a more grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God then my soule, all my bones can say, Lord who is like unto thee? this heart hath been heavy and thou hast cheared it, this soule hath beene heavy and thou hast relieved it, many troubles have befallen me and thou hast given a gratious issue out of them all.</p>
            <p>And shall I thus reward the Lord? shall I sin against his goodnesse and this kindnesse? Then what shall I say, heare O heaven, and harken O earth, the Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Asse his masters crib, and Israel knoweth not Gods kindnesse, nor acknowledgeth his goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, the consideration hereof one would


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21378:56"/>
thinke should break the hardest heart under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: if men be but ingenious men, if they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any great kindnes from a friend, they were never in want but he relieved them, he tooke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> into his house, and they might freely goe to his purse or any thing he had. If a man should deale thus kindly with another, and this man should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him an ordinary favour, he will be ashamed to come into his presence, he will say his house was mine, and his purse was mine, and to deale thus unkindly, nature would have taught me other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: what are your hearts to God that hath been gratious to us all, he hath created us, &amp; doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and keepe and afford many blessings unto us; he gives us our houses that cover us: it is God that affords us all this, and shall we sinne against such mercy? therefore goe to the beasts of the field, and they will tell you, and to the birds of the ayre, and they will discover unto you Gods mercy: goe to your beds and tables; who gives these, and continues these? doth not the Lord? &amp; yet sinne against this God? O foolish people and unwise, all love on Gods part, and all negligence on ours? God exceeds in goodnesse towards us, &amp; we doe exceed in unkindnesse, and unthankfulnes towards him; this is the first ground upon which meditation must be raised.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second ground, secondly if it be so that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will not prevaile with you, if you have no good nature in you, then secondly, consider that this is a just God, that hath beene provoked by your sinnes, if mercy cannot prevaile with you,


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21378:57"/>
you shall have Iustice enough, and that without mercy; you must not thinke to slight Gods mercy, and carry it away in that fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.

            <p>God sent <hi>Pharoah</hi> into the red sea, and for ought we know, his soule may now be roaring in hell; this is certaine, that whosoever resisteth him shall find him a swift Judge to condemne him.

So many sins against God himself, in the first commandement, against his worship, in the second, against his name, in the third, against his Sabbath in the fourth commandement; nay, all our thoughts, words, and actions, all of them have beene sinnes able to sinke our soules to the bottome of hell: bundle up your sinnes, &amp; lay one upon the heart and another upon the conscience, and then it will breake your backes; those small infirmities you make nothing of, &amp; those sinnes you make slight of, and make a tricke of youth, if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow

your minds a little seriously, you will see them to be farre otherwise: every sinne deserves death, <hi>The wages of sinne is death,</hi> not he onely that murthers his neighbour, and takes away his life, but the malitious man, and the proud man deserves death. Nay, to come nearer the text, what if I prove you had a hand in the shedding of the blood of Christ; dwell here a little and consider it, and you shall see the point cleare. If there be any soule here present that hopes to have any part in Christ, as if I should goe from man to man and aske, have you a part in Christ? you will say, aye surely I hope so; marke what I say the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, if thou hopest for any mercy from Christ, then Christ was thy surety and bare thy sinnes, and those sinnes of thine were the witnesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Saviour, they were the souldiers that tooke him, the thornes that pierced him, the speare that gored him, the Crosse that tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life: The truth is, the souldiers, and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> could have done nothing to our Saviour but for thy sinnes: had it not beene for thy sinnes, had it not beene for the sinnes of the elect, the souldiers could not have apprehended him, the <hi>Pharisees</hi> could not have witnessed against him, there could have been no Judge to condemne him; very well then, thy sins caused all this, thy wicked thoughts and wicked actions caused our Saviour to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> He sunke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the consideration of thy sinnes, and thou goest away and makest a tricke of youth of them,


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21378:58"/>
and a matter of merryment, of loose talke, and wicked doings; well, you had a part in the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of Christ. When you are gone, think of this, and as you are going home, thinke with your selves, It was my sinnes that had a part in the shedding of the blood of Christ; and when you are at meate let that come into your mind, I have had a hand in the crucifying of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; and when you goe to bed thinke of it, I am one of those that have embrewed their hands in the blood of the Lord Jesus, that Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our that is now at the right hand of God, that hath done so much for his servants, that sweat drops of blood, those sweates and drops were for thy sinnes, and is this a matter of merryment and a tricke of youth in the meane time? No, no, thy soule will finde it otherwise one day, unlesse the Lord remove those sinnes of thine, those sins will make thee howle in hell fire one day, unlesse you be burthened with them here: thinke of this, I am one of those that by vaine thoughts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane actions have crucifyed the Lord of life; and if you can make those sinnes a matter of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment I wonder at it.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth Ground ariseth from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the punishment of sinne, you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what sinne will cost you; namely, those endlesse torments that cannot be conceived nor prevented, and I will leave here to speake of the paines of the wicked, (I should have said much thereof) and come to speake only a little of the last Judgement. Me thinkes I see the Lord of


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21378:59"/>
heaven and earth, and the attributes of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing before him: the Mercy of God, the Goodnesse of God, the Wisedome of God, the Power of God, the Patience and longsuffering of God, and they come all to a sinner, a wicked hypocrite, or a carnall professor, and say, Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath kept you, Patience hath borne with you, Longsufferance hath endured you, Mercy hath relieved you, the Goodnesse of the Lord hath beene great unto you; All these comfortable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes will bid you adue, and say, farewell dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned soule, you must goe hence to hell, to have fellowship with damned ghosts. Mercy shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be enlarged towards you any more, you shal never have Patience any more to beare with you, never Goodnesse more to succour you, never compassion more to relieve you, never power more to strengthen you. Nay, you that have heretofore withdrawne your selves from Gods wisedome and gospell, you shall never have wisedome more to guide you, never Gospell more to comfort you, never Mercy more to cheare you, you shall then goe into endlesse and easelesse torments, which can never be ended, where you shall never be refreshed, never eased, never comforted; and then you shall remember your sinnes. My covetousnesse and pride was the cause of this, I may thanke my sinnes for this. Thinke of these things (I beseech you,) seriously, and see, if sinne be good now, see, if you can take any sweetnesse in it: I end all with that of <hi>Iob, O that my griefe were well weighed, and my calamity


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21378:59"/>
laid in the ballance: for now they would be heavier then the sand of the sea.</hi> So say I, oh that our sins were weighed, and our iniquities weighed in the ballance together, such mercy have we despised, such Justice we have provoked, such a Lord of life have we crucifyed, such torments have we deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, endlesse, easelesse, and remedilesse: if these were weighed, they would be heavyer then the sand, and sincke our soules under the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
            <p>But then you will say, happyly I can thinke of these things, and consider of them. The mind happyly hath conceived and fadomed these truths and brought in these occasions, and yet for all this, the mind stirres not, the heart workes not, I say therefore, when your meditation is thus rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, you must have this skill to follow home the blow, and make it worke kindly on the heart; and that is done by these three things. When your meditation is up, there is another thing which is the following of it home to the soule, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in these three particulars.</p>
            <p>The first is this, when we have conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of sinne, and the nature thereof, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment due thereunto, then doe not rest in the bare consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of these things, but never leave the heart, be still musing of these things, and bring these blessed truthes home to the soule, &amp; binde these things on the wil and affections; hold them and fasten them there, force them upon the soule, that the heart may not make an escape: take notice of it, it is a rule I would have you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21378:60"/>
of, never leave meditating til you finde your heart so affected with the evill, as your mind &amp; judgement conceived of the evill before; namely, let the heart feele that evill it conceived, let the soule feel that gall to be in sin which the mind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to be in it: you see these sinnes loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and abominable, make the heart feel them, and be affected with them; the heart will fly off now, therefore it is the cunning of a Christian to lay at the heart, and pursue it continually, and hold these truthes to the soule, and at last it may be under the dint of the blow, and the power of God makes the soule feele and finde, and be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of the gall, and bitternes, and vilenes of the evill, as before it conceived it so to be; It is not enough for a man to exercise himselfe in the meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of sin, but a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> must bring his soule in subjection under the power of that meditation, a man must not only chew his meat, but he must swallow it also, if he meane to have it nourish him: meditation is when the heart swalloweth downe these sinnes, that is, when he labours so to be affected with sinne, and the nature of it, as it doth require. Meditation in this case is like the beleaguring of a Citie, when a Citie is wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; strongly beleagured, and beset rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d about, they doe two things: first, they batter it from without as much as they can; and secondly; they cut off all provision and reliefe from comming in, and so the city being partly battered from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as much as they can, and being hindred from all reliefe comming in, in conclusion when they


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21378:60"/>
see the enemie is strong, and no provision can come to them, they are conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t to yeeld the City, and render up themselves; and if they send a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him that doth besiege it, and say, they are ready to perish, why, he bids them deliver then, and they shall be provided for, he bids them yeeld, and they shall be succoured, and before that day, there is no supply shall be brought into the City: So it is with meditation, and here is the cunning of a Christian. Do as wise Souldiers doe, cut off all provision, that is, by serious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation bring thy heart to such a loathing of sinne, that it may never love it more, besiege the heart with daily meditation, that so you may cut off any ease and refreshing that the heart may seeme to have in any sinfull course; if the soule be looking after any sinne, if the soule would goe out a litle to occasions, and take delight in his corruptions, the drunkard in his company, and the wordly man in his wealth, then batter that: When you are thus affected, beleaguer the way, that you may finde no comfort; no ease, and when the soule is looking after occasions, and lingering after his abominations, then say to your hearts, you will have your sins though you have your shame with them, you will have your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, though you have your confusion with them: when the soule would meddle with these, let meditation knocke off these. If you be still proud, and malitious, and quarrelling, take heed; you cannot have these, but you must have hell and all; you cannot have these, but you must have


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21378:61"/>
destruction and all: the mercy of God will be not abused; and the justice of God will not be provoked, and God will be revenged of you, and at last the heart by this meanes will be troubled: Why, deliver up your sins then, and your soules, if your hearts find any sorrow and anguish; why, then yeeld up your souls unto Christ, that you may finde as much comfort in a good way, as you have done misery in an evill way. Thus by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation make the heart see those evills; nay, thus by meditation make thy heart see those evills, and the punishment that shall be executed for those evills.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when you have made the heart thus affected with sinne, then take heed that the heart doth not flie off and shake off the yoke. Imagine meditation brings all those sins, and miseries, and vilenesse, all are brought home to the heart, and the soule is made sensible by this meanes: Hold the heart there then, labour to keepe the heart in the same temper, that it is brought into, by the consideration of sinne, for this is our nature, when the strooke is troublesome that lieth upon us, and the sinnes are hainous that lie upon us, and are committed by us, these sinnes, these sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, these judgements, when the heart feeles this, it is weary, and would secretly have the wound healed quickly, and the sorrow removed, and the trouble calmed: Take heede of this, and labour to maintaine that heat of heart, which you finde in your selves by vertue of meditation, this is the pitch of the point: as there must bee


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21378:61"/>
subjection unto meditation, the heart must be so affected with sinne, as it conceived it to be, so there must be attention; that is, the soule must hold it selfe to that frame and disposition so wrought as it should be. Looke as it is with a Gold smith that melteth the metall that he is to make a vessell of, if after the melting thereof, there follow a cooling, it had beene as good it had never beene melted, it is as hard, haply harder, as unfit, haply unfitter, then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make vessell of; but after he hath melted it, he must keep it in that frame till he come to the moulding and fashoning of it: So meditation is like fire, the heart is like a vessell, the heart is made for God, and it may be made a vessell of grace here, and of glory hereafter: Now medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is that melts the soule, the drosse must be taken away from the soule, and sinne must bee loosened from the heart: Now meditation doth this, it melts the soule, and affects the soule with the weight of sinne: now when you have your heart in some measure melted, keepe it there, doe not let it grow loose againe, and carelesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; for then you had as good never have beene melted: And that is the reason why many a poore sinner that hath sometime beene in a good way, and the Lord hath come kindly and wrought powerfully on the heart, and yet at last it hath grown cold &amp; dumpish, &amp; as hard as ever he was againe, and the worke is to beginne againe. And take notice of it; looke as it is with the cure of the body, if a man have an old wound, and a


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21378:62"/>
deepe one; two things are observable; it is not enough to launce the wound, and draw out the corruptions, but it must be tented also, for if the wound be deepe, it must not be healed presently, but it must be kept open with a tent, that it may be healed soundly, and thoroughly: so it is here; meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> it is set on, doth launce the soule, it launceth the heart of a man, and it will goe downe to the bottome of the belly: When a man seeth his sinne, and weigheth his sinne it will goe downe to the bottom sometime, and when your heart is thus affected, do not heale it too soone, but hold the soule in that blessed frame &amp; dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: For as meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> doth launce the soule, so attention doth tent the soule; keepe the soule therfore so troublesome and sorrowfull that so you may be healed soundly, thorowly, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably.</p>
            <p>I use to finde this by experience, a City that is be leaguerd and wonne, he that hath won it, sets a Garison over it, that he may keepe it for ever under: So when the soule hath beene wonne by the stroke of meditation affecting the heart with sinne, then set a garison over the soule, and keepe it in awe, set a garison over the Conscience and keepe all downe, keepe all under, that it may submit it selfe, and that kindly under the stroke of the truth, for it were a blessed frame, if we could alwayes be so in that temper that we are in when we are first humbled for our sinnes.</p>
            <p>The third rule, which is marvelous usefull is this: when the soule hath beene affected with


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21378:62"/>
sinne by meditation, and kept to sinne by atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then know how you must stint your soules; know therefore that the soule must be so farre kept to the consideration of sinne, that it may seeke out for pardon for sinne. This is a point of marvelous use, and you must give the leave to be inlarged; because there are many deceits this way, in the spirits of a man: for marke it, this is the cunning of the Devill, if it be possible, he will keepe a man that he shall never see, muse, nor be troubled for sinne; and therefore he doth plucke him off, and sends him to company on one side, and merriment on the other side, that by this meanes, he may keepe him from serious medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the evill: But if it be so that God wil make a man meditate of his sinnes, and that the heart of a sinner is fully resolved to muse, and ponder, and consider of his corruptions; If he will pore upon his sinnes, then he shall see nothing else but sinne: and thus the Devill hath hindred many a poore soule from comming unto Christ, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> receiving comfort of him; he shall now be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes poring upon his corruptions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here lies the skill of a Christian, not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect meditation, and therefore here is the stint of meditation of our sinnes, you shall thus discover it: So farre see thy sinnes, so farre be affected with them, so farre hold thy minde to them, that they may make thee see an absolute necessity of a Christ, and that these sinnes may drive thee to the Lord Iesus Christ for succour: here is the maine thing observable, and thus farre we may


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21378:63"/>
goe, and must goe, if ever God intend to doe good to our soules: and therefore when thou settest thy soule, and bestowest thy selfe to muse and meditate upon thy corruptions, and lay them to thy heart; when thou findest thy soule to bee affected with them, and humbled under them, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then to see an absolute necessity of a Lord Iesus Christ, and so farre see them, that they may drive thee, &amp; compell thee to seeke unto Christ for mercy: and this is all God lookes for, all the Lord requires and cares for in this preparation or preparative worke: And therefore take notice of it, see thy sinnes so farre as they may make thee meerely looke for a Christ, and to fall upon the armes of Gods mercy in and through Christ. For it is not sorrow for sinne, nor humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, nor faith it selfe, that can justifie us in it selfe, but onely these must make way for us to a Christ, and through him we must receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: for these two be the speciall extreames, that the Devill seekes to drive a man into: If a man presume of a mans owne sufficiency, then he thinkes he is well, and he will not goe to Christ, because he thinkes, he doth not stand in need of Christ; and if he despaire of his owne abilitie, he will not goe to Christ neither, and here is the ground why a sinner despaires, it is not by reason of any sinne, excepting onely the sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the holy Ghost, despaire is not grounded there, for <hi>Cain</hi> despaired, yet <hi>Manasses</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted greater sinnes then <hi>Cain</hi> and despaired not; but the soule despaires out of stoutnesse of heart,


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21378:63"/>
because it hath not sufficiencie in it selfe, it will not looke out for helpe and comfort from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: presumption saith, I have sufficiencie in my selfe, and need not goe unto Christ; and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire saith, I have not sufficiencie, and therefore will not goe to Christ: here is the property of despaire, to cast away hope, when a man hath no hope that God will helpe him, now all the while the soule lookes for sufficiencie from Christ, there is hope; for though our sinnes bee never so hainous; thats nothing, all the question is, whether we can hope in Christ; For if all the sinnes that ever were, are, or shall be committed, ranne into one man, as all Rivers runne into one Sea, Christ could as easily pardon his sinnes, as ever he pardoned the sinnes of any Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but here is the ground, when we looke into our selves, we can see there is no sufficiencie to comfort us, and we will not goe to Christ, that we may be comforted, and so we come to be voide of hope, and to despaire: a despairing heart, is a proud stubborne heart; because he cannot have what he would of his owne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will not goe to another to receive it, and so sinkes downe in his sinnes. And therefore let this be the period and stint of meditation, when the soule so farre seeth sinne and the punishment deserved by it, that the hart is resolved that none but Christ can take away these sinnes and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments due to them, and is resolved to seeke to Christ, and be beholden to him for all; when it is thus with you, then away to the Lord Jesus


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21378:64"/>
Christ, and let this meditation of a mans corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be as a Bridge to carry him to Christ, that so he may have salvation which is promised through him, and shall be bestowed upon all broken harted sinners: and marke what I say, that soule that will not seeke out to Christ, and will not be beholding to Christ for what he need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, that soule wants brokennesse of heart: What ever he be that will not seeke out to Christ, and goe out of himselfe to another, wants brokennes, and this stubbornnesse of his, that he will not goe to Christ, ariseth from some of these three grounds.</p>
            <p>First, the soule will not goe out, it is because the heart thinkes and presumes it hath no neede of Christ, and therefore will not goe, but we will not medle with that: for that is proper to carnall men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the soule will not seeke out to Christ for helpe and comfort, it is because the heart is not content in good earnest to be ruled by Christ, that Christ should come and take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the soule, and doe all; therefore if the heart cling to corruption, it is content that Christ should ease it, but not that Christ should sanctifie it, and remove that corruption that hath prevailed over it; and therefore when a man is under the sight of sinne, he would faine have God shew mercy unto him, and yet he will not pray, nor read, nor use the meanes but dwels upon the meditation of his sinnes, and neglects many ordinances of God, whereby it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21378:64"/>
comfort: this man would have a Christ to quiet him, but not to rule him, and take posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of him, and this is the reason why, in these cases the soule is never commonly kindly striken, these would faine have quiet and comfort; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d yet they will not be driven to holy duties, nor be content that Christ should rule in them, they are content to commit the sinne, but they would have pardon for it.</p>
            <p>The third ground is this, and the cunningest of all, and that is this; provided the soule be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be ruled by the Lord Jesus, and to submit unto him, yet here is another deceit of the soule of a poore sinner, that would joyne something with Christ, for the helping of him in that great worke of salvation, and this I take to be the complaint of sinners, and sometime broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ones too; they dare not goe to expect mercy from the Lord Jesus. Why? why? because they are unworthy, so abominable their lives, so wretched their courses, that they dare not goe to Christ, that he may shew mercy to them. I reason the point thus; is it because of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse that you dare not goe to Christ? so then, if you had worthinesse, this would incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you for to goe: Why then, you thinke Christ is not able alone to helpe you, but you would have your worthinesse helpe Christ to save you, and so you would joyne with the Lord Jesus in this great price of Salvation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: If your sinnes were but small, and you had some worthinesse, that so Christ might


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21378:65"/>
doe something, and your worthinesse doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and so you might make up the price be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you, then you could be content to goe to Christ, but otherwise you thinke you may not goe to Christ, without some worthinesse of your owne; Againe, why then (belike) you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> be beholden to Christ for so much mercy, and so much grace, and so much forgivenesse: one of these two must needs be the ground of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, either we would have our own worthines joyne something with Christ, or else we are so vile that we will not be beholden to Christ for so much mercy; but this unworthinesse indeed is nothing else but pride, a man will not be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Christ for so much mercy, but he will share with Christ in the matter of salvation, or else he will not be pertaker of the great worke of redemption.</p>
            <p>Imagine a debtor were in prison, and a friend sends to him, what ever the debt be, if he will but come to him, he will pay all; the man returnes this answer. If he had not such a great debt to pay, he would be content to come to him, but the truth is, the debt is so great that he will not come to him, nor trouble him: now one of these two must needs follow, either he thinkes his friend is not able, or willing to pay his debt, or else in truth he will not be beholden to him for so much, but if the debt were a little one, then he would make a shift to pay some, and his friend some, and so they would make up the debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: So it is in this case, this is that which


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21378:65"/>
keeps the heart from laying hold on the promise: they thinke they are unworthy to pertake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is nothing but pride of spirit: for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would bring something, and share with Christ in the worke of redemption, or else they will not be beholden to Christ for so much mercy.</p>
            <p>There is another shift which keepes the heart from going to Christ; O faith one, I never had my heart so broken &amp; affected as such a one hath; and therefore they dare not goe to Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have not so much contrition, their hearts so much broken as others have, therefore they dare not goe: Ay, but be your soules content to goe to Christ and yeeld to him; would you keepe any corruption? is there any sinne which you would not have Christ come and remove? The soule answereth, that they would be content to resigne all to the Lord Jesus Christ, but they are not so humbled as others are: I say the ground of this complaint is nothing else but selfe-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in broken heartednesse, for the soule is not content to have so much broken heartednesse as is sufficient to bring a man to Christ, but it would have so much as that it might bring a man to Christ to helpe him in the worke of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they thinke i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> is not enough to have the soule so hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>bled as to submit to the Lord Jesus Christ, but they would have so much as they would joyn with Christ in this great worke: which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but carnall confidence. Therefore the conclusion is this: So farre see thy sinnes, so farre

meditate upon thy sinnes, and so farre labour to have thy heart affected with thy sinnes, and so far attend unto them, that three things may follow.</p>
            <p>First, that you may see an absolute necessity of Christ, and that thou maist use all meanes to seeke unto him, and never be quiet whilst thou findest him; Nay, while thou dost use the meanes but only upon the Lord Jesus; pray, and rest not in prayer, but in a Saviour that is obtained by prayer, heare, but rest not in hearing, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay to thy selfe what is revealed in hearing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacraments, but rest not in them, but therein seeke a Saviour which is there signed: this is the very stint and pitch of meditation: thus farre see and affect and drawe your hearts to the consideration of your sinnes, that the soule may be forced to goe to Christ, and use all meanes to find him, pray for a Christ, heare for a Christ, use all meanes, and see a need of a Christ, to blesse thee in all thy services, and see a need of a Christ to pardon thy sinnes, and then you take a right course; And thus much for the second pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage; now we see how to follow meditation home, that the soule may be affected therewith, and holden thereto.</p>
            <p>Ay, but you will say, our thoughts are dull, and our meditation fraile, and our wants heavy, and little good we get by this meditation, we fall to sinne againe; how shall we come to get the life of meditation, that it may be to us as it ought to be?</p>
            <p>I answer, the meanes to make meditation


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21378:66"/>
powerfull are two, I confesse after a man hath mused and pondered, it is possible that a corrupt heart may recoile and fall backe againe, therefore there are two helpes to put more life into medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>First, labour to call in the helpe and assistance of conscience, that meditation may be more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and powerfull; conscience is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, it is Gods vicegerent and chiefe officer, and God is the general overseer of all the affaires of the world, but conscience hath authority to execute Judgement according to the sentence God hath revealed, and hath a greater command with the heart, then bare meditation hath; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and reason are but the underlings of the wil, &amp; they are but serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts &amp; subjects to the wil, and these only suggest and advise unto the will what is good, as a servant may suggest to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster what is good, and yet his master may take what he list, &amp; refuse what he please in this kind. But conscience hath a greater command, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. conscience is said to accuse or excuse a man, and conscience comes with a law and a command as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.20. <hi>If our hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us</hi>; conscience makes the heart to yeeld. I comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e it thus: look as it is happily with a man that is in debt, if a man have a writ out for him, he is not troubled greatly with that, he will not goe to prison because of that, nay, though he shew it him, yet he will not goe, but if he brings the Sergean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o arrest him, then he must go, and and then he must be imprisoned whether he will


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21378:67"/>
or noe: So it is here, meditation brings in the writ, and sheweth a man his sinnes, layeth open all his duties neglected, so many hundred duties omitted, so many thousand sinnes committed, so many prophanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s of Sabbaths, so many oathes, so many blasphemies; but the soule saith, What is this to me? I have sinned, and others have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and I shall doe as well as others; but consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a Sergeant, and Sergeants do your office; these are your sinnes; and as you will answer it at the day of Judgement, take heed of those sins upon paine of everlasting ruine. When consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence begins thus to arrest a man, then the heart comes and gives way to the truth revealed, and conscience thus settles it upon the heart.</p>
            <p>The Second meanes whereby meditation may get power upon the soule, is this, we must cry &amp; crave, and call for the spirit of humiliation and contrition, that God by that blessed spirit of his which in Scripture is called the spirit of bondage would set to his helping hand &amp; assist conscience his officer, &amp; take the matter into his owne hand, and because there are many rebellious corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that oppose Gods truth, we must call to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for helpe, that God would seise upon the heart, and breake it: A perverse heart will linde the Judgement, and say, I will have my sinnes, though I be damned for them, and when consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence comes, and saith, I will beare witnes against you for your pride, and covetousnesse, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse. They resist conscience: Looke as it is if a Sergeant arrest a man, he may escape his hands,


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21378:67"/>
or kill the Sergeant, but if the Sheriffe or the King himself come, &amp; take the prisoner in hand, then he must goe to prison whether he will or no; so it is here, though a corrupt heart can stoppe conscience, stay conscience, yet there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power of Gods spirit; the spirit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: And when God comes from heaven to aide his officer, the heart must stoope, and be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned. Looke as it is with a child that is under government, his father perhaps bids the servant correct him, now it is admirable to see how the child will taunt with the servant, and struggle with him mightily, now when the father heareth this, he saith, Give me the rod, and he tells the child, you would not be whipped, but I will scourge you, and he will set it home, and plague him so much the more; because he resisted the servant: So it is here, the Lord hath revealed his will and sent his ministers to discover your sins, and verrifie your hearts, it is strange to see what resistance we finde; one scornes to heare, and rebells against the minister. Well, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the voice of the minister, or the word, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make the blow fall heavy enough for the time, yet if the Lord take the rod into his owne hand, he will make the stoutest stomack stoope, and the hardest heart come in: when the father takes the rod into his hand, and lets in hell fire, he will set it home, take it off who will or can; the <hi>Apostle</hi> cals it the spirit of bondage: and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the place,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note>

When the Lord doth shew unto man his sinnes, and holds him to his sinnes, that he cannot looke off them, this is the worke of the spirit of bondage: when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science hath done his duty, and yet his mouth is stopped, then the Lord himselfe comes; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the word by the mouth of the ministery could not prevaile, yet God will set the sun-light of his spirit to your soules, and then you shall see your sinnes, and stoope under them. When a man would cut off the sense of sinne, yet where ever he is, and what ever he doth, the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents his sins to him, when he goeth in the way, he reades his sinnes in the pathes, when he is at meate his sinnes are before him, when he goeth to lie downe, he goeth to read his sinnes on the teaster of his bed, this is thy covetousnesse, and thy pride, and for these thou shalt be plagued. Looke upon these sinnes, they are thine owne, &amp; thou hast deserved punishments to be inflicted upon thee for them: thus we see the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds how meditation must be raised: We see how we may bring meditation home to the heart, we see how


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21378:68"/>
also we may get the life &amp; power of meditation.</p>
            <p>I thought to have propounded an example that you may see the practice of the truth delivered: as imagine it were the sinne of the opposing of the word, I would breake my soule withall; first, by meditation cast the compasse of this sin, looke into the word, &amp; see whatsoever the word hath revealed of this sinne: The text saith, by this meanes the anger of the Lord is marvelously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, in so much that <hi>he will laugh at the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of such.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 1.26</note> Nay, by this meanes Christ himselfe is despised, nay, our condemnation is hereby sealed irrecoverably. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. the text saith, <hi>They despised Gods word, till the wrath of the Lord arose, and there was no remedy:</hi> Nay, hereby we aggravate our conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>nation. For Christ saith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Woe be to thee Bethsayda: Woe be to thee Chorazin, for if the mightie workes which have beene done in thee, had beene done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented in dust and ashes: But it shall be easier for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then for thee:</hi> Nay, the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> saith, 2.3. <hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?</hi> The case of such a man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate: how shall we escape? Thus you see the reach how farre this sinne goeth, gather up all then, and tell your hearts of this, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell and oppose the word of God; How dare I doe this? what, provoke God so farre as to laugh at my destruction? what, despise Christ and his Spirit, nay, make my case irrecoverable, and aggravate to my condemnation? but if the


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21378:69"/>
heart will not stoope under this, then call for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; conscience to your charge, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science comes, and chargeth the soule on paine of everlasting condemnation to heare and to be humbled; And if this will not doe, intreat the Lord to take the rod into his owne hand, and bring these truths home unto the soule, that it may never be quieted till it be humbled: this is the course I would have you take, to bring the truth home to your soules. When the minister hath done his sermon, then your worke beginnes, you must heare all the weeke long: he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meditates of his sinnes, is never like to be broken hearted for his sinnes: take notice of this, The text saith of these converts, <hi>They were pricked in their hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This clause of the verse discovers unto us that, which brings in this shiverednesse and contrition of spirit which the Lord cals for at the hands of his servants; Now give me leave to make way for my selfe, by opening of the words, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken away all the vaile from them, you may more clearely see the truth delivered.</p>
            <p>First, let me shew you what this <hi>piercing</hi> or <hi>pricking</hi> of the heart is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what is meant by <hi>heart.</hi> You must know, that sound sorrow, or sorrow soundly set on, is here meant by <hi>pricking,</hi> and this word <hi>prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> resembles sorrow in three degrees: For the word in the originall imports not only a bare <hi>pricking,</hi> but a <hi>searching quite through</hi>; and we have no word in our English tongue to answere the


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21378:69"/>
same word, but onely a shiverednesse of soule all to pieces. I say there are three things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>pricking</hi> resembles sorrow. First, the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pricked, but there must be some paine, some griefe, some trouble wrought by it, and accompanying of it. Secondly, it is the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one part from another, as the naturall Philosophers couceive, and as the Physitian gives us to understand, it is the sundering of two parts. Thirdly, the parts being thus pricked, there is the letting of it out, and if any blood or water be in that part thus pricked, so answerably in this sound sorrow in heart, there are three things; I meane in that sorrow which is set home by the Almighty: First, there is a great griefe and vexation of soule: Secondly, by reason of the burthen that lieth upon the heart, that cursed knot, and union, and combination betweene sinne and the soule comes in some measure to be severed and parted; the soule being thus grieved with the sinne, is content to be severed from it: this is the thing we aime at. Thirdly, this knot of corruption being loosened, and this closure being broken, and the souldring betweene sinne and the soule being removed, there is now a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for the letting out of all these corruptions, that the heart may be taken from under the power of sinne and be subject to the power and guidance of God: This is the true nature of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And by the way, consider this, unlesse the Lord should thus wound and vexe the soule, the heart that prizeth corruption as a God (as every


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21378:70"/>
naturall man doth) would never be severed from it; did the soule see onely the delight in sinne, it would never part from it; and therefore God is forced to make us feele this, that we may be severed from our sinnes, and be subject to him in all obedience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what is meant by heart; not to tyre you with any matter of signification, this word implieth two things specially, which concerns our purpose, both may be implied and intended, but the first is mainely implied and intented, it is not the naturall part of a man which is in the middest of the body, that is, a fleshly heart; but it is the will it selfe, and that abilitie of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>oule, whereby the heart saith, I will have this, and I will not have that. As the understanding is setled in the head, and keepes his sentinell there, so the will is seated in the heart, when it comes to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or refusing, this is the office of the will, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but their sins peirced them: but I will not meddle with this point, though otherwise is were very usefull.</p>

               <hi>All the creatures groaned under it,</hi> the earth groanes under sinners, and is willing to vomit them up, it is a burden to the Sunne to give light to the adulterer to see his harlot, and it is a burden to the ayre to give breathing to a blasphemer that belcheth out his oaths against the God of heaven, nay, it is that which sinkes the damned into the bottomlesse pit, it is such as <hi>Iudas</hi> had rather hang himselfe then indure the horror of Conscience for it: let this therefore dash the foolish conceit of them which thinke there is no pastime but in sinne; however men glory in sinne, and take delight in sucking the pleasure of sinne, yet the end will be bitternesse.

            <p>So that the maine point which fits our aime is this sound sorrow, piercing of the soule of those that are affected with it, they were not onely pricked in their eyes to weepe for their sinnes,

a man to thrust him through. This discovers it selfe in three particulars. First, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and usually lets in a kinde of amazement into the mind of a sinner, and a kind of gastering: As it is with a sudden blow upon the head, if it comes with some violence, it dazells a man, that he knowes not where he is; Just so it is generally with the soule, the Lord lets in some flashes of his truth, and darts in some evidences of his truth into the heart of a man, the hammer of Gods Law layeth a sudden blow upon the heart, and this discovers the vile nature of sinne; as when a drunkard is drunke to day, and will be so to morrow, and the minister preacheth against that sinne, and yet he will be drunke still, and the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer saith, come lets sweare the minister out of the pulpit, now it may be the Lord lets in some suddaine truth, that unmaskes the soule, and drives him to sudden amaze, that now he sees his corruptions to be otherwise then ever he did; commonly he doth not yet see the evill of sinne, but he is driven to a stand and a pawse, and he doth not know what to say of himselfe, nor what to thinke of his sinne, there is a kinde of tumult in his thoughts, and a confused cumber, he knowes not what to make of himselfe, and he goeth away in a kind of confused distemper: Thus it was with <hi>Paul</hi> when he was running a long to <hi>Damascus</hi>; and had gotten a lustie Steed to make hast, suddenly there did shine a light from heaven, and he heard a voice from heaven saying unto him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou

            <p>As it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> so it is most commonly with us all, it may be a poore man drops into the Church, and the Lord lets in a light, and the Lord doth compas him about with some threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Law, and shewes him the nature of sinne, and the damnation that comes by it, and thereupon his thoughts beginne to hurry in one upon another, and he retyres home, and thinks thus with himselfe, surely the preacher spake strange things to day, if all be true that he spake, then certainly my conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is naught, surely there is more in sinne then ever I thought of; I did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thinke that such sinnes as were grosse and punishable by the Law of man, were abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and God was incensed against them, but what? will every wicked thought sinke the soule into hell unlesse God pardon it? and is God so just, and so severe, and will he punish all sinners? and must I answere for all my petty oathes? If I shall be condemned for my words, and thoughts, it is a strange thing: well, I will inquire further of the matter, it is marvelous hard if it be true. Many a man hath beene thus, and goeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the present.</p>
            <p>Well then, Secondly, he resolves to heare the minister againe, and he fals to reading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with others, to try if it be so as the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster before revealed unto him, and commonly


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21378:75"/>
he goeth to heare the same minister againe, and by this meanes what with hearing and reading &amp; conferring, he seeth the thing he doubted of is too certaine, and that the thing be questioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is without all doubt: the Law is just, the word is plaine, if God be true, this is true, <hi>The wages of sinne is death</hi>; Yea of every sinful thought: and, <hi>He that beleeveth not, is condemned already:</hi> so that now the sinner beginnes to consider that the condemnation threatned sleepes not, and that God hath him in chase, and that punishment that God threatens shall be executed upon him sooner or latter: thus the soule from a generall amazement, comes to see that it is so, and by this meanes he is surprised with a sudden feare of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in expectation and suspition of what is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, left God should lay it upon him, in so much that the soule saith, What if God should damne me, God may doe it: and what if God should execute his vengeance upon me, the soule feareth that the evill discovered will fall upon him, the nature of his feare is this, he knoweth there is cause of feare, and he cannot beare the evill when it is come. He saith, I am a sinfull wretch, and God may damne me for ought I know, and what if God should damne me: this is the reason of those phrases of Scripture, <hi>Wee have not received the spirit of bondage to feare againe,</hi>

                  </gap>7.</note> That is,


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21378:75"/>
the spirit of bondage that workes feare; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord saith by <hi>Moses, Thy life shall hang in doubt before thee, and thou shalt feare day and night, thou shalt have no assurance of thy life.</hi> It is with a soule in this feare, as it was with <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> when he commanded the cups to be brought out of the house of the Lord, that he, and his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and his concubines might quaffe in them, &amp; brave against the God of Israel: then came a hand writing against him on the wall, and when he saw it, his thoughts troubled him and his face beganne to gather palenesse, and his knees knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one against another, as if he should say, surely there is some strange evill appointed for me, and with that, his heart began to tremble and shake; Just so it is with this feare, he that runnes ryot in the way of wickednesse, aud thinkes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise Gods Spirit, &amp; to hate the Lord Almighty, and to resist the work of his grace and saith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himselfe, Let us goe &amp; heare the minister, that we may cavill at him, and persecute him.</p>
            <p>Now it may be there comes this feare and hand-writing against him; and who knowes but that it may be thus with thee, whosoever thou art: for this is a note of the child of the devill, to hate Gods servants, and ministers. Now when a wicked man heares this, he saith, the word of God was profestly spoken against him, and these are my sinnes, and these are the Judgements and plagues threatned against them, and therefore why may not I be damned? and why may I not be plagued? and thus his heart is full of feare, &amp;


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21378:76"/>
he begins to reason with himselfe; what, is this the nature of sinne? and are these the Judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts of God denounced against sinfull creatures? why then, what if God should lay these Judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my soule? and who knoweth but God will doe so to me this day; plucke me out of the land of the living? I am sure my sinnes are such, and Gods Judgements are such threatned against them, and therefore why may not this be? and when he goeth to bed he reasoneth thus; what if I never rise more? and when he goeth from home, what if I never returne more? and God may take me with my meate in my mouth, and cast me downe into hell fire for ever. The soule being in this estate, and the heart being thus pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered and plagued with the feare of Gods wrath that followeth a man like a Jailor, he is hindred still that he cannot sinne so freely, but still the wrath of God pursueth him, and saith, Do you not feare that God may take you away in the act of sinning, and in the middest of your chambring and wantonnesse? The heart being thus pestered with this feare, it is not able to endure it, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to drive away this trouble and dread from his mind, and still he thinkes God is against him, and he heares some behind him saying, Thou must come to Judgement and be plagued: Now the soule labours to drinke away and play away this Sorrow. Another man haply that was a prodigall before, riseth now early and will be exceedingly busied about his occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s all the day long, that these things may take up his mind; &amp;


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21378:76"/>
the reason is, there lyeth something at the heart and he cannot tell which way to drive away his feare, but he labours all in vaine: For this is to make up walls with untempered morter which will presently fall downe; it is as much as a man should labour to ease himself of sinne by sinning, to give a man cold drinke in a hot burning feaver.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the third place the Lord pursueth the soule, and when the heart cannot be rid of this feare, the Lord beginnes to let fly against the soule of a sinner, and discharges that evill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him which was formerly feared, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enters into the heart. The nature of feare is to feare an evill to come: now the Lord makes the soule to see that it is not only great drunkards &amp; adulterers that are threatned, but every sinfull thought and idle word.</p>
            <p>The soule would faine have driven away this feare, but the Lord will not let him, but saith, these curses shall kindle upon thee, and shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever to thy perdition. And hence comes this sorrow, the Lord lets in some veine of his vengeance, and some secret displeasure of his, and makes sinne to stabbe the soule, and then the curse lyeth upon him, and the Lord as it were kindles the fire of his wrath upon him really, and makes him see this is that which he feared. Now his conscience is all on a flame within him, and he saith to himselfe, Thou hast sinned and offended a just God, and therefore thou must be damned and to hell thou must goe: This is the particular


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21378:77"/>
seising of the curse upon a sinfull soule; for this is the nature of true sorrow, if evill be to come we feare it, if evill be upon us we grieue and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for it, herein is the greatest worke of all, &amp; the Lord deales diversly as he seeth fit; specially these three wayes.</p>
            <p>First, if God have a purpose to civilize a man, he will lay his sorrow as a fetter upon him; he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes to civilize him, and knocke off his fingers from base courses, as wee have knowne some in our daies; many desperate persecutors of Gods people, God casts his sorrow into their hearts, and then they say, they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute Gods people no more, haply they are naught still, but God confines them first: God only rippes the skinne a little, and layeth some small blow upon him: but if a man have been rude and a great ryoter, the Lord begins to serve a writ upon him, and saith, Thou art the man, to thee be it spoken, thy sins are weighed, and thou art found too light, heaven and salvation is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thee, thy sorrow is begunne here, never to have end hereafter, but thou must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in endlesse torments: thou hast continued in sinne, and therefore expect the fierce anger of the Lord to be upon thee for ever; so that now the soule seeth the flashes of hell and Gods wrath upon the soule, and the terrours of hell lay hold upon the heart, and he confesseth he is so, and he hath done so: And therfore he is a poore damned creature, and then the soule labours to welter it, and it may be his conscience will be deluded by


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21378:77"/>
some carnall minister that makes the way broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then it is, and bids him goe and drinke, and play, and worke away his sorrow: or else it may be, he stops the mouth of conscience with some outward performances: it may be his conscience saith, Thou hast committed these &amp; these sinnes, and thou wilt be damned for them; And then he entreats conscience to be quiet &amp; hold his peace, and he will pray in his family, and heare sermons, and take up some good courses; and thus he takes up a quiet civill course, and stayeth here a while, &amp; at last comes to nothing: And thus God leaves him in the lurch, if he meanes only to civilize him.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, if God intends to doe good to a man, he will not let him goe thus, and fall to a civill course: When a man begins to colour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his old sinnes, and God hath broken his teeth, that he cannot worry as formerly: but yet there is no power in him: If the Lord love that soule, he will much the more clearely reveale his sinnes unto him: God will plucke away all his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and wantonnesse, all his pride and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishnesse, and pull off his vizzard, and shew him all his sinnes, and pursue him; therefore as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God entred the blow, so now he followes it home. And hence it is that <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the Almighty sticke fast in me, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome thereof drinkes up my spirits, and the terrours of the Almighty encampe themselves against me eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way.</hi> And as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Thou keepest my eyes waking, and my sinnes are ever before me.</hi> If God

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 7.19</note>And in another place <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low downe my spittle?</hi> You had better a great deale now have your hearts humbled and broken, and see your sinnes, then to see them when there is no remedy.</p>

            <p>And in another place <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Thou wilt breake a dry leafe tossed too and fro:</hi> And yet the Lord brake him: Now the soule seeth all the evill, and the Lord pursueth him and sets conscience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke to the full. Consider that of the <hi>Apostle, That all those might be damned which beleeved not

No, nor you little ones neither; all that lay not hold upon Christ, but have pleasure in unrighteousnesse, not only great ones, and such as are abominably prophane, but even all that had pleasure in wickednesse. Now conscience saith, Doest not thou know that thou art one of them that have had pleasure in unrighteousnesse, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore away thou must goe, and thou shalt be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Now the soule shakes, and is driven beyond it selfe, and would utterly faint, but that the Lord upholds it with one hand, as he beates it downe with the other; he thinkes that every thing is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and the fire burnes to consume him, and he thinkes the ayre will poyson him, consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence flies in his face, and he thinkes hell mouth is open to receive him, and the wrath of God hangs over his head, and if God should take away his life he should tumble head-long downe to hell.</p>
            <p>Now the soule is beyond all shift, when it is day, he wisheth it were night, &amp; when it is night he wisheth it were day; the wrath of God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth him wheresoever he goeth, and the soule would faine be rid of this, but he cannot; and yet all the while the soule is not heavy and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for sinne, he is burdened, and could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to throw away the punishment and horror of sinne, but not the sweet of sinne: as it is with a child that ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es a live coale in his hand, thinking to play with it, when he feeles fire in it, he throws it away, he doth not throw it away, because it


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21378:82"/>
is blacke, but because it burnes him; So it is here: A sinfull wretch will throw away his sinne, because of the wrath of God that is due to him for it, and the drunkard will be drunke no more, but if he might have his queanes and his pots without any punishment or trouble, he would have them with all his heart, he loves the blacke and sweet of sinne well enough, but he loves not the plague of sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Foolish people</hi> (saith the <hi>Prophet</hi>) <hi>are plagued for their sinne.</hi> If thou roarest for disquiet of heart, and thy bones are broken; it is because of thy sin; thy pride, and drunkennesse, and uncleannesse, brought this upon thee; If thou wilt be eased of the plague, throw away thy corruptions, if you would have the effect removed, then take away the cause.</p>
            <p>There are two things in sinne which make a man sorrowfull; first sinne it selfe that doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file a man, and separate him from God: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the punishment of sinne. Now the sinner lookes either so far at sinne as it causeth punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or as it separats from God.</p>
            <p>Haply a sinner will come to this, he will be content to carry his heart, and that furiously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne, because it brings Judgements and plagues; But thus farre a hypocrite may goe, a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, a Caine, a Saul: Caine would say his sinnes were greater then could be forgiven: because he had killed his brother; but he could never see his sinne so vile; because it did separate him from God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:21378:82"/>Thus you see how God enters the blow, and followeth it home upon the soule, but yet for all this, God may leave a man as he did <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and there is an end of them.</p>
            <p>Now in the third place, if the Lord purpose to doe good to the soule, he will not suffer him to be quiet here, but he openeth the eye of the soule further; and makes him sorrow, not because it is a great and shamefull sinne, but the Lord saith to the soule, even the least sinne makes a separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene me and thee; and the heart begins to reason thus, Lord is this true? is this the smart of sinne? and is this the vile nature of sinne? O Lord! how odious are these abominations that cause this evill, and though they had not caused this evill, yet this is worse then the evill, that they make a separation betweene God and my soule. Good Lord, why was I borne? and why came I into this world? why did God continue me here, and all the meanes of grace for my good, and all the comforts of this life, wherby my course might be maintained and made lesse tedious? what if I did want this horrour of heart, and had all the ease in the world? and what if I might be free from all misery on earth? what were this, so long as I had sin in my soule, that makes a separation betweene God &amp; my soule? I was made to be one with God, &amp; to have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> God, &amp; to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mandements, but I have departed from God by sin &amp; departed from his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mandements.</p>
            <p>A Godlesse and a gracelesse man is a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man though he were never plagued at all; I


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21378:83"/>
was made to honour God, and I have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but dishonour him: I was made to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject my selfe to the good will of God, but I have withdrawne my selfe from his will; and this is my misery and my plague; If I had beene in hell, and had not had sinne, I had beene a happy man, and though I had beene in heaven and had had sin I had beene a miserable man; because it makes a separation betweene me and my God.</p>
            <p>Nay, the sinner still thus pleads with himselfe, what is this to me that I am rich and miserable, honourable and damned, to have quiet, and ease here, and a benummed conscience, and so in the end to be throwne among the devils for dogges meat? If I had all the ease, wealth, honours, and friends in the world, so long as I have this vile heart I could not be a happy man.</p>
            <p>If you were never pierced for your sinnes your condition is woefull, you shall have enough of it one day, you that are never troubled for your sinnes but goe on smoothly, know this, I charge you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, though you had all the ease and pleasures in the world, so long as you have these proud, sturdy, unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearts, you are as miserable creatures as ever breathed upon the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>Thus the heart complaines as sometimes the lamenting Church did, Woe to us that we have sinned, not because we have deserved plagues, but because we have sinned, woe to us, for the God of grace is gone from us, and the God of mercy is gone from us, because we have sinned;


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21378:83"/>
and the God of blessednesse is gone from us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we haue walked in cursed waies. Hold here and then your sorrow goeth right, if the soule can say, though I have no horrour of heart, yet if I have this sinfull heart, I am a miserable man.</p>
            <p>Then thy sorrow is right. Sometimes God deales thus punctually with a man; first, he drives it to an amazement, Secondly, he workes in him marvelous feare of evill that is to come; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he possesseth the soule with the feeling of the evill, and so forth, as in the former particulars, but yet is bound to no time, and therfore we must not limit the holy One of Israel: it is true, the Lord may presse in upon the soule, and worke all this on the sudden, but yet experience hath proved, and reason will confirme it, when God workes never so sudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ly, he affecteth the soule, thus whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> a poore soule commeth in the congregation, he layeth some truth upon him, that is new and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, so that the soule dare not deny it, nor yet fully resist it, but is in a maze, and by and by it may be the Lord opens his eyes and awakens his conscience, and makes that more evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t to the soule, and so immediately arrests the soule, and then sorrow fals in a maine upon it; and the heart thinkes God meant my courses, and the minister spake against him; and he must go downe to hell suddenly; so that sometimes the sinner cries out in the congregation, and though he contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for a time, yet he buckles under the burthen; all this may be done at one sermon, in one do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or in one part of an use; but usually this is


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21378:84"/>
Gods maner of working. But now the question in the next place will be this, how doth the soule behave it selfe under this sorrow?</p>
            <p>I answer, when the soule is sorrowfull for sin, as it is sinne, and as it is a breach of the Law of God, it may appeare by these two particulars. First, the soule is most of all weary of sin, because of the vile nature of it. Secondly, it is restlesse in importuning the Lord for mercy and pardon for it.</p>
            <p>First, the heart is most of all weary of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of sinne, as it is sinne, and thinkes it the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test burthen in the world: as a man that hath a great burthen on his backe wrincheth this way and that way, and if he cannot remove it, yet he will ease it; so the heart useth all meanes, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all courses, that if it were possible, it may cast off and ease it selfe of the vilenesse of sinne &amp; plague of sinne. This wearisomnesse of the soule, which followeth the weight of sinne, makes it self knowne in these three particulars.</p>
            <p>First, his eye is ever upon it, his mouth is ever speaking of it, and he is alwaies complaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and he is readily content to take shame to himselfe for it. If a man have a sore place in his body, his eye, and his finger will ever be upon it: so it is with the soule; As the people when they apprehended the hideous wrath of God against them, they entreated <hi>Samuel</hi> to pray for them,<note place="margin">1.

            <p>As it is with a man that hath the stone in the

I was a persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and a blasphemer, and the like; and I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to mercy; he doth not say, I was in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or in trouble, but I was a persecutor: he doth not say, I was thus and thus plagued, but I was an injurious person to Gods Church, there he was weary, and there he would be eased, if it were possible. Let all vile wretches tremble at it, for God hath enough for all <hi>Pharoes</hi> and <hi>Nymrods.</hi>

It is admirable to see how hard it is for a man to lay

open his sinnes before God, it is a signe that he is never weary of sinne, that he is not willing truly to confesse his sinne, when he is lawfully called to it, and when he pretends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> it is true sometimes God will accept of a confession made to him in secret, if it be in truth, but when God will have a man unbowell himselfe, and all his abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and when a man commeth and desires com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in this kinde, then for a man to cover his sinne, and to complaine a farre off of some ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary corruption, which every poore child of God is troubled with, and that particular lust whereof he is guilty for shame he is not willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; this argueth that the heart is naught and never sound this wearisomnesse of sinne: I know that the best heart under heaven will have many windings and turnings; but the Lord will never leave the heart in this case, till he come to deale plainly; and say, these are my sinnes, and this is my uncleannes, and this is my secret theft, and thus he openeth himselfe at large, to that man whom God hath appointed for that end: but some are content to confesse and complaine of their sinnes when God hath them upon the racke, and Judas did, but marke, his punishment is the greatest cause of his complaint, and hell is his greatest feare, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> weary of sinne because of the plague and punishment due to it, but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver regards the vilenesse of sinne in this respect, because it makes a separation betweene God and his soule. Secondly, as the soule complaines of the vile nature of sin and desires to have his face


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21378:85"/>
covered with shame, for it is so in the second place; it will never meddle with nor give way to any thing that is sinfull, so farre as it is revealed, so to be setting aside sudden passions, and violent temptations, but when a man is come to himselfe againe, his conscience is awakened; this is sure, the soule will not dare to tamper with any thing that is sinful: why? becaus it hath bin wearied with the burthen of it before. It is the practice of the lamenting Church in <hi>Hosea</hi>;<note place="margin">Hosea. 14.3.</note> 
               <hi>Ashur shall not save us, we will not ride on horses, neither will we say to the workes of our hands: Ye are our Gods, for with thee the fatherles finde mercy.</hi> That is, we wil meddle no more with any thing that is sinfull, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> God heretofore, for they had trusted in their horses, &amp; made Idols, and relyed upon them, but now they cast them cleane off.</p>
            <p>The reason is, because when the soule seeth sin as it is sinne, and that it is burthen to the soule, and the heart is now weary of it, it will lay no more weight upon it, because now the heart is weary enough already. The blasphemer feares an oath, &amp; the adulterer shakes to see his quean, and he trembles to see the place where his abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations have beene committed, and now his heart loathes all these. If a man hath beene once at deaths doore by drinking deadly poyson, he will never tast of it more; Nay, he will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the sight of that cup, he wil rather fare hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and rather starve then eate and drinke that which shall kill him, so (saith the soule) it is sin that hath made a separation betweene me and


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21378:86"/>
my God, this pride, or this uncleannesse had been the death of me if God had not beene mercifull unto me, and therefore I will rather sinke and die then meddle with these sinnes any more.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that if any thing come under the colour of corruption, the soule that is truly weary of sinne, saith, Omitting of this duty is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and therefore I will not omit it, the doing of this action is sinfull, and therefore I will not doe it; because the sinne is worse then the plague, he will take the lesse evill of the two, as we use to doe in other matters: if a man hate his sinne for the plague, then so soone as that is removed, he returnes to his sinne againe, the blow was but weake. This was the fault in Judas his sorrow he did see and confesse his sinnes, and bewaile them, and did more then many will doe now a daies, &amp; tooke shame to himselfe, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> though he confessed and complained of his sinne, yet he would rather commit murther upon himselfe, then under-goe the horrour of sinne; if he had beene weary of sin because of the loathsomenesse of it, he would not have layed violent hands upon himselfe: These two passages are every where, where true saving grace is.</p>
            <p>Now in the third place, if God should deprive a sinner of his judgement and horrour of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet if his heart be truely apprehensive of sin as it is sinne, he cannot lay aside his sorrow; so long as sin prevailes and gets head against him, and dogges him up and downe, nothing will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him, but the removall of his sinne: That soule


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21378:86"/>
which was cured by any other meane save onely by Christ, was never truly wounded for sinne: If ease cures him, then horrour was his vexation: If honour cure him, then shame was his burthen: If riches cure him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> poverty did most of all pinch him: but if the soule were truly wounded for sin, then nothing can cure him but a Saviour to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, and grace to purge him: for what is that to the soule, to have ease and liberty, nay to be in heaven, if he have a naughty rebellious heart, nay if it were possible for him to be in heaven with his sinfull heart, it would tyre him and burthen him there: Therefore those soules that are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any thing saving by Christ, those soules were never truly wounded for sinne as sinne: It may be horror and vexation lay heavy upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, but it was not the stroke of sinne that did trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them.</p>
            <p>Then gather up all, he that which out of the vilenesse which he seeth in sinne is content to take shame to himselfe, and will not meddle with his sinne, neither carelesly nor willingly, and is not cured by any thing saving by Christ, this man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haveth himselfe truly in the first place. Thus much of the tryall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, againe, the soule is restlesse in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning the Lord for mercy, and will not be quieted till it get some evidence of Gods favour, the soule will take on nay, it will not be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unles it can finde some glimps of acceptance through the goodnesse of God in Christ. This is plaine, if a man be burthened with a weight, or


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21378:87"/>
some heavy load that is laid upon him, if that he be fallen under his burthen, he lyeth there like to die, and if there be none neere to succour him, all his care is to cry out for helpe, and though he seeth no man yet he cryeth out, O help, help, for the Lords sake. <hi>Saul</hi> was without sight three daies,<note place="margin">Acts. 9.17.</note> and no doubt he prayed to God all that while, as if he had resolved to give him no rest till he had found mercy: this is the nature of true sorrow, it ever drives a man to God, whereas reprobate sorrow drives a man from God: Nay, it may be, though the heart thinkes it shall never finde mercy, yet the Lord carryeth on the soule in an earnest desire, and using the meanes, and wil not off from God, and from his word and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ordinances, Nay, though he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time concludes that he shall never get mercy, nor get power against his corruptions; and then one saith, You had best leave off all; Nay, (saith the soule) I cannot be worse then I am, if I goe to hell I will goe this way. There is a kinde of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the heart which is heavenly and godly, but reprobate sorrow even drives a man from God, and maks him say, if I am damned I am damned, if I be a reprobate I am so. O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>hou wretch, is this all? If a poore creature that is pressed under his burthen cryeth for helpe, when almost nature &amp; strength doth faile, he crieth still for helpe, and that is all he can say, and so he dyes, and this is the last word that he speaks with a soft still voice O help, help: So it is with the soule of a poore languishing sinner, when the heart is burthened


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21378:87"/>
with the vilenesse of the nature of sinne and the separation from God by the same, he doth not now cry ease and liberty and riches Lord: No, he cries mercy mercy Lord on this vile heart of mine, and give me power against these mighty lusts: &amp; after many means using when he is going the way of all flesh, his last word is mercy.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes I see this poore soule slyding away and saying, how many sinnes have I committed, Oh mercy, mercy, Christ. And this is the last word he speaketh, and so he dies; and no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but mercy shall be given him. It is not a <hi>Lord have mercy upon me,</hi> and <hi>God forgive me</hi> will serve the turne: No, it is otherwise, if ever God set home this worke, he will make you restlesse in seeking mercy, and nothing shall content you but mercy to pardon your sinnes, and grace to subdue them, and the soule thinkes if mercy would but shine upon him, and if his sinnes were taken away that they might never hinder him in a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> course, he were a happy man: this is the frame of the soule that is truely weary of sinne.</p>
            <p>When the young man came to Christ, and played fayre and a farre off, and said he could do any thing.

burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, O Lord help me against it, give me mercy to pardon me, and grace to remove it: But our Sauiour heard no more of the young man, and as it is in the text, this pricking of heart made the Jewes come to <hi>Peter</hi> saying<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, <hi>Men and brethren, What shall wee doe?</hi> They did not as a great many say now a dayes, if the minister were far enough off from me, and I from him, I were happy, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quiet for him: these are reprobate spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: but the sinner that is truly humbled and burthened with sinne as sinne, he comes home, and is resolved to wait for mercy till the Lord sheweth mercy to him. Carnall sorrow sent <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and <hi>Achitophel</hi> to the gallowes, but godly sorrow ever drives a man to God.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ionah</hi> was in the Whales belly he said, Lord, though I cannot come to thy temple, I will <hi>looke</hi> towards it: so a sorrowfull soule that is truly burthened with sinne, will say, though I cannot come to heaven, yet I will looke up to heaven: and though I never finde mercy, yet for mercy will I wait: thy mercy onely Lord shall content me.</p>
            <p>The next thing is this, we thinke of all things our sinne most pleasant, and nothing so grievous as Gods commandements, and therefore will these sinnes wherein we have taken so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, will these so wound the soule; why should sinne so wound and pierce the soule? The reasons are these three.</p>
            <p>The first is this, the soule must be pierced with sinne, because it is the greatest evill of the


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21378:88"/>
soule, and therefore if the heart doe but truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, it cannot but it must be most of all burthened with it: If a man beare two weights on his backe, that is most grievous which is most heavy; if he feele the burthen, as the nature of it requires, it will most presse the shoulders of him that beares it; if the one be thirtie and the other fortie pound weight, nature will be most bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with the greatest weight: so there is no evill so properly and directly evill to the soule, as the evill of sinne: Punishment deprives the soule of ease and quiet, but sin depives the soule of God, and the maine end for which it was created, through which the soule must be happy, or for the want of this it must be accursed. Now sinne is as it were ten thousand weight, when as sorrow and shame and punishment, they are but a hundred weight: if it were possible for a man to have all the ease and quiet in the world, and to be in heaven, yet if he had a foule heart and a sinfull soule, he were a miserable cursed creature, and if it were possible to be in hell, free from sinne, he were a happy man. There is nothing that can do properly good to the soule but God, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can properly doe any hurt to the soule but sinne, which estra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>geth the heart from God, which is the chiefest good. If a man had all the pleasures and contents the world could afford, nothing wil satisfie the soule but God, and if the soule were in horrour, and had the presence of God with it, it would not but be comforted and quieted therewith, it is possible; Nay, God doth it also,


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21378:89"/>
he makes the soule of a man feele the burthen of sinne because of the vilenesse of it, as well as of the plague and punishment of it.</p>
            <p>When the Lord will fasten a mans sinne to his conscience, he is able to force the soule to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the evill of sinne as well as the torment and plague of sinne.</p>
            <p>And the ground is this, take the soule as it is polluted with corruption and all abominations, sinne is very crosse to the nature of the soule, it is a creature and a created thing by God, and hath his being from God, and the soule as it is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was made for God: and howsoever the power of sinne prevailed with it and made it fall short of God, yet the nature of the soule still, considering it as it is a creature, it is made for God, and desires to have fellowship and union with God: therefore marke how I despute: If sinne be the worst evill to the soule, as crossing the end of it, and depriving the soule of his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est good, then the Lord is able to make the soule see sinne as the greatest evill to the soule; But sinne crosseth the end of the creature, for the end of the creature is Godward, and to have union and fellowship with God. Therefore the Lord is able to make the soule see the evill of sinne as well as the evill of punishment: Therefore it is no wonder that the heart be most of all pierced with sinne.</p>
            <p>The second reason is, because by sound sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the soule is truly prepared and fitted for the Lord Jesus Christ, and no other way then


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:21378:89"/>
this: namely, when the soule sees the burthen of sin as sin: For when the soule comes to feele sinne in the proper colours of it, and to be affected with the loathsomnesse that is in that sin, which hath formerly over-ruled it: Now the soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to renounce the power of that sinne, and to withdraw himselfe from under the dominion of his corruptions, so that the union betweene sin and the soule is now broken, and roome is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared &amp; way is made for the Lord Jesus to come into the soule; when sorrow hath wearied the heart and loosened it from the love of sinne then the heart is fitted for Christ. As it is with a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell that hath beene for dishonour, if a man will turne the nature of it and make it a vessell of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he must not only beat it a little, but he must melt it throughly, and then it is fit to be a vessell of honour. So the soule of every sinfull man and woman is a vessell of dishonour, and sinne hath marvelously polluted them. Now if you will have your hearts fitted for Christ, you must not only have your hearts warmed a little by humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, but you must have them melted all to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the heart must be content to part with al abominations whatsoever, that so the Lord may take place in it, and rule over it even for ever. First, cast out the <hi>strong man,</hi> and then the Lord Christ wil come in and <hi>take possession</hi> of the heart; sinne and satan are the strong man, and the Lord Christ <hi>binds</hi> this <hi>strong man</hi> and casts him out, when he sheweth the vilenesse of sinne, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart with the burthen of it, and binds


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21378:90"/>
the soule to good behaviour; that now the heart is readily content that Christ should come and doe all in the soule.</p>
            <p>Many haue gone a great way in the strok of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, and yet because it neuer went through to the quicke, they have gone backe againe, and become as vile as ever they were; I have knowne men, that the Lord hath layed a heavy burthen upon them; and awakened their consciences, and driven them to a desperate extremity, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much anguish and many resolutions and the prizing of Christ, as they conceived, and after the renouncing of all, to take Christ upon his owne termes, as they imagined; and even these when they have beene eased and refreshed, and God hath taken off the trouble, they have come to be as crosse to God and all goodnesse, and as full of hatred to Gods children as ever, and worse too.</p>
            <p>Now why did these fal away? Why were they never Justified and Sanctified? and why did they never come to beleeve in the Lord Jesus? The reason is, because their hearts were never pierced for their sinne, they were never kindly loosened from it; this is the meaning of that place in <hi>Ier. Plow up the fallow grounds of your hearts,<note place="margin">Ier. 4.3. opened.</note> and sow not among thornes,</hi> it is nothing else, but with sound saving sorrow to have the heart pierced with the terrours of the Law seising upon it, and the vilenesse of sinne wounding the conscience for it. The heart of a man is compared to fallow ground that is unfruitfull; you must not sow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst thornes and thistles, first plow it, and lay


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21378:90"/>
it bare and naked, and then cast in your seed. If a man plow here a furrow, and there a furrow, &amp; leave here and there a bawke, he is never like to have a good croppe, there will grow so many thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and so much grasse, that it will choake the seed: our hearts are this ground, and our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are these thornes and thistles: Now if a man be content to finde some sinne hatefull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is shamefull, but will keepe here a lust &amp; there a lust, he will never make any good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry of his heart: though a faithfull minister should sow all the grace of the promises in his soule, he would never get any good by them, but the corruptions that remaine in the heart wil hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the saving worke thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore plow up all, &amp; by sound saving sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row labour to have thy heart burthened for sin, and estranged from it, and this is good husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry indeed; the want of this was the wound of the <hi>thorny ground</hi> as you may see in the <hi>parable,</hi> those <hi>hearers</hi> had much of the world in them,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> much ease, and profit, and pleasure, and these choaked the word and made it utterly unfruitful, and so they never received comfort nor mercy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.<note place="margin">Psalm. 51.17.</note> This is that which the <hi>Prophet David</hi> saith, <hi>A contrite and an humble heart O God thou wilt not despise</hi>

This one lust may breake his necke and send him downe to hell. So then, if the soule onely can be fitted for Christ by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound sorrow, then this must needs pierce the heart before Christ can come there, but the heart cannot be fitted for Christ without this, and therefore of necessity, the heart must be truly wounded with sorrow for sinne.</p>

evill to be in horror and vexation, then ease and quietnesse from these will be the greatest good; but now the soule seeth grace to be truly precious; because it seeth sinne to be truly vile: and this is the end why the Lord makes the soule see the vilenesse of sinne; that the heart may be brought to see the excellency in Christ and prize him above all.</p>
            <p>Now there are two questions to be answered. <note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, I will shew the difference of this from sanctifying sorrow, and yet it comes to be sanctifying sorrow.</p>
            <p>For the order: first, the heart in this worke is not yet conceived to be in Christ, but only to be fitted and prepared for Christ.</p>
            <p>If you stoppe here in your consideration, and despute not of any worke to come, it is only in the way to be ingrafted into Christ; but so, that undoubtedly that soule which hath this worke upon it shall have faith powred into it: for this

               <note place="margin">Luke 19.10.</note> Now to be <hi>lost</hi> is not because a man is sinfull and miserable in himselfe; but he is <hi>lost</hi> that seeth the evill of sinne, and the punishment that comes therby, &amp; comes to be lost in his owne apprehension, in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But he that is truly sensible of his sinne and the vilenes of it, and abhors himself for it, he is truely lost, he is not yet settled on Christ, for then he were safe enough, but he is truly sensible of his lost estate, and therefore shall have faith and Christ; though yet he partake not of them, yet he shall be everlastingly saved and redeemed by Iesus Christ.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:21378:92"/>The next thing is the difference of the sound saving sorrow from sanctifying sorrow; and you must know there is a double sorrow. First, there is a sorrow in preparation, Secondly, there is a sorrow in sanctification.</p>
            <p>The sorrow of the soule in this preparative worke of it,<note place="margin">Twofold sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> is thus to be conceived; when the word of God leaves an impression upon the heart of a man, so that the heart of it selfe is as it were a patient, and onely beares the blow of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the Spirit of the Lord and the over-powring force of the same forceth the soule to beare the word: and hence come all those phrases of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>wounded, pierced, pricked,</hi> and the like, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the passive voice; Because the soule is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and the Lord by the almighty hand of his Spirit, breakes in upon the soule, so that this sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in preparation is rather a sorrow wrought upon me, then any worke comming from any spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ability in my selfe.<note place="margin">What prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sorrow is.</note> This is sorrow in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration when I am a patient, and wherein I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the worke of the Spirit, and am forced and framed by the spirit to doe that which I doe in this kinde.</p>
            <p>But then Secondly there is a sorrow in sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and that is thus, that sorrow that doth flow from a spirituall principle of Grace, &amp; from that power which the heart hath formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Gods Spirit:<note place="margin">What sorrow in sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is.</note> For sanctification comes after justification, and after the soule hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved faith and grace, then the heart hath a new power given unto it, whereby it is able to set

forth it selfe into any holy action, so that in this a man is a free worker; whereas sorrow in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is a worke wrought on me, and I am a patient and doe onely endure it: but I have not any spirituall power to doe any thing of my selfe.</p>
            <p>Now mark what I say, both these are saving for rows, but they differ marvelously; many thinke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th at every saving work is a sanctifying work, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is false; for every saving worke is not a sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worke,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>Those whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, them he also justifies, and whom be justifies, he glorifies.</hi> Glorification implies sanctification here in part, and glory for ever hereafter; there is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving worke and calling but yet not sanctifying worke;<note place="margin">Every saving worke is not a sanctifying.</note> for <hi>vocation</hi> is when God so farre enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </label> The second question is this, whether doth the Lord worke this in all, and whether doth he worke it in all alike or no. For I perceive the hearts of many poore Christians are gasping for this, the Lord never wrought upon me in this maner, and my heart was never thus battered &amp; bruised, therefore how shall we know, whether the Lord doth worke this in all or no, and in all alike?</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
               </label> For the answere of this question, I will han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle three things, First, the worke is the same in all, Secondly, the maner is different in the most; Thirdly, many have it in them and yet perceive it not how or when it was wrought.</p>
            <p>First, this work of contrition of heart is wrought in every one in this worke of preparation, before he is, or can be planted into Christ: for the truth of this and the substantiall nature of it, Scripture is plaine, and reason is pregnant; Scriptures are many, I will only name three, as that in <hi>Luke,</hi> our Lord Jesus Christ <hi>came to seeke and to save that which was lost.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 19.10.</note> We may observe two things, first, the qualification of that party whom Christ will <hi>seeke</hi> and <hi>save,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those whom Christ will save.</note> he must be a <hi>lost</hi> man in his owne apprehension: secondly, see the certainty of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of such a one, Christ came for this end; he came to seeke up and save that which was lost. Now Christ will not misse of his end; he <hi>came</hi> for the <hi>lost sheepe,</hi> then the lost sheepe he will have; &amp; though the lost sheepe cannot seek nor save the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet Christ will save them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:21378:94"/>Thus you see, all men must be thus disposed before they can be saved; and if thus fitted and disposed, they shall be certainely saved; It is not enough for a man to be in a miserable estate and damnable condition, but he must also see it, and his heart must be truly affected with it, and finde and feele the but then of it; not so much for the punishment, but for the sinne whereby his heart is estranged from God, and also God from his soule.</p>
            <p>Now that the sensiblenesse of his lost conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is there spoken of, and this man that hath it shall be saved, may appeare, because the sensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a mans condition in regard of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinne is such, as a man may have, and yet never have grace and salvation: <hi>Cain</hi> had the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Gods wrath and felt the punishment of it, and so did <hi>Iudas</hi> also, and yet they were never sought up nor saved.</p>
            <p>The second place of Scripture, is out of <hi>Iohn, No man commeth to me except the father draweth him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 6.44.</note> by <hi>comming</hi> you must conceive beleeving, (as in that famous place of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 6.35.</note> 
               <hi>He that comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth in me, shall never thirst</hi>;) Now this text implyes two things, and they are profesly granted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> for the <hi>people murmured</hi> why the <hi>Pharisies</hi> and the <hi>great ones beleeved not and followed not Christ,</hi> to whom Christ answeres; <hi>Vnlesse my father from heaven draw them they cannot come</hi>: so that these two things are cleare, first, a man must be drawne, secondly, if he be drawne he shal surely come<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:21378:95"/>This drawing is thus much, when God opens the eye of a man and makes knowne his sinne, &amp; sets downe the heart in the acknowledgement of sinne, so that he feeles the vilenesse and the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of it, and is content to part with the fame.</p>
            <p>When the Lord shal lay all a mans abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon him, all his adulteries, and all his thefts, and now he sees what it is to depart from a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and a pure God; O then, he will be drunke, and uncleane, and malitious no more, because the heart is weary of it, and is content to part with it.</p>
            <p>From hence I reason thus, true drawing is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accompanied with true beleeving; but this sense of sinne in regard of the punishment of it, is not alwaies accompanied with true beleeving, but a man must see his sinne further in the vilenes of it, and in the abomination of it; and then he shall undoubtedly beleeve.</p>
            <p>The streame of the whole Scripture runnes this way,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> as that in <hi>Matthew, Come to me all y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Conclusion</hi> 1</note> It is a confest case (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) that every man by nature doth entertaine sinne as his God, and seekes and loves that most of all; himselfe, and his sinne, is his God. In this case it is his chiefest good, and the heart will not, nay, it cannot, be content to part with it; What is the cause that we propound Christ, and grace, and salvation, to a company of poore simple creatures, and yet the counsells, the promises, and commandements of God prevaile not with the heart of them, nor awe them, but still they will have their sinnes, and the <hi>offer</hi> of Christ and <hi>grace</hi> lies in the dust; the adulterer will have his queans, and the drunkard will have his cups, &amp; they will not suffer the word to plucke away their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but they will have them though they be damned for them, what doth this argue, but that sinne is their God. Nay, it is cleare, not only in palpable reason, but the Scripture is evident this way: It is the match Christ offers to the young man,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.21.22</note> if he would <hi>sell all and follow him, he should have treasure in heaven</hi>: he was covetous, and this was fayre offer for a little trash, he should have everlasting life, now the text saith, <hi>he went away sorrowfull,</hi> he would rather have his covetousnes and his wealth, then heaven.</p>

of their evill nature; I say, till then, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that ever the soule should be separate from that sinne wherein it hath found such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; therefore it is of necessity that they be parted; but before the soule seeth the venom of sinne, it will not part with it, and so he cannot come to receive the Lord Jesus Christ and hence it is, that the Lord in his infinite wisedome is thus not only willing to doe for a poore sinner, but to force him to it, for there is such love and liking to sinne; that if you pull away the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers queanes, and the drunkards pots, you had as good kill them, and they begin to say, It was well with the towne before the minister came there; the reason is, because he would have his sinne.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord is pleased to lay a heavy weight upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>oule, and to force the burthen of sinne upon it, that whereas before, the heart did finde much sweetnesse in these base courses; the Lord makes them as bitter as gall, or wormewood; And then the soule begins to reason thus with it selfe; and faith, Is it such a thing to be drunke, &amp; is it murther to envy my brother? and can none such enter into the Kingdome of heaven? &amp; when the soule seeth God taken away, &amp; heave separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him; he saith, Is this the pleasing sin that I have loved? and is this the nature of my pride to have God resist me? this lies heavy upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the heart, and at last the soule is resolved to part with his sinne and never to love it more; Good Lord, do what thou wilt with me, only take my soule and save me, and take away my lusts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21378:97"/>
The heart is content at length that Christ should doe all; and now the match is made, the sight of sinne from the punishment of it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver separate the soule from sinne, nor breake that union that is betweene them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudas</hi> had it in a great measure, and God pluckt his sweet morsels from his mouth, and made him confesse his sinnes, and take shame to himselfe; &amp; so God doth with many, and makes them say, I have beene a drunkard and an adulterer, and a desperate opposer of God and his ordinances: But though <hi>Iudas</hi> loathed the horrour &amp; punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinne, yet he had a murtherous disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion still, he that had killed Christ went and <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered</hi> himselfe too.</p>
            <p>Now from these former conclusions I reason thus, If a mans sinnes be his God, and if there cannot be two Gods in one heart, and if those corruptions of the heart must of necessity be cast out, and if the heart will not part with sinne till it be wearied with it, and that is done by godly sorro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>; then it is a matter of necessity, that the heart must be pierced; and there must be a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration betweene sinne and the soule, before Christ will marry the soule and rule in it; or else there shall be two Gods in one heart, which cannot be.</p>
            <p>The second thing in this answere is this, some may say, oh I never found this worke in me. Now therefore you must know, how ever this worke is wrought in all for the substance of it, yet in a different maner in the most. For the fashion that God useth in framing the heart is different; two


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21378:98"/>
men are <hi>pricked,</hi> the one with a pinne, the other with a speare: two men are cut, the one with a pen knife, the other with a sword: So the Lord deals kindly and gently with one soule,<note place="margin">All are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like wounded for sinne.</note> &amp; rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with another, and handles it marvelous sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and breakes it all to pieces. There is the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a thing and the breaking of it with ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; this I say the rather to checke the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that harbours in the heart of some men, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise holy and wise, (and yet mistaken in this point) they thinke the Lord never workes grace, but in this extraordinary manner.</p>
            <p>It is true, God sometime must use this affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of spirit, and when proud spirits come to grapple with the Lord, he will make their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>urdy hearts to buckle: And it is true; there must be a cleare sight of sinne and the heart must be weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the vilenesse of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As for example, First, if the person be a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous liver, and an opposer of God, and his grace, and sets himselfe against the Lord Jesus Christ; if he set his mouth against heaven and professe himselfe an enemy to God and to his truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if a man have harboured a filthy heart, and continued long in sinne, &amp; hath been a close adulterer, and continued long in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if a man have been confident in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill course.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:21378:98"/>Lastly, if God purpose to do some great workes by him.</p>
            <p>In all these foure cases he layes a heavy blow upon the heart, &amp; commonly the nature of these persons requires it.</p>
            <p>First, when any one hath beene an opposer of God and his grace, if the Lord should deale gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly with him, other vile wretches would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to say, such a man is gone to heaven, though he be thus and thus, yet the Lord dealt lovingly with him: and therefore though I continue in these courses, I shall doe well enough; Nay, (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude not thy selfe, for) the Lord will bruise him, and rend the kall of his heart, and make him seek to a faithfull minister for direction, &amp; to a poore Christian for Counsell, whom before he despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and the world shall know what it is to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose God, and to persecute his children; as he broke <hi>Pauls</hi> heart, and made him say, <hi>I am he</hi> that have persecuted the Saints.</p>
            <p>Commonly the Lord will not shew mercy to such as these are, in hugger mugger, but wil make the world see their humiliation, as they have seen their rebellion and opposition.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord deales with the secret theefe &amp; close adulterer; the Lord pluckes away their corruptions, &amp; makes them vomit up their sweet morsels, and then they will say, these are my sins, and this heart of mine is hardened by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in them: And therefore it is that the Lord workes in this manner.</p>
            <p>But if the soule be otherwise trained up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21378:99"/>
godly parents, and live under a soule-sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ministery, that saith, you cannot goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a civill course, and you cannot have any dispensation for your prophanation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; I say, if a man live under such a ministery &amp; keepe good company, the Lord may reforme this man, and cut him off from his corruptions kindly, and breake his heart secretly in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of his sinnes, and yet the world never see it.</p>
            <p>In both these we have an example, in <hi>Lydia</hi> and the <hi>Iaylor, Lydia</hi> was a sinfull woman, and God <hi>opened her eyes</hi> and <hi>melted her heart</hi> kindly,<note place="margin">Acts 16.</note> &amp; brought her to a tast of his goodnesse here, and glory hereafter. But the <hi>Iaylor</hi> was an outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, rebellious wretch, for when the <hi>Apostles</hi> were committed to prison he layed them up in stockes and whipped them sore; O saies he, now I have gotten these precise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ellowes into my hands, I wil have my penny-worths of them.</p>
            <p>Now there was much worke to bring this man home; when the <hi>Apostles</hi> were <hi>singing Psalmes</hi> there came an earth-quake which made the <hi>Prison doores to fly open</hi> and the prisoners <hi>fetters</hi> fall off, but yet the <hi>Iaylors</hi> heart would not shake, at last the Lord did shake his heart too, and he came trembling and was ready to lay violent hands upon himselfe, because he thought the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners had beene fled; but the <hi>Apostles</hi> cried to him,<note place="margin">Acts 16.30.</note> 
               <hi>Doe thy selfe no harme: for we are all here; with that he fell downe</hi> before them and said, <hi>Men and brethren, what shall I doe to be saved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:21378:99"/>I conclude this; naturally all men are locked up under infidelity, now the Lord ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s their hearts severally, you know some lockes are new and fresh, and therefore an easie key may open them, but some lockes are old and rusty, and therefore must be broken open by force of hand; so it is with some mens hearts, howsoever sin prevailes over the hearts of civill men, and they are full of pride, and the like; and yet their hearts are kept cleare fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> rusting, by restrayning grace; now the Lord will draw that man by the key of his spirit, and kindly withdraw him from his sinne. But if a man have beene an old rusty drunkard, or adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, no key can open his heart; alas, it is not a little matter will doe the deed, it is not now and then a gratious promise that will breake his heart: But the Lord must come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and breake open the doore by strong hand, by awaking his conscience, that all the countrey rings of him.</p>
            <p>You know all mens hearts are compared to stones;<note place="margin">Mans heart is like a stone.</note> some stones are soft, you may crush them to pieces with your hands, and some are flints which must have many blowes before they will breake, so it is with the heart: while it hath not beene melted and softned by humility, the Lord must breake it open by maine force, and as it is with a tree, some branches are young and smooth without knots; and some are old ones, and full of knots; now if a man come every day and give a little cut at the tender branch, at last it will off easily; but it is no cutting of an old tree with a


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21378:100"/>
pen-knife, but a man must take an axe, and give many a sore cut, that all the people in the towne may heare it.</p>
            <p>All men grow upon the root of sinne, which is <hi>Adams</hi> rebellion: some are young, and have not growne knotty in a rebellious course; every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day the Lord gives a cut at him by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and by his threatnings, and by his promises; at last it falls off kindly, and they are content to part with their sinnes, and to rest upon Christ for mercy. Another man is an old sturdy vile wretch an over-growne adulterer and drunkard, and his heart is blinded in sinne: I tell you, if ever the Lord cut off this man from his base course, hee must come with a mighty hand, and with his book of the Law: God is ever laying at his soule, blow after blow, and so at last hee begins to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his wicked courses. What (saith one) is such a man turned? hee was as heavy a persecutor as ever the Sunne saw: his father was an enemy to all goodnesse, and hee was as bad; Like father like sonne: Hath the Lord brought him home? Yes, now hee sends to the faithfull Ministers, and to Gods people for comfort and direction.</p>
            <p>The third and last part of the answer is this, That when God workes gently with Christians, they hardly perceive the worke, though wise Christians may approve that which is done; for this is certaine, wheresoever Christ is, there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was; if ever man be saved, Christ hath made him see his lost estate.</p>
            <p>Sometime the worke is secret, and the soule


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21378:100"/>
apprehends it not because it is so, and though he doe, yet it is an unknowne worke to him, hee knowes not what to make of it, he can finde in his heart to hate those and those sinfull courses, yet he cannot see how this was wrought in him: Mans spirit is such that he misjudgeth the worke; but give me a Christian that God doth please to worke upon in this extraordinary manner, and to breake his heart soundly, &amp; to throw him downe to some purpose, though it cost him deare: this man walkes with more eare and conscience, and hath more comfort comming to himselfe, and gives more glory to God, wheras the other doth but little good in his place, and hath little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort comming to him.</p>
            <p>Therefore labour for soundnes in this worke, and then for ever sound: but if once deluded here, then for ever cozened, and everlastingly damned.</p>

               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:21378:101"/>See what the Lord saith by <hi>Moses, If a man see his neighbours oxe or asse fall into distresse by the way the Lord commanded to ease him and succour him,<note place="margin">Deut. 22.1.2.3.</note> nay to lay all businesse aside, and not to hide himselfe from him.</hi>

I have knowne many such opposers of God and his Grace, that have beene forced to lay violent hands vpon themselves, and when the Lord hath gotten some of them upon their sick bed they lye roaring there; and the Lord layes his full wrath vpon them; If there be any such in this congregation, I pray God let them see some sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den veine of his vengeance, that if it be possible they may finde and feele the waight of this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conscience; that they themselves also may finde mercy from the Lord.</p>
            <p>The second part of the Vse is this; as we must pitty those thus wounded; so hereby we see the best way to send help to such as are wounded in their hearts, the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is in vaine to tell a poore wounded soule of Hawkes or Hounds, or the like: hee is not wounded in his body, but in his heart: the physicke must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the part diseased. If the head be sick or sore, you must not apply a salve to the arme; and


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21378:103"/>
if the brest be ill, you must not apply a salve to the foot: so it is a vaine thing to offer riches or pleasures, or profits, to a man that is wounded in his conscience for sin; the wound is not there: if the wound were in disquietnesse, then pleasure will cure it; if the wound were in poverty, then riches would cure him; if the wound were in basenes and contempt, then honours would cure him. No, thy heart is wounded, and the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is terrified in the apprehension of Gods wrath; And therefore apply the spiritual <hi>Balme of Gilead,</hi> even the blood of Christ: the case is cleare that all the <hi>Crosses</hi> and <hi>Crucifixes,</hi> and <hi>Agnus dei</hi> in the world, &amp; al the popish pardons can doe no good to a wounded Conscience. There is never a popish shaveling under heaven can cure a wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded soule, hee cannot apply that spirituall salve that should comfort him: hee may delude him, and lead him into the commission of sinne, but he cannot minister any true comfort unto him: thus they cure a poore Christian by searing of his conscience, and make him sinne so much the more, and neuer be troubled for sinne, as if a man should kill a sicke person, and say now he feeles no hurt, so it often fals out that a man feeles no sinne, but yet he is not cured, because his sinne is not removed, and his heart unpacified in the blood of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">

            <p>It was the guise of the old world: <hi>Haman</hi> went home sicke, because he wanted the <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>knee</hi> from <hi>Mordecay: Amnon</hi> was sicke of incest, and <hi>Ahab</hi> was sicke of covetousnesse, and <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi> was sicke because his counsell was not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; The Lord of heaven knowes, the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer is sick because he cannot get the heart and company of his queane; many a man is sicke of envy, it is rottennesse to his bones; yea many a man goeth up and downe sicke of it, and is not quiet, because he cannot vent his rage against a faithfull minister that checkes him: You swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

            <p>Secondly, It condemns such as are in a faire straine; such are they that have a slight sense of sinne; but it never goes downe to the heart, the skinne is ripled a little, but the kall of their heart was never broken for their abominations. <hi>Naaman</hi> was to wash seven times in <hi>Iordan,</hi> so this water of godly sorrow is of a healing nature, but these men doe not rubbe and reince their soules in it, they only dippe their soules in a little sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but you must wash it throughly and fully, if ever you desire to have the leprosie of sinne purged out: Men bathe their sinnes with teares, but they doe not drown them; they do as parents doe with their children, they will correct them a little, and presently cocker them againe; so the hypocrite useth to trouble his corruptions; and complaine of them and vexe them a little with sorrow; but in the meane time cocker them and dandle them againe.

            <p>O brethren it is a desperate hypocrisie, that sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which God hath appointed as a meanes to purge out sinne, should be a meanes to cover his sinne: will a few wambling teares doe the deed, and breake the heart? is this acceptable sorrow? you your selves are ashamed of this work, and do you thinke God will accept of it? No, no, it is not the rending of the garments, nor the wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the eyes, that will doe the deed, but you must breake your hearts: If you only cut off the legs or wings of a fowle, it will live for all that: so you cut off the armes or hands of sinne, but so long as the heart is not wounded, and driven to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amazement for sin, it will live with you here and in hell too.</p>
            <p>Oh doe not cozen your owne soules; it is not the teares of the eye, but the blood of the heart that your sinnes must cost, and if you come not to


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21378:106"/>
this, never thinke that your sorrow is good; and therefore you that finde your selves guilty, lay your hands upon your hearts &amp; say, Good Lord, this is my portion, the Lord knowes I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed my sinnes, and yet have taken liberty to sin: but my heart was never burthened with this evill and vilenesse of sinne; and therefore to this day I never had this true sorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> There is a third sort of sorrowers which is the worst of all, they are such as heretofore have drunke deepe of this sorrow, and have beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily strucken and yet they are grown so much the more hardened in their sinnes by all these blowes that God hath layed upon them; these are in a desperate condition, even such as God hath made howle in the congregation, yet afterwards fall into the same courses againe, and returne to their old byas, and now they can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face God and his ministers and all; and thinke it a matter of basenesse to be disquieted in heart, as they have beene: such novices and children they were once, that they could not sleepe nor be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, but now they care not what all the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters under heaven say against them; nay, they can fleare in our faces, and be drunke and vile, &amp; be never troubled for it, they have gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the skill of it, This is the most fearfull condition that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a poore creature can fall into.</p>
            <p>Thou accountest it thy glory and credit that thou canst beare all, and art metall of proofe, and no bullets can pierce thee, thou wast trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before, but now thou hast shaken it off; This


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21378:107"/>
I say is thy shame, &amp; will aggravate thy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nay, I take it to be one of the forest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens under heaven, of a gracelesse heart; If thou hast had thy conscience awakened, and hast beene troubled for sin, and now dost fly off, It is a signe of Gods high displeasure towards thee; thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest the right course, as if God had inve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted a way to destroy thy soule, as you may see in <hi>Esay, Go thy waies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 6.7.8.9.</note> saith the Lord, <hi>Speake to this people, but they shall not heare; make the heart of this people fat:</hi> as though he had said, there are a company of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in such a place; Goe thy waies to them, open their eyes, and touch their hearts, and awaken their consciences, and when thou hast done, then let their consciences be feared and fatted, and then they will goe the right way to destruction; for if they would awaken, and sorrow kindly, and repent, I must needs save them.</p>
            <p>Let these men remember that it is a heavy signe God hath forsaken them; me thinkes this should trouble their soules exceedingly, &amp; force them to cry out, I am the man that have my heart fatted, and would not be touched and converted.</p>
            <p>Now if all be true that I have said, there are but few sorrowers for sinne, therefore few saved; here we see the ground &amp; reason, why many fly off from Godlinesse, and Christianity: This is the cause; their soules were only troubled with a little hellish sorrow, but their hearts were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kindly grieved for their sinnes. If a mans arme be broken and disjoynted a little, it may grow together againe; But if it be quite broken

off, it cannot grow together; so the terrour of the Law affrighted his conscience, and a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minister unjointed his soule, and the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God were rending of him; but he was never cut off altogether: and therfore he returnes as vile, and as base, if not worse then before, and he growes more firmly to his corruptions.</p>
            <p>It is with a mans conversion, as in some mens ditching; they doe not pull up all the trees by the roots, but plash them: so when you come to have your corruptions cut off, you plash them, and do not wound your hearts kindly, and you doe not make your soules feele the burthen of sinne truly: this wil make a man grow and flourish still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever more cunningly and subtilly. This lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping professor growes more subtle in his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse: the soule that hath beene terrified for his lusts, hee is now growne a plashed adulterer, and Alehouse haunter, hee will be drunke more cunningly and secretly: and so he that hath beene an open opposer of Gods children, will now jibe and jeast at them in a corner, and when he comes amongst his old companions, then hee can vent out all his malice.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why all wicked men that were in some good way of preparation of soule, they turne their backs upon Christ; even because they were never cut off kindly from their sinnes, but only unjointed, and that is the reason why they fall to their old corruptions againe. This is the maine cause of all the hypocrisie under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: there was never any soule that made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,

            <p>This is a great point of wisedome, and sinks many a Christian, (I know what I say,) as it is with child bearing, a woman when her throwes


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21378:110"/>
come often and strong, there is some hope of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; but when her throwes goe away, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the child dies, and her life too. So it is in this great work of contrition, which is nothing else, but the child-birth of the soule; when your throwes goe away, take heed that your salvation goes not too; once you could say, the minister spake home to my heart, I remember the time full well; Why then what becomes of all your sorrow? You can be as carnal &amp; as secure as ever? it is certaine you are in child-bearing, but your throwes have left you, and your brokennesse of heart is gone, and therefore you are in an ill case, surely at some low ebbe of grace.</p>
            <p>Againe, if a mans heart be soundly broken, though he fal into some sinne, he may be recalled; but if he have not his heart soundly broken; he is undone. If the foundation be naught, the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must needes fall; So it is in this preparation of the soule for Christ, if this be naught, all comes to naught; therefore be so much the more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of your soules, because your condition is so much the more tickle in this, then in any thing else, and rather desire soundnesse then quietnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when God stirres, doe you stirre your hearts too, be you stabbed further, &amp; make the blow goe deeper, therefore wheresoever any truth goeth neere thy heart, and awakens thee, looke up to heaven, and blesse God for it, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to drive the naile home to the head, and make the salve sinke into the bottome; And let me advise you to this, when your soules are


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21378:110"/>
wrought upon by any reproofes or admonitions, take that truth, and labour to maintaine the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it upon your hearts all the weeke after; and let your soules be awed by it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, consider what thy soule findes to be most evill and detestable, whether it be poverty or disgrace, or losse of liberty; and then (marke what I say) get up thy heart higher in the very apprehension of sinne as it is sinne: and let thy soule be more affected with the vilenesse of sin, then of any other hardship whatsoever; As thus, suppose thy heart be vere proud, if shame and disgrace befal thee, oh how doth this heart shake in the apprehension of it, he can live no longer, except some honour come: Now sinne is worse then shame, therefore looke up to heaven, &amp; say, oh my heart did shake with shame, but sinne is farre worse, for, what if the Lord take away my honour, that he hath promised to such as feare his name? and what if he blot my name out of the booke of life, therefore sinne is worst of all; this is certaine, there is no evill the soule feares or finds, but sinne is the cause of it, but the separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the soule from the Lord is the greatest evil, and sinne is the cause of it, and therefore rest not till thy soule shake in the apprehension of it. This is the next way to be above punishment or any thing else.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the fruits of godly sorrow, which are from these words, <hi>They said to Peter &amp; the other Apostles, Men and brethren what shall wee do?</hi> In these words there are three things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed;


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:21378:111"/>
and three things plainly expressed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, there are three things presumed; they did see themselves in a miserable and damnable condition, as if they had said; hell is now gaping; it is but turning of the ladder, and we goe to hell for ever, <hi>Men and brethren, what shall we doe</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they themselves were ignorant, and could not direct themselves what to doe to come out of this estate, and therefore they said, <hi>Men and brethren,</hi> advise vs what to doe: if there be any help, yee know it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Yet still there is a secret kinde of hope, and the heart suspects, that it may and will be otherwise with them, they doe not say, there is nothing to bee done: no, they say, <hi>What shall we doe?</hi> surely there is some way to finde helpe, if wee could tell it.</p>
            <p>Againe, there are three things plainly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in these words; they make an open and plaine confession of their sinnes; when they were sicke at the hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, they could make open confession, and lay the hand upon the sore; and say, If there be any vile wretches under heaven, we are they.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a thorough resolution against their sinnes, and a hatred of the same, as if they had said, We are resolved to doe any thing, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is, we care not, so we may thwart our sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The last thing expressed is a sequestration of the soule from this sinne, the soule falles off from them, and bids farewell to all cursed courses.</p>
            <p>First, I come to the three things presumed;


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:21378:111"/>
and because I shall have occasion afterward to handle the two former, Therefore now I come to the last of the three, which is this, <hi>Men and brethren, What shall we doe?</hi> Surely there is some course to bee taken. Is there not? you that are <hi>Gods Prophets</hi> tell vs, if there be any hope for such poore distressed sinners as we are.</p>
            <p>So the Doctrine is this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </note> there is a secret hope of mercy, wherewith God supports the hearts of those that are truly broken hearted for their sinnes; howsoever these men did see themselves miserable, yet they did not throw off all, &amp; say, <hi>Men and brethren</hi> there is no hope for vs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will heare no more; but, seeing we must go to hell, we wil take our pleasure while we live here in the world, while we may, and if we must bee damned we will be damned for some thing; No, these people had some hope that they should finde mercy, the Lord bruised the heart, but he did not breake it; the Lord will not quench the smoking flaxe, but kindles it further, and the Lord drawes on the worke of the soule and pluckes it to himself, and makes it looke vp to him and waite vpon him for helpe and mercy.</p>
            <p>I confesse, it is true, that sometimes the soule in some desperate fit, and in some horrour of heart, when temptation growes violent &amp; long, and the distempers of a mans heart stir excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, then a man may seeme to cast of all, and resolve with <hi>Dauid</hi> when he had beene long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by <hi>Saul, I shall one day fall by the hand of Saul</hi>; So the soule sayth, God will one day leaue me,


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:21378:112"/>
and I shall perish; And as <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place,<note place="margin">Psal. 77.6.11.</note> 
               <hi>All men are lyers,</hi> that is, they sayd I shall be King of Israel, but they are all deceived; <hi>They all lyers</hi>; but it was in his haste, in a proud, impatient, haughty humour of soule.</p>
            <p>This is our nature, if God buckle not to our bow, and heare us not even when wee will; then (in a proud humor) wee are apt to say, oh my sins will never be pardoned, and I shall never get ground against my corruptions; a man that is in a swoune, lies as if he were dead, but yet he comes to himselfe againe, and lookes up and speakes; So how ever the soule in some unruly humor is driven to a swoune, and thinkes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to finde mercy, or overcome his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? yet still he recovers againe, and the soule that is truly broken for sinne,<note place="margin">Ionah. 2.4.</note> is upheld; as <hi>Ionas</hi> said, <hi>I am cast out of thy prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce, I am eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> sinking, yet will I looke towards thy holy temple</hi>; So howsoever the soule may be over-whelmed in a drunken fit of pride, or impatience; yet aftes the soule hath prayed, it saith, I will wait upon God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>God deales with poore sinnners in this case, as men doe that pound pretious powder, as Bezar stone or the like, to make some potion withall, they will breake it, and pound it all to pieces, yet they cover it up close, and will not loose the least sand of it, as they breake it, so they keepe it close that none be lost: So when God doth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to doe good to your soules, he will breake you, and melt you,; and then you thinke he hath


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:21378:112"/>
cast you off in his anger; No, no, he is pounding of you, but he will preserve those soules notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and will not lose such poore sinners whom he purposeth to doe good unto.</p>
            <p>As it is with pocket dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ls, a man may shake them this way and that way,<note place="margin">The soule hath many shakings.</note> but they are still northward by vertue of the loadstone; so there are many shakings in the soule, sometime it fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God will not be mercifull, he sometimes hopes that he will; thus it is tossed to and fro, but still it is heaven-ward, &amp; there is a hope that it may be otherwise: For the Lord holds the soule by a secret vertue to himselfe, and drawes the heart to seeke for mercy.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Prodigall</hi> child was brought to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate strait, he beganne to consider what he had done,<note place="margin">Luke 15.18.</note> whereas before he said; shall I ever be a slave in my fathers familie? but at last when all was spent, what doth he doe? he saith, It is true, I can looke for no help and favour, and I cannot tell whether my <hi>Father</hi> will receive me or no; yet <hi>my Fathers servants have bread enough, and I shall starve for hunger</hi>; O wretch that I am, I have left a kinde fathers house; yet, come what will, <hi>I will home to my father, and say, Father, I have sinned</hi>; Thus the soule thinkes with it selfe, Oh the many sweet and gratious cals that I have had! how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hath Christ come home to my heart, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired entrance? and yet I shut the doore upon him: shall I now goe home to the Lord J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:21378:113"/>
may save me, &amp; therefore I will wait upon him for mercy: thus the soule will not off from God, but it hath a secret hope wherewith the Lord keepes the heart to himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note>The first reason is, because unlesse the Lord should leave this hope in the heart, it would ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be overthrowne with despaire: You that make nothing of your loose thoughts, and vaine speeches, I tell you, if God did set but one sinfull thought upon thy heart, thy soule would sinke under it, &amp; the Lords wrath would drive thee to marvelous desperation: were it not that the Lord doth uphold thee with one hand, as he beats thee downe with the other, (I say) it were impossible but the soule should despaire, (as the proverb is,) But for hope the heart would breake, Who can stand under the Almighty hand of God, unlesse he doth uphold him: God hath broken off the sinner by this sorrow, but he will not throw him to hell: As the gardiner cuts off a graft to plant it into a new stocke, not to burne it: So the Lord cuts off a sinner from all abomination, but he wil not cast him into hell; and the Lord melts the heart of a poore sinner, but consumes him not, but as the goldsmith melts his gold, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it all away, but to make it a better vessel: So the Lord melts a poore sinner to make him a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of glory: the Lord will fire those proud hearts of yours, and clip off those knotty lusts, but if you belong to him, he will leave a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of hope, that you shall be formed and fashioned, not consumed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:21378:113"/>It is the argument of the Lord by the <hi>Prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay. 57.16.</note> 
               <hi>He will come and dwell with, and refresh the broken soule, and he will not contend for ever, lest the Spirit should faile before him:</hi> If the Lord should let in but one scattering shot of his vengeance into the heart, it were enough to drive the soule to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, but God will lay no more upon us then will doe good to us.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </note> if the Lord did not leave this hope in the heart, a mans indeavours in the use of the meanes would be altogether killed: if there be no hope of good, then there is no care of using the meanes, whereby any good may be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Good is the loadstone of all our endeavors, a man will not labour for nothing: therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire killes a mans labours, and pluckes up the root of all his indeavours. If there be any good present, hope makes us labour to encrease it, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good be to come, hope labours to attaine it: But good there must be.</p>
            <p>So hope provokes the soule to use the meanes and to say, I am a damned man, but if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope I will pray, and heare, and fast; who knowes but God may shew mercy to my poore soule?</p>
            <p>Now gather up all: if without this secret hope the heart would faile, and if without it a mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours would be utterly crusht and come to nothing, then it is no wonder that the Lord in his infinite mercy and wisedome, when he will doe good to the soule, leaveth some secret hope of mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:21378:114"/>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note>First, we may here take notice of the marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous tenderness, and the loving nature of God in dealing with poore sinners; that in al his courses of justice remembers some mercy; and in all the potion of his wrath still he drops in some cordials of comfort: he deales not with us as he might; but so, as might be most comfortable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way, and usefull to worke upon our hearts, &amp; to draw our soules home unto himself. Should the Lord come out against a poore sinner, and in his wrath let fly against him, his soule would sinke downe under him; but blessed be God, that he doth not deale with our hearts as we deserve, if he were as rigorous against us, as we have beene rebellious against him, we should sinke in sorrow and fall into despaire never to be recovered any more.</p>
            <p>But as the Lord batters us, so he releeves us; as we may see in <hi>Saul,</hi> he had gotten letters to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus,</hi> and now he hoped,<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> being generall of the field, to bind and to imprison all, and he would not spare the poore Christians a jot; but Christ meets him in the field, &amp; threw him downe, and might have killed him too: but the Lord desired rather that he might be humbled then confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I cannot read that ever he shewed his letters, but layed all flat downe before the Lord, and so was accepted; the Lord shewed him his misery, yet he lets him not perish there, but gives him a little crevise of comfort.</p>
            <p>When the Lord dealt with the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, he said, <hi>I will allure her and bring her into the

            <p>The valley of <hi>Achor</hi> is the valley of trouble, of stoning, or consternation, so the Lord doth here; he draweth the soule into the wildernesse of sorrow for sinne, but doth he leave the soule there? no, there is the doore of hope also, and there the soule shall sing as in former times. And hereupon the soule saith, there is some hope that God will do good unto me for all this; there is hope the Lord is melting me, to make me a vessel of glory: that's a gloomy night when there is neither moone nor candle to be seen: so though the soule be marvelous gloomy and heavy, yet there is some crevise of light and consolation let into the heart, still chearing and refreshing it: the Lord knowes what metall we are made of, and <hi>remembers that we are but dust,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 103.</note> therefore he so corrects us, that he may leave an inkling of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and favour in our hearts.</p>
            <p>O therefore let us admire and blesse this good God; and not quarrell with his ministers nor providence, and say, other men have comfort, and therefore why am I so troubled and disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted? how now?

            <p>As a marriner that is tost with a tempest in a darke night, when he sees no starres, he casts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and that cheares him; this hope is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of the soule, whereby it lookes out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects mercy from God: the poore soule seeth no light nor comfort, nothing but the wrath of an angry God, and he saith, God is a just God, and a jealous God, even that God whose truth I have opposed, is displeased with me, then the soule is tossed and troubled, and runnes upon the rockes of despaire, how shall the soule be supported in this condition? you will finde this true one day, therefore looke to it before: you vile drunkards are now sayling in a faire gale of pleasure, and carnall delight, but when the Lords wrath shall seaze upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> you, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he shal let in the flashes of hel fire, then you are tossed, sometimes up to heaven, now downe to hell: therefore cast anchor now, and this hope will uphold you,<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.19.</note> for this <hi>hope is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

            <p>Now I come to some other particulars that are plainly exprest in our text.</p>
            <p>First, they made a free and open confession of their sinnes, they did not stay till the <hi>Apostle</hi> went to their houses, but they went to him, and said, <hi>Men and brethren,</hi> you have spoken against the sinne of murder, and we confesse we are guilty of this sinne; they saw their sinnes and confessed them openly before the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine which ariseth from hence is this:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctrine:</hi>
               </note> When the heart is truly broken for sinne, it will be content to make open &amp; free confession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when a man is called thereunto: or thus, sound contrition brings forth bottome confession. <hi>Men and brethren, What shall we doe to be saved?</hi> as if they had said the truth is, we have heard of the feareful condition of such as have killed the Lord Jesus, and we confesse whatsoever you have said he was persecuted by us, and blasphemed by us, we are they that cryed Cucifie him, crucifie him, we would have eaten his flesh, and made dice of his bones; we plotted his death and gloried in it, these are our sinnes, and haply a thousand more


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:21378:119"/>
that then they revealed; and this is remarkable, <hi>They goe to Peter and the other Apostles,</hi> they did not goe to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed crew.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note.</hi>
               </note>Whence observe this by the way, when the soule is thus truly broken, generally it will never repaire to such as are carnall and wicked men: for these people knew that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> had their hands as deeply imbrued in Christs blood as themselves; and besides they knew them to be such naughty packes, that they would rather incourage them in their sinnes, then any way ease them and recover them from the same: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went to the <hi>Disciples,</hi> because they were holy and gratious persons, and willing to succour them; and it is certaine, that soule was never tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken for sinne, that goes for helpe to such as are guilty of the same; it is suspitious that these men goe only to stoppe the mouth of conscience, but never to have conscience awakened. You see our converts here went to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> not to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and fellow-murtherers; but this by the way only: I goe on in the former point.</p>
            <p>A broken hearted sinner knowes more by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe then any man can doe, when a man is pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with famine or drought, he will open his wants fully and freely, and so a man that is sicke and hath some heavy disease upon him, will tell of more paines and gripings then any Physitian can doe: So it is with the soule that is deadly sicke in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, they differ in the end, a broken hearted sinner confesseth his sins that he may take shame to himselfe, and glorifie God, this is the frame of the soule that truly confesseth his sins, he doth it to honour the <hi>Gospel</hi> which he hath so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, to discover the vilenesse of his person and of his sinne, that he hath so much set up; he is willingly content that the glory of it may be Gods, and the shame his owne. Consider that passage of the good <hi>Thiefe</hi> upon the <hi>Crosse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 23.40.</note> when the reprobate was going to be executed for his

            <p>So in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.16.</note> the text saith, <hi>They shall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their waies that were not good, and shall be ashamed.</hi> that is, they shall take shame to themselves, they shall not shrinke for the same; a gracious heart cannot tell what to doe to make sinne and it selfe base enough before God; that his soule and sin may fall out one with another. As in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Zacheus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 19.28.</note> whereas the confession of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hypocrite comes not so currantly off, it stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his teeth, he begins to confesse something, and then he stands; he saith something, and cals it backe againe, and is loath to take any shame for the evill committed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and therefore haply he will come when he is called, and goe away and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse nothing at all; Nay, if a minister heare any thing of him, he will hide it and tell a flat lie, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then take shame to himselfe for it; it is true, a carnall hypocrite may confesse sometimes to give the minister content, as commonly such doe; he may confesse, to get inward with a man, and to get commendations, nay, he may confesse, to sinne more freely without suspition; for charitie


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:21378:121"/>
beleeves this, that when a man hath confessed his sinne, he will never sinne in that kinde againe, nay sometimes he doth it to stop the mouth of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and therefore when conscience is full of horror, to quiet conscience and to stil the clamor thereof, he is content to reveale his sinne, that so he may have some secret peace for his sinne: thus far they differ in their ends.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they differ in their grounds: the cause and ground of a broken hearted sinner, it is from the loathsomnesse and vilenesse that the heart seeth in sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and therefore it confesseth to free it selfe from that sin, and to let out all those abominations that are so loathsome and tedious to him; as the sinner that is truly burthened is to confesse all his sinnes, so especially those that are most loathsome and secret, even those sins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the heart hath bin most estranged from God: for as before the soule did confesse sinne freely, because he was content to take shame to himself, so now he doth it to ridde himselfe of the same. Then a man feeles sinne kindly, when it goeth to the very inwards of the soule; it is in this case with a broken hearted sinner, as it is with that part of a mans body that is impostumed, or the like; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the impostume is ripe, if it be lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ced to the quicke, the very coare and all comes out; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus you see when a man is bound to confesse his sin, this is farre enough from the tyrannicall confession of that strange popish doctrine of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confession: they hold, all men are bound, whatsoever their condition be, whether their sins be pardoned or unpardoned, they are bound to confesse all their mortall sinnes, and to expect their pardon authoritatively from the Priests hand,<note place="margin">Popish confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now we bind no man upon paine to come necessarily, but if hee can get pardon from God in the use of the meanes, and get power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his corruptions, in this case we injoyne no man to confesse; but when the Saints doe come, it is not because we wil or can sel pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fit them for mercy. And this is the truth, and that our Church holds.</p>

            <p>Now for the terrour of all such gracelesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I desire to discover two things in the point. First, that this is a marvelous fearfull sinne: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is a dangerous sinne.</p>
            <p>First, me thinkes the sinne it selfe is like the sinne of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 5.3. opened.</note> hee sold all that he had, and as the Lord moved him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, he gave way to it that it should be given to the poore: But when it was sold, he kept backe one part of it: and when <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>Did you sell it for so much?</hi> Is this all the price? Yes, saith he.<note place="margin">To hide our sins, a fearefull sinne.</note> Now mark what <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy heart, that thou hast not lyed to man, but to God.</hi> Satan many times steps into the heart; but when he is said to fill the heart, he shuts out the worke of judgement and reason, and the Word, and Spirit, and all good Resolutions in those particular occasions, which concerne a man.</p>
            <p>As if Sathan should say, Knowledge shall not direct him, the Spirit shall not perswade him, &amp; the word shall not prevaile with his heart: but I will take possession of him in despite of all these; this is Sathans filling of the heart.</p>
            <p>Thus it is with the Hypocrite: his conscience is awakened, and saith, Thou must confesse thy sinnes, or else thou shalt be damned for them:


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:21378:127"/>
the word commands thee, and the Spirit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades thee to confesse thy sinne; and hereupon thou saist, This is my condition, and there is no ease nor comfort to be had in private means, and therefore I must goe to some faithfull Minister, and reveale my selfe to him: and when thou hast done, thou keepest backe halfe from him, and thou lyest against Conscience, the Word, and Spirit, and all: and when the Minister saith, Is this the bottome of thy sinne? Diddest thou not commit such and such a sinne? Oh! no; I was never guilty of any such matter: and yet thou ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. Marke what I say, this is to have Satan fill thy heart, thou givest up thy heart into the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Devill: Knowledge directs thee not, the Spirit perswades not, and the Word prevailes not; but the Devill crowds into every corner of thy heart, and thou wilt cover thy sins, and so perish for them everlastingly.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But secondly, as the sinne is vile and odious, so it is as dangerous; <hi>Hee that hideth his sinnes, shall not prosper,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28.13.</note> saith the Wiseman. Howsoever thy heart may be still for a while, yet thou shalt not prosper in thy Family, nor in the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, but all meanes are accursed to thee, thou shalt receive no<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> mercy at all: hee that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth and forsaketh his sinnes, shall finde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but he that confesseth not his sinnes, shall not finde mercy.</p>
            <p>As wee use to have a neast egge to breed upon, so it is the Devils cunning to leave a neast egge, some bosome lust or other in thy soule, and the


<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21378:127"/>
Devill sits upon this same, as upon a neast egge: and when the Devill is cast out by a slight overly confession of your sinnes, yet there is some secret lust still left in the heart, and that will breed a thousand abominations more in you. For (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you take notice of this) the Devill returnes and brings seven Devils more then himselfe, and he hatcheth seven times more uncleannesses then there was before: therefore as you desire that Satan may not fill your hearts, and as you desire to have any meanes blessed to you; come off kindly and currantly, eyther not confesse at all, or else confesse currantly, that you may finde mercy in the time of need.</p>

If the word lay any thing to his charge, he will not deny it, a man need not bring any witnesses against him: he will never seeke to cover his sinne, but if any occasionall passage of speech come, that may discover his sinne, he takes it presently, and yeelds to it, and saith, I am the man, I confesse, this is my sinne and my folly: he doth not fence his heart against the truth.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, hee must be a skilfull and able Minister of God,<note place="margin">A skillfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> one that is trained up, and is master of his Art, and so experienced, that hee may be able in some measure to finde out the nature of the disease: (Not that any Minister under heaven can be so wife and holy, as to give pardon to a poore sinner: but onely hee is able ministerially to doe it under God) Hee must be able to approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the Minister of God: hee must have the tongue of the learned, and be able to breake the heart, and prepare the soule for Christ; and then to apply the cooling promises of the Gospell to him.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, in dealing plainely with every one, though a man be his patron, or of what place or condition soever he be, if he have a proud heart he must labour to humble him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And Secondly, as he must apply a salve fitting for the sore, so he must be faithfull in keeping se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret the sinne that is laid open to him, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may fly abroad, no not after his death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in some cases.</p>
            <p>Now what remaines,<note place="margin">Motives to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse our sins.</note> but that you all be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take up this duty, and provoke your hearts freely to confesse your evill waies; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose let me give you three motives.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because it is a very honourable thing, &amp; will exceedingly promote the cause of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; you will hardly yeild to this on the sudden; a man doth thinke, that if the minister knowes his vilenesse, he will abhorre him for it.</p>
            <p>But (I assure you brethren) there is nothing that doth more set forth the honour of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and winne the love of a minister, then this. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a shame to commit sinne, but no shame


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:21378:130"/>
to confesse it upon good grounds; Nay, when the heart comes kindly off, it is admirable to see how a faithfull minister will approve of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, his love is so great towards them; O, saith the minister, it did me good to heare that man confesse so freely, I hope the Lord hath wrought kindly in him, certainely now he is in the way to life and happinesse; oh how I love him, I could even be content to put that man in my bosome.</p>
            <p>Whereas this overly, and loose dealing of yours, is loathsome to us; doe you thinke we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not? Yes, we may feele it with our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and (when you are gone, I tell you what we thinke) surely that man is an hypocrite, he hath a hollow heart, he is not willing to take shame to himselfe for his sinne, his confession never comes to the bottome.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 2.</note>Secondly, confession is a matter of great safety; I take this to be the only cause, why many a man goes troubled, and gets neither comfort in the pardon of the sinne, nor strength against it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he comes not off kindly in this worke of confession.</p>
            <p>When you doe nakedly open your sinnes to a faithfull minister, you goe out in battaile against sinne, and you have a second in the field to stand by you: but especially there is comfort in this particular, for the minister will discover the lusts and deceits, and corruptions, that you could not finde out, and he will lay open all those holds of Sathan, and that meanes of comfort that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew: I am able to speake it by experience,


<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21378:130"/>
this hath broke the necke of many a soule, even because he would goe out in single combate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sathan, and (doe what he could,) not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing himselfe to others for help, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne for ever.</p>
            <p>As it is with the impostumed part of a mans body, when a man lets out some of the corrupt matter, and so skins it, never healing it to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome; at last it cankers inwardly, and comes to a gangrene, and the part must be cut off, or else a man is in danger of his life; so when you let out some corruptions by an overly confession, but suffer some bosome lust to remaine still, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or uncleannesse, &amp;c. Then the soule cankers, and Sathan takes possession of it, and the soule is carried into fearefull abominations.</p>
            <p>Many have fallen fouly, and lived long in their sinnes, and all because they would not confesse freely; therefore as you desire to finde out the deceitfulnesse of your corruptions, confesse them from the bottome of your soules.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 3.</note> this open and free confession, may maintaine the secrecy of the soule; for the onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

our sinnes, God will cover them; if you take shame to your selves, God will honour you; but if you will not confesse your sinnes, God will breake open the doore of your hearts, and let in the light of his truth, and the convicting power of his Spirit, and make it knowen to men and Angels, to the shame of your persons for ever.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Iudas</hi> had taken notice of his sinne, and yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Christs accusation, and desired some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nference with Christ privately, (and said, Good Lord, I am that <hi>Iudas,</hi> and that hell-hound that have received mercy from thee in the outward meanes, and have been entertayned among thy people, yet it is I that have taken the thirtie <hi>pence,</hi> Lord pardon this sinne, and never let this iniquity be laid to my charge;) I doubt not but though <hi>Iudas</hi> his soule could not be saved (because that now wee know Gods decree of him) yet God would have saved him from the publike shame that was cast upon him for it: but he did not doe so, but hidde his malice in his heart, and professed great matters of love to Christ, and kissed him, and thus he thought to cover his sin wisely: but what became of that? the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to come and to indite himselfe in the high priests hall, before the temporall and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all counsell.</p>
            <p>So you that keepe your sinnes as sugar under your tongues, and will be loose, and malitious, and covetous still; well, you will have your <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pence</hi> still, and they are layed up safe, as <hi>Achans wedge of gold was</hi>; remember this, God will one

day open the clossets of your hearts, and lay you upon your death beds, and then haply yee will prove mad, and vomit up all: were it not better to confesse your sinnes to some faithfull minister now?</p>
            <p>If you will not give the Lord his glory, he will distraine for it, &amp; have it from your heart blood, as <hi>Iulian</hi> the apostata said, when the arrow was shot into his heart, he plucked it out, and cried saying, <hi>thou Galilean, thou hast overcome me,</hi> the Lord distrained for his glory, and had it out of his heart blood.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the second fruit of contrition, which is here plainly expressed, and it is this, A restlesse dislike of themselves and their sinnes: as if they had said, <hi>Men and brethren,</hi> we care not what we doe against those evils of ours, whereby the Lord hath beene so much dishonoured, and we indangered, command us what you will, we must not rest thus, so loathsome are our sinnes that we will doe any thing rather then be as we are.</p>
            <p>So from hence the doctrine is this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctrine:</hi>
               </note> The soule that is truly pierced for sinne, is carried against it with a restlesse dislike and distaste of it: or thus, Sound contrition of heart, ever brings a thorow detestation of sinne; this they professedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime before the <hi>Apostles.</hi> As if they had said thus much in more words;</p>
            <p>You say we are they that <hi>have crucified the Lord of life,</hi> and we confesse it, oh happy had it beene for us if we had never listened to the plots of the


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:21378:132"/>
               <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisies,</hi> but that which is past can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be undone or recalled.</p>
            <p>What must now be done? if we rest here, we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish forever: can nothing be done against these our sinnes, that have done so much against the Lord Jesus? we must loath ourselves, and our sinnes, and we must get out of this e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ate, or else we are undone for ever.</p>
            <p>Now for the further opening of this point, I will discover these three things.</p>
            <p>First, I will shew what a distaste and dislike this is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wherein this hatred and dislike of sinne consists.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will shew the reason, why it must be so.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the first, namely what dislike this is; for the clearing of which you must looke backe to that which I spake before of godly sorrow. For of the very same stampe and nature, is this dislike and hatred of sinne; and it is thus much in effect. First,<note place="margin">Dislike and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of sinne what it is.</note> there is a hatred in preparation, and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a hatred in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>sanctification; both are saving workes, but both are not sanctifying workes: vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a saving worke, but not a sanctifying worke: they are two distinct workes.</p>
            <p>This hatred in preparation, is that which the Lord workes upon the soule, and smites upon the soule, and thereby puts this kinde of turning into the heart; not that the heart hath any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull inward principle of grace before, (for this is the first that the Lord workes) so that as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:21378:132"/>
the soule was forced to see sinne, and to feel the burthen of it; so the heart is now brought to dislike sinne; this is a worke wrought upon the soule, rather then any thing done by the soule; the Lord is now fitting and preparing the soule for the presence of his blessed Spirit.</p>
            <p>And in this great worke of preparation the Lord workes these three things.<note place="margin">How the soule is prepared for Christ.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, he stoppes the soule from going on any longer in sinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly he wearieth the soule with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of sinne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by hatred the soule is brought to goe away from those carnall lusts and corruptions, with a secret dislike of those sinnes which he hath been wearied withall.</p>
            <p>In all these, the soule is a patient, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes the worke of humbling, and breaking, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then (it is any way) active and operative.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Thus the heart is turned away from sinne, and set against those corruptions which heretofore it was burthened with; as it is with wheels of a clocke, when the wheeles have runne wrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man can set them right againe, he must stop it, and turne it to its right place, and all these are meerly wrought upon the wheele, by the hand of the workeman; for of it selfe it hath no poise nor weight to runne right; but when the clocke-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster puts to his plummets, then it is able to runne of it selfe, though the workemans hand be not there.</p>
            <p>So the will and affections of a man which are


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:21378:133"/>
the great wheels of this curious clock of the soule these wheels do naturally of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selves run all hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and sin-ward, and devil-ward: now before the soule can receive a new principle of grace, first, the Lord unmaskes a man, and makes him come to a stand, and makes him see hell gaping for him; thus the heart is at a maze.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Lord laies the weight of sinne and corruption upon him, and that doth sincke the soule with the horrour, and vexation, and loathsomnesse of his sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, then the soule is carried away from sinne by hatred and dislike; and saith, Is this the fruit of sin that delighteth me? oh then no more malice, no more drunkennesse, thus the heart is turned away: but after the soule is once brought on to God by faith, and goes to God, &amp; receives the spirit of sanctification, (of which we shall speake afterwards) this is a new principle of life, and out of this gratious disposition the soule is now growne to hate sinne freely, and to knocke off the fingers from corruptions, and beat downe his lusts, and to love God freely; out of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of grace which the Lord hath put into the soule.</p>
            <p>Now you must know, that all this while I speake of the first worke, when the soule is turned by the spirit against his sinne, being formerly bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with the same sinne: This doth ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a heart truly broken for sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt sorrow for sinne, and hatred of sin.</note> There is this difference betweene sorrow and hatred; sorrow feeles the burthen, but hatred


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:21378:133"/>
flings it away; sorrow loosneth the heart, but hatred lets out the corruption; sorrow saith, doth sinne thus pinch the soule? and hatred saith, no more sinne then; thus the Lord by his Spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the soule.</p>
            <p>For the proofe of this point, see what the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Ezek. 30.31.</note> 
               <hi>You shall consider your waies, and your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that were not good, and shall loath your selves.</hi> A poore Christian would teare his heart in pieces in the apprehension of his owne vilenesse, and saith, Good Lord, shall I ever be plagued and annoyed with this sturdy malitious heart? and shal I ever carry this vile heart about me, that wil one day carry me to hell, if thou be not the more mercifull? this makes a man even fall out with himselfe. Againe, see what the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, for this thing you have had godly sorrow, but what hath it wrought in you? doth it worke <hi>a holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and revenge against your sinfull courses?</hi> that when thy soule seeth his filthy abominations rising, swelling, and bubling within thy heart, it takes on exceedingly, and wil scarce owne it self; but lookes away from sinne, and is weary of it selfe, in regard of the same; Nay, (if it were possible) that thou couldest be content to live without a heart, even to forgoe thy selfe, that so thou maiest not be troubled with that vile heart of thine, and so dishonour God no longer. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you observe it, when a man is brought thus farre, oh he cries to God, and saith, Lord was there ever any poore sinner thus pestered with a vile heart? Oh that this heart should ever be so


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:21378:134"/>
opposite against the Lord? Lord, except I had a better heart, I would I had none at all: thus the heart loathes it selfe, and in what measure the soule is carried with a restlesse dislike of sinne, as it is sinne, in the same degree it is most violent against those sinnes, whereby he hath most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured God;<note place="margin">Luke 19.8.</note> as you may see in <hi>Zacheus,</hi> his heart did most rise against his master sinne; so the Lord having humbled the repentant <hi>Church,</hi>

               <hi>thou shalt defile thy graven Images of silver, and the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thy golden Images, thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth, and say, get you hence.</hi> They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all sinne, but especially their Idolatrous courses; so it will be with the heart that is truly broken, he will cast away with hatred all his pleasing and profitable sinnes: thus much of the first passage.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, if the soule doth truly hate sin, then it is very willing to make search for it in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the heart.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, as the soule desires to have sinne revealed, so it desires to have sinne killed, and it makes no matter how it be killed, or by whom, so it be killed at all.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to passe, that the soule which truly hates sinne, is ever seeking to those meanes, that are most able to give strength to him, and to over come his corruptions; and is well pleased that any minister should meet with the base haunts of his heart;<note place="margin">He labours to have his sinne killed.</note> and if the word hit &amp; wound that master-sinne of his, hee is marvelous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therewith, hee cares not from whom the help comes. The sharpest and keenest reproofes, that will shake his very heart, and draw blood out of sinne, and the most powerfull deliverer of Gods word, that divides betweene the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and the bones, hee likes best.</p>
            <p>Nay, though the great Cannons roare, and


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:21378:135"/>
Gods ordinances worke mightily upon his heart; so that his corruptions may bee killed and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, hee blesseth the Lord, and saith, Blessed be the Lord, I have had a good day of it, the Lord layed battery against this wretched heart of mine; I blesse God for these reproofes and judgements threatned; my heart is in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure broken under them, I hope my corruptions have gotten their deaths wound this day.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, as hee desires to see sinne killed in himselfe,<note place="margin">He hates sin in others.</note> so hee is not able to see sinne in others, but so farre as God hath put authority and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity into his hands, he pursues it with dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indignation.</p>
            <p>As a man that hates a murderer, hee will not onely keepe him from his owne house, but hee pursues him even to the place of Justice: So the Soule that truly hates sinne, will not onely keepe sinne from his owne heart, but hee will plucke it from the hearts of others, so farre as possibly he may.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Haman</hi> had a spleene against <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai,</hi> hee was not onely desirous to kill him, but hee would kill <hi>all the nation of the Iewes,</hi> this was hatred indeed: so it is with a broken heart. If a broken hearted father have had a proud heart, and hath beene wearyed with it, hee labours to kill all the brood of those cursed distempers in his children.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Lastly, hee labours to crosse and undermine all those occasions and meanes that have given any succour to his corruptions of heart: the soule


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:21378:135"/>
hath such a secret grudge against the thriving of sinne,<note place="margin">He hates all occasions and meanes of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> that it lothes all occasions that may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his sinne: as the drunkard and adulterer hate the place where they went in to commit sinne.</p>
            <p>As in warre, haply they cannot take the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but they will drive him out of the Country, and burne downe all his Forts, and fill up all his Trenches, that hee may finde no provision: so the heart that truly hates sinne, and hath beene truly broken for it, will hate all occasions and whatsoever may be any meanes to strengthen it. Even all these proud and whorish lockes, and these Spanish cuts, &amp; all these wanton and garish attires, and light behaviours, which were nothing else but the Tent wherein his vaine filthy light heart hath lodged.</p>
            <p>Thus it was with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>: &amp; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it is so,<note place="margin">Luke 7.38.</note> is this: because the heart that hath beene broken for sinne, and burdened with the evill of it, hath now found by wofull experience, that sinne is the greatest evill of all others: and therefore (for the preservation of it selfe) it will hate that sinne which separates betweene God and the Soule, and with which the safety of the soule cannot stand.</p>
            <p>Every thing in reason desires the safety and preservation of it selfe; the soule knowes sinne to be the greatest enemy, and therefore it is most invenomed with violence against sinne, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>aith, Whence come all these miseries? and what is the mint out of which all these plagues


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:21378:136"/>
and Judgements come? Is it not my sinne? It is not povertie, it is not sicknesse, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace that pincheth mee, but my sinne first cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all these.</p>
            <p>It is the poyson of sinne in povertie, and the poyson of sinne in shame, and the wrath of God in all these by reason of my sinne. These e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills were not evill to mee, but that my sinnes make them so.</p>
            <p>Had I a heart to feare GOD, and to love him, and depend upon him, in poverty God would inrich mee, and in shame hee would honour mee, and in misery hee would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort mee: It is not povertie, nor shame, that doth hurt mee; but sinne lyes, and venomes my soule.</p>
            <p>And therefore the soule now cryes, <hi>Men and Brethren, What shall I doe</hi> to bee freed from these corruptions? Great are the evills that I have found, and marvellous are the plagues that I have felt, by reason of my sinnes: but farre worse will that portion bee, that I shall have in hell, in endlesse torments hereafter: this will bee the perfection of all misery; let it bee any thing rather then this: it is better here now to be plagued, then everlastingly damned.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:21378:136"/>I doubt not but every soule is perswaded of this,<note place="margin">

               </note> and saith, Indeed if I could finde my soule greeving within me for my rebellions, and sinnes, then I did not doubt it; but how shall I know whether my soule hath beene ever as yet truely wounded for sinne, as sinne.</p>

               </label> I answer, if thou hast this hatred, and thy heart is carried against thy sinnes with an utter indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against them, then certainely thy soule hath been truly broken; indeed, sometimes a man doth hate his sinnes, more then ever he hath been burthened with them; but thus it is commonly, if thy hatred be good, thy sorrow hath been sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; for how can thy heart goe against sinne,<note place="margin">How to know that your soules are truly broken for sin.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou have found some evill in it? and how canst thou be an enemy to corruption, except thy heart hath beene wounded with it? therefore let me advise all those that desire to have an evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of the worke of grace in their soules, to goe in secret, and examine their hearts, whether they can make hue and cry after their corruptions; can you be content that all your sinfull distempers, (even those that would affect you most) should be made knowne either in publique by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the word, or in private by some faithfull Christian? and can you be content that he should come home to your hearts, and dragge out your corruptions before the world? then you have beene wounded for sinne, and are enemies against it, (as <hi>David</hi> saith) <hi>Trie me O Lord, and examine me, and prove my heart, and my reines;</hi>

subject that lockes all the doores, and bids the officers search if there be any traitor in his house, if any one hide the traitor, he is a traitor himselfe in so doing; so <hi>David</hi> as it were sets open the doore of his heart, and saith, Good Lord, if there any wickednesse in me, yet not discovered, Lord let that word, that Spirit, and that messenger of thine, finde it out; reprove me, convince me Lord, and discover my hypocrisie, and pride of heart, This is an honest heart certainly.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when thou hast found out thy sinne by the help of the minister, then here thou must not rest; but thou huntest for the blood of thy corruptions, and thou canst not be quiet till thou seest the death of them; the soule can doe little of it selfe, but it would have the Lord doe all for it: so though thou have not sanctifying grace, &amp; hast not power of thy selfe to kill thy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet thou makest all thy friends thou hast to use all meanes to sinke thy enemies that else would sinke thee.</p>
            <p>As it is amongst men, when a man hath found his enemy, he followes the law hotly, and he will have his life or else it shall cost him a fall, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues him from one court to another, and makes all the friends that he can, that he may plague him; and if all the law in the land will doe it, he will have him hanged; this is a right hatred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; so the soule can doe little of it selfe, yet it indeavours, and makes a levy of forces, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and will not leave sin with life, it pursues sin hotly, and if all Gods words and all the promises,


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:21378:137"/>
and if the grace of Christ will doe the deed, it will not rest til it see the decay of sinne, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will even dragge sinne before the Lords tribunall, and there cry for judgement, and say, Lord kill this proud malitious heart of mine, these are thy enemies, &amp; the enemies of thy grace; Lord they sought my blood, let me have their blood; blood for blood, tooth for tooth, O let me see their destruction.</p>
            <p>The second use is a word of instruction;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> Is this contrition? and doth it bring forth such fruits? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> true broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> godly sorrow is rare in the world, and there are few that have it even amongst those that thinke themselves some body in the bosome of the Church; therefore save me a labour, and cast your eyes abroad in the world and enquire in the houses and villages where you dwell, and knocke at your neighbours hearts, and say, is there any broken hearts here? it will appeare, there are but few broken hearts here to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the professors of the Gospell; and so, few shall be saved.</p>
            <p>If this true hatred be a true evidence of broken heartednesse, what wil become of a world of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane persons, that are caried on with the pursuit of sin, from which they will not be pulcked; the drunkard will have his cups, and the adulterer his queanes, and the chapman his false weights; they are so farre from this dislike of sinne, that they hate every thing save sinne; they hate the godly magistrate that would punish them; nay, they hate the Lord himselfe, and say, it was pitty


<pb n="258" facs="tcp:21378:138"/>
there was such a law made to punish sinne, what shall we doe? let us doe any thing rather then be hindered in our pleasures; what shall we do that we may not be checked and reproved? get you downe to hell, and there you shall have elbow roome enough, there you may be as wicked and as prophane as you will, and that will be your portion, unlesse the Lord be mercifull unto you. Consider what the wise man speaks,<note place="margin">Prov. 28.29.</note> and doe not thinke, a little humbling of your soules before God, and a few prayers will serve your turne, No, no, <hi>then shall they cry</hi> (saith the text) <hi>But I will not answer,</hi>

               <hi>they shall seeke me earely, but shall not finde me, because they hated knowledge, &amp; did not seek the feare of the Lord.</hi> Oh how feareful is the doom, and how certaine is the desolation of such poore wretches!</p>
            <p>Now the Lord, for his mercies sake, settle these truthes in every one of your hearts, Amen.</p>
