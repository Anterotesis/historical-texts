            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Treatise deuided into three parts, touching the inconueniences, that the Importation of Tobacco out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hath brought into this Land. viz.</head>
            <list>
               <item>1 <hi>In the first is shewed how treasure was vsually brought into this Land.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 <hi>In the second, what hath and doth hinder the bringing of it, with other incoueniences.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 <hi>In the third, how to remedie the one, and the other.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>THe chiefe Spring from whence the mayne Current of Treasure flowing into all Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endome, hath his originall, is in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and by the Spanish gouernement is forced to set first into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and thence is deuided into all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, according to the quantitie of goods, which out of their aboundance they furnish to supply their wants: hence it followes that the Commodities of this Land, are the Mynes from whench Treasure is drawne into this Kingdome. And the meanes from whench wee vsually draw it from <hi>Spaine</hi> are these.
<pb facs="tcp:17757:2"/>
First, (our goods being conuerted into Money) Wee prouided, so many necessarie Commodities of that Land, as were sufficient to supply the wants of this Kingdome, and all the rest wee brought home in Bullion, Witnesse the Ship taken at <hi>Cales.</hi> Anno 1615. in which was supposed to be 15000 pounds in Money. It should therefore ensue that almost twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares of peaceable commerce, which wee haue had since his Maiesties Reigne, should haue repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed this Land aboundantly with Siluer, had there not beene some especiall cause to haue hindred it, but what hath stopped the entrance of it, Ile dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer.</p>
            <p>The maine decay of Trade, and the chiefe cause that hindreth the importation of Bullion out of <hi>Spaine</hi> is <hi>Tobacco,</hi> for there is consumed by all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, yearely in this Land, three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand weight, and I deuide all the <hi>Tabaccoes</hi> wee buy for this Kingdome, into three sorts and values. The best at vi. shillings the pound, the second at iii.s.vi.d. the third at ii.s.vi.d. for neere about these prizes they cost, and almost xii. pence the pound for the custome there, which is v. shillings <hi>per</hi> pound, but to speake with the least Ile say iiii. shillings <hi>per</hi> pound, so then it doth cost there, first penny Sxtie thousand pound, and the disorderly saile of our goods to buy it, hath abased the price of our commodities through all <hi>Spaine, Bisky,</hi> and <hi>Portingale,</hi> 20. <hi>per Cent.</hi> so what it doth cost, and what is lost yearely, amounteth to a hundred thousand Pounds, all which would bee brought into this Kingdome if that were not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17757:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>But who will hazzard to send home Siluer now when he may put it of by exchange, thereto the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacconists at as much profit as it is worth heere at the Mynt, for so I haue done this yeare.</p>
            <p>Now if this Weede were prohibbited, all men would stand vpon the orderly saile of their goods, &amp; not sell vnder 10 or 12. <hi>Per Cent.</hi> outward, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they haue done, when little <hi>Tobacco</hi> came out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the most part of our returnes would be in <hi>Bullion,</hi> for on that we get 12. <hi>Per Cent.</hi> and on no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commoditie, (<hi>Tobacco</hi> accepted) is any man certaine to get so much. Then who would not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring home ready money then goods, for which hee is vncertaine when to haue Money. This is the vse of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch-men,</hi> which maketh their Countries so aboundant in Siluer, for no Country is so smoakt as ours. In so much, that both <hi>Spainiards</hi> &amp; al other Nations say tauntingly to vs, when they see al our goods landed (to vse their owne words) <hi>Que todo esso se pagtaa con humo</hi>; that al that wil be paid in smoak; Now our gracious Soueraigne, knowing it to be a vitious and most pernitious weede laid great impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions on it, thereby to hinder the importation; But that brings the more damage to this State, for (except it be prohibited) our people will buy it what soeuer it cost, and the more it doth cost the more is our losse; for no sooner did his Maiestie lay an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position on it heere, but the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> laid two there, the one vpon his owne Subiects, the other on vs; But wee pay all, for they must raise it on vs; And no sooner had his Highnesse granted a Patent
<pb facs="tcp:17757:3"/>
for it heere, but forthwith the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> made it his owne Comoditie there, to no other end but to keepe vp and raise the price of it still more and more, for if they get all our goods for smoake, we neede no more misery as I thinke. To conclude this then, say our Kings Maiestie receiues Sixteene thousand pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> for the Patent of it (I doe not say he gets it) but receaues it, and of his owne goods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the Land, and not of any thing brought in by the Patentees. But I say the K. of <hi>Spaine</hi> getteth a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds <hi>per an.</hi> thereby, for the goods he hath from vs for <hi>Tobacco</hi> would cost him yearely so much if that were not. All which would bee brought into this Kingdome. And now hauing thus plainely shewed how it hinders yearely the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of a hundred thousand pounds, it of force followeth that it hath kept backe neere twelue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds, or at least a Million since his Maiesties reigne, which were it in the Land, what inestimable benefite would it bring yearely to his Maiestie, and the whole Kingdome by encrease of trade, who can rightly imagine, for mony is the soule and sinewes of trade, and a well gouerned trade, the true fountaine of treasure. But this is not all the good it hath done to <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor the preiudice it hath brought to <hi>England,</hi> which remaines to be spoken of in the next point.</p>
            <p n="3">The good then that we haue done to <hi>Spaine</hi> by buying our <hi>Tobacco</hi> from them, hath caused them since the yeare 98. to inhabite the teritories of <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes Cumana Cumanagotta Trinidado Oronoque</hi> &amp; now
<pb facs="tcp:17757:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at least all <hi>Maracaibo,</hi> for in those daies (I was an eye witnesse to it) their people went thither more vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then ours now goe to <hi>Virginia</hi> and the <hi>Summer I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> (yet the King gaue them leaue to carry &amp; recar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all things Custome-free:) but now the Case is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for if they would giue leaue to as many to goe as would, they would soone leaue few enough in <hi>Spaine.</hi> But whosoeuer goeth now, attaines vnto it by great suit and especiall licence, which will cost at least fifty pounds for each person ere he obtaine it. So sodaine did the gaine by bringing Tobacco draw so many thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And although that were the chiefe hopes, that drew them thither, yet now they bring not Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co onely but many other beneficiall and necessary Commodities, as <hi>Ginger, Hides, Sugar, Sarsaparilla, Balsam, Peeta Caraua, Gumme, Allome</hi> and <hi>Wo<gap reason="illegible: overwritten" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the King reapeth already yearely bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it at least 50000. li. and yearely it encreaseth.</p>
            <p>Now the hurt it hath done to this Land more then formerly mentioned is, that it hath altogether hindered that Plantation in <hi>Virginia,</hi> which in short time might yeeld his Maiestie as much or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, then the afore said places do to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> besides the generall good it would bring to all this Common wealth, cannot be imagined, for if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestie graunt this one Priuiledge to them, the lucre of gaine by Tobacco, will draw thither more inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in one yeere then the Company haue done with all their care and charge euer since the plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and let them once be drawne thither, they will quickely finde better Commodies then Tobacco, as
<pb facs="tcp:17757:4"/>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue done in the foresaid places, so that the only meanes were to cause importation of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> of Treasure, &amp; sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to inhabite <hi>Virginia,</hi> and to draw from thence greate benefit into this Land, is nothing but prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the bringing in of Spanish <hi>Tobacco</hi>; and suffer it only to be brought from <hi>Virginia</hi> &amp; <hi>Summer-Islands,</hi> which I presume our Soueraigne Lord the Kings Maiestie may as lawfully doe as the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> may forbid vs the importation of <hi>Pepper</hi> and <hi>silke</hi> into his Kingdome, which he hath done vnder penaltie, of losse of life and goods. Againe, <hi>Tobacco</hi> is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the groweth of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but of the <hi>Indies,</hi> with whom we haue no commerce.</p>
            <p>If any alledge that those Countries yeeldes not so good Tobacco as the <hi>Spa: Indies,</hi> I answere, there is some as good Tobacco brought from <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and the <hi>Summer Ilands,</hi> as the first Tobaccos were that we had out of <hi>Spaine.</hi> And no doubt, but as they discouering further into the Land, found better grounds for Tobacco: So will our people doe also as they goe further. But say they doe not altogether finde so good grounds as the <hi>Spa: Indies</hi> are for that purpose: must we of force therefore haue <hi>Spanish To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi> to our so great preiudice. We see their Spanish Wines are better then English Beere, shall we vtterly forsake that, and vse the other. Also we see <hi>Gascoine</hi> wines are better then <hi>Rochell</hi> wines, yet the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Rochell</hi> will not suffer their people to spend any but the grouth of their owne Vines, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of their owne people. And these Countries of
<pb facs="tcp:17757:4"/>
               <hi>Spaine</hi> that haue Wines of their owne growing, will not suffer any other to come in, be theirs neuer so bad and the other neuer so good, till their owne prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be spent: and be they so carefull for their owne Conseruation, and shall we be so carelesse of ours: Nay, God forbid, I hope better Order will bee taken by his Maiestie, and this most Honourable assembly. It may be some man seeing this, will thinke, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terressed in the <hi>Virginia</hi> Company: But the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull of the Company know the contrary. Its the zeale I beare to the good of the State in generall that makes me speake. If so what I point at take effect, I shal be most glad, although to my own preiudice, for till it be forbidden I will trade in it, and make no question but to get by it as well as any other man, But I defie the perticular gaines that brings a generall hurt. And thus I haue shewed what hinders the importation of Treasure. To conclude this point, Shut the gates of entrance of Tobacco, and you open the gate for the entry of Treasure: but open the gate for the entry of Tobacco, and you shut the gate of the entrance of Treasure.</p>
