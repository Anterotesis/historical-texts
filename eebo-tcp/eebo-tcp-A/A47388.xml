            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

|ving found your Printed <hi>Proposals,</hi> amongst many others; which, comparing with Yours, I find Yours <hi>Metamorphosed,</hi> (but not <hi>Mended)</hi> in almost all their Designs: And I must Infinitely blame You, for not Reprinting your <hi>Proposals,</hi> with the Additions we discoursed of lately; this being a fit Time, when the whole Nation has approved of <hi>Banks,</hi> and the Currency of <hi>Credit,</hi> and the Usefulness thereof, as well as the Necessity our <hi>Coyn</hi> has brought us to.</p>

            <p n="5">V. You tell me, your Security is not only Greater than any of the other <hi>Banks,</hi> but greater than any in the known World; and a hundred times more Security, than would be Necessary, or demanded; Pray shew me, how that can be?</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> I desire your Leave to Reprint your <hi>Proposals,</hi> with the <hi>Additions,</hi> if you will not do it your self; and you will extreamly Oblige,</p>

One</hi> Objection <hi>is this,</hi> This would be too Easy. <hi>Another asks,</hi> How will Men, in Power, be able to Impose on the King, and the People, if this were set on foot? <hi>I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I did not imagine, a</hi> Bride <hi>could be too Handsom, or her Portion too well Paid.</hi>

               <hi>I do confess I see my</hi> PROPOSALS Metamorphosed <hi>in many others, but not</hi> Mended; <hi>I will not exclaim against their Industry, who, seeing my</hi> Proposals <hi>have no Effect, have made</hi> Proposals <hi>for their own private Advantage; But, in my Opinion, very dangerous to the</hi> Government: <hi>For, if they succeed, so great Power and Riches will accrue to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, or Governours, that they will become our Masters: We must</hi> Vote, Elect, <hi>and</hi> Choose, <hi>as they please; or they will</hi> Call <hi>in, and allow no Prolongation, but</hi> Enter <hi>and</hi> Seize.</p>

            <p>I Put this Design in Writing, at the Request of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral considerable <hi>Members</hi> of both <hi>Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. when a War was voted against <hi>France;</hi> but a Peace being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, no Money was given; and since that, I have had no Opportunity to do my Country the Service I design'd by this <hi>Proposal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the general Approbation this <hi>Paper</hi> had from all that saw it, in Three several <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and very many considerable <hi>Members</hi> having declar'd, that they could not couch any one Rational <hi>Objection</hi> against what I here hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offer; I have thought fit, in this juncture of Time, to Revive this Design; and most humbly refer it to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>KING,</hi> and both <hi>Houses of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I have not the Nomination of the Sums now to be given to the <hi>Crown,</hi> so I shall only suppose a Sum of Two Millions; but the Case will hold on all Occasions, of the same Nature.</p>
            <p>I humbly beg Pardon, if I am plain and short; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to Eloquence; I shall first set down what I would have done, and then shew what Advantage this Nation will reap by so doing: Lastly, I will Answer all <hi>Objections</hi> that have hitherto been made, and shall be ready to Answer any <hi>Objection</hi> that may hereafter be made.</p>
            <p>I cannot vary from my <hi>first Proposals;</hi> but have added something on Sir <hi>James Sheene</hi>'s Letter and Approbation.</p>

Counterfeiting of these Bonds must also be made Capital; altho' I know, 'tis impossible to Counterseit the Bonds, which must be made on a Marbled, or Flourish'd Paper, fairly Tallied and Registred in the Office-Books, where the Counterparts must be kept.</p>
               <p>☞ On this <hi>Paragraph</hi> depends the whole <hi>Proposals,</hi> the <hi>Objections,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Sheene</hi>'s Questions: This causes the Bills, or Tallies, to be a new <hi>Specy</hi> of Money, supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Money, made of Gold or Silver: This makes the Security a hundred times more than ever was proposed or given; because all the Revenues of the <hi>Crown,</hi> all our Trade and Consumption, is Security, as well as the Taxes, set to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95985:5"/>
pay the Principal and Interest, and Charges; which Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is far more than I have said, of a hundred times more than was ever given: This unites the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> by the strongest Bonds; I mean, their Interest, to support each other: And it was an Argument for the <hi>Million-Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> That it would oblige so many Families to be Friends to this <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I propose the Bonds on Marbled Paper, because less Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome, and easiest to Register, and turn'd to their <hi>Folio;</hi> else a Tally of Wood, or Mettal, is as good.</p>
               <p>Now, I ask, If all our late Tallies had been made Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by a Law, how would our ill-affected, and our Money-Mongers, have imposed on the necessitous; who have been forced to sell at vast Loss, and intollerable Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Buyers?</p>
               <p>Consider the vast Loss our Trade has had of late, by This, and the <hi>Bank-Bills,</hi> and what People have suffer'd for want of their Money: How impudently have Men been refused their own Money, payable on Demand; not that it is possible, that the Nation wants Money, or <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> to Circulate our Trade.</p>
               <p>Many cry out, That our Money, and <hi>Bullion,</hi> is Export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, never to return; I wish our Knavery, Usury, Factions, and Self-Interest, were Exported; and am confident, these <hi>Proposals</hi> will send away a great part of these Destroyers of the Publick Welfare; a worse People than our <hi>Coyners, Clippers,</hi> or <hi>Robbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pray, Is not a <hi>Government</hi> oblig'd to make Laws for the Publick Good? And, do we not daily desire the Increase of Trade? Ought not a <hi>Government</hi> to oblige the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to do what is for their Advantage? Who will not force a Mad Man to be let Blood, and take wholsome Medicines? Is not the Nation in a Distraction about their Money and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95985:6"/>
Credit? Is not this Method a Wholsome, Secure, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Cure for this National Distemper? Why then should not the <hi>Government</hi> oblige Men to take this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Currant Credit,</hi> grounded on so Solid, and so great a Security, and so generally Advantagious?</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <hi>XV.</hi> It must also be made Capital for the Office to make any Use, or Private Advantage of the Publick Cash; and they must order it so, as to have a good Cash, because many times the Tax may not be paid in, time enough; it may be, a Month or two later than the Interest is due.</p>
               <p>And a considerable <hi>Cash</hi> may be kept, to answer <hi>Foreign Bills,</hi> if ready Money be requir'd: This I add, to answer a <hi>Noble Lord</hi>'s Objection: But, suppose these Bonds, or Bills, will not pay <hi>Foreign Bills,</hi> I shall make Use of a Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Dr. <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> viz. <hi>That a Stage-Coach is a good Convenience to a Man, to go to</hi> York; <hi>yet that Coach can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not set another Man down at</hi> Exeter. And what is hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter added, will bring in <hi>Cash</hi> enough, to answer any <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bills;</hi> besides, how will the <hi>Bills</hi> be paid, without this <hi>Proposal,</hi> which must, of necessity, make <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Coyn</hi> free and common in the Nation?</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <hi>XVI.</hi> These Bonds being thus made Currant, and Grounded on a Law, and the Security of the whole <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> they will not only be of an Intrinsic Value, equal with Gold and Silver, but superior to either; and of the same Consequence, as if so much Money were Imported, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this Nation, to Trade with.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <hi>XVII.</hi> I say, these Bonds will be superior to Gold or Silver, because these Bonds cannot be Counterfeited, Lost, Stoln, or Burnt, without Recovery; they will be a new <hi>Speices</hi> of Money, that will grow in our Coffers, every day increasing; which Gold nor Silver does not, but is liable to many Inconveniencies; as Thieves, False and Clipp'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95985:6"/>
Money, Counterfeiting, Loss of Time in Counting, and Chargeable to carry in large Sums.</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <hi>XVIII.</hi> These Bonds will soon become our best Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Coyn, for every one will covet them; nor will any scruple to fetch their Payments at the Office, more than now they do fetch their Money at the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> or <hi>Lombard-street;</hi> and the Bonds must be transferr'd at the Office, because the Counterparts are kept there; the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice becomes Witness to the Payments, and avoids Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes at Law.</p>
               <p n="19">
                  <hi>XIX.</hi> All Mankind must confess, That Credit grounded on a good and solid Security, if it can be made currant, is not only as good, but better than Money it self; for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney does no Man good, until he has disposed of it for good Security: And I desire to know what Security can be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd so great, and of so Intrinsic a Value, as these Bonds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> There is no end of Security, as long as there is a <hi>Fund</hi> to support it; it runs <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be overburthen'd with it; for it stops when there is no Occasion for it.</p>

               <p>Thus then at Twelve Months end the Interest &amp; Charges of the Office will be paid, and there will be 170000 <hi>l.</hi> in Cash; out of which may be paid 150000 <hi>l.</hi> of the Bonds, and keep 20000 <hi>l.</hi> in Cash, and for the future Pay off Part of the Debt, proportionable every Six Months, keeping still

BY this means the <hi>Crown</hi> receives the entire Sums of <hi>Money,</hi> given by the <hi>Parliaments;</hi> and the <hi>Crown</hi> has the <hi>Money</hi> immediately, without staying till the Taxes come in, or being oblig'd to take up <hi>Money,</hi> or buy Stores at hard Rates, and paying by uncertain Assignments; so that, part by the raising and collecting the Taxes, part by taking up Money, and buying Goods on Credit; This will save very near one Third Part of what is given by the <hi>Nation;</hi> besides the great Disappointments our Kings have met with by Delays, and the Nation also; who expect from the <hi>Crown</hi> the same thing, as if the <hi>Crown</hi> had the whole Sums given, and in due time.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> The <hi>Crown</hi> will buy all Stores, at least, 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> cheaper than usually; for Men will prefer these Bonds before any Assignments, or Money it self; because these Bonds will increase in their Coffers, and are not lyable to a Postpone.

                  <hi>III.</hi> This Currant Credit will do the duty of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and is the same thing in all respects, as so much Money, Imported and Distributed, and added to the general Stock of the Nation; which will increase our Trade proportionably, as the <hi>Crown</hi> will soon find, by the Increase of the Revenue; for we have not <hi>Seven Millions</hi> in Money, to support our Trade, and Consumption; and by adding Two or more Millions of this currant Credit, we add proportionably to our Trade and Consumption.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> These Bonds will produce a double Gain to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; first, by drawing out the Money, which lies dead for want of Security; secondly, Men will Trade with these Bonds, or draw the Interest, which makes the Bonds daily of more Value, altho' they lie dead in their Coffers.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Paragraph</hi> ought to be well consider'd; It shews great Advantages.</p>
               <p n="6">

                  <pb facs="tcp:95985:8"/>
                  <hi>VII.</hi> Our Retailers, into whose Hands paseth the greatest part of our currant Cash, will Change or Buy these Bonds, as soon as they have but 5 or 10 <hi>l.</hi> in their Shops; for they let such Sums lie by them, till they have a Stock, either to pay a Debt, or go to Market, which they may as well do with these Bonds; by which they will gain more in the Interest, than their Share of the Tax will come to; therefore they'll pay Taxes with Joy.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <hi>VIII.</hi> These Bonds (like Money) will pass thro' five or six Hundred Hands in the Year, every Trade gaining 10 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> as they must needs do, or they cannot subsist; because most Traders pay <hi>6l. per Cent.</hi> for the Money they Trade with. Now, I will suppose these Bonds, the one with the other, pass thro' forty Hands only in a Year, every Trader gaining but 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> then every 100 <hi>l.</hi> in these Bonds produce 200 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> gains to the <hi>Nation,</hi> as long as they are standing out.

                  <hi>Note,</hi> This <hi>Nation</hi> would soon be weary of paying a yearly Tax, to support a Years War; and it is easier to pay 20 <hi>s.</hi> a Year, for twenty Years successively, than to pay down 20 <hi>l.</hi> at once: Now, by this Method, the Taxes will not be felt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they last many Years; and, if requir'd, I could name Taxes, that would scarce be felt.</p>
               <p>Thus far, this may be accounted a <hi>Cantore,</hi> like that of the <hi>States-General.</hi>
               </p>

               <head>A <hi>Clause</hi> may be added to the <hi>Act,</hi> Declaring,</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Office may issue out Bills to any Person, on Lands, Houses, Ground-Rents, Merchants Goods, or any thing that is a good Security, at</hi> per Cent. <hi>and Redeem the same by Parcels, in equal Sums; the Merchancs paying Warehouse-Room for Bulky Goods, with Money, or Office-Bills, which must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Office to be oblig'd to impart no Man's Concerns to any other Person, unless the Party concern'd desire it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this; Men will be free from the Charges of <hi>Procuration,</hi> and <hi>Prolongation-</hi>Money; and, by redeeming by Parcels, it will be more easie; and a great Help to the Borrowers.</p>
               <p>Now, we need not fear too many Bills will be standing out; because, if not necessary, they will not be issued out; and if necessary, the Necessitous ought to be helped; and, as fast as they Redeem, so much of the Office-Bonds will be cancell'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> This <hi>Addition</hi> makes this Office different from a <hi>Cantore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Act</hi> may further declare,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a distinct Appartment, in this Office, shall be fitted; where all Merchants, and Others, may lodge their Cash, as in the Public, or Private Banks; Provision being made, by the Act, for the Security of such as lodge their Cash there, against any Objections of our Criticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this being under the Security of the <hi>Government,</hi> Men will not be lyable to such Losses, as has been by <hi>Private Banks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Credit, thus Establish'd, will of necessity make Money more Plentiful, and Common amongst us.</p>
               <p>As it is not my Part, to write how much must be raised, or advise how; I shall on'y set down some Things, and the Sums Blank.

               <head>OBJECTIONS Answer'd.</head>
               <p>Obj. I. <hi>THIS is a new Project; and</hi> England <hi>has long been a Glorious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on, without this Proposal; and new Methods will not be easie,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This <hi>Objector</hi> should then wear a Ruff and Trowses, in lieu of Rowling-Breeches, and a Cravat, which his Great Grandfather never wore; and, that we have now alter'd our Habit, is, because the Habit we now wear, is easier than formerly were worn: Nay, a Government is alterable, when not easie; and alter'd for the Better.</p>
               <p>Obj. II. <hi>Some think this Credit will lessen the Value of Houses and Lands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> These <hi>Objectors</hi> allow then the Credit to be good, and better than Houses or Lands.</p>
               <p>Let these Men make the Titles of their Lands and Houses to be Clear and Good, then this Credit will do them no harm, but the contrary; if we have more Trade and Credit, Men will become more able to buy Lands and Houses, which are always preferrable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holland</hi> has vast Sums standing out in Obligations, or Bonds, transferrable, but Currant; yet so valuable, that I have sold them in <hi>London,</hi> at 6¼ <hi>per Cent.</hi> and this does not hinder Lands to be at 40 and 50 Years purchase: And it was this kind of Credit, or Obligations, that raised that State, and supported it.</p>
               <p>Obj. III. <hi>How secure us against the Misfortune of the Bankers, or a Strong Hand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Bankers Money was in the <hi>Exchecquer;</hi> These Bonds will be in the Hands and Possession of the People: And I have already said, the <hi>Crown</hi> may as easily call back the Money, paid out of the <hi>Exchecquer,</hi> as stop what is paid out for Money, and made currant by a Law. Secondly, The Office will have little in it, worth seizing; and we may as well fear the Plundering of <hi>Lombard-street,</hi> or the City.</p>
               <p>Obj. IV. <hi>We shall have nothing but Paper-Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If it does the same Duty, it is as good. By adding this Currant Credit, we do not Banish Gold nor Silver, but make it more Free and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongst us; and Men will rather hoard up these Bonds than Money, because this <hi>Species</hi> increaseth in their Coffers.</p>
               <p>Obj. V. My own Objection is, <hi>That Men will hoard up these Bond<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Best and Securest-Treasure, and so spoil my Design of making them run in Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, if they do, they must purchase them with Money or Goods; which then will turn to the same Account.</p>
