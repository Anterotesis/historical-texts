            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Abuſes diſcovered, whereby the Creditors are meerly cheated, the Officers of Law, and Goalers are unjuſtly inriched, and the poor Debter and their families Tyrannically deſtroyed.</head>
            <p>AMongſt many the Conſiderations I have had of the oppreſſions common amongſt men, this hath ſeemed to me none of the leaſt, That one man is ſuffered to devour another, and that by colour of Juſtice, as in the caſe of Arreſts of mens perſons by colour or debts, before Judgement, or Legal conviction. And hearing of your pious endeavours to beget a Law for Redreſs of ſuch heavie Oppreſſions and Cruelties now uſed in that kind, and the Reforming the Ancient Common Law of England in that particular, Do in my Zeal and Senſe of other mens Sufferings (and that divers times very unjuſtly) repreſent to your view ſome former Collections of mine, of the many inconveniences which attend ſuch Reſtraints, before it doth appear that there is a cleer and juſt Debt.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place therefore, I take the Law to have bin fundamentally, That no mans perſon was lyable to Arreſt at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law for Debt, no not upon Execution; which you may ſee 13. <hi>H.</hi> 4. Fol. 5. That the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Cap. 17. was the firſt Law that ſubjected the Perſon to Arreſt, in caſe of Debt, the Proceſs before that Law, being <hi>Summons,</hi> and <hi>Capias</hi> againſt the Lands.</p>
            <list>
               <head>The Abuſes and Oppreſſions introduced ſince that Law, and under pretenſe of Juſtice, are numberleſs.</head>
               <item>1. That many have bin, and are daylie Arreſted upon feigned Accounts, where no debt is due at Law: And this is a common thing in London; and other Corporations.</item>
               <item>2. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon Specialties for Debt forged and feigned.</item>
               <item>3. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon Sleeping Specialties, that have long before bin diſcharged, but the Bond not given in, nor cancelled, as they ought; which daylie experience ſheweth upon Bills in Equity for relief in that particular.</item>
               <item>4. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon Specialties loſt or miſcarryed, and come to the hand of Strangers, who feignedly take Adminiſtration.</item>
               <item>5. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon pretended Debts and Promiſes.</item>
               <item>6. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon Accounts for 1000. l. whereas the debt is not an hundred.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Vpon all which, or any of the ſaid Accounts, the party that is arreſted muſt be anſwerable to the Action, be the debt never ſo ſmall true, or falſe, and muſt therefore ly in Priſon until he put in bayl: which if in a Corporation, or otherwhere, will be hard for the party Arreſted to procure, if not impoſſible, without troubling his Security for the ſame debt, binding his hands, to free his heels. Beſides, the charge of his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> in ſuch caſes, to remove himſelf, and put in Bayl above; when as all this while it doth not Judicially appear whether the party arreſted be really indebted or not.</p>
            <p>By this means, the Law, (which truly was intended for Redreſs) becomes the deſtruction and ruine of thouſands of Families; and the ſupport and maintenance of under-Sheriffs, Sergeants, Bayliffs, Goalers, and Catch-poles; the latter of which feed upon the miſeries of honeſt men, or grow rich out of others ruines, and the Debtor thereby more diſabled to pay his juſt debts. And M. <hi>Horn</hi> in his Mirror of Juſtice ſaith, <hi>That by ſuch Writs many are destroyed wrongfully:</hi> Fol. 233. <hi>a.</hi> And Fol. 64. <hi>b.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law of this Kingdom was, That no Judge was to hear the Plaintiffe in his cauſe, if he did not first put Sureties to anſwer his Adverſaries full damages if he complained of him wrongfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Ancient proceedings in Chancery was, that the Complainant upon exhibiting his Bill, was to enter Bond to prove the Surmiſe thereof; otherwiſe the Defendant was not compealable to anſwer the ſame.</p>
            <p>Men are in danger of Arreſt ſeveral waies and means. <hi>By Latitat out of the Kings Bench into any County. By</hi> Capias <hi>upon Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in the Common Pleas. By</hi> Capias <hi>upon the Exchequer. By Bill upon the Exchequer. By Bill of Middleſex. By Sergeants of the Mace, in Corporations, Towns, and Cities. By Bayliffs of Liberties. By Writs of Priviledges, in nature of Muchmen out of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</hi> So that the Poor Debtor, nay the non-Debtor, <hi>eſt undique circumventus.</hi>

The Judges Fee is (as I take it) 15. s. 4. d. and how many hundred there be of theſe in a yeer, may be gathered.</p>
                  <p>If by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> the Priſoner be removed out of the Country Priſons, then it will be chargeable to him; 10, 20, 40. l. and according to the diſtance of the place from whence he is brought up to London.</p>
                  <p>Added to theſe, the Fees of Goalers, Keepers of Priſons, and Turn-keys, the Marſhal of the Marſhalſie of the upper Bench, and Warden of the Fleet Fees, according to the ſeveral qualities of the Perſons.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I have known when many poor people have bin put to 10. s. for a ſuppoſed debt of 3. s. 4. d. or a treſpaſs of that value, being Arreſted in the Country 120. miles hence, by a <hi>Latitat,</hi> to draw a Compoſition, which rather then the poor man will travel to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to anſwer the Suit, ſubmits unto: and this is the ordinary uſe of Atturneys, which get by it 8. s. 4. d. or thereabout, although the Action might be tryed either in the Court Baron of the Manour, or Countrey Court, for two ſhillings ſix pence Charge.</p>
            <p>So that in Fees to Judges, Lawyers, Atturneys, Clerks; and others, and by the oppreſſion and extortion of Bayliffs, Sergeants of the Mace, and of Liberties, Goalers and Catch-poles, there is exhauſted 30000. l. <hi>per annum</hi> at the leaſt, out of the eſtates of Debtors,<note place="margin">You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Act this Parl. for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the High Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary Courts, which was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom to the Subject, in extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fees, 10000. <hi>per annum.</hi>
               </note> and  poor Priſoners, not a penny of their debts payed, their eſtates ruined, and their perſons diſabled for ever, which certainly was never the intent of that Statute, to undermine the common Law, which had mans liberty in ſo light an eſteem, as if it were not lyable to Arreſt for debt.</p>

And what extorted by Goalers, Sergeant of the Mace, in Corporations, by Clerks, and other Officers of the Country, in London, and throughout the Kingdom? And all this out of the livelyhoods, fortunes, and eſtates, of men in a miſerable and wanting condition.
