         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

cauſeth to grow up Trees, Herbs, &amp; infinite

<pb facs="tcp:53223:3"/>
bountifulneſs of the great Lord &amp; Creator
towards his Creatures, naturally and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

the things growing out of the Earth, he
nouriſheth, ſuſtaineth and maintaineth our

exceeding pleaſure to ſee the Trees
and Herbs at certain times to ſpring out of
the boſom and womb of their tender &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Nurſe. To be brief, we learn there
what manner of life we ought to live, as
not to be idle, but to incraaſe that which is
ours; to contemn daintineſs, pleaſures,
ambition, and ſuch other vanities; and let
us imitate the lives of our Fore-fathers; as
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who delighted in the life of
a Shepherd; <hi>Saul,</hi> in keeping of Aſſes;
<hi>David,</hi> in keeping of Sheep; and both of

our Fore-fathers, even ſuch as are

Labourers; and afterwards by God taken
from the Plow, the Cart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Feeding

Calling: This Country life being
not only more holy, innocent, and juſt,
but alſo more pleaſing and acceptable
unto God, and that which receiveth more
bleſſing than any other from him. But let us
paſs over the Sacred Hiſtories, and give me
leave (following the Proverb, which ſaith,
<hi>We muſt learn the manners of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
and practice according to the
preſent age</hi>) to lay out unto you the wayes
how a good Houſe-wife (as to thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
things belonging to her Charge) ſhall
Order and Govern a Farm, as that it may
keep and maintain with the Profit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
thereof, her Husband, and all his
Family, which ſhall be hereafter declared
in this Tract of <hi>The Office of the good
Houſe-wife;</hi> who muſt not forget, that
Woman was made for a helper, and that
<pb facs="tcp:53223:4"/>
God doth call her to her task, which doth
not conſist of a few or baſe things, but of
many and the principal matters; Yea, and
the Cure &amp; Charge of the Families health.
But leaving to ſpeak any more of her charge
in particular; I could wiſh her to be wiſe,
according to Sobriety &amp; Gravity; So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
in not meddling above her place
or reach in matters of Phyſick; and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
in not having to do in the matter
of Peaks and Paints, either for uſing
or preparing them; for they argue, if
not plainly prove, a light, a looſe, and
very ſinful life. And thus good Women,
having commended unto you, ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
as is both delightful and Profitable,
(I leave you,) hoping you will practice it

            <head>THE
OFFICE
Of the
Good Houſewife.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ADam</hi> our firſt Father was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in a Champion ground (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was Created, and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
of the Earth, of the field
of <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) to ſerve his Creator; and
to the end, that all his actions might
redound to the glory of his Soveraign
Lord, not to toil in it with pain, and
grief, which ſhortly after were laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53223:5"/>
him, and his poſterity. This is the
reaſon why the old Writers have call'd
the Husband-mans Trade, the life of
Liberty, and Innocency; for in truth,
of all Arts, which reſpect either the
profit, or health of man, Husbandry is
the chief; for beſides the nouriſhment
it affordeth, it alſo hath a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Trade, with the Earth; the
common Nurſe of all men, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and maintaining the powers of our
bodies, and cauſing us to live more
healthfully, and a longer time, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
abundantly our Poſterities; as
may be inſtanced in the ſtory of <hi>Noah</hi>
(writ by <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi>) who with his
Family coming out of the Ark upon
the top of the Mount <hi>Cordicus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into the plain at the foot of
the Mountain, in which, <hi>Noah</hi> erected
a Pillar; and upon this occaſion, ever
after it was called, <hi>The place of</hi> Noah's
<hi>coming forth of the Ark,</hi> and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by him and his Family; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53223:5"/>
the World in ſuch fruitful
manner, as that <hi>Ninus</hi> in <hi>Noah's</hi> life
time, was able, and did leavy an Army
of Seventeen hundred thouſand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Two hundred thouſand horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
beſides Ten thouſand and ſix
hundred Charriots, or thereabouts.
Much to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Beroſus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
That in the ſpace of 100 years,
theſe Husband-men did increaſe ſo
abundantly. That <hi>Noah</hi> One hundred
years after the Flood (even when <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck</hi>
was born) was conſtrained to ſend
<hi>Sem</hi> into <hi>Aſia, Cham</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
<hi>Africk,</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> (whom men call
<hi>Atlas Maurus,</hi> becauſe he dyed in
<hi>Mauritania</hi>) into <hi>Europe,</hi> all of them
to perform the duty of husbanding the
Earth, their natural Nurſe, and to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
thoſe their great multitudes of
people, which <hi>Scithia</hi> could no longer
contain; Moreover, the plentifulneſs
and number of ſuch as have led the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-mans
life, and exerciſed Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53223:6"/>
hath been always greater, and their
works more excellent than any others
whatſoever. <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, that there
is no life, or manner of living more free,
and more worthy a virtuous man, than
the Husband-mans life; and howſoever
it be, that every man in all things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
after his own commodity, and
frameth himſelf to come as near to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and excellency as poſſibly he
can; Yet the well-inſtructed and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
houſholder contenteth himſelf with
that, whatſoever it be, that cometh of
the hand and grace of God, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
for great bountifulneſs and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſuch portion as falleth unto him.
So then we are to hold our ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with ſuch eſtate and condition, as
the place ſhall afford where we muſt
dwell and ſettle our habitation; and if
it be not ſuch as ſome curious man in
his deſire, or one that is hard to pleaſe,
might require and look for, then we
ſhould ſtrain our ſelves to mend it by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53223:6"/>
our induſtry, and the means ſet down
by many famous writers on this ſubject.
And now having roved thus far; I
come to the owner of the Farm, who I
wiſh and deſire may be a man of great
knowledge, well acquainted, and given
to matters of Husbandry; for whoſo
is ignorant of them, having had but
ſmall practice therein; as alſo he which
doth take his chiefeſt delight in other
things, and ſpendeth his time other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
muſt of neceſſity commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the mercy and diſcretion of a
Farmer, which will mock him to his
face, and will impair his Grounds and
Houſe alſo, heaping thereto a world of
quarrels and ſuits, which he will raiſe;
or elſe he muſt truſt to ſome other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſher
of the buſineſs, either in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning,
or waiting and attending, and
he asking councel of other the Farmers
there-abouts; they will make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
things not to be ſo good by half as
they are; and indeed we read for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53223:7"/>
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories, that the
Earth was never ſo fruitful, as when it
was allured and won by the induſtry of
the famous <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of the tyranous handling of
groſs-headed Peaſants, whom we ſee
before our eyes, (notwithſtanding that
they are altogether ignorant) to grow
rich at our coſts and charges, and to the
great ſpoil of the Ground which they
husband and till; there is nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to the over-looking eye of a
prudent and diſcreet Owner, and one
that is accuſtomed to Husbandry, who
looketh after, and contenteth himſelf
with ſuch eſtate as may ſtand with his
profit, let him learn well to know &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the natures and choice of men,
cattle and grounds, and let not that
work happen, which he himſelf knows
not how to do if he ſhould ſtand in need,
or elſe to give directions in, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
unto others; at leaſt let him
underſtand the times and ſeaſons when,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53223:7"/>
as alſo the manner how things were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to be done; For the owner
of a Farm that underſtandeth not, ſhall
never know well what to command, and
doth nothing but trouble and vex the
workmen; and it is the manner of men
to mock at ſuch as command and will
ſuch things to be done, as are nothing
to the purpoſe, but muſt afterwards be
undone again, or elſe abide without any
profit. Let the Owner of the Farm
make his abode upon his own Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
let him have a back Gate, that
he may withdraw himſelf from home,
and ſecretly return again when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
and this will keep his People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in doing of their offices and
charge; let him not go to ſee the town
unleſs it be upon his earneſt affairs; and
let him commit his Suits to be followed
[which without great loſs he cannot let
paſs] by ſome faithful Attourney, to
whom he ſhall intruſt nothing but the
only counterpain of his evidence; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53223:8"/>
being in the Town, let him not go to
ſee any man therein, except it be in
Winter, or at ſuch time as his Harveſt
is in, and his Seed-time diſpatcht; to
the end that by one and the ſame means
he may attend upon his Cauſes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
and go about the getting in
of his Debts. I wiſh further, that he
carry himſelf pleaſant and courteous to
his folk, not commanding them any
thing in his choller; for boiſterous and
rough language will prevail as litle with
men, as with ſtiff-necked Jades: let
him ſpeak familiarly unto them, let him
laugh and jeſt with them ſometimes;
and alſo either give them occaſion, or
elſe ſuffer them to laugh and be merry;
for their unceſſant pains are ſomething
mitigated, when they are vouchſafed
ſome gentle and courteous intreatance
of their Maſter towards them; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding
I wiſh him not to be too
familiar with them, for the avoiding of
contempt; neither would I have him to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53223:8"/>
acquaint them with his purpoſes, except
it be ſometime to ask their councel in a
matter; and let him not ſpare ſomtimes
to ſeem to do after their advice, though
he had determined the ſame courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
For they will work with more
cheerfulneſs, when they think that the
matter is carryed according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention:
Let him patiently and quietly
bear the tedious and troubleſom natures
of his neighbours, whom he knoweth
to envy and repine at him, never giving
them any juſt occaſion of diſpleaſure,
but to pleaſure them to the ut moſt that
he can, and ſeem to be at one with
them as if he never had underſtood any
thing to move him to the contrary, and
thus he may purchaſe peace and reſt.</p>
            <p>Let him make choice of a Farmer
or Bayliff of indifferent years, ſuch a
one as hath the report of an honeſt man,
and his Wife to be a thrifty Houſewife,
and his Children well nurtured; ſuch
a one as hath no Earth near unto your
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53223:9"/>
Houſe, who is well experienced in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and buſineſſes belonging to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry;
one that will uſe to riſe firſt,
and go to bed laſt, which will make no
bargain when he is in drink; as alſo that
he know how to govern, and amend all
ſuch Tools as he hath the handling of,
or which his folk uſe; otherwiſe, if
there ſhould but need a Handle to a
Spade, or Nail to a Horſe or Tumbrel,
there muſt preſently be admitted into
wages a Nail-Smith for the Cart, and a
Shooe-Smith for the Horſe: Let this
Farmer or Bayliff, have always his eyes
upon his People, and overſee his Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
every night; and not only when they
are in the houſe, but alſo when they
return from labour, or from Paſture;
let him view and look well upon their
countenance, gate, ſtate, and geſture;
for to know if there be any diſeaſed or
languiſhing: and from this care he is
not to exempt himſelf any one day, in
reſpect of the Oxen, Kine, Swine, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53223:9"/>
Sheep; for oftentimes in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
they go to their Paſture in good
ſtate and plight, and return ſick home
at Evening; Let him not go to bed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he have appointed every one of
his people what he is to do the next day
in the Morning; Above all things let
him be juſt and true to his truſt; Let
him not Swear, but ſhew ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to his people, as thereby he may
induce them to eſteem highly of him,
to reverence and to honour him; Let
him pay them their own juſtly, and
not to pay them any thing before hand,
if it be not in caſe of loſs or fickneſs;
Let your Farmer or Bayliff have all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
as he ſhall requeſt of you,
whether it be for the maintenance of
your houſe, or the repairing of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things that do belong unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
watch him not ſo near, as that he may

wrong you in ſome one thing or other
that you would never think of; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53223:10"/>
mark, That to be too much exacting
upon the Farmer, doth oftentimes
make him either a meer negligent, or a
plain Thief.</p>
            <p>Now to the end that his people may
not live idle, and that they may not
looſe one ſmall Minute of time, he
ſhall diſpoſe of his work ſo, as that
they may every one have his certain

            <p>In the Moneth of <hi>January,</hi> chiefly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

VVood and timber, which he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for building or other work, when
the Moon is decreaſed; for the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Moon maketh the VVood
more tender; and the VVood which
ſhall be cut at ſuch time, will endure a

Dung the Fruit-Trees, not letting the

Orange-Trees, Mirtle-Trees; as alſo
all ſuch other Trees as you had kept

The condition and ſtate of the

no leſs care and diligence then the
Office of her Husband; underſtood
always that the Woman is acquitted
of Field-matters, in as much as ſhe is
tied to matters within the houſe, as the
Husband is tied to what concerneth
him, even all the buſineſs of the Field;
and according to our Cuſtom of <hi>England,</hi>
Countrey women look unto the things
neceſſary and requiſite about Kine,
Calves, Hogs, Pigs, Pigeons, Geeſe,
Ducks, Peacocks, Hens, Feaſants,

loving to ſtir from home, not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
full of words and tatling, nor
drowzy headed; let her diſpoſe of all
things under her charge in ſuch ſort, as
that every thing may have his certain

               <p>ANd for the better keeping of
Kine, let the Houſe-Wife cauſe
her Maids to over-look oftentimes,
and ſee that all things be well in the
Cow-houſe; for there is nothing that
doth them ſo much good, and keep
them ſo well in health and good liking,
(their Meat and Fodder excepted)
as the clean and neat keeping of their
Houſes; let them be rub'd along the
back, about the neck and head, and no
more, with a wiſp of ſtraw hard writhen
together, at their coming from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
and in the Morning after they
have been dreſſed, let the holes that
are in their houſe-flore be carefully
filled up, wherein their Piſs might
ſtand and ſtink, and caſt Sand or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel

the faſter or ſurer ſetting for their feet;
let them not be put to the Bull before
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53223:15"/>
they be upon their third year, nor any
longer then until their twelfth year;
for if they be put too ſoon then they be
grown up to their full ſtrength and
growth, they will bring forth Calves
halfe caſt, ſmall and little, weak and
feeble, and if you continue their breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after twelve years their Calves will
not be ſo ſtrong, nor of ſo comely a
ſhape; ſhe ſhall make much account
of the Cow, which is of a mean ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a long body, a large flank, four or
five years old, of a black or brown Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or ſpotted with White, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe, a great belly, broad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the brows, a black eye, and long

but of a wide and well ſpread
ſhape, her Ears very hairy, a narrow
Jaw, a thick and groſs Muzle, wide
Noſtrils and ſnivley, little and black
Lips, her Hair gliſtering and thick ſet,
her Legs ſhort, her Thighs groſs and
thick, and her Neck long and groſs,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53223:15"/>
her Back large and broad, her Tail
long even to the heel, her Hoofs ſhort
and even, a broad Breaſt, a great and

               <p>The Good Houſe-wife muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

it ſhall be ſet in a place where it may be

the Milk, as Heat doth ſowr it, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
make it to turn, ſhe ſhall not let her
Milk be kept long, as above a day in
Summer, eſpecially in Autumn and
the Spring; but as ſoon as ſhe can ſhe
ſhall gather her Cream, Green-Cheeſe,
Preſſed-Cheeſe, Whey, and other
Commodities, which a good Houſe-Wife
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53223:16"/>
is wont to raiſe according to the
time; yet in Winter the Kine yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but ſmall ſtore of Milk, as then
being with Calf, ſhe may gather three
or four Meals together, which will not
ſo ſoon be ſpoiled, by reaſon of the
coldneſs of the Weather, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Milk to thicken preſently; and
ſeeing Cheeſe made in Winter, is not of
ſo great price, nor ſo good and dainty,
as in Spring, Summer and Autumn,
by reaſon of the Graſs; therefore it
ſhall be no great matter to gather the
Butter the clearer from the Cheeſe in
Winter then at any other time. To
ſpeak any thing here of the making,
keeping and ordering of Butter and
Cheeſe, would be impertinent; for
I preſume there is no Countrey-Houſe-Wife
but is well acquainted therewith,
and for thoſe that live in Cities and

Let the Good Houſe-wife take care

and that chiefly in the moneths of <hi>May,
June,</hi> and <hi>July;</hi> For about this time
they are ſet to go a Bulling, ſeeking
for the Bull themſelves, without being
lead unto him; and you ſhall know their
inclination to the taking of the Bull by
the puffing and ſwelling of their Hoofs,
as alſo by their continual Lowing,
and by their leaping upon the Bulls
back. The profit which riſeth by
their taking the Bull at this time is;
for that they will Calve about 10
Months after, (which is the juſt time of
their Going with Calf) and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at ſuch time as new Graſs doth
draw on, it will be an occaſion of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
their Milk, and their Calves
ſhall be a great deal the better fed.</p>
               <p>The Cow that is indifferent lean,
will hold her Bulling better then the
fat Cow; but on the contrary, a good
Bull for breed muſt be fat, well ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53223:17"/>
and well meated for Two Months
ſpace before.</p>
               <p>And for the choiſe of a good Bull,
let him be rather long then high, of a
black or brown hair, large betwixt the
Shoulders, ſtrong Legged, round and
well truſt Body, broad Breaſted, ſhort
Headed, broad Brows, a fierce Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and terrible to fight, black
Eyes, ſhort Horns, and a long Tail full
of hair.</p>
               <p>During the time of the Cows going
with Calfe, keep them from leaping
of Ditches, Hedges or Buſhes, and a
little before the time that they do
Calve, to feed them in the houſe, or
Yard adjoyning to the houſe, and that
with good Hay or Turnips, or ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Provender as the Countrey ſhall
afford, not milking them at all for a
good ſpace before their Calving; for the
Milk that they have then cannot but
be nought, and become as hard as a
Stone.</p>

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53223:17"/>
As for Calves newly fallen, you muſt
leave them with good Litter of freſh
Straw until ſuch time as the Cows have
licked and cleanſed them, and for two
or three days after let the Cow be with
the Calf, which doth heat and ſettle
the Calf; after that you ſhall put it
into ſome ſhed, providing it good
Litter, and renewing the ſame once a
day, and thence you ſhall bring them
forth when you would have them ſuck;
and if you ſee that they will not ſuck,
or that being willing to ſuck, they can
do nothing but offer to take the Paps,
without ſucking any thing, you ſhall
look under the Tongue if they
have not the Barbs, which is a whitiſh
fleſhineſs growing under the Tongue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
after the manner of the Pip, which
(if it be ſo) you ſhall take away gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

place afterwards, either with red Wine
of it ſelf, or with the Infuſion of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53223:18"/>
and Salt ſtamped therewith: For
this diſeaſe will cauſe them to languiſh,
unto death, by keeping them from
ſucking; Let them be carefully kept
from Lice and Scabs, both which do
hinder them from thriving, the Lice
may be pickt away, and for Scabs if
they have any, which you may know,
if ſtraking your hand along their Skins,
you feel it, hackt and rough like a
File, and the Hair ſtairing and ſtanding
upright; for the healing whereof you
ſhall rub them with Butter all over
where the Scab is. But as it is a great
deal better to prevent diſeaſes then to
cure them: The Houſe-wife ſhall cauſe
her Calves once or twice a day to be
rub'd over with wiſps of Straw unbound,
and ſuffer not their Piſs to ſtand in
Puddles under them; but let them
be kept with freſh and dry Litter, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

This Beaſt is a great Eater, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure Hunger, eſpecially the Sows,
which in this neceſſity have been ſeen
to eat their own Pigs, and thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as alſo Children in their Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles;
and therefore you muſt have care,
that their Troughs are never empty;
They are ſubject to many diſeaſes, and
they are known to be ſick when they
hang their Ears much and become ſlow
and heavy, or when they loſe their
Appetite. For the better certainty,
when there do not appear any of theſe
ſigns, pull from him againſt the Hair,
a handful of Briſles off his Back; if
if they be clean and white at the Root,
he is ſound and healthful; but if they be
bloody or otherwiſe ſpotted, he is ſick;
likewiſe it is commonly ſaid, That when
a Hog is ſick, he will neither eat nor
drink, till he knows whether he ſhall
live or die, and therefore when he falls
to his meat, you may be aſſured that
he begins to mend.</p>

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:53223:21"/>
The Hog by reaſon of his filthineſs,
hath (for the moſt part) one fault or
other betwixt his skin and his fleſh, how
ſound ſoever he be; and therefore it is
good after he is kill'd to ſinge of his
Hair with ſtraw, rather then to ſcald
them off with water; for the Fire doth
draw our a great deal more eaſily then
hot water, whatſoever is betwixt the
skin and fleſh; kill your Hogs in the
increaſe of the Moon, and let them
not drink nor eat the day before you
kill them; that ſo their fleſh may be
the more dry; for if they drink till you
kill them, the ſalting time will have
the greater quantity of ſuperfluous
moiſture to drink up; Cut out as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the bones as you can; for that
will cauſe the ſalting to be of better
effect, preſerving the fleſh the longer
from corruption.</p>
               <p>Cover your Bacon all over with
bay-ſalt, renewing it once in three days,
and do this for a Fortnight or more, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53223:21"/>
then hang them up to ſmoke over a
Wood-fire, but in any caſe, not too
near the heat of the Fire, and when
they are well ſmoked, which will be
in Ten days time, if they have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Fire, then hang them about your
Kitchin, or other convenient place
where they may keep dry. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
thus ſalted, will be more faſt, and of
a better Taſt then any other way; Some
cut the fleſh in pieces, and put it into
a ſalting-tub, making as many beds of
Salt groſly brayed, as of fleſh, the one
above the other, and when the Tub is
almoſt full, they fill it up with Salt,
and preſs all down together with
weights; but this way is nothing ſo
good, though more uſed by ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

               <p>If you would increaſe the ſtore of
your Dove-houſe by drawing others
thither, you ſhall lay upon the Altar
within the houſe, or upon the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
a Loaf made of Red Earth, Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min-ſeed
well bruiſed, Honey and
Brine all well boiled together, and
dryed in the Oven; for having picked
upon this lump, they will never fail
to return thither again; for they are
much given to the pleaſing of their
taſt; and further, by the very ſent

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:53223:32"/>
When you ſhall perceive that they
begin to lay, caſt them Morning and
Evening a little clean Corn, and cauſe
their water-pot, wherein they bath
themſelves, to be oftentimes made
clean, and freſh water put therein;
Let the Dove-houſe be kept very
clean, and for that cauſe let him that
hath the charge thereof, go into it once
every week at leaſt, and that in the
Morning, or at the times of relief, when
the Pigeons are ſeeking their meat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the Countrey thereabouts;
for they keep their noon-tyde in the
houſe, and at that hour he muſt not
enter therein, he ſhall pare the floor,
caſt out ſuch as he finds dead, make clean
their holes; and if any are fallen out of
their holes, let them not meddle to
put them up again; if he perceive the
train of any Snake or Adder, let him
provide a long earthen pot, and ſet it
upon its bottom, and put within it a
Pigeon, and place it right in the train
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53223:33"/>
and walk of the Snake or Adder, and ſet
by it ſome board or other, or other
thing whereby ſhe may creep up unto

and rid the Dove-houſe of ſuch Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</p>
               <p>It is true, that Pigeous do require
ſome coſt in Winter, when through
Froſt or Snow, or when the Corn is
ſhot, they cannot find any thing in
the Field; but this is not above two
Months continuance or thereabouts,
that you need to feed them with Corn;
at the end of which time they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
afford you a flight, and they
are the moſt fat, tender and dainty of

               <p>You ſhall preſerve the Dung which
you take from the Pigeons, not mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>IT is requiſite that we ſhould now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the manner of ordering the
Garden, wherein the good Houſe-wife
muſt have a good ſhare in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
we will begin therefore with the
Kitchin-garden, which ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the Garden of pleaſure
by the intercourſe of an Alley of the
breadth of three Fathoms, or elſe by a
Wall or Hedge; both which Gardens
muſt be in ſome plain plot of ground,
as it were a little hanging for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of the Rain-water that ſhall
fall therein; and likewiſe for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of their labour, it muſt be caſt
into ſquares, very equal and uniform,
by the ſide of the Kitchin-garden; It
were neceſſary to have a Garden for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53223:34"/>
Hemp, Flax, ſaffron, Turnips, Parſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips,
and other things of profit and
good Husbandry; and on the other
ſide of the Garden of pleaſure, another
Garden for Peaſe, Beans, Rice, Millet,
and ſuch other things; for they ſerve
greatly for the keeping of a Family.</p>
               <p>The encloſures of the Garden muſt
be ſuch, as the commodity and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of the place doth require; that
is to ſay of Walls, if the Revenues of
the Farm will bear it, or of a ſtrong
and thick Quickſet Hedge, if there
want either Stone, Brick, or Revenues
to build the Wall withal. Some there
be that encloſe their Gardens with
Banks, but nothing to their profit; for
the moiſture of their Gardens which
ſhould ſerve them, is thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
away and taken from them;
for this way doth no where hold
good, but in Fenny and Marſh
grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:53223:34"/>
The ground of the Gardens muſt be
good, of his own nature free from
ſtones, well broken and dunged a year
before it be digged to plant in, and
after it hath been digged and dunged
or marled again, you muſt let it reſt
and drink in its Dung or Marl. As
concerning the nature and goodneſs of
it, the ſtiff Clay or ſandy ground are
worſt of all, but it muſt be fat in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
Black in Colour, and which
crumbleth eaſily in the breaking or
ſtirring of it with your fingers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
ſmall with labouring, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
all grounds that are good for
Wheat are good for Gardens; it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
alſo (to the end it may bring
forth green Herbs in abundance) that
it be reaſonable moiſt; for neither
that which is very dry, nor that which
is ſubject to much wet, is good.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding if the grounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Farm, happen not to
be ſuch, you muſt remedy it as well as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53223:35"/>
you may; the ſtiff Clay and ſandy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
muſt be amended by Dung and
Marl, and would be caſt three foot
deep, the watry places will be made
better, if you mix with it ſome ſandy
or gravelly ground, and therewithall
caſt it round about with Ditches, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to draw and drein out the water an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying
the Garden. Thus the good
Husband ſhall do his endeavour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
and make his ground more
fruitful; Let the Dung which he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon it be either of Sheep, Swine,
Horſes or Pigeons, according as the
nature of the ground ſhall require, and
the elder it is, the better alſo; in as
much as in time it looſeth his filthy
ſtink, and whatſoever other evil qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and getteth a new kind of rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which is more ſoft and more eaſie
to be converted into the ſubſtance of
the Earth, whereby good earth is made
better, and the naughty amended.
This is the cauſe why ſuch as have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53223:35"/>
writ of Husbandry in Latine, do call
Dung <hi>Laetamen,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> men call
it <hi>Letiere;</hi> becauſe it maketh the ground
merry, that is, when it is once mingled
and incorporated therewith.</p>
               <p>If it be poſſible let not your Gardens
be on that ſide the houſe the Barn or
Thraſhing-flore is, to the end that the
Herbs and Flowers may not be hurt by
the Duſt, Dirt, ſmall Straw or Chaff,
which might be blown from the
Thraſhing-flore unto the Garden by
the wind; for ſuch Chaff having
taken hold upon the leaves, doth pierce
and fret them through; and being thus
pierced, they burn and parch away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
               <p>As there are two times in the year
to ſowe Herbs, ſo there are two ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to bring into order and dreſs Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
that is to ſay, Autumn and the
Spring; Let your ground be digged
and manured in <hi>November,</hi> which you
intend to ſowe in the Spring; and dig
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53223:36"/>
in the Month of <hi>May</hi> ſuch other grounds
as you intend to ſowe in Autumn; to
the end, that by the Cold of Winter,
or by the Heat of ſummer, the Clods
may be apt to turn to duſt, and become
ſhort and brittle, and all unprofitable
Weeds may be killed.</p>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>The time of Sowing.</head>
                  <p>ALl Seeds which are for the ſtore

ſown and removed in the increaſe of the
Moon, as namely from the firſt day
unto the ſixth; and for thoſe that are
ſown in the decreaſe, they either come
up ſlowly, or elſe be nothing worth;
beſides that, although you ſowe in the
increaſe of the Moon, it ſometimes
falleth out, that notwithſtanding your
Seed be fat, full, make a white Flower,
and be nothing corrupted or hurt, yet
ſome evil conſtellation (which the
Gardeners do call the courſe of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53223:36"/>
Heavens) do hinder them, that they
profit not, nor thrive any thing at
all.</p>
                  <p>If you are diſpoſed to ſowe Seeds in
Summer, it muſt be in the increaſe of
the Moon of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and in
Autumn in the increaſe of the Moon of
<hi>September</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> as alſo for the
Spring in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March:</hi> In pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
naturally Cold, or which receive
no great Heat from Sun-beams, the
ſowing in the Spring time muſt be
toward the latter end thereof,
and that in Autumn haſtened and early
performed; and on the contrary, the
ſowing of Seeds in the Spring time, in
a hot place, muſt be early, and the
ſowing in Autmn late. Seeds grow
beſt when they are ſown upon warm
days, or days that are neither hot nor
cold.</p>
                  <p>Colworts, Spinage of all ſorts, with
Succory, Garlick, Leeks and Onions are
ſown in Autumn, and live all Winter.</p>
                  <p>

Navets or Turnips, Radiſhes,
Parſnips, Carots, Parſley, Fennel,
and other Herbs, whoſe Roots are
good in Pottage, are ſown in Autumn;

alſo thoſe of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April</hi> grow
more early then thoſe of <hi>February,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the diverſity of the time.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the ground is full of Seeds
in all places, you muſt be careful to
water it if the place be dry of its own
nature, that ſo the Seed may not be
hindred of his ſprouting by too much
dryneſs, or that the Herb already
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53223:37"/>
ſprung, may not die. The beſt water to
water Pot-herbs withall, is Rain-water,
if it fall in the night, or in ſuch a time
as it may not heat the Herbs; for it
waſheth and cleanſeth them from the
Duſt, and Vermin that eateth them,
eſpecially if the Rain come driving
with a Northern wind; for want of
this the River or Brook-water is beſt
next, being a little warm, and inſtead
of this Well water (drawn in the
Morning, and put into a Barrel, or
ſome other thing of Receit, that ſo it
may take the heat of the Sun-beams)
may ſerve; for cold, and Salt-water
is an enemy to all ſorts of Herbs; The
time to water them, is the Evening
and Morning, not the mid-day, for
fear that the water being heated by the
Sun, and the ſurface of the Earth
(being hot) might burn them at the
Root.</p>
                  <p>Cutting of Herbs is profitable for
them, at ſuch time as they be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

make them more beautiful and tufted,
to keep them from ſeeing, and alſo
to gike them ſomewhat a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

at all times; for ſuch as have a hollow
ſtalk, as Onions and others, if they
be cut when it raineth, the blade or
ſtalk of the Onion is filled full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and rotteth, and this is the cauſe,
why Herbs of ſuch nature are not

Leaves and whole Herbs when they

turn Yellow, and are grown to their

all laid and dry; and it muſt generally
be obſerved in all manner of gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as well of Herbs, Flowers and
Roots, as of Fruits and Seeds, that it
be done in a fair and clear weather, and
in the decreaſe of the Moon.</p>
                  <p>Such Herbs as are to be kept
muſt firſt be made very clean; and
dryed in the ſhadow, which is the beſt

fail much in their way, which
hang their Phyſick-herbs in the Roof

their force, and become laden with
Duſt, Cobwebs, the Dung of Flies,
and a thouſand other filthy things.</p>
                  <p>The beſt way to dry flowers will be
in a temperate place, and to turn them
oft, to the end they may not corrupt;
having a continual care, that they
may not looſe their colour or ſmell,
and when they are dryed, put them
into an earthen Veſſel. Seeds muſt
be kept in Bags, or Boxes well

muſt lay them in Sand or Gravel very
thin, in ſome place under the Earth,
and a little covered, or elſe to bury
them under the Earth in the Garden,
as I have ſeen it done to keep them the

them dry, after they are gathered, you
muſt waſh them with clear water,
and after take from them all the ſmall
Fibres and Hair-threds that hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

of men, but alſo for a ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
to comfort the Heart that is ſick,
to rejoyce and recreate all the heavy
and troubled ſpirits, as we may well
perceive by that famous confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
called of the Phyſitians <hi>Alkermes;</hi>
which being for the moſt part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of the decoction and infuſion
of Silk in the Juice of Kermes, being
taken inwardly, is a Sovereign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
in faintings and ſwouning;
wherefore the good Houſe-wife ſhall
make great account of theſe Creatures,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53223:47"/>
to the end that ſhe may reap profit of
the ſale of the Silk, which ſhe ſhall
gather from them yearly; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
practice is well known amongſt
the good Wives of forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
from whence we have ſuch great
quantities of Silk brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the making of her beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
hereof ſhe muſt chooſe out a
convenient place for the keeping of
them, and it muſt be rather high then
low, in a good Air, without moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſo provided of Windows, as
that the Sun may come in at them
Morning and Evening, if it ſeem good
to thoſe that have the charge of them.
The Windows muſt be ſuch as will
ſhut cloſe, either glaſed or paper-windows,
to the end that when it
raineth or bloweth, in cold weather or
in moiſt, they may be kept very cloſe
and faſt ſhut; for who ſo faileth to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
and provide for them in this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53223:48"/>
manner, without doubt theſe pretty
Creatures (being tender at all times)
cannot eſcape but die, when cold
weather cometh. There muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be Nets hanged before the VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
to the end that when the Paper-windows
are opened, the Sparrows,
Swallows, and ſuch like hurtful Birds,
may not get in to feed upon theſe
VVorms: Neither Cock nor Hen
muſt come in here; for they would ſo
ravenouſly feed upon them, as that
they would be ready to burſt. The
walls and floor muſt be very clean, and
free from holes or creviſes, by which
Rats, Mice, or other like Vermin
may enter and get in to kill and ſpoil
theſe little things, either night or day.
In it there muſt be Tables or Shelves
for them to abide upon, and they muſt
be kept upon Sheets of Paper, the
edges turn'd up, that they may not
creep away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:53223:48"/>
The careful Houſe-wife as ſoon as
Spring draweth near, and that ſhe ſhall
ſee that the Mulberry-tree beginneth
to bud, ſhall bring forth her Eggs that
ſhe hath kept all VVinter, and ſet
them where the warmth of the Sun
may come to them; and if ſhe ſee that
the Mulberry-tree is ſlow to bud, there
ſhall be freſh Dung laid to the Roots
thereof, during the new Moon of <hi>March,</hi>
thereby to bring it forward; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
for lack of the leaves of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-tree;
if it ſhould happen the
VVorms ſhould be bred or hatcht, you
muſt for their food have recourſe to
the Heart of the Thorn, Elme-leaves,
the tender tops of Nettles, and others,
all which will but keep them alive;
and as concerning making choice of
ſuch VVorms as are to be breeders,
you muſt take the ſeed, which being
bathed in Wine, falleth to the bottom;
and doth not float above; the time
of breeding then is about the fifteenth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53223:49"/>
or twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> from the fourth
unto the tenth day of the Moon, but
never in the decreaſe; for then they
will bring forth their Silk at ſuch time
as they are ſtrong, in ſuch ſort as that
their ends and husks will be greater,
harder, and more finely haired then
any other that are bred at another
time: For theſe that are bred in the
decreaſe of the Moon are always feeble,
and yield no profit; the way to make
them hatch is, after that you have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and bathed them in the VVhite-wine,
rather then warm water, to lay
them near the fire till they are a little
warm; then lay them betwixt two Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
made likewiſe ſomething warm,
and ſo as they hatch and come out of
their Eggs, to take them gently away,
and put them upon Mulberry-leaves,
and to lay them upon Boards or Papers
that have been rub'd over with
VVormwood or with Sothernwood,
or ſome ſuch like Herb, and give
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53223:49"/>
them freſh Mulberry-leaves Evening
and Morning, increaſing them every
day as the VVorms ſhall grow greater
and greater, unto the fourth change;
for then they will ſtand in need to be
fed at noon alſo, becauſe then they eat
more then they were wont; but be
cateful, that when they mew or change,
you muſt give them ſparingly; for
then they are weak and feeble, and in
any caſe let not the leaves be moiſt,
wet or rotten, and if it ſhould fall out,
that they are wet when they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
you muſt wipe them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with clean linnen, and dry them a
little at the fire if need be. They
muſt be gathered of old Trees rather
then young ones, and not to gather
them in the Morning when they are
wet with the Dew or other thing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Sun hath gone over them, and be
ſure to pick the bad from the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you give them to the VVorms.
Theſe little Creatures muſt not be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53223:50"/>
touched with your hands, but as little as
may be; for the more they are handled,
the more they are hindred; becauſe they
are very exceeding tender and dainty,
eſpecially at ſuch time as they caſt their
ſloughs or claing; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they muſt be kept clean and neat,
and all their little Dung taken from
them once in two or three days, the
place where they are kept, muſt be
perfumed ſometimes with Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſence,
Garlick or Onions; that you
may miniſter matter of pleaſure to
theſe little Creatures, and if they are
weak and ſick, theſe ſmels refreſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
them again. You ſhall take notice
that they are wont to ſleep, eſpecially
at ſuch times as they caſt and change:
After they have caſt and changed the
fourth time, they eat better then ever
they did, until ſuch time as their
bodies begin to ſhine, and that they
make ſhew of the Silk that is in their
bellies; which if it be to come white
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53223:50"/>
from them, their heads will look as if
they were Silver; if Yellow, their heads
bear the Colour of Gold, if Green or
Orange Colour, their heads foretel
the ſame. Thus they feeling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
well filled and fed, do ſeek out
ſome reſting place for the purpoſe to
faſten themſelves unto, and there or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
to avoid their Silk, every one
ſhutting up himſelf in his ſcale or husk,
which they make or build up in three
days at moſt.</p>
            <p>When you perceive them begin to
ſpin, and faſten themſelves to the
Paper or other thing that they are kept
on, You muſt make them little Coffins
of Poper, putting but one in each Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and ſo pin them up about the
Room to the hangings or other things
convenient; when they begin their
work, they are ſo eager, as that they
go mad till they be packed up in their
little Clews and Bottoms, where they
are ſo incloſed that a man would think
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53223:51"/>
they would be ſtifled they have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their work in two or three days more
or leſs, as the weather is cold or hot
at that time. When any begin to
ſpin, mark the Paper-coffins, when
you pin them up, with the day of the
Month; for in ſix days you may wind
off their Silk, though they lie thus
in their husks, for the moſt part twenty
days more or leſs, according to the
ſoftneſs or hardneſs of their Bottoms
of Silk, and then (if you do not wind
off their Silk before) they will eat their
way out.</p>
            <p>As concerning the choice of their
Husks or Cods, the Orange-coloured
are the beſt, and not the Yellow, and
leaſt of all the White or Green. When
you go about to wind your Silk, you
muſt have in readineſs a Reel, and then
after you have pulled off all the looſe
Silk, till you come to the hard bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
find out an end, which you may
do by drawing two or three ends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53223:51"/>
till they run ſingle, and ſo do by
the reſt, and you may wind 10 or 15
Husks together, and your beſt way to
wind is out of water a little warm, and
wherein ſome Gum-Arabick hath been
ſoaked. After this manner you may
wind ſo much Silk off the Husks,
that the Worms will drop out into
the water, and the Gum'd water gives
the Silk an excellent gloſs; Take the
Worms out of the water, and lay them
on ſheets of Paper to dry, keeping
them ſafe from Rats, Mice, and other
Vermin, and then make choice of the
beſt for breeding, which are the groſeſt
and blackeſt; for thoſe are the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and afford better Eggs then any
of the other; you muſt take more fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male-then
males, and for the knowing
of the one from the other, the Eyes
of thoſe Creatures do ſufficiently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thereof; for the females have thinner
Eyes, and not ſo black as the males; but
this is known beſt when the become
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53223:52"/>
Butter-flies, which will not be till the
middle of <hi>July,</hi> or after; and then as
ſoon as they come forth out of their
Husks, they will couple, and lay their
Eggs, one will lay about 200 Eggs,
which will ſtick to the Paper as they
are laid, and there ſhould be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſtirring all Winter, till brooding
time come again, and you muſt be
ſure to keep them from the Winter-froſts.</p>
            <p>As concerning the diſeaſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
theſe little Creatures be ſubject;
when they have not been ſo carefully
looked unto as they ſhould, to be kept
clean, when the cold Northern-wind,
or the hot Southern-Sun hath moleſted
them; as alſo when they have eated
too much, then they become ſick,
wherefore keep them very cleanly,
ſtop the Windows and holes by which
the cold winds do enter and get in,
and carry Coles of fire that ſmoke not,
into their Rooms, ſetting thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53223:52"/>
Frankinſence, (for they ſo love
this ſmell, as that it preſently cureth
them) and alſo beſprinkle them with
a little Malmſey, or <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi> And
if they have been troubled with too
great heat of the South Sun, then
ſprinkle on them ſome Roſe-water;
if they have over-eaten themſelves the
contrary dyet will cure them, as the
keeping them two or three days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
eating any thing; if there be any
of them that ure ſpotted with duskiſh,
blewiſh, or yellowiſh Colour, and
there appear withall upon their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
a certain humour that doth wet
them, they muſt be ſpeedily taken
from out of the company of the reſt,
and carried out, and in the Morning
before the Sun riſe, ſet the whole and
ſound in the air for ſome ſmall time,
and after put them in their places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and ſprinkle them with good and
ſtrong Vineger, and rub their Rooms
with Wormwood or Southernwood,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53223:53"/>
and alſo to give them air, and let them
feal the force of the Sun, provided
that the Beams thereof do not touch
them, and ſo fit the Windows, that
the Morning air may ſeaſon and ſend
his breath throughout the whole houſe,
And as for thoſe that are ſick, keep
them upon Papers by themſelves,
and now and then ſprinkle on them
ſome Roſe-water, or <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> and
rub their Papers with Wormwood, as
before.</p>
            <p>The pleaſure in the keeping, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and obſerving this little Creature,
is not to be conceived, but by thoſe
that have had the government of them.
As concerning their ſhapes, firſt their
Eggs are laid all round together upon
the Paper, and in ſuch order that none
are laid upon another, and they are
about the bigneſs of a Turnip-ſeed, or
ſmall white Beads, which within a
week after they are laid do turn Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and in a week more they are Brown,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53223:53"/>
and the week after they are a Dun Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
which Colour they hold all Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
till the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> at which
time or beginning of <hi>May</hi> they will
hatch and bring fourth young, as hath
been ſhewed before. When they are
hatcht they are black and no bigger
then the end of a ſmall Pin; when they
they are about a fortnight old, their
heads begin to be white, and a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
or three weeks after that, they
caſt a ſlough or skin, and the bodies
begin to be white, and ſo at every time
they caſt, their Colour doth change,
until ſuch time as they begin to ſpin,
and then you may perceive them to be
clear, and ſhine of ſuch Colour as the
Silk will be that they ſpin.</p>
            <p>From the time that they are hatcht
to the time of their spinning, will be
about ſeven weeks, and after that they
never eat any more; for after the Silk
is wonnd off, and the Worms come
out of the bag, in a ſhort time they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53223:54"/>
come to be Butter-flies, as you have
heard before, and then after they have
coupled and laid their Eggs, there is no
more care to be taken of them, for
then they pine away and die.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the greateſt part of
the profit of a Farm
depend upon the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Cattle: I dare be
bold to affirm, that the
fruitfuleſt thing that can
be kept about a Countrey-houſe, is Bees;
indeed there is ſome pains and care to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53223:55"/>
be taken in chooſing, feeding, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and keeping of them clean in their
Hives; but withall, what ſo rare and
ſingular commodity have we as the
Wax, and the Honey which we enjoy
by their admirable workmanſhip, both
profitable and pleaſant for the uſe of
man; Let not it then ſeem ſtrange,
if I adviſe the Houſholder to be careful
to keep Bees about his Farm, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
teach him in a few words what
ſhould be the ordering and governing
of them and their Hives, and what
time and hour it is good to gather Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and VVax.</p>
            <p>The Houſholder therefore ſhall firſt
make choice of ſome fit and ſecret
place in his Garden of pleaſure, for
the keeping of his Bees, in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of ſome Valley if poſſible, to the
end they may riſe on high to fly abroad
to get their Food, and alſo when they
be laden, they may deſcend the more
eaſily downward with their load; but
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53223:55"/>
eſpecially let the place be open to the
South Sun, yet where they may be
ſhaded ſometimes, and that by ſome
wall, ramport, or houſe-ſide, that they
may be defended from winds and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts,
and ſo alſo that they may ſly
ſundry and ſeveral ways, for to get di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of Paſtures, and ſo return again
to their little Cottages laden with their
Compoſition of Honey.</p>
            <p>And it is convenient to have them
where there is good ſtore of Thime,
Organy, VVinter-ſavory, VVild-thime,
Roſemary, Sage, Gilliflowers,
Violets, VVhite-lillies, Roſes, Saffron,
Beans, Mellilot, and other ſweet Herbs
and Flowers, wherein there is no bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,
and alſo Fruit-trees, Peach-trees,
Pear-trees, Apple-trees, Cherry-trees,
and other ſuch like.</p>
            <p>The place muſt be cloſed in with a
ſtrong Hedge or good wall, for fear
both of Beaſts and Thieves; for
Kine and Sheep do eat up their Flowers,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53223:56"/>
and beat the Due off from the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which ſhould load them; but of
all tame Beaſts there is none that doth
ſo damnifie theſe little pretty wretches
as Swine and Goats; for the Goats
waſt their Food, and jump againſt their
houſes, yea, and oftentimes beat them
down; the Swine, beſides the waſting
of their Food, rubbing againſt their
Hives, do overturn them, and the
ſeats whereon they be ſet; Sheep in
like manner looſing ſome of their locks
of VVooll upon the Hedges, are the
cauſe that the ſilly poor Bees now and
then become entangled therein, when
they labour to get their Food, and ſo
leave their Carcaſſes for a pledge;
Hens likewiſe have a glutronous appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
towards them, Snakes and other
like venomous Beaſts ſometimes take
up their Inns in their Hives; but to
take away this caſualty at once and
for ever, you muſt plant Rue round
about them in good quantity; for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53223:56"/>
ſuch Beaſts cannot abide this Herb.
Their place alſo muſt be far from the
Dunghils, and all dirty or miry places
which might hurt them with ill ſmells;
for they are deadly enemies to all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiueſs
and uncleanneſs; but let their
places be as near as you can to ſome
little Brook of water, naturally and of
it ſelf continually running, and this
Rundle muſt have by the edges thereof
Stones or Boughs of Trees for the Bees
to light upon.</p>
            <p>But whatſoever the place be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Garden of pleaſure or elſe
where, it muſt not be hem'd in with
very high walls on every ſide, unleſs
you leave ſlits or holes in the walls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
four foot from the ground, that
the Bees may paſs the eaſier in and
out.</p>
            <p>The place and ſtanding for the Bees
being thus appointed, the next thing
is to provide for Hives; the beſt are
thoſe which are made of Boards, wide
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53223:57"/>
enough, but not very long; and they
muſt be made ſo, that one or two of
the Boards may be lifted up when the
Honey is to be taken, or the Hives to
be made clean; There are ſome Hives
made of Sallow or Willow twigs; and
ſome of Straw, but not ſo convenient as
the former; they muſt be wide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
and narrow above, drawn over
and dreſt on the outſide with Lime and
Oxe-dung mingled together, that ſo
they may continue the longer; they
muſt be ſet upon Boards fitted for the
purpoſe, and that near unto ſome wall
or houſe-ſide, but not cloſe to it, that
ſo there may be a ſpace left, for one to
go about them and make them clean,
or elſe upon ſome Vault of Stone or
Brick to the height of three foot, and
as much in breadth laid over with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on every ſide, and planed ſo, that
that neither Rats, Mice, or other
Vermin may clime thither to hurt
them. The Hives ſhall be ſo ſet,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53223:57"/>
as there may be a certain diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twixt
one and the other, that when
need ſhall require to look unto any one,
for the making of it clean, or any other
thing. You may not ſhake or diſturb
the adjoyning Bees, who do greatly
fear when they are touched, leaſt their
workmanſhip of Wax (which is very
weak and eaſie to be ſpoiled) ſhould
be ſtirred or broken. The Hives muſt
have ſome covering or ſhelter of
Boards or other thing beſides the ſhade
of Leaves and Boughs, which may ſerve
to preſerve them againſt cold, Snow,
Rain and heat, although heat do not
ſo much hurt unto Bees as cold. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
behind the Bees as they ſtand,
there muſt be ſome building, or at leaſt
a wall, which may be to them inſtead
of a Sunny-bank againſt the North-wind,
and keep the Hives in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
warmth, and mark it well that
you put the fore-part of the Hive,
where the Bees come forth, ſomething
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53223:58"/>
more towards the Eaſt then the South;
to the end that in the Morning the Bees
for their earlier coming forth may have
the Sun warm upon them for their
better awakening. The holes by which
they paſs and repaſs, muſt be very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that they may may not give place
for the entrance of much cold, and
they will be big enough, if ſo be there
may but one Bee paſs at a time; but
according to the quantity of Bees in
the Hive, you muſt have more or leſs
holes, three holes will be ſufficient for
the fulleſt Hives. It would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
that they be ſheltered with
Boards in Winter, made with Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
to open and ſhut, that you may
cloſe them up in Snowy or very cold
weather.</p>
            <p>I will ſay nothing here of the ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of Bees, whether it be by the
coupling of Males and Females toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as we ſee in other kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or by the corruption and rotting
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53223:58"/>
of the Belly and Entrails of a young
Bullock; (whereof <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaketh)
but I will deſcribe them as they are
already ingendred, as what be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of ſuch as are fit and like to
make good Honey.</p>
            <p>There are many ſorts of Bees; for
ſome are of a golden Colour, clear,
ſhining and bright, others blackiſh,
rough and hairy, ſome great, ſome
ſmall, ſome thick and round, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſpare and long, ſome wild and
ſome tame; but if you would buy or
gather ſwarms to keep for their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
look and take good heed that
they have the Marks following, as that
they be little ones, ſomewhat long,
not hairy, golden coloured, ſhining
and ſparkling like Gold, ſpotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
gentle and loving. For the
greater and longer that Bees are,
the worſe they are. And if they be
cruel they are nothing worth; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53223:59"/>
that their Choler and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
is eaſily helped if they be well
marked and fruitful, by ſeeing them
oft; for in your oft going to them
they become tame; but becauſe one
cannot perceive whether they have all
theſe marks aforeſaid, if he ſee them
not: If you buy them, before you
bargain you muſt open the Hives, and
ſee if they be well repleniſhed or not,
and if you cannot look up high enough,
you may gueſs what they are by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
if there be good ſtore at the
mouth, and whether you hear a great
noiſe and huzzing within; and if they
be all retired to reſt, if you blow into
the Hive, you will preſently perceive
whether they be many or few, by the
noiſe which they will make when they
feel the breath. It is good to buy
them as near unto your abode as you
can, and not in other Countries far off;
for the change of their Paſture Air and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53223:59"/>
Countrey doth aſtoniſh and amaze
them; beſides alſo, the farther they
are carried, the more they are pained
in their Hives; but if they cannot be
had but by ſeeking far for them, it
will be beſt to carry them away in the
Evening or before day, and rather in
Spring then in Winter, and then to be
born between two men, and when
they are brought to the place of their
abode, you muſt not open them till
next day at night, to the end that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have reſted all night, they
may be the fitter to come forth peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
in the Morning; There is no ſuch
careful heed to be taken in the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of thoſe which are given, nor of
thoſe which are taken out of the Fields
or Woods; although I could adviſe
the contrary, ſeeing the charges and
pains are as great about the bad as the
good; notwithſtanding when one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them out of the Fields or
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53223:60"/>
VVoods, it is not poſſible to make
ſuch choiſe as he would, and therefore
muſt be content with ſuch as come
next to hand. The manner uſed in
ſome Countries to gather them is
thus. VVhen you have found out
any place where ſtore of Bees do uſe
and keep, (which is commonly in
in Woods and Forreſts where Herbs do
abound, and Trees of ſweet ſmell and
near ſome ſmall River or Fountain)
you ſhall uſe diligence to find out the
place of their abode, which you may
eaſily learn by watching their return
from water, whether it be near or far
off, then afterwards in the beginning
of the Spring, with Thime and Balm
bruiſed, with other ſuch like Herbs as
Bees love, annoint and rub a Hive
well, ſo that the ſmell and Juice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may remain behind; after that make
the Hive clean, and ſprinkle it with a
little Honey, and having thus handled
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53223:60"/>
it, ſet it down in the Woods or
Forreſts, near unto the Springs
where the Bees do moſt uſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have once found it out,
the Hive will quickly be full of
Bees.</p>
            <p>The good Houſholder having provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Hives and fit places, and alſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
bought or gathered good ſtore of
Swarms of Bees to repleniſh his Hives,
ſhall be careful to afford them a more
diligent and attentive kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ordering then unto any
kind of Cattel; Becauſe the Bee is
more diſcreet and induſtrious then any
other kind of living Creature: For ſhe
hath a kind of wiſdom coming near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the underſtanding of man; and
therefore look then for a more careful
manner of uſage and carriage towards
her from them that are her Governours
and cannot abide them to be ſluttiſh
and negligent, nor to be nigardly or
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53223:61"/>
filthily intreated. It muſt therefore
be his condition that ſhall have the
charge of them, to conſider their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and manner of living, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
to frame himſelf thereunto in
the beſt ſort that may be. They have
a King whom they obey as their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
in all things, accompliſhing and
fulfilling, whatſoever he ſhall give
them in charge, whether it be to go
forth, or to return home, or to ſtay
within, and they attend him always in
companies whereſoever he be, they
comfort him, if at any time he be ſick;
and do keep about him if he cannot fly,
not one of them is negligent and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but every one ready and quick to
any kind of work; ſome gather and
bring home what they get and ſuck
from Flowers and ſweet ſmelling Herbs
and Leaves, unto thoſe which ſtay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Hive making Honey; others are
buſie in making Combs, and building
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53223:61"/>
of little Cabbins. Some make Honey,
and others attend other matters and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;
ſome lay their hands to the
ſoftning of Wax, and temper it ſo
well, as that making thin Leaves
thereof, they therewith build up and
frame them Cels and Cloiſters; others
with great labour do ſunder the
groſs and droſſy ſubſtance, and make
ready a place for every ſort of Honey;
ſome of them with their pains and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
do keep clean the Hives; which
notwithſtanding are never defiled by
any of their own Dung; for always in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad they void their excriments;
ſome there are which ordinarily do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but keep watch and ward, to the
end that to the uttermoſt of their power
they may withſtand whatſoever thing
may annoy or hurt them. They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
out ſuch as die within their Hives;
but then their King dies, they
ſtir him nor from his place; but croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53223:62"/>
one upon anothers back about him,
they ſeem to lament and mourn, as
they make ſhew by their noiſe and
humming, and that ſo vehemently,
as that if their Keeper do not look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and take him from under them,
they will ſuffer themſelves rather to
die for hunger, then forſake him.
To be brief, every one of them is ſo
diligent at his work, as they cannot
bear it, that any ſhould be in their
company that ſhould not be occupied
in doing of ſomething; and this is
the cauſe why they drive away the
drone which will never work, neither
is good to any thing elſe, but to waſt
and devour the Honey. They hate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things evil ſcents: They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fly againſt the light, nor unto any
fleſh, or blood, or fat; but content
themſelves with Leaves and Flowers
only, which have a ſweet ſmelling
Juice; They take delight in pleaſant
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53223:62"/>
Songs and Voices, whereon it cometh
to paſs, that if they be ſcattered abroad,
they will be called together at the
delightful ringing of ſome Baſon or
ſmall Bells. To be brief, their faſhion
and manner of living is as it were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
in nature: But to give over all
further deſcribing of them, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf in delivering the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and duties required about their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and governing.</p>
            <p>He therefore that hath the charge
and over ſight of the Bees, muſt be
careful firſt of their Paſtures (whereof
we have made mention before) then
he ſhall diligently look unto their
Hives twice or thrice a Month, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at the Spring, and continuing
till <hi>November;</hi> for there is not that
time in the year, wherein they ſtand
not in need of ſomething, and if they
be well ordered, they will continue
ten years: They muſt be opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53223:63"/>
the Month of <hi>March,</hi> and the
Honey-combs made clean with a very
ſtrong and ſolid Feather, when as they
cannot be come by with the hand, that
ſo whatſoever filth is gathered there in
the time of Winter, may be caſt out,
and the Spiders Webs; which ſpoil all
the Combs, may be taken away, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
he ſhall ſmoke them all with
Oxe-dung burnt; for this Dung by a
certain affinity is gratefull and well
liked of Bees; but in the mean time
before he handle the Hives, be ſure
that he hath not been drunk the day
before, and that for the preſent he
come not near them without being
waſhed, made clean, and well appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralled;
in like manner he muſt abſtain
from all meats that are of ſtrong ſmell,
as are all Salt-meats and Souſed-meats,
and all things being ſtrong of ſcent, as
Garlick or Onions, or ſuch like things;
and let him carry in his mouth ſome
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53223:63"/>
thing that hath a good ſmell; for by
this means they will love him ſo well,
as that he may handle their Hives at his
pleaſure, and the little pretty Birds
will never hurt or annoy him. In
the Spring when they begin to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and increaſe, and to caſt their
Swarms, which ſo ſoon as they can
fly, deſire nothing more then to fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and not to abide with the old
ones, and much leſs to become Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
unto them, then it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to keep watch very diligently, and
that from ſeven or eight a Clock in
the Morning till two or three in the
Afternoon, that ſo they may not fly
unto ſome other place; wherefore if
you can diſcern and ſpie out their
Kings, it will be good to take their
Wings from them, if they make ſhew
of themſelves oftentimes, and ſeem
as though they would fly together with
their company, as alſo to caſt duſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53223:64"/>
them or water; for by theſe means
they will be kept from going away, ſo
that then they will not go out of their
own Yard, nor out of the limits of
their own Kingdom; neither will they
ſuffer their Troop to go far from them,
or elſe it will be good after they are
come forth, to aſtoniſh and occupy
their minds with the ſounding of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Braſs-pans or Kettles, ringing forth
ſoftly; for by how much you ſound
the ſtronglier, by ſo much they mount
the higher into the Air, and ſtray the
farther off; but if it be a gentle and
low ſound, they in like manner do
ſtay and keep themſelves near at hand,
and below; If you ſee them begin to
knit and haſten themſelves to the Bough
of a Tree, or to any buſh near the
ground, ſound your Pan or Baſon more
gently, and then having got a Hive
well prepared (as before is ſhewed in
taking of Bees in the Forreſt or Wood)
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53223:64"/>
ſhake them all therein, and cover them
ſo cloſe with a ſheet or other linnen
cloth, that they may not get out again,
and at night when they are all got up
into the top of the Hive, (as by that
time they will) remove your Hive,
and ſet it upon the board or ſeat of
Stone or Brick, where it ſhall continue,
If they reſt themſelves in ſuch a place
as where you cannot come at them with
your hand, then take a Pole and tye
to the end of it a Hive, ordered as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and ſprinkled with good Wine,
and hold it near unto the Bees, and
thus they will not fail to go into it.
Another way, and which is the beſt in
my opinion, is thus. When you ſee
that the young Kings ſhall be come
forth with their young Train, which
within a day or two will all become to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at the mouth of the old ſtock,
and ſhew by ſufficient ſigns and tokens
that they are deſirous of ſome place
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53223:65"/>
of their own, and peculiar to themſelves,
then ſet a Hive ready dreſt before them,
and they will go into it, and reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
therewith, and abide therein.</p>
            <p>It is to be known when this young
Hoſt will come abroad, by the noiſe
and humming which they will make in
the Hive three days before that they
purpoſe to come abroad, as if a Camp
of Warlike men would riſe up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move;
And to know when they make
this noiſe, he muſt lay his Ear at Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to every Hive, that ſo he may hear
the noiſe and humming when they
make any. And yet indeed this noiſe
and humming is ſometimes a ſign and
token of ſome fight or ſtrife raiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, as where there are more
Kings then one, which muſt be well
prevented; otherwiſe by ſuch civil
Wars and deadly fights, all the whole
Troop and Company will quickly be
overthrown and brought to nothing;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53223:65"/>
but this intended Combat is quickly
taken up with a Bowl of boiled Wine
ſet unto them, or elſe ſome Honied
VVine or other ſuch liquor; which by
its ſweetneſs is familiar to Bees for
theſe will appeaſe their fury; but yet
if you perceive, that theſe fights and
skirmiſhes are not thus ended, you
muſt make haſt to kill the Kings of the
Bees, which are the cauſe of ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and tumults, Theſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are ſo inraged with love towards
their King, that for to defend him,
they willingly caſt and expoſe their
own lives into open hazard againſt all
his Enemies, which come to aſſail
him, beſides other incredible obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance,
which they continually yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
            <p>At this time of the Spring it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſometimes cometh to paſs, that
by reaſon of the hardneſs of the winter
paſt, or of ſome diſeaſe or ſickneſs,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53223:66"/>
there is great want and ſcarcity of Bees
in old ſtocks, and this muſt be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
by putting a new Swarm into that
hive, killing the young King, that ſo
his Subjects may content themſelves
to live peaceably under the old; but if
you have not a Swarm, then the next
way is to put the Troops of two or
three ſuch diminiſhed ſtocks into one,
bedewing or ſprinkling the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with ſome ſweet Liquor, and after
to ſhut them up in the ſame Hive, and
ſet ſomething within it for them to
eat, until they be well wonted unto it,
and ſo to keep them three days cloſed
up, giving them a little freſh Air at
ſome ſmall and little holes.</p>
            <p>If Rainy weather continue long, that
the Bees cannot go out of their Hives
to ſeek paſtures, and to bring home
food unto their young brood, you
muſt not fail to help them with ſome
proviſion of honey, untill ſuch time
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53223:66"/>
as they ſhall be able to fly abroad to
get their own living, and to work
their Honey combs off, for otherwiſe
you ſhall quickly make an end of them,
as it oftentimes comes to paſs. All the
Summer they muſt gather Honey
(whereof we will ſpeak hereafter) and
at the ſame time every ten days their
Hives muſt be opened and ſmoked
with Oxe-dung, and afterwards be
cooled by watering the empty parts
of the Hive, and likewiſe be made
clean, and all Grubs taken out of them
if any be therein. In ſome fair day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the end of Autumn, you muſt
make clean their Hives; but ſee that
it be hot and calm weather; and all
the Winter you muſt not open nor
touch them; but keep them cloſe
within till the Sun-beams break forth
again for their comfort, ſtopping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whatſoever clefts and holes you
find, with Morter and Neats-dung
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53223:67"/>
mixed together, ſo that you leave
none open, but only a way for them to
paſs in and out; and alſo though their
Hives ſtand under Covert, yet cover
them again with Hackles made of
ſtraw, or ſome ſuch like thing, that as
much as is poſſible they may be kept
from cold and winds, which they fear
and abhor more then any other thing,
and you ſhall likewiſe provide, in caſe
of a hard Winter, to make proviſion
of Juice of ſweet Balm, Honied-water,
Sugered-water, Milk, or other Liquor,
which may be convenient for them,
in which Liquor you muſt ſteep pure
and clean Wooll, whereupon the Bee
ſitting, may ſuck out the Juice or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
that is therein.</p>
            <p>In the Combs are found Drones like
unto Bees, but greater, which (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be unprofitable, becauſe
they gather no food or ſuſtenance, but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53223:67"/>
eat up that which others bring in) yet
do ſerve for ſomething, for they hatch
the young brood, whereupon come
the ſmall Bees, and therefore you muſt
not kill them at all, but keep a certain
number; to the end that the Bees may
not grow ſlothful and idle.</p>
            <p>And to the end that they may not
endure hunger in Winter, and that
they may not eat up the Honey they
have made, and which is beſt untaken
from them, it will be good to give them
ſome dry Figs ſtampt or tempered in
water, or boiled Wine, and likewiſe
ſome Raiſons ſtamped and ſprinkled
with water, or elſe ſome Curranes
ſtampt with good Wine; or elſe to
caſt then in at the door of the Hive
ſome ſweet Liquors with Siringes, as
Milk, and eſpecially Goats-milk, as
the beſt of all the reſt, to bear out the
ſcarcity and poorneſs of the time until
Spring.</p>

               <p>THe Bee is ſubject unto the Plague,
in which caſe there is no more

preſently to carry them far off; they
are troubled with the Flux of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the beginning of the Spring, when
the Spourges are in the flower, and the
Elme-trees bring forth their Seed,
where they are given to feed greedily,
and with great Stomacks, having faſted
all Winter, and they be ſo deſirous to
eat of theſe new and young Flowers,
as ſome folk are to eat of new Apples,
and thereupon they die quickly, if it
be not ſpeedily fore-ſeen. For this
cauſe you muſt quickly help this Flux
of the Belly, with the Rinds or Seeds
of Pomgrannets dried, pounded and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53223:68"/>

Honey, and ſprinkled with ſweet
VVine, or with Honied-water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               <p>Bees ore often ſick when there is
great ſtore of Flowers; for the Bees
thereupon labour rather to make great
ſtore of Honey then any young Bees,
and ſo it cometh to paſs that many die
of exceſſive toil and travel; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when in the Spring time the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Fields are full of Flowers,
it will be good every third day to ſtop
up the places whereat they go in and
out of their Hives, leaving only a few
little holes, but ſuch as the Bees can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
go out at, that ſo they may be
turned from making of Honey, and
alſo when they perceive that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fill up all their waxen Chambers
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53223:69"/>
with Honey, they may apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to fill them with young
Bees.</p>
               <p>They fall into a Conſumption and
dry all away when they have indured a
very great heat or cold, and it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
derceived; for it is often ſeen,
that one beareth out of the Hive the
body of another that is dead, and and
ſome of thoſe that are within a Hive
become penſive and ſad after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a general mourning, which when
it happeneth to them, they muſt have
meat made of Honey, boiled and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
with Galls or dry Roſes.</p>
               <p>Sometimes there is ſuch ſtore of
Combs made, as that for want of Bees
they ſtand empty, whereupon it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that they rot and deſtroy the

            <div type="subpart">
               <p>The gathering of Honey, for which
there is ſo much labour taken all tbe
year, is chiefly effected at three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
time, as ſhortly after the Spring,
all the Summer, and in the beginning
of Autumn; but there cannot any
prefixed day or certain time be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

upon the finiſhing of the
Combs, for if you draw them out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be throughly wrought, the
Bees will grow malecontented, and
ceaſe to work any more, by reaſon of
the thirſt which they endure. The time
of gathering Honey is known by the Bees
ceaſing to make any great noiſe, but
turning the ſame into a ſoft and low
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53223:70"/>
buzzing; as alſo if the holes which are
above are ſtopt with VVax, and if the
Bees drive out the Drones, which
are like unto Bees, but a greater beaſt,
and altogether unprofitable, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking any pains; for they gather
no Food, but eat up that which others
bring in. The Hour of taking the
Combs is moſt commonly in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or Evening; For it is not good
to diſquiet or trouble them in the heat
of the day: The Hives muſt not be
wholly emptied, and ſo all the Fruit
taken out, but there muſt be left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

muſt be left, and a third taken; for

upon, The gathering of Honey moſt
commonly uſed and reaſonable, is but
to take the ripeſt Combs, and thoſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53223:70"/>
which are beſt perfected, and with all
of them unto two thirds; If the Hive
be but halfe full of Honey, then but
the halfe of that to be taken; and if
it be under halfe full, then proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;

with the Juice of this Herb annoint his
face and hands which ſhall gather the
Honey, to keep him that he be not

have a thin hood to compaſs and go
over his face, head and neck, and
Gloves on his hands; and by this
means he ſhall ſee at his pleaſure what
he goeth about to do, and yet be free
from the danger of the Bees ſtinging;
but notwithſtanding that you take
from their work of Honey and VVax;
yet you ſhould not kill them, nor
drive them far away if it be poſſible,
but keep them to draw more profit
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53223:71"/>
out of them afterwards, and when
there is no hope of good of them by

               <p>The good Farmer maketh gain of
every thing, and I dare boldly ſay,
that there are few things found about
a Countrey-houſe which are of
greater increaſe and advantage then
Honey. Again we ſee what Traffick
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make with it, who through
the barrenneſs of their Countrey, having
no other means to inrich themſelves,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53223:73"/>
do keep a great number of Bees. In
like manner do the Inhabitants about
<hi>Narbone,</hi> who ſend amongſt us great
quantities of Honey, which we make
ſerve for our uſe; but I would adviſe
ſuch as make a Traffick hereof, that
they would not gather any Honey but
that which is good; For the labour
and coſt is no leſs to nouriſh and keep
bad Bees, then thoſe which are good.</p>
               <p>The marks therefore of good Honey
are, that it be of a Yellow Colour,
pleaſant ſmell, pure, neat, and ſhining
in every part, ſweet and very pleaſant
to the Taſt, and yet notwithſtanding
this having a certain kind of acrimony
of ſhardneſs, of an indifferent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
betwixt thick and thin,
hanging together in it ſelf it ſuch ſort,
as that being lifted up with the fingers
end, it keepeth together in manner of
a direct line, without any breaking
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53223:73"/>
aſſunder; it muſt not be long in boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and yield but ſmall ſtore of Scum
when it doth boil, and that which is
gathered in Spring and Summer is
much better then that which is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Winter.</p>
               <p>Honey the newer it is, the better
it is, clean contrary to Wine, which
is more commended when it is old then
when it is new; this alſo is to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in Honey, that as Wine is beſt
at the Mid-Cask, and Oil at the top,
ſo Honey is beſt towards the bottom;
for by how much Honey is more firm
and heavy, ſo much it is the better as
being the ſweeter.</p>
               <p>The uſe of honey ſerveth for many
things, it prolongeth life in old
Folks, and in them which ate of a
cold Complexion; that it is ſo, we
ſee that the Bee which is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53223:74"/>
Creature, feeble and weak, liveth
Nine or Ten years by her feeding
upon Honey: To be ſhort, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
and keepeth from putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and corruption, which is the
cauſe that we have ſo many Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
made therewith, as Honey
of Violets, Roſes, Roſemary-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Mirtles, Bugloſs, and ſuch like.
We have have here in <hi>England</hi> a Drink
made of Honey, which is far more
pleaſant, and more wholſom then
many mighty Wines, and it it is
called Mead, or rather Metheglin,
this kind of Drink is very good
againſt Quartain Agues, ill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of the body, Diſeaſes of the
Brain, as the Falling-ſickneſs, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy
and Palſey, in which caſes Wine
is forbidden.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:53223:74"/>
The Countrey-men of <hi>Provence,</hi>
and the <hi>Italians,</hi> do make March-panes
of Honey, and Almonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which are ſingular good for them to
eat which are in a Conſumption; as
alſo to cauſe ſpetting, many other
Vertues there are in Honey, which I
ſhall here omit, and conclude with
the diſcourſe of an ancient Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who lived a retired life in a ſmall
Cottage in <hi>Kent,</hi> to ſome ſtrangers
who viſited him, wherein I ſhall a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
further acquaint you with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of Bees, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impertinent to the matter in
hand nor tedious to make you weary.
It follows thus.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen I have for the ſpace of
twenty years paſt dwelt in this place,
taking no delight in any thing, but
only in keeping my Bees, and
obſerving them, and this I find, which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53223:75"/>
had I not ſeen, I ſhould hardly have
believed, that they uſe as great wit by
indution and art by workmanſhip, as
ever man hath, or can, uſing between
themſelves no leſs juſtice then wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and yet not ſo much wiſdom as
Majeſty, inſomuch as thou wouldſt
think that they were a kind of people,
a Common-wealth for <hi>Plato,</hi> where
they all labour, all gather Honey, fly
altogether in a Swarm, eat in a Swarm,
and ſleep in a Swarm, ſo neat and
finely, that they abhor nothing ſo
much as uncleanneſs, drinking pure and
clean water, delighting in ſweet and
ſound Muſick, which if they hear but
once out of Tune, they fly out of
ſight,, and therefore are they called
the Muſes birds; becauſe they follow
not the ſound ſo much as the conſent;
they live under a Law, uſing great
reverence to their Elder; as to the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:53223:75"/>
They chooſe a King, whoſe Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
they frame, both braver in ſhew,
and ſtronger in ſubſtance, whom if
they find to fall, they eſtabliſh again
in his Throne, guarding him continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with no leſs duty then devotion, as
it were for fear he ſhould miſcarry,
whom they tender with ſuch faith and
favour, that whitherſoever he flyeth
they follow him, and if he cannot fly
they carry him; whoſe life they ſo
love, that they will not (for his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
ſtick to die; ſuch care have they
for his health, on whom they build all
their hope, if their Prince die, they
know not how to live, they languiſh,
weep, ſigh, neither in tending their
work, nor keeping their old ſociety;
and that which is moſt marvelous, and
almoſt incredible; if there be any that
hath diſobeyed his Commandments,
either on purpoſe or unwittingly, he
killeth himſelf with his own Sting,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53223:76"/>
as Evecutioner of his own ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The King himſelf hath his Sting,
which he uſeth rather for honour then
puniſhment, and yet albeit they live
under a Prince, they have their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and as great Liberties as ſtreight
Laws.</p>
               <p>They call a Parliament, wherein
they conſult for Laws, Statutes, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
chooſing Officers, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their King, not by affection, but
reaſon not by the greater part, but the
better, and if ſuch a one by chance be
choſen as is bad, then is there ſuch ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War and diſſention, that until he
be pluckt down, there can be no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</p>
               <p>Every one hath his Office, ſome
trimming the Honey, ſome working
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53223:76"/>
the Wax, ſome framing the Combs, and
that ſo artificially, that <hi>Dedalus</hi> could
not with greater art or excellency bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſpoſe the orders, meaſures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
diſtinctions, Joints and Circle;
divers hew, others poliſh, all are careful
to do their work ſo ſtrongly, as they
may reſiſt the Craft of ſuch Drones as
ſeek to live by their labours, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them to keep watch and ward, as
living in a Camp to others, and as in a
Court to themſelves, ſuch a care of
chaſtity, that they never ingender, ſuch
a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſire of cleanneſs, that there is not
ſo much as meat in all their Hives;
when they go forth to work they mark
the wind, the Clouds, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doth threaten either their ruine
or Reign, and having gathered out of
every Flower Honey; they return
laden in their Mouths, Thighs,
Wings,, and all the body, whom
they that tarried at home receive readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53223:77"/>
as eaſing their backs of ſo great
burdens.</p>
               <p>The King himſelf not idle, goeth
up and down intreating, threatning,
commanding, uſing the Councel of
a Sequel, but not looſing the dignity
of a Prince, preferring thoſe that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to greater authority, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe that loiter with due ſeverity;
all which things being much admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet this is moſt, that they are ſo
profitable, bring unto man both Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Wax, each ſo wholſom, that
we all deſire it; both ſo neceſſary that
we cannot be without them. Here is
a Common-wealth which oftentimes
calling to my mind, I cannot chuſe
but commend above any that either I
have heard or read of, where the King
is not to talk of, where there is ſuch
homage, ſuch love, ſuch lobour, that
I have wiſhed oftentimes rather be a
Bee, then not be as I ſhould be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:53223:77"/>
In this little Garden with theſe
Hives, in this houſe, have I ſpent the
better part of my life, yea and the beſt,
and thus contented with a mean E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and never curious of the high
Eſtate, I found ſuch quiet, that me
thinks he which knoweth leaſt, liveth
longeſt; inſomuch that I chooſe rather
to be an Hermit in a Cave, then a
Councellor in the Court.</p>
