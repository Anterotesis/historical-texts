            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>Grece</hi> there dwelt many Noble men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the which there was one named <hi>Alexto,</hi> a Lord of great account and eminencie, who was reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced and honoured of all
<pb facs="tcp:4062:11"/>
ſtrangers aſwell as of his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke people, and thoſe which did inhabite about him, not for the largeneſſe of his Patrimony, or the greatneſſe of his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (though they were ſuch as his neighbouring Peeres could not equalize) but the foundation and originall of his extolments ſprung from his grave, judicious and matchleſſe counſels, which ſo liberally he would extend on all ſorts: And alſo for his chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Almes and benevolences, with which hee plentifully would ſtore, ſuccour and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh thoſe, which were in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
            <p>But to our intended diſcourſe. This grave Senator had a Sonne who bearing his name, diſagreed not from his properties, but punctually had his Fathers he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke
<pb facs="tcp:4062:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inclinations, which made him as happy as meritorious, and was no leſſe honoured of all men, then the limits of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts did reach unto: whoſe daily practiſes were to excell each man in courteſie: but as he was not too much ſelfe-conceited, nor too lofty minded: ſo were not his thoughts fixed on any baſe or unworthy object, for they were as magnanimous as he nobly borne, which alwayes did aſpire unto the height of vertue, and no ſooner ſought but attained unto. For the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of his pourtraiture it was unparallel'd, yet had <hi>Venus</hi> lived in thoſe dayes, ſhe would have ſaid that her <hi>Adonis</hi> did exceed him far: who, in my judgment, was not worthy to beare the title of this young <hi>Grecians</hi> name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4062:12"/>But now as touching his fea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture and Phyſiognomy the co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lours of this my Rurall pencill is to ſable to him and figure him in ſo liberall, lively, and ample ſort, as the genius of the judicious Reader may conceive: And alſo fearing that in heraul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring forth his worth, ſome <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> interrupt mee as did <hi>Aeſehines</hi> the Orator: who being ſent from <hi>Athens</hi> to King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> at his returne from the Court to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> he much commended and extold the exquiſite beauty of PHILIP, with his admirable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution and exceſſive bearing of drinke. The which being related in the audience of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,</hi> hee preſently checkt <hi>Aeſehines,</hi> ſaying, that he made a woman of <hi>Philip</hi> for his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:4062:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a babling Sophiſter for his eloquence, and a ſpunge for his retaining of liquour.</p>
            <p>But now this young ALEXTO, was the onely joy and comfort of his Aged Sire, who having a deſire to have his Sonne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in Martiall Diſcipline, and alſo not ignorant for the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of amorous Damozels, he ſent him to <hi>Athens</hi> to bee edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in both, and alſo for his Comrade he ſent one <hi>Sandrico,</hi> a mans Sonne of great worth, and no leſſe valiant, then his owne Sonne, for <hi>Sandrico's</hi> Courage was apparently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and alſo proved moſt eminent.</p>
            <p>But in ſhort ſpace theſe two undanted ſpirits were landed at <hi>Athens,</hi> where not altogether ſo joyfull for their ſafe arrivall, as
<pb facs="tcp:4062:13"/>
for the good ſociety of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whom they linckt their fidelity in a fraternall vow, and bound their friendſhip with ſuch a Gordian knot, as the Aſſe was faſtened to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Apollo</hi> with.</p>
            <p>But after they had ſpent ſome few yeares in <hi>Athens,</hi> the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Emperour began to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne <hi>Greece,</hi> which ſtood in need of the ayd, power, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of theſe two Champions <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lexto</hi> and <hi>Sandrîco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſpeedily they were ſent for home, for the ſuccour of their aged Sires. In which warres they performed excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rare deeds of Chivalry, whereby they became the only bloſſoms and mirrours of thoſe times: for ſtill the honour of each day did adorne their Creſts.
<pb facs="tcp:4062:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But the acting of their exquiſit feates, to the no ſmall amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of each ſpectator, in which behold how retrograde fortune proved, that theſe two uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troled <hi>Greeks,</hi> became captivated by the arrivall and verball re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, which the ſhrill Trumpet of fame triumphed through all the Army.</p>
            <p>Which was of the exquiſite feature of the <hi>Roman</hi> Lady <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> of whom t'was ſaid, that if all the Goddeſſes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in an Vnion, they could not equalize her, the citation here of each particular of her unparalleliz'd worth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, would appeare too tedious. Only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this, that the report which flying fame did demonſtrate, did ſtill ſolicite the Eares of young <hi>Alexto</hi>: inſomuch, that it was
<pb facs="tcp:4062:14"/>
deepely rooted in his heart, and the fruit which ſprung from thence, was his daily ſquared ſighes, whereby he was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſabled to negociate his Martiall affaires. And thus was he enamoured of her whom his eyes were never bleſt with the proſpect of; yet daily did hee ſurfeit by the exceſſive quaffing of the nomination of her name, and did as much adore the ſame, as <hi>Pigmalion</hi> did the ſenſeleſſe Portraiture that he carved, on which he ſo much doted, that he made it his bedfellow.</p>
            <p>But all this while, we have not treated of the vexation and perplexity which <hi>Sandrico</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained: not that hee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled or captivated, by the amorous report of the terreſtiall Goddeſſe. But his griefe and
<pb facs="tcp:4062:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſability proceeded from the penſivenes, which he perceived his friend <hi>Alexto</hi> to be in.</p>
            <p>And as he could not conceive the originall from whence it ſprung, ſo would not ALEXTO relate unto him, and divulge the cauſe of his internall griefe, which was apparantly deſcryed by his externall hew, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy geſtures, yet poore <hi>Sandrico</hi> was not ſo well read in that loving Philoſophy as to conceive the nature of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall paſſion, for he was more fitte for the Tents of boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Mars,</hi> then the Temples of amorous Ladies.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe was ALEXTO before he was intrapped with the ſnare of affection: But alas! there is no heart ſo ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good, but Love can make ſimple.
<pb facs="tcp:4062:15"/>
And ſo it fell out that one time above the reſt, <hi>Sandrîco</hi> came into the Tent of his noble friend ALEXTO, and falling into a deepe diſcourſe: at the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroph</hi> &amp; period of each ſentence, <hi>Alexto</hi> would ſtill cloſe them up with ſuch a ſigh, that it would ſeeme to rent and cleave in ſunder the rafters of his Tent.</p>
            <p>At which <hi>Sandrîco</hi> laying faſt hold upon that occaſion, began to importune and requeſt him by all the permanent and unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned friendſhip, that ſo liberally he had and did ſhew on him, that hee would not conceale any longer that in obſtinacy, which might prove his utter ruine, but reveale it unto him, whereby it might be a mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his diſtreſſe, vowing to
<pb facs="tcp:4062:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
participate of the ſame, and alſo to lend him the propagation of all his future and faithfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</p>
            <p>Have you beheld how <hi>Iris</hi> ſtruts when as her Mantel's ſpred? Or have you mark't when as <hi>Sol</hi> riſeth with his radiant beames, he doth diſperſe the miſty Foggs and unſavoury va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, which were obſcured in the concavious places of the earth? Even ſo the true paterne of perfect friendſhip, which SANDRICO ſpred upon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEXTO partly diſperſt the ſable Clouds of that his preſent calamity. For when Birds ſing early, it doth betoken a faire day, but when the Sun-ſhine garniſhes it, it prognoſticates a ſhower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but after a ſtorme comes a calme: ſo after ALEXTO had
<pb facs="tcp:4062:16"/>
turned over the Volumes of numberleſſe ſighes, he unfolded his mind unto SANDRICO in theſe words.</p>
            <p>O unhappy J! Warres have their ends either houre, or death, the <hi>Scilian</hi> pooles by ſufficient helpe, may be drawne dry, the <hi>Talitian</hi> tree in time did wither, the <hi>Stoiticall</hi> floud did drowne the uſurping Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>But Love, O Love! Thou haſt no period, neither can J bring thee to a compromiſe delay to thee, is the unhappy Headſman, that holding mee, neither ſaves nor kills, but leaves me to languiſh in a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning frozen zone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sandrico</hi> being attentive, by this underſtood, that an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous paſſion had creep'd into
<pb facs="tcp:4062:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him, and thus began modeſtly to chide him.</p>
            <p>Oh quench theſe ſmothering ſparkes, leſt ſuffered they grow to a perpetuall flame, and like the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Cell, ſcorch all that doth approach it nigh, and at laſt with Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it ſelfe; But (Oh my friend) let the Buckets of thy undanted courage, draw forth of the noble Well of thy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo much reaſon; as to quench this unmartiall Agony.</p>
            <p>Let not thy brave, heroicke mind, ſtoope unto ſo baſe and aſcivious a lure fit for none but Panicall ruſticks, that never were trained in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Warres, whoſe whips &amp; prongs are Speares and Lances; Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, Shields, and Targets, and blew Bonnets, Creſts and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
<pb facs="tcp:4062:17"/>
I bluſh at thy thoughts, and could take pleaſure to deridefan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: were it not in thee, but now J ſee the Poets did well, when as they firſt fained <hi>Cupid,</hi> that diſloyall Sycophant to be blind. For had he ſeene thy worth, hee never durſt attempt a ſhaft, as thus rovingly hath light upon thee, the which repulſe, and ſend backe againe in as many pieces about his Corpes, as there be ſands in the Lydian ſhores: for what's his bolt only headed with a voluntary deſire, and feathered with a quicke conſent, which is ſhot from a bow of Jdleneſſe. Then rowſe up thy diſordered ſenſes, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Souldiours Phraſe; <hi>Dulcior eſt Mors quam Amor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle, Socrates,</hi> Nay, hadſt thou taken Lectures from <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and ſtudied all thy life
<pb facs="tcp:4062:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
time for Poems, to feed the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able incredulity of theſe inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Dames, either they would baniſh thee, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did <hi>Ovid,</hi> or condemne thee to dye in the height of their diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>As for beauty (their chiefeſt pride) it is but Times flower which as it is delicate, ſo it ſoone withers; for it is like the Colours which <hi>Phidias</hi> drew, which ſeemed admirable, and to the view moſt excellent, but did vaniſh and impaire at every aeriall breath. You know that VENUS the Matron of them all was faire, the ſooner to make a wanton, alſo HELEN the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of our <hi>Grecian</hi> Land, but aske <hi>Troy</hi> of her qualities.</p>
            <p>Therefore when as you have runne through the Alphabet of praiſing fictions, as in ſaying
<pb facs="tcp:4062:18"/>
Worthieſt Miſtreſſe, my ſervice lyes proſtrated unto your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, the which if you pleaſe to command, I ſhall think of none other happineſſe, but in the accompliſhment of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Or ſhould'ſt thou figure thy Miſtreſſe, as the Poets did <hi>Venus</hi> to ride in a Golden Chariot, drawne with ſilver breaſted Doves, or as <hi>Iuno</hi> with golden plumed Peacocks: At the laſt, when as they are ſatiſfied by drawing the day of extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they will ſeeke to place thee amongſt the ſtarres, as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did <hi>Pythagentes,</hi> for a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, a very lofty ſeate but low in reward, and this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe now a dayes of our <hi>Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Damoſels. Therefore uſe no phyſicke but
<pb facs="tcp:4062:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the conſideration of theſe, which forth of the ſeriouſneſſe of my love to thee, I have beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned to relate.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Sandrico</hi> had made an end of this diſcourſe, <hi>Alexto</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to anſwer him, as followeth, My deareſt <hi>Sandrico,</hi> had <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius</hi> but ten <hi>Platoes</hi> to tell him truth, he had not erred, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon</hi> wiſh't but ten ſuch as <hi>Neſtor,</hi> to vanquiſh all his Enemies at <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and to ſet our <hi>Greekes</hi> at liberty: But thou art both a <hi>Plato</hi> and a <hi>Neſtor,</hi> unto me, thy counſels are both true and good: But alas! my heart is filled with ſuch an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous paſſion, that it admits no attentiveneſſe unto thy friendly advertiſements. Yet J muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I have heard that a womans love is like the river <hi>Tedocheus,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:4062:19"/>
being taſted unto ſome, it proves venomous and banefull, but unto others as their daily nutriment: Or as the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Image, which unto ſome Champions at the triumph there, it would caſt amorous glances, and on others diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lookes and frownes. And alſo as on the <hi>Saxtenion</hi> Mount there was a Caſtle inchanted by the <hi>Necromancer Baſtellotus,</hi> wherein he cauſed to bee tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his faire <hi>Polidarca,</hi> for her cruelty towards him, at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of which he had placed a Braſen Bull, a fierce Dragon and helliſh furies: Theſe were <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> whereby none could vanquiſh nor unlooſe, but onely he, which was the Mirrour of <hi>Rome,</hi> for all perfection. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contiodes</hi> and hee finiſhed the
<pb facs="tcp:4062:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Inchantment.</p>
            <p>Then O <hi>Sandrico,</hi> ſuffer mee to try my fortune, which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture may prove as theſe have, and why may not I with <hi>Calapaſſus</hi> take a turne in Dancing with <hi>Ióves</hi> Daughters in the <hi>Pierian</hi> Greene?</p>
            <p>Tuſh, tuſh, ſaid <hi>Sandrico,</hi> remember thy owne ſpeeches, wherefore did <hi>Baſtelotus</hi> cauſe <hi>Pilodorea</hi> to be tortured, but for her cruelty towards him, and may not thy Miſtreſſe prove as marble hearted?</p>
            <p>Alſo, remember how long <hi>Lodovicus</hi> was enamoured of the Lady <hi>Dantriſſea,</hi> and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull ſhe prooed unto him; As alſo when he dyed, he deſired that his heart ſhould be ſhewed unto her, wherein ſhe perceived her owne ſimilitude, as tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb facs="tcp:4062:20"/>
as an object is by the Suns reflexion in a Chryſtall Mirror, yet ſhe regarded it not, but eſteem'd it ridiculous: But ſhould thy Miſtreſſe prove ſo marble-hearted, I would become <hi>Santeticus,</hi> cauſing her to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted in that ſort, as hee did <hi>Dantriſſia,</hi> for being the death of his friend <hi>Lodovicus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, he cauſed her to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a boyling Caldron a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt furies, with the portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his friend <hi>Lodovicus</hi> in her view, holding his blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heart in his hand, whereby ſhee ſhould alſo gaze on her own diſſembling Phiſiognomy, and on <hi>Lodovicus</hi> front was engraven in Capitall letters this motto.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thy baſe diſſembling face, did cauſe my death,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4062:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thy flattering Tongue, makes this to bleed on earth;</l>
               <l>Torments I did ſuſtaine in life for thee:</l>
               <l>And now in Death thus tortured ſhalt thou be.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Secondly, her nutriment was the excrement of <hi>Toades, Adders</hi> and <hi>Serpents,</hi> which was diſh't in the naturall Scull of <hi>Lodovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> ſerved her by Satyres which were her attendants, with ſtrange deformed beaſts.</p>
            <p>In this ſort ſhe ſtill remained which is too good for all ſuch diſloyall Sycophants. But my <hi>Alexto,</hi> if this amorous conceit doe but once creepe into thee, I doe much dread the ſucceſſe, for thou, that art for beauty like the faire <hi>Romans</hi> Paramour, for Wiſedome like <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4062:21"/>
whom <hi>Circe</hi> could not inchant, for Courage like a ſecond <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſeeing thou art adorned with all theſe graces, bequeath not thy ſelfe, and it, unto ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a paſſion, which allowes nothing excellent, but what it likes, for it ſhadoweth beggery, in <hi>Crates,</hi> whom <hi>Hiſparata</hi> thought, and eſteemed rich for his love, but contrariwiſe, <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perea</hi> accompted <hi>Croeſus</hi> a poore fellow, becauſe ſhe diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him. Then yeeld not thy ſelfe to this fancy which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in extreames, and admits no reaſon, for thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4062:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>Remember alſo thou art a Warriour, whoſe undanted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, was never yet quail'd by any, neither forraigne Foe, nor home bredenemy. For the name of noble ALEXTO is ſufficient to vanquiſh Troopes of armed men.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Sandrico</hi> had uſed all the skill he could to perſwade his friend ALEXTO from the entertaining of his new fancie <hi>Alexto</hi> began thus to anſwer him.</p>
            <p>My deare <hi>Sandrico,</hi> as the wounded Deere wringeth forth teares, and as the Myrtle depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed yeeldeth gumme, ſo by the deepe impreſſion, which J have conceived of faire <hi>Angelica's</hi> beauty, my ſighs leade mee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive to picke up a mourner in the time of my owne teares: beſides, my SANDRICO,
<pb facs="tcp:4062:22"/>
the Gods ſhould doe nature too much wrong, if they ſhould place an Adamant heart in a Chryſtall face, therfore twit me no more with <hi>Veſta,</hi> for <hi>Venus</hi> is ſhe who can chaſtiſe <hi>Angelica</hi> though ſhe did glory in beauty, as <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> who ſtooping to kiſſe his owne ſhadow in a brooke was immediately drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein; Beſides <hi>Lucina</hi> is a Goddeſſe which muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, for marriage is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and to live unmatcht it were a wrong to nature. The <hi>Phoenix</hi> when ſhee is nigh her end, builds her neaſt with all ſweet ſpices, and odoriferous perfumes, as cloſe unto the Sunnes reflexion as ſhe can, whereby at her deceaſe his ſplendidious and Radiant beams ſhould revive a young <hi>Phoenix</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4062:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
forth of the Aſhes of the olde deceaſed one.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Sandrico</hi> ſhould either man or woman dye without the propagation of Iſſue, their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and reſemblances, could not be left behind, but by a dead ſubſtance as <hi>Doſtitetius</hi> was, whoſe portraiture was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ere he died by the cunning <hi>Artiſt</hi>; therefore I ſay Love is Divine, and Marriage honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, eſpecially to thoſe that are the paragons of this terreſtriall Paradiſe.</p>

            <p>So neither will nor can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing aſſwage the fervent anguiſh of a Loyall Lover, but the true acceptance of the beloved; For what ſpoke APOLLO, hee whoſe skill in compounds and ſimples excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all mens (for <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> were not worthy to carry his Drugs, when as an Amorous paſſion crept into him) hee ſaid, <hi>Hei mihi quod nullis amor eſt medicabilis herbis</hi>; Beſides, Love, that Divine paſſion, if it bee over raſh dealt with, it burnes dim, and

            <p>But my <hi>Sandrico</hi> if my faire <hi>Angelica</hi> would looke vpon me as the affectionated mother on her ſmiling Infant, or with ſuch an amiable countenance as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranelia</hi> did on <hi>Stol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſuch ſtrength and freſh Courage from the feiture of his beautious Love which did ſo repleniſh his empty veines, that in ſhort time he ſubdued his haughty Foes, and brought them to ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even ſo an amorous glance from <hi>Angelica,</hi> would revive my drooping heart, which is in a fierce conflict for her ſake, and is almoſt vanquiſht by death, his deadly enemy.</p>
            <p>But ô <hi>Sandrico,</hi> doe but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Love is; for as there is no cut to vnkindneſſe; ſo there is no haughty ſpirit, but that the quinteſſence of Love, can chaſtiſe with Celerity.</p>

            <p>I feare, quoth <hi>Sandrico,</hi> that this fiction of praiſing Love will not laſt long, for the Nightingale hath but one <hi>May</hi> in twelve moneths, and whereas thou haſt ſurfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by quaffing the poyſoned Cup of bitter Love, thou ſhalt finde the reward in the bottome thereof, to bee but the dreggs of thy counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting Miſtreſſes hate; yeeld not too much to the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency thereof, for you know not with how much gall and

            <p>For <hi>Phyliſtis</hi> waighing his Miſtreſſe in the ballance of equity; found the longer hee kept her the lighter ſhe was, and as the Marble drops teares againſt every ſtorme, ſo a woman will faine wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeping

            <p>With theſe and ſuch like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes they ſpent the time untill Supper was ready to bee ſerved, at which ſhe cauſed <hi>Alexto</hi> to be placed as her oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, whereby amorous glances paſt on both ſides: and as for <hi>Sandrico</hi> he was as joyfull thereof, as if he were a ſharer in his friends preſent happineſſe: but while Supper time laſted, there began a demand amongſt the Nobility, wc<hi rend="sup">h</hi> ſhould firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the liſts in the morning, but being they could not decide this controverſie between themſelves it was proffered to the Lady <hi>Angelica</hi> to define the ſame,
<pb facs="tcp:4062:36"/>
ſhee having the diſpoſing did command ALEXTO the firſt entrance: he no little glad thereof ſeem'd loath, yet willing to accept ſo great a favour, but he ſoon perceived a murmuring amongſt the nobility, and not without juſt cauſe, that a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Forraigner ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe them of their right, and honour which did appertaine unto them, by reaſon thereof he requeſted of the Lady to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and to ſurrender that favour which ſhe had imployed upon him unto ſome nobler perſon, whoſe deſerts might exceed his.</p>
            <p>The Lady entring into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration with her ſelfe, did place it, though unwillingly, of the Lord of <hi>Montulus,</hi> unto the which all the reſt willingly did
<pb facs="tcp:4062:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
agree, and as for the next places they did accord amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: by that time they had brought this unto a compremiſe Supper was ended, where after ſome paſtimes, Bed time did approach, where each one was conducted, but <hi>Alexto</hi> and <hi>Sandrico</hi> were moſt ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly lodged next unto the Ladies Chamber, to which they were ſome part of the way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by her owne perſon, then leave being taken, and ſweet reſt bequeathed on both ſides, the Lady departed, and they entred their Chamber, the which they found ſo garniſht with uneſtimable Jems, and adorned with ſuch gorgeous hangings, that it ſeemed rather to entertaine ſome Monarch then their perſons: but the

doore being cloſed and none reſident but themſelves, ALEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TO began to burſt forth as thus.</p>
            <p>O fortunate ſtarre that thus propitiouſly hath ſmiled on me, and adorned me with the beams of uneſtimable favour, in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Correſpondent amity betwixt Lady <hi>Angelica</hi> and my ſelfe!</p>
            <p>Shee now have I beheld which is the onely Phoenix of this Terreſtriall Paradice, and ſole Mirrour for natures orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Sandrico</hi> was ſtrucken dumme, and was loath to anſwer in ſome ſpace, being in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage with himſelfe for his precedent abuſing the Feminine ſexe before he had knowne any

            <p>And thus he turnes unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexto</hi> in <hi>Angelicaes</hi> preſence, thou diddeſt ſeeme to exceed <hi>Cicero</hi> the moſt eloquent of all Oratours, canſt thou now in as ample ſort figure her comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?

anſwered <hi>Sandrico</hi>; and after theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches ſleepe did begin to faſten on them both, whereby they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the reſt of their diſcourſe untill the morning that they did awake, unto which reſt weele leave them being loth to diſturbe them any further, and returne unto the Lady <hi>Angelica,</hi> who being in her bed could take no reſt, but ſtill her Genius conceived an apparition, which ſeemed to be the pourtraiture of <hi>Alextos</hi> countenance, thus was ſhe ſtill perplexed, being greedy to be ſatisfied of his Parentage, then did ſhe conceive him to be noble, by reaſon of the rare perfections that ſhee had conceived in him: theſe things being conſidered by
<pb facs="tcp:4062:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her, ſhe reſolved to conceite nothing of him, untill ſhe had viewed his feates of Armes, which were to be performed on the Morne, and with this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſhe betooke her ſelfe to ſlumber, but all in vaine, becauſe ſhe could not ſhake off her new conceived fanſie: but being ſhe is deſirous of reſt, wee will leave her to enjoy it, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing her her hearts content, and all other Ladies that are in her caſe, and becauſe ſilence poſſeſt them all for this preſent we will requeſt your patience to the morning.</p>
            <p>Which being come, the Lady<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ANGELICA was the firſt that was awake, for ſhe was moſt perplext in mind; <hi>Alexto</hi> and <hi>Sandrîco</hi> were
<pb facs="tcp:4062:40"/>
ſtill ſecure in a ſweete ſlumber, for ALEXTO had received ſo much pleaſure over night at thoſe uneſtimable favours, with the which the Lady did adorne him, that he had turned all his precedent deſpaire into hope of a good ſucceſſe. But by this time ANGELICA had beautified her Corpes with her ſumptuous and gorgious Veſtments, accompanied with her amiable lookes, ſhe went forth of her Chamber and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into the Hall, where the Nobility did attend and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her approach, in which ſhe was no ſooner entred, but ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being given on both ſides, ſhe aſcended her chaire of State, where we leave her in diſcourſe with the Nobility, and returne unto <hi>Alexto,</hi> who by this time had a viſion, the which gave him
<pb facs="tcp:4062:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to underſtand, that they all were in readineſſe to enter the liſts, onely expecting his comming. At the departure of this Viſion he leaps out of his bed awaking his friend <hi>Sand.</hi> telling him that they had over-ſlipt their time. By the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you muſt conceive they could have no great diſcourſe, but the time they had for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them, in which <hi>Sandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> thus began; Noble <hi>Alexto,</hi> you laſt night undertooke to enter into the liſts, as one of the kn<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> of <hi>Angelica,</hi> in which my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall be that you may return victorious, gaining the honor of the day &amp; that triumphant glory may adorne thy Creſt, for by the atchieving of this heroick action in the ſight of the vertuous Lady, it will either procure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thee thy hearts content, or make thee Loves vaſſaile for ever, if once
<pb facs="tcp:4062:41"/>
condemned to dye in the hate of her diſpleaſure, and at thy return if proſperous, we will conclude in what ſort to reveale the nature of thy apparant paſſion unto her ſoft attention.</p>
            <p>By this time they both were ready, and comming down into the Hall, the time was at hand of their departure into the Liſts, each one (doing his duty unto the Lady) tooke their places after the Lord <hi>Mon.</hi> who over night was aſſign'd the firſt that ſhould enter. So the Lady with the reſt of her attendants of exquiſite beauty deſcending from their ſeats, and being ready to take places, <hi>Angelica</hi> requeſted <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> to conduct her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which he was not unwilling to imbrace, in the meane time <hi>Sandrîco</hi> went to prepare his Horſe and
<pb facs="tcp:4062:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Martiall accoutrements, which were prepared for that exploit, ALEXTO having placed the Lady for her proſpect, and doing her reverence, taking his leave, ſhe tooke a Scarfe, that was moſt ſumptuous to behold, imbrodered with Pearle and Gold, the which ſhe cauſed to be tyed about his Arme, wiſhing his happy ſucceſſe and aſſiduall proſperity; for ſhe ſeemed much enamoured of him, but cautious leſt he ſhould conceive any thing thereof.</p>
            <p>But how much joy <hi>Alexto</hi> conceived of this uneſtimable favour, I want the power of expreſſion, therefore reſigne that to the learned judgements, to conceive of. But in this extaſie <hi>Alexto</hi> came unto his friend <hi>Sand.</hi> relating to him in briefe
<pb facs="tcp:4062:42"/>
what had happened betweene the pierleſſe Lady and himſelfe, at the audience whereof <hi>Sandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> conceived no ſmall content: but becauſe ALEXTO would not be accompted prolixious, he mounted his fiery Steed, being accompanied with his friend, and by that time, the reſt were placed, and after reverence done unto the Lady, he entered the liſts, cauſing his horſe to corvet in that ample ſort that he aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht each ſpectatour.</p>
            <p>And you muſt conceive if the Lady was enamoured of him before, how much more was ſhe now ſurpriſed by his matchleſſe actions. But the Trumpets warning unto the firſt encounter Lord <hi>Montulus</hi> and <hi>Saſetus</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> Knight met in ſuch a full Carreere, that
<pb facs="tcp:4062:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Saſetus</hi> ſtrooke <hi>Montulus</hi> out of his Saddle upon the Crupper of his horſe, But <hi>Montulus</hi> loath to paſſe by without clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming quittance with him, ſtrooke ſo outragiouſly on the breaſt of <hi>Saſetus,</hi> that his Lance ſhattered in pieces, and nimbly clapping into the Saddle again, meeting ſo furiouſly together, diſmounted <hi>Saſetus</hi> tumbling him and his horſe unto the Earth, ſo <hi>Montulus</hi> paſſed by not being further indamag'd, but <hi>Saſetus</hi> ſeeing himſelfe foyled, eſpecially in the preſence of the Lady <hi>Angelica,</hi> unto whoſe acceptance his aſſiduall devotions were bent, imagining that it would have beene his perpetuall diſgrace couragiouſly drew forth his owne Sword, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his feet, ſheathed it again
<pb facs="tcp:4062:43"/>
in his owne bowels, uttering theſe words, Thus nobly will J dye, rather then live diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This unexpected ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageme proved an aſtoniſhment unto each Spectator, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally miraculous unto the Ladies: but after ſome pacification, and the cauſe of this outrage being fully related, it was very well approved of both by the Ladies and Nobility, whereby the Juſts did ſtill proceed which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had diſſolved. But had not <hi>Montulus</hi> beene animated and recomforted by <hi>Alexto</hi> &amp; others, he had ſurely endangered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for very anguiſh and griefe that ſo noble a Spirit ſhould fall by his feeble Arme.</p>
            <p>But having recollected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he was ready to encounter with the next that made againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4062:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>ALEXTO as yet was loath to encounter with <hi>Montulus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he had overthrowne moſt part of thoſe Knights there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, imagining thereby that <hi>Montulus</hi> ſhould be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extold of each ſpectator, and that the Ladies would affirme that he was the choiſeſt of all <hi>Europe,</hi> for Kingly Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and when as <hi>Montulus</hi> ſhould be adorned with theſe favours, he would inſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine to juſt with him, being fully aſſured that having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one amorous glance of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from his Miſtreſſe eye, he ſhould be able to diſmount and captivate <hi>Montulus,</hi> and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine all honour unto himſelfe.</p>
            <p>But as he was ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mering, and contemplating of this matter, his friend <hi>Sand.</hi> perceiving no
<pb facs="tcp:4062:44"/>
Knight prepared for the next encounter, doing reverence unto the Ladies ſpeeded towards <hi>Montulus,</hi> and encountered with him ſo furiouſly, that he broke his Lance upon the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of <hi>Montulus</hi> in ſuch outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſort, that fire flew forth of his Beaver, at which <hi>Montulus</hi> being much amazed, ſuppoſed that <hi>Iove</hi> had ſent a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt upon his Creſt, that did ſo ſtartle him. But meeting both againe, <hi>Montulus</hi> being in the height of his fury, and holding himſelfe perpetually diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, gave <hi>Sandrico</hi> ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combendibus upon his breſt, that beate him of one ſide of his horſe, but he ſpeedily recovered himſelfe, ALEXTO meeting of him imbraced him in his armes vowed to be revenged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4062:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>But by this time <hi>Montulus</hi> had recovered himſelfe, &amp; was fitted for the next encounter, the which was entertained by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> who doing reverence unto the Ladies, making his pampered Courſer flye, as if he ſcorned to be control'd, and meeting with <hi>Montulus</hi> in a full Careere bore him unto the earth with his Saddle betwixt his leggs, cauſing his horſe to tumble on the other ſide, but <hi>Montulus</hi> broke his Lance upon the breſt of <hi>Alexto</hi> who paſſed on his courſe ſtill ſo upright, as if that none had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered with him, the which cauſed ſuch a generall applauſe, as if he had bin ſome demy god.</p>
            <p>But becauſe <hi>Alexto</hi> ſhould not vant long of his proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, ſome of theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

at his actions ſet forth together againſt <hi>Alexto</hi> being 8 in number, all which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very nobly, but to their ſmall comforts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the firſt two he run through with his lance, tumbling them from their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to meaſure their length on the ground, the third being with him ere he could unſheath his furious Sword, he lifted up his Martiall fiſt, and ſtroke ſuch a ponderous blow upon his Creſt, that he laid him breathleſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, making his brains flye about his horſe heeles.</p>
            <p>Then drawing his bloody weapon, with which ere any reſcue was made, he had bereaved three of the other five of life, and left the other two ſore wounded the which ſpectacle cauſed no little admiration to <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4062:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>But the Ladies being ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, forſook their ſeats, and <hi>Angelica</hi> being accompanied with her train entred the liſts as <hi>Juno</hi> among the Gods, to nip this early quarrell in the bud, as alſo fearing further outrage.

               <hi>Angelica</hi> ſeemed to ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize this his paſſion, &amp; to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of his griefe, and taking him by the hand raiſed him from the ground, and refuſing his Sword, ſaid unto him, moſt valiant Knight, your actions me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite fame, deſerving to be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Hectors</hi> Regiſter for a perpetuall memory, which may ſurvive after Ages: I grieve to behold the outrage and uncivill affront that you have ſuſtained in my preſence, but every of them have ſuſtained their juſt deſerts from your Martiall hands for their preſumptuous fact, with theſe and ſuch like words ſhe freed <hi>Alexto,</hi> requeſting that the Corpes of the deceaſed Knights ſhould be honourably interred, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Heſetus</hi> to be entomb'd in

her owne Chappell with a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous monument over him, the charge of which being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to certaine nobles there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ſhe with ALEXTO and the reſt departed into the Pallace where ſhe entertained them very royally with Muſicke and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes for the ſpace of three or foure dayes. But ALEXTO was not content therewith, but ſtill did watch opportunity for a private diſcourſe, but ſtill his intent was fruſtrate, the Lady <hi>Angelica,</hi> on the other ſide was as much perplexed for the ſame opportunity.</p>
            <p>But ſtill <hi>Alexto's</hi> heart did conſume, yet was he fixt and conſtant in the determination, which is the <hi>Nepenthe</hi> which who ſo drinketh of, forgetteth all care and griefe, for <hi>Agrippa</hi>

            <p>Tuſh, ſaid <hi>Sandrico,</hi> faint-hearted Lawyers are not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put in plea at the barre of Love. A cowardly lover with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope ſhall never gaine faire love with good fortune, beſides ſadneſſe is the puniſhment of the heart, but hope the Medicine of diſtreſſe; for, it is a pleaſant paſſion of the mind which doth not onely promiſe us thoſe things which we moſt deſire, but thoſe things alſo which we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſpaire of.</p>
            <p>But for all Poetry, quoth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEXTO, give me Oratory, for it is the ſpurre to Armes: for the eloquent Oration of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> was the firſt Trumpet that gave <hi>Philip</hi> an Alarum to the

               <hi>Aſian</hi> warres, which <hi>Alexander</hi> his Sonne without intermiſſion ended.</p>
            <p>But I muſt confeſſe unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table eloquence is like <hi>Cypres</hi>-trees which are comely in alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude but bare no fruit, and bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Orators are the theeves of time compared to empty veſſels, which give a greater ſound then thoſe which are full, but a dry thirſty eare muſt be therewith watered. Eloquence grounded vpon reaſon is able to content and ſatisfie the hearing.</p>
            <p>In this diſcourſe we will leave them &amp; returne to ſpeake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Lady <hi>Angelica,</hi> who though ſhe was ſo ſuperbious, yee like a Faulcon ſhe could ſtoope to a goodly Lure, for ſhe much admired their prolixity from her, which drew her to

            <p>Sir, I know not how to accept theſe lines, becauſe I deeme them to proceed from preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and arrogancy; and becauſe I favoured his perſon in the liſts, he imagins me enamoured of him, but his hopes foole him, if ſo he deemes; or have I ſhowne him ſome other extraordinary favors that he ſhould thus abuſe my vertues meaning? But I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he reacheth me to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and circumſpect in all my actions, confining my lookes vpon imoveable objects, leſt others with himſelfe miſdeeme them.</p>

               <hi>Sandrico</hi> perceiving her ſtill to proceed, emboldened himſelfe to interrupt her thus.</p>
            <p>Thrice illuſtrious Lady, his perpetuall ſervice is offered to your Divine perſon; for at your feete he caſts the hope of his worlds happineſſe, uniting the remainder of his life therewith: for he, and that little, all nature endowed him with, lyes ſole at your diſpoſing.</p>
            <p>Then ſeeing you are the firſt Starre that ever ſeduc't him to ſtudy Aſtronomy, let him not periſh by the reflexion of your ingratitude, ſeeing he is loyally affected towards you.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Angelica</hi> fearing to be entrapped, requeſted his vnwelcome abſence, adding that by his lines ſhe perceived no forcing effects; beſides, that ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:4062:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had vowed Chaſtity, and that a Monarch ſhould not cauſe her infringe her former paſſed vowes to <hi>Vaſta.</hi> But turning aſide, ſhe ſaid, ſhe muſt give her conſcious to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> lie; for though a Monarch ſhould not, yet <hi>Alexto</hi> could.</p>
            <p>So pulling a Jem fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her Ivery neck, freely preſented it to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drico</hi> requeſting him to pacifie his friend, and ſo away ſhe paſt &amp; <hi>Sandrico</hi> returned vnto his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Alexto.</hi> But <hi>Angelica</hi> ſeeing ſhe had <hi>Alexto</hi> at a bay, vowed to keep him off to try his conſtancy and a while to triumph over him while he was in Captivity.</p>
            <p>But by this time <hi>Sandrico</hi> had met with ALEXTO and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating vnto him what anſwer he received from the beautious Lady, which cauſed ALEXTO to fall into a ſecond deſperation. But <hi>Sandrico</hi> ſhewing him her
<pb facs="tcp:4062:52"/>
favour recomforted him to ſend a ſecond Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>My ALEXTO, ſaid, he it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall for women a while to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe that which is offered, but death to them if they be denyed of their demands. And he that looketh to have the pureſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall water muſt dig deepe; and he that delighteth in ſweet Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, and Madrigals muſt ſtraine Art vnto the higheſt: So he that ſeeketh to win his Love, muſt not ſpare labour nor feare hazarding his life; for Birds are trained with ſweet Calls, but caught with long nets, ſo lovers are inſnared with faire lookes, but intangled with diſdainfull eyes. Then let me be the bearer of another Epiſtle, for he that gathereth Roſes muſt be content to prick his fingers, and he that
<pb facs="tcp:4062:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would conquer a womans affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt not be repulſt by ſharpe words, and the wiſeſt ſort of them are commonly tickled with ſelfe love.</p>
            <p>Come then, lay hold of my adviſe, for it is better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the ſtedfaſt counſell of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed policy, then the raſh enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of malapert boldneſſe; for as a <hi>Cameleon</hi> hath all Colours ſave white; ſo a flatterer hath all points ſave honeſty. I wiſh thee to proceed as if the ſubject was my owne.</p>
            <p>I never found thee otherwiſe, anſwered <hi>Alexto,</hi> but it is an eaſie thing for a man being in health, to give good counſell to another that is Sicke, but with ſuch facility the Sicke man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow it; but Ile write once more ere other exploits Ile try.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Sandrico</hi> anſwered, he had brought him the loadſtone of perfection, and ſo delivered to him the J em, telling him, that he ſhould not omit that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:4062:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but diligently proſecute that proffered opportunity, which was throwne him from the Lap of fortune, which certifying him alſo where he ſhould finde the Lady in her Bower.</p>
            <p>ALEXTO not having liberty to gratifie <hi>Sandrico's</hi> diligence, departed with much expedition vnto the private walkes where he found the Lady alone, melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly playing vpon a Lute, warbling there vnto an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ode, but ſhe no ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him come, but laid aſide her Inſtrument, and diſcending from her Bower tooke him by the hand, being hardly able to diſſemble her paſſion without apparence thereof, for it is their imbecillity not to retaine their affection long without demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration vnto the affectionated,
<pb facs="tcp:4062:55"/>
but ſhe thus begun to excuſe her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Worthy Knight, I little ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that your eares ſhould have been auditors of my vnci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Ode, but let us mount up yonder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>owen &amp; contemplate a while for I received two Epiſtles from you, the which being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; I conceive thereby that an amorous paſſion hath poſſeſt you, the mitigation of which you affirmed to be reſident with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Center of my bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, but I know not how to impoſe the aſſurance of my affection on any Knight, becauſe Lovers oathes are like fetters made of Glaſſe that gliſter faire, but couple no conſtraint; beſides love maketh a man that is naturally addicted unto vice to be endued unto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, forcing himſelfe to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb facs="tcp:4062:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto all laudable exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that thereby he may obtain his loves favour; as alſo coveting to be skilfull in elocution that thereby he may allure her, and to excell in Muſicke that by his melody he may intice her, to frame his ſpeech in a perfect phraiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by his learning he may perſwade her. So that which is defective in nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nurture perfecteth and the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly originall of this vertuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; is Love.</p>
            <p>Beautious Lady, anſwered <hi>Alexto,</hi> a roling-ſtone containes no moſſe, and a fickle headed lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts no cauſe of mourning. There are wanton lovers, Lady, I muſt confeſſe, whoſe laſcivious eyes are like the darts of <hi>Cephalus</hi> that where it hits, there it deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounds; But my meaning
<pb facs="tcp:4062:56"/>
is loyall, affection permanent and both proſtrated vnto your Divine acceptance. But noble Knight, anſwered the Lady, young yeares make their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt onely, of the glittering ſhow of beauty, the mind of a young man is momentany, his affections ſicke, his Love vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and his fancy is fired with every new face, and as young Willowes bend eaſily, ſo greene wits are intangled by every new fangle.</p>
            <p>But by your favour Madame, replyed ALEXTO, <hi>Cupid</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none in his Court, but yong that can ſerve freſh, and wiſe that can talke, faithfull to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and valiant to revenge their Miſtreſſes proffered injuries. And as they that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſuffer the light of a Candle, can much worſe
<pb facs="tcp:4062:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abide the brightneſſe of the Sun: So they that are troubled and damnified by each ſmall trifle would be much amazed to beare the weighty matters which are contained in Love.</p>
            <p>For the paſſionate, Lover if he ſaile love, is his pilot, if hee walke, love is his companion, if he ſleepe, love his pillow: pure love never ſaw the face of feare, pure loves eyes pierce the darkeſt Corners, and pure love attaineth the greateſt dangers. Otherwiſe, faire Lady, had I not preſumed in this abrupt ſort to preſent vnto your ſoft attention the true coppy of my perplexed heart, for as Mountaines that have too much heare of the Sun are burnt and Valleys having ſcarcity thereof are barren, but ſuch places as continue in a
<pb facs="tcp:4062:57"/>
meane, are moſt fruitful; Even ſo gracious Lady<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pitty your diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſervants, who hath no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but in the beames of your favour.</p>
            <p>Now the Lady <hi>Angelica</hi> waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ALEXTO's griefe: by the perplexity of her owne heart, imbraced him in her Armes, utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe words.</p>
            <p>Where the knot is looſe the ſtring ſlippeth, and where the water is ſhallow there no veſſell will ride, then here deare Knight, take heart and hand with as true a zeale and perfect love, as thy amorous heart can deſire to be requited with.</p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Alexto</hi> ſatisfied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed thereof by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall imbracements, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they ſpent their time, vſing <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

            <p>After <hi>Alexto</hi> had thus ended, it pleaſed <hi>Angelica's</hi> fancy very much, ſhe making a reiteration of all her precedent proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: unto him, vowing what ere ſhe perpetrated; ſprung
<pb facs="tcp:4062:66"/>
from that which was enacted in her breſt, ſo with much amorous daliance as befits Lovers to diſport time with, they with a very willing unwillingneſſe, for that time parted, where we will leave her entring of her Palace, and ALEXTO and SANDRICO to their accuſtomed Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>You have heard of this their ſeverall meetings, and how lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly they accorded together, but fortune proved her ſelfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, as to mixe his preſent joyes with perpetuall ſorrowes, for ere the time was totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd, the Duke of <hi>Aragon</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Palace, who was very nobly entertained by the Lady and her attendants, but to cut off prolixity, he became her Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſo fervently, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:4062:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could repulſe his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>The Lady being mightily perplexed thereat, knew not how to demeane her ſelfe, for faine ſhe would, yet loath ſhe was to condeſcend, becauſe her vowes were paſſed to <hi>Alexto,</hi> and the Worme of Conſcience turning round, did ſolicite her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ares with the ſting of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi> thus betwixt feare and hope or rather falſhood and diſſembling, ſhe remained the moſt part of a day, but at laſt conſidering with her ſelfe, ALEXTO was but a Lord, the other a Duke, who was eſteemed a potent Monarch, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded utterly to renounce ALEXTO, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Duke into her favour,
<pb facs="tcp:4062:67"/>
and ſtudied with her ſelfe how to accompliſh it, without the impeachment of her honour: at laſt ſhe reſolved not to make a perfect ſemblance of rejecting him at firſt, but by degrees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting his amorous glances with coy and diſdainfull frowns, and to repute his modeſt imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces laſcivious claſpes.</p>
            <p>With this reſolution ſhee went to meete the affectionate ALEXTO, who expected her preſence in the Garden, muſing at her long delay, but when hee perceived her comming, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from the banke to meet her proferring imbracement, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing it, anſwered that, that was Childiſh play, and fitter for Rurals, then theſe of their degrees, at which ALEXTO
<pb facs="tcp:4062:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much marvelled, little concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her drift and policie therein, yet had he no great cauſe to admire, becauſe <hi>Plato</hi> reports that the ferventeſt mind may be changed betweene Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Morning: beſides how could truth be expected to lye in falſhood?</p>
            <p>But ALEXTO rowſing his decaying ſpirits, thus anſwered. Lady is your Love like your beauty, both fading like a Roſe in <hi>June?</hi> You ſaid a ſliding knot was ſoone looſe, and that Lovers vowes couple no conſtraint, but like fetters made of glaſſe, that gliſter much but ſpeedily breake; your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures make your words appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet in your vowing you gave mee heart and hand.

I meane no other-wiſe (quoth ſhe) unto you, if ever I marry your ſelfe ſhall be him that ſhall Crowne my browes with a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell wreath, why ſaid <hi>Alexto,</hi> the time of our marriage is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and is almoſt expired.</p>
            <p>With this diſcourſe they ſpent their time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Alexto</hi> urging her ſtill to remember her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in ſo much that <hi>Angelica</hi> flung forth of the Arbour very much diſcontented, <hi>Alexto</hi> after her requeſting her ſtay and further conference, ſhe neither returned, anſwered nor look't, but ſhrowding ſubtilty beneath the Maske of anger, went her way, leaving <hi>Alexto</hi> ſolitary to himſelfe, who ſtayed not long but went to <hi>Sandrico,</hi> who was the mitigator of his
<pb facs="tcp:4062:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſtreſſe: and no ſooner did he meet with him, but he thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
            <p>To a man in miſery, life ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth too long, but to a worldly minded man living in pleaſure life ſeemeth too ſhort.</p>

            <p>What unexpected ſtratagem hath thus perplext thy mind, condenc't your underſtanding exil'd your judgement, betrayed your ſpirits to diſquiet paſſions, and leading your ſelfe captive to fond contemplation! O my <hi>Sandrico,</hi> anſwered <hi>Alexto,</hi> the pinace of my affection is like to ſuſtaine Ship wracke on the waves of her inconſtancy: ſhee begins to diſdaine mee, whom formerly ſhe loved, the World ſeduceth the eye with variety of objects, the Sent with ſweet

confections, the taſte with all delicious dainties, the touch with ſoft fleſh, the body with precious clothings, and all is but the inventions of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Tuſh, ſaid <hi>Sandrico,</hi> admit ſhe doth forſake thee, as 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, never grieve therefore, for that griefe is beſt digeſted, that brings not open ſhame, but now you have no ſuch cauſe of mourning, then ceaſe theſe bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh teares.</p>
            <p>Tis true, ſaid <hi>Alexto, Homer</hi> ſo ſpoke, but what anſwered <hi>Seneca,</hi> we ſhall ſooner want teares, then cauſe of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this life, and GRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GORY ſaid teares crave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and ſubmiſſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth

            <p>For its common in the eye of a ſtrumpet &amp; like heat-drops in a bright Sun-ſhine, and as much to be pittied as the wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a Crocodile, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture thy Mrs. dropt angry words to try thy conſtancy, and might act this with the counterfeite <hi>Tragedians</hi> of

            <p>Then anſwered ALEXTO, I like not ſuch notes to write as <hi>Demetrius</hi> did on Sand, or as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did on glaſſe, nor as <hi>Damaratus</hi> on wood; therefore what wilt thou adviſe me to do, to anſwer her dumbe jeſture?
<pb facs="tcp:4062:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Sandrico</hi> requeſted him to write ſome amorous lines vnto her in courting ſort, and he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them. ALEXTO condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended thereunto and writ as enſuing:

with <hi>Cupid</hi> and hold him as a Boy, conſider as ſhe is faire, ſo ſhe is cruell, and as ſhe is well featured ſo ſhe is perjured, the curious Herbaliſts meaſure not their Plants by their Colours but by their properties, the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidaries</hi> value their ſtones not by their outward hew, but by their ſecret vertues; for a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond with a Cloud is caſt into the Gold-ſmiths duſt, then let Lillyes wither on the ſtems, and weare violets both in heart, and hand, the one is faire but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory; the other blacke but ſweet and vertuous, but have a care leſt the impreſſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender ſome exorbitant paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thee.

<pb facs="tcp:4062:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhall ſuffice to prevent the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities that may enſue, if you proceed in theſe franticke fits: for there was one LOCUSTUS that had beene ſerved in the like manner, as the Lady ſerves you, on which he grew franticke, and meeting a friend of his, requeſted him to be his ſecond: his friend condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. <hi>Locuſtus</hi> carryed him to the Church of St. <hi>Marke,</hi> at which time the Duke of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> was reſident, who aſſoone as this Doterd ſaw him, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to his companion, ſee there is he with whom I have the quarrell, Let vs ſet vpon him, pointing to the Duke, and if hee had not beene reſiſted by the Guard, he had committed the outrage; And the diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
<pb facs="tcp:4062:76"/>
of <hi>Ajax</hi> firſt ſprung from Love, of whom wee reade in our <hi>Grecian</hi> Fables; by this and the like diſcourſe he had ſo well quailed <hi>Alexto's</hi> paſſion that he fell into a fine ſlumber, but preſently ſtarts and being againe awaked, he begun to call to mind the fantaſie that had poſſeſſed his braine in that his ſlumber, and thus cry'd out, O SANDRICO, I have dreamed that ANGELICA is married.</p>
            <p>Tuſh, anſwered SANDRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CO, that I cannot beleeve, and credit no dreames; for they be fables, and commonly fall out by contraries, as they appeare; for HAMILCAR Generall for the <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> laying Siege at <hi>Ciracuſa,</hi> an Image
<pb facs="tcp:4062:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
came to him in his ſleepe, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that hee ſhould the next night ſup as Conquerour in <hi>Siracuſa,</hi> and ſup there he did, but as a priſoner and Captive by the <hi>Siracuſians,</hi> and not as a Captaine by his <hi>Carthagenians</hi>; the like did JULIUS CAESAR, the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſlaine, he dreamt that he was ſitting by <hi>Iupiters</hi> ſeate, but ſuddenly he fell flat with his face on the ground; therefore wee muſt not cocker our <hi>Genius</hi> and flatter our ſelves with what we conceive in ſuch illuſions.</p>
            <p>But, ſaid ALEXTO, mee thought there was great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs at the ſolemnization thereof, and that hee and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Nobles were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb facs="tcp:4062:77"/>
of a Maſque and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>
            <p>Be it ſo or not, how ſhall wee come to ſpeech with AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GELICA?</p>

deſire, for as luſt, is an Enemy to the purſe, a foe to the perſon, a Canker to the mind, a Corraſive to the Conſcience, a weakner of the wit, a beſotter of the ſenſes, and finally a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Duke proteſted he meant verily to make her ſole owner &amp; governour to him and his, if ſhe would but requite him with her laſting affection: ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him, ſo he would vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce all ſuſpition, and as having no cauſe given by her ſo he would not lay hold on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very frivolous occaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:4062:78"/>
Iealouſie might proceed; for I will relate a jealous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and the ill conveniency thereof, ſaid ſhee, and thus ſhe begun.</p>
            <p>A jealous man is ſuſpitious ever more, judging the worſt; for if his wife be merry, hee thinketh her immodeſt; if ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſullen; if pleaſant, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; if ſhe laugh, it is lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if ſhe looke, it is lightly; So he is ſtill caſting beyond the Moone, and watcheth as the crafty Cat over the ſilly Mouſe; for if the heart be once infected herewith, his ſleepes are broken and dreames prove vnquiet, the whole night is conſumed in ſlumber, thoughts and cares, the day in woe, vexation, and miſery: beſides, my Lord, the
<pb facs="tcp:4062:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
jealous man living dyes, and dying prolongs out his life in paſſion worſe then death, none looketh on his Love but (ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitious) ſayes, this is he that would be Corrivall in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; none knocketh at the doore, but ſtarting up, hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins them to be the meſſengers, of fancy; none talkes but they whiſper of affection; if ſhee frowne ſhe hates him, and loves others; if ſhe ſmile it is becauſe ſhe hath had ſucceſſe in her Love, lookes ſhe frowardly on any man, ſhe diſſembles, if ſhe favours him with a gracious eye; then, as a man poſſeſſed with a phrenſie, he cryeth out, that neither fire in ſtraw, nor love in a womans lookes can be concealed; Thus doth he live reſtleſſe, and maketh love,
<pb facs="tcp:4062:79"/>
that is ſweet in it ſelfe, more bitter then gall: conſider this my Lord; for ſhould you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate the like, it would make a woman wanton, if ſhe were borne to Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>But by this time ALEXTO had pen'd his Epiſtle, therefore we will leave her ſubtilty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in her <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by yoking the Duke vnto her ſervitude, and returne vnto him, who was reading what he had writ vnto <hi>Sandrico</hi>; and this was it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Shall I be ſtab'd with Ponyards of diſdaine,</l>
               <l>Or languiſh ſtill in my obſcureſt paine?</l>

            <p>After SANDRICO had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed theſe lines, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion hee proſecuted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, knowing the Lady frequented the walkes in the Coole of the day, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being both come, though

unſeene, yet they ſaw the Lady ANGELICA imbraced by the Duke of <hi>Aragon,</hi> to whom ſhe had newly contracted her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>ALEXTO being conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently placed, <hi>Sandrico</hi> vndan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted proceeded towards her, where ſhe ſtarting vp from the Dukes lap demanded the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of his abrupt intruſion, SANDRICO ſaid, Lady you muſt and ſhall peruſe each ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble encloſed here, delivering her the Letter, at which the Duke begun to ſtorme, but ſhe having her trickes briefer then her <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> ſoone pacified the Duke, telling him, he was a gentleman Sewer to a kinſman of hers, from whom ſhe did not much deſire to be

ſolicited, ſo craving pardon, and his patience, diſcended the Mount and read what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed.</p>
            <p>SANDRICO demanded her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, why that I am otherwiſe provided, quoth ſhe. With that ALEXTO did approach, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to be ſo ſatisfied, at whoſe comming ſhe did ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine an Agony which more tortured her, then if grimme death had ſeized each part; then ſaid ALEXTO, Lady will you falſifie your vowes, ſhe replyed, that ſhe never made any, and demanded his witneſſe, I have none ſaid <hi>Alexto,</hi> but <hi>Sandrico</hi> and your owne conſcience; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, wherefore did you vſe mee ſo reſpectively, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me into your favour, why,

as my ſervant ſhee reply'd, for that was your firſt requeſt at your entring of my Palace, and ſo I have counted of you and ever will, if you bee reſident with me.</p>
            <p>Lady anſwered SANDRICO, you are falſe and diſloyall, you are like the Mandrake apple, comely in ſhow, but banefull in taſte, and for your ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, you are worſe then the Serpent, who hath venome to annoy others, but not himſelfe. And then ALEXTO begun, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is this equity and juſtice? O no; For Juſtice conſiſts of Eight parts, Friendſhip, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, Godlineſſe, Humanity, gratefulneſſe, faithfulneſſe, and vertuouſneſſe, but you have neither; for it is the badge of
<pb facs="tcp:4062:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Vertue, the ſtaffe of peace, and the maintenance of Honour. O that I were but ſome Sorcerer as <hi>Cyrce,</hi> who altered the ſhapes of Men and Women, to Beares, Wolves, Lyons, Aſſes, Apes and the like; whereby I might make ſome metamorphoſe of thee, if your Sexe were not worſe then ours!

            </p>
            <p>ALEXTO ſeeing himſelfe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly caſt off, was deſperate, but SANDRICO perſwaded him as followeth:</p>
