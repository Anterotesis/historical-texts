            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat there may be an <hi>Vnjuſt</hi> Peace, and that
there may be a <hi>Iuſt</hi> Warre, is ſo cleere and
evident a Truth, that in moſt ages of the
World, we ſhall find it written with the
poynt of a ſword, in Characters of Blood;
And as cleare it is, that we are bound to
Pray againſt them both: Againſt ſuch a Peace, as only
skinnes the ſore, but repairs not the body; a Peace that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
a ſubtle ſuperficiall Quiet in the Fathers dayes, but
threatens the Sonnes with an inteſtine and more laſting
Warre: And againſt all Warre; if not for the many ſinnes
which Liſt themſelves even with the juſteſt Cauſe; yet at
leaſtwiſe, for the Temptations ſake, which in the holieſt
Warre too often aſſault the braveſt Champions: And we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152775:3"/>
are bound to pray againſt all Temptations in what kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>I am not, dare not be of his Religion, who ſaid, that
<hi>Gunpowder in the Field gave as ſweet a Perfume, as Incenſe
at the Altar:</hi> And yet, ſuch may be the caſe, and ſuch
now it is, that the Incenſe at the Altar burnes the ſweeter
for the Gunpowder in the Field. The ſmoak of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
is good or bad, as the cauſe is ſo; and that which
proves a ſtench, an odious ſtench in the noſtrills of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
when it is fired to blow up a State, when it is fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerciſed to defend Religion, then it ſmells like the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Oyntment upon <hi>Aarons</hi> Head.</p>
            <p>I preſume, the <hi>Socinian</hi> is not here, who ſubſcribes to
the unlawfulneſſe of all warre; ſo ſubtlely taught the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt</hi>
once, till he had compaſſed a mighty ſtrength, and
a Power of reſiſtance: He taught ſo, till he made <hi>Germany</hi>
reele with his thundering Legions, borrowing that very
argument to beat down the ſword of Warre, which the
<hi>Iewes</hi> at this day make uſe of, to cry down the Saviour of
the World, and the Prince of Peace, as not yet come; <hi>viz.</hi>
That in the time of the Goſpell all Nations are required to
<hi>beat their Swords into Plow ſhares,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and their Speares in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Pruining hookes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic. 4. 3.</note> Whereas indeed the Prophets doe
hereby commend unto us, not the Practice of Chriſtians,
but the Doctrine of Chriſt. If we would put on the Lord
Ieſus, that ſame love and meekneſſe, which we ought to
do, and become ſuch men, as Chriſt in his Goſpell charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us to be, there would be no need of the Sword then; we
ſhould be greater ſtrangers then to the lowd reports of
Warre, then we are now to the ſweet ſounds of Peace.</p>
            <p>But now, the Almighty, who is himſelfe the Lord of
Hoſts, as well as the God of Peace, hath put a Sword into
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152775:3"/>
the hand of the ſupream Magiſtrate, a ſharpe edged Sword,
not a painted Dagger; and <hi>Warres well grounded are
nought elſe</hi> (ſaith my Author) <hi>but ſutes of Appeale to the
great Conſiſtory of Heaven.</hi> However, it will appeare that
Iſrael found not ſo much comfort in <hi>Davids</hi> victorious
Lawrell, as under <hi>Solomons</hi> ever peacefull Vine. There may
dwell more of Honour in a ſcarrified face, but in a ſmooth
skinne there ſhines more of Beauty; this a work of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that of chance. We muſt ſtill preferre the Olive to
the Ivie. <hi>David</hi> one of the three Worthies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſo:
Whoſe ſword, though it were drunke with the blood of
Gods enimies; yet you ſhall never find him to beginne the
Quarrell with them; he was forced in a manner to Fight
for the Peace of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> and to ſhew how great an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
he was to Warre, (which moſt commonly has been
an Enemy to Religion and Liberty) he not only called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Brethren to Pray for that Peace, but for their ſakes
is reſolved to lead them the way.</p>
            <q>
               <p>For my Brethren and Companions ſake I will now ſay,
Peace be within thee.</p>
               <p>Becauſe of the Houſe of the Lord onr God, I will ſeek thy
good.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Religion and Liberty, thoſe two Atlantes, the Pillars
upon which <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſtands, and which are now ſo much
pretended by our Enemies, ſo much ſought after by us,
are the two motives in my Text, which here firſt ſet a good
King upon his knees to pray for the Peace of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi>
and then ſet him upon his legges agen, (if need be) to fight
for that Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For my Brethren and Companions ſake:</hi> theres his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
or, you may call it in a larger ſence, the <hi>Liberty of the
Subject.</hi> For which we have the Royall word of a King;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152775:4"/>
               <hi>I will now ſay</hi> (ſaith he) Peace be within thee; or, <hi>I will wiſh
thee Proſperity:</hi> as ſome read it. Now Peace without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
Proſperity and Bondage are they not inconſiſtent?</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, <hi>Becauſe of the houſe of the Lord our God:</hi>
Behold here his Piety; behold here, the Religion of our
<hi>David;</hi> and for which <hi>(O Ieruſalem)</hi> he will more then
Wiſh, he will endeavour thy good. So that, if either his
Heart or his Braine, if either his Pen or his Sword can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
the Peace and Proſperity of his Brethren, together
with the pure worſhip of his God, we have his full and
Princely Reſolution. I <hi>will</hi> ſay, and I <hi>will</hi> ſeek.</p>
            <p>The words then in briefe containe in them a <hi>double Act</hi>
enforced from a <hi>double motive:</hi> an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>wiſhing,</hi> and an
<hi>Act</hi> of <hi>ſeeking.</hi> The firſt relates unto the Heart and the
Tongue, <hi>Loquar de Pace tuâ;</hi> I <hi>will pray for thy Peace,</hi> or
I <hi>will wiſh thee Proſperity:</hi> The ſecond imployes the Braine
and the Hand, indeed all the members, <hi>Quaeram bonum tibi.</hi>
I will Study, I <hi>will ſeek thy good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Correſponding to which <hi>double Act,</hi> we have a <hi>double
Motive.</hi>

            <p>I begin at the <hi>double Act:</hi> which I ſhall twiſt together

a good King labouring both in Word and Deed for the
Peace of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152775:4"/>
of the wiſh. I will <hi>Now</hi> ſay. Which inſtant of

it reflect only upon the returning of the Arke unto <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
from the hands of the <hi>Philistins;</hi> yet, becauſe his ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
and ſearch after Peace, was eminent throughout all his
perſecutions, both from Forraigne and domeſtique Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and becauſe this Pſalme of <hi>Degrees,</hi> was in lieu of a
<hi>Te Deum,</hi> ſet and tuned for his Harpe, to be ſung upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſolemne Feaſt day, and at all times whenſoever he or
his People approached the Courts of the Lord: Therefore
we ſhall take leave to runne this <hi>Now</hi> through each ſeverall

            <p>
               <hi>Now,</hi> that you have dranke deep of the dregs of Gods
wrath; <hi>Now,</hi> that you have ſeen with horrour, and rued

nature, (and me thinks the Goſpell ſhould need no Second,
no other Spokes man then the <hi>Meſsiah)</hi> yet when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
ours ſo perverſe and ſtubborne, they win but
weakly upon our affections. The only Maſculine Logick
now lies in the Sword; and we muſt haſt unto the Camp
for a true definition of Peace.</p>
            <p>When once we begin to find the ſword ſtealing from a
Neighbours Boſome to lighten in our faces, and to lodge
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152775:6"/>
in our Bowells; Then preſently we advance into an extaſie
of Expreſſion, bleſſing thoſe former dayes, now forfeited
by our ſinnes, wherein we could call ſomewhat our Owne;
our Eſtates and Fortunes our Owne; our Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
our Owne; our Owne Bodies, yea and our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they were our Owne: For even in Religion we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the day, when we had a <hi>Propriety</hi> in that too.
Then we can ſay, O thrice happy Peace, wherein we might
ſee the King and Subject ſo incorporated each into other,
as that <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> was not diſtinguiſh'd into phrenſie, or
put upon the rack to make an argument for Rebellion;
Nor yet <hi>Praerogativa Regis,</hi> raiſed as a ſtep or ſtaire to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:
But were both of them like the two eyes in the

theſe times with what we have loſt, and our Fathers
dayes will run the danger of an <hi>Vtopia;</hi> be deem'd rather
the ſport of a luxuriant Fancy, then any reall truth. Then,
when the King ſeemd rather a Steward <hi>for</hi> the people, then
a Lord <hi>over</hi> them; and when the People were ſo endear'd
into the favour of the Prince, as if there had been an holy
kind of Anarchy in State, and every man had been both a
King and a Subject: well may we ingeminate the Rapture,
and Cry, O thrice happy, O thrice bleſſed Peace.</p>
            <p>And yet to redeeme thoſe times, and to recover that
Peace, the bleſſings whereof we have learn'd ſo throughly
from the miſerable effects of Warre; God knowes how
few there be who are contented to ſpend more then an
empty Prayer, a little wholſome breath, and a cheap wiſh:
I will <hi>wiſh</hi> thee Proſperity; and I will now <hi>ſay,</hi> Peace be
within thee. If words could make the purchaſe, ſhould
we not all be buyers? But, I will <hi>ſeek</hi> thy good; ſeek it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152775:6"/>
through fire and water; engage my Life &amp; Fortune for the
Peace of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> I doubt me this will prove a hard
Chapter to thoſe, who through avarice, lazineſſe, or
Cowardice, have cauſeleſly reſolved before hand, we ſhall
be all undone; and therefore make it their only ſhifting ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
how to fall laſt in the Field. Whereas indeed God
may juſtly challenge the very ſpring of our Actions; and
therein is to be invocated and petitioned, not only with the
Heart and Tongue, but likewiſe with the Hand, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
member we can finde more Active, for the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Peace. For otherwiſe, to Pray with the Lipps,
and unpray with the Hand, <hi>i. e.</hi> to begge Peace at Gods
hands, and ſcarce ſtretch out our Own to take it, what is
this, but to play handy dandy with our maker? We would
have Peace, but not yet, <hi>Lord;</hi> or, we would have Peace
but are loath to Buy it; Or, if Buy we muſt, will not a little
Sweat ſerve the turne? This marketting and chaffering for
Gods bleſſing, which was wont to be cheap at the price of
Blood; is to dally with his <hi>mercy,</hi> and calls aſſuredly for
his <hi>Iuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much better therefore that poſture of the men of
<hi>Iudah,</hi> whom we find with a Petition in their mouth, and a
ſword in their hand? They cryed unto the Lord their God,
and Fought with their enemies. 2. <hi>Chron. 13. 14. &amp;</hi> 14. 11.

            <p>It ſeems, the Peace of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was loſt, as doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

them who had leaſt reaſon to deny it. And, think we, he
would have parted with his Wives, his <hi>Ionathan,</hi> his
friends and ſervants, (and you know, all this he parted with
afterwards, out of a pure love to Peace) would he have fled
from the great City to <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> and chang'd the Royall

For perceiving the eaſineſſe of the King, and with what
Facility they had obtained thus much, They make this
graunt but a ſtep to a freſh Demand; and now, they muſt
have more: Even his men of Warre, his ſtrong-holds, his
Cities, his Forts and Magazines; yea, and the houſe of his
God; <hi>Whatſoever was moſt deſireable and pleaſant in the
eyes of the King,</hi> v. 6. Whereupon he begins now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the unreaſonableneſſe of their demand: collects Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
ſummons the <hi>Princes,</hi> the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and <hi>the Elders of
Iſrael,</hi> v. 7. whoſe generall Vote it was, by no meanes to
yeeld to ſuch inequitable and unprincely Conditions: <hi>And
all the Elders, and all the People ſaid unto him, Hearken not
unto them nor Conſent,</hi> v. 8. He did ſo, as they adviſed him:
and the next newes is, <hi>The Syrians are ſmitten twice by the
ſword of Iſrael,</hi> v. 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29.</p>

If either the <hi>Liberty</hi> of our <hi>Brethren,</hi> or the <hi>worſhip</hi> of
our <hi>God</hi> be demanded as a Prey and ſpoyle for the railing
<hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> or imperious <hi>Benhadad;</hi> the promiſe of private
eaſe and an effeminate Peace, muſt not lock up the Sword
within the ſcabbard; But let the King ſay then, as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>

the People,</hi> Nehem. 4. 14. <hi>Be not ye afraid of them; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your
Brethren, your Sonnes and your Daughters, your Wives and
your Houſes;</hi> and for the houſe of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> who ſought for Peace, and was
forced upon a poſture of Warre: And thus did <hi>David;</hi>
who ever prayed for Peace, though ſometimes with a
Sword in his Hand. And that, <hi>For his Brethren and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions

could not prevaile ſo farre, even with the then prevailing

And endeavour to appeaſe <hi>Simeon</hi> &amp; <hi>Levi</hi> with the Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
