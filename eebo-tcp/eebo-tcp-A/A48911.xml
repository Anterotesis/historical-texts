         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

chastize the Reproaches which he hath
thrown upon the most Eminent Professors
of Musick, than for any thing of Learning
that I found in him. Those Gentlemen he
accus'd of Ignorance, for not imbracing his
illiterate Absurdities; for which it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to bring him to the <hi>Bar</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi>
and to do him that Justice which his Follies
merited. Though for the same he gets by this
I shall not much envy him; with whom it will
fare, as with common Criminals, who are
seldome talkt of above two or three days
after Execution. The Gentleman might
have slept in a whole skin, had he not
challeng'd all the World; in which, how
well he has behav'd himself, you may, if you
please, in reading judge; and so farewel.</p>

            <head>A LETTER of THANKS
To Mr. THOMAS SALMON
For the Vindication of his Essay, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>To the Favours formerly acknowledged by
me, and since repeated by you, you
have obligingly added in the <hi>Vindication</hi>
of your <hi>Essay</hi> so many others (though
of far different Nature to them, yet doubtless with
the same, if not greater heartiness) that I was at a
loss how to put my self into the least Capacity of
manifesting the thankfulness they deserve, without
looking back, and endeavouring (if possible) to
find out their true Rise; wherein if I fail, I shall
willingly acknowledge my fault, and beg your
pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, In your</hi> Essay (pag. 10) <hi>you are pleas'd
to affirm,</hi> That the dark and tedious Principles of
Musick, the bugbear Terms and confused Cliffs,
hindred the access to it. Pag. 11. That the long
discourse of Gibberish, a fardle of hard Names and
fictitious Words, call'd the <hi>Gam-vt,</hi> to be learn'd back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and forwards by heart, as though a Man must
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57311:4"/>
be exact in the Art of Conjuring before he learn'd
Musick, terrified the Beginner. Pag. 15. That
you cann't tell any thing that perswades Musick-Masters
to trouble their Scholars with an impertinent
difficulty, but a pernicious humour in some Men still
to do what hath once been done, howsoever useless and
unprofitable; and that though the <hi>Gam-vt</hi> be retain'd,
they think it insufficient. Pag. 16. That they are
to be blamed for not beginning the Naming of their
Notes with <hi>Mi.</hi> Pag. 19. That intollerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
which arose from the Alteration of the Cliffs,
caus'd some charitable but lazy Wit, to invent <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blature,</hi>
whereby the Notes are Mechanically clouded
in Letters, and so darkly, that the most quick
sighted Musick-Master cann't tell what they mean,
till he find out the Tuning, and the Scholar, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
condemn'd ever to be ignorant of the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
part of his Musick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Voyce and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
not capable of that literal Expression,
People learn by rote, and quickly forget what like
Parrots they ignorantly prated. Pag. 22. A Musick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Master
cann't trust to the Observation of Intervals
in passing from one Cliff to another. Pag. 24. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick-Masters
will be loath to consent to a Way, wherein
every young Practitioner may rival them. Pag. 25,
26. Some Musick-Masters return'd me such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
as betray'd their misapprehension of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and their unwillingness it should come into
practice; upon which account I have put my self to
the trouble of writing these Papers, that they might
the more clearly perceive the conveniency of our <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis:</hi>
And if afterwards they should remain
peevish, and obstinate against the use of it, their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57311:4"/>
Scholars might be able to right themselves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a remission of more than half their slavish
Task, for to learn the <hi>Notes</hi> and con their places, is
the very drudgery of Musick, <hi>&amp;c. which,</hi> when once
Men find it will save them half the trouble, they
will embrace it as readily, as if I were Emperour of
the World to command it. Pag. 27. But if after
all this, Musick-Masters shall double the time in
teaching their Scholars, in hopes of double Gain; or
their Scholars be such Fools to undergo that expence
of time and trouble; give me leave to laugh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
let them have their labour for their pains. Pag. 32.
I will make a wild Comparison to shew how madly
Custom perswades Musicians to reckon. Pag. 36.
By how much Musicians have been wanton in their
various Cliffs for Singing, they bring in Evidence
of the Mischief it makes. Pag. 47, 48. I should
think this unworthy my pains, unless the difficulty
were so great which demands redress, and necessity
required me to answer the perverse obstinacy of some,
who would oppose even the justest Alterations; <hi>Vitio
malignitatis humanae vetera semper in laude, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentia
in fastigio esse.</hi> But if any shall contemn this
because Easie and Natural, let them remember what
a grave company of such Contemners were baffled
in setting an Egg upright, till they were shewed
how. Pag. 74. If there be a nearer and an easier
way <hi>(than the Old Scale)</hi> why should not those Guides
be so honest to lead us in it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Truely if Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick-Masters
will continue obstinate, to maintain such
needless difficulties, they may like some (Musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
be left to play by themselves in Fidlers Island.
Pag. 78. <hi>Pity me ye confounded Sons of</hi> Nimrod,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57311:5"/>
               <hi>that I must still suffer the Curse of my old confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
disorders.</hi> Pag. 88. I have heard many Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in vain importune their Masters for some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
to this purpose (viz. <hi>to Play or Compose an
Air or Consort</hi>) whose Charity notwithstanding has
been so straight, or else their Ignorance so obstinate,
that their just intreaties were frustrated. <hi>For which</hi>
Pag. 90. Now a Master is ranked in the same order
with those Empyrical Traders, who have a parcel
of Musical Receipts, but understand not one Note of
their Composure.</p>
            <p>These, Sir, These bold and untrue Aspersions
thrown on All Masters of Practical Musick, and
All Gentlemen and others that have learn'd <hi>their
way,</hi> as if your taking a Degree had authorized
you to abuse Men; together with the perpetual
magnifying your self, and the Brat your <hi>Essay,</hi> were
the Motives of my inserting a Merry Proverb or
Simily here and there in my <hi>Observations;</hi> and
those if I mistake not of your doubty manner of
Vindicating it.</p>
            <p>Sir, I have been told, that Generosity is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Attendant on Noble and Heroick Spirits, and
should have believ'd it, had I not heard of many
Great Ones that abhorr'd the found of the very
word; but you, Sir, by those showers of Bounty
heap'd on me in the <hi>Vindication</hi> of your <hi>Essay,</hi> have
made so absolute a Convert of me, that I hold it a
Duty necessary to let the World know, how admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
your Tongue speaks your Heart. Sir, you
have prevented a long Journey and much trouble
for its discovery in your Title Page, by slily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the Titles of those real Favours their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57311:5"/>
have been graciously pleas'd to confer on me
in both their Services, that thereby you might take
advantage to render me contemptible to all that
know me not, and all other your tender-hearted
Proselites, who believe you are already in possession
of some Infallible Chair, and consequently can speak
or write nothing but Truth: As fair an Introduction
for your following Discourse as Heart could wish!
In your Advice to the Reader, you tell him <hi>Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi>
and the <hi>Bear-Garden</hi> are Entertainments only
for the Rabble, <hi>your old Cronies;</hi> to prevent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my being drawn into the Lists of their Active
and Martial Atchievements, you, to render me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
as well as ignorant, have plac'd me on the
Grand Theatre of the World, bidding Defiance,
first, to your Learned Patron Dr. <hi>Wallis;</hi> then, to the
<hi>Royal Society</hi> and all <hi>Mathematicians</hi> that have been,
are, or shall be; andlastly, to Modesty, Honesty, Piety,
and whatever else relates to God or Good Men.</p>
            <p>Behold, Sir, an Abbreviate of your transcendent
additional Favours! Favours indeed! and when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
considered, such as in all probability could not
proceed from any but your self, your Epistoler,
or that Great Prince who pretends Right to all that's
donable in this World.</p>
            <p>But of their Particulars hereafter. At present
give me leave, if you please, to admire that so much
Prodigality should be used to so little purpose;
especially when I reflect on that great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Call which necessitated you (as your self
confess) to this Act of Reformation: for no
sooner can I cast my Eye on the <hi>Vindication,</hi> but I
lose the <hi>Essay;</hi> this proposing a nearer and easier
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57311:6"/>
way to the attaining of Practical Musick; that
running quite from it to what either we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
past, or to what is meerly speculative, or at
most insignificant to us: So that upon a true account,
when your jingling with, and playing on my words,
with your perpetual wresting or falsifying them,
are laid aside, there's not one word in the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
makes good the Title and Contents of the
<hi>Essay,</hi> but your own bare affirming you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
it; which how true it is, I appeal to
all Masters of Practical Musick, who are, and
ought to be Judges in this Case of Practice.</p>
            <p>Yet, Sir, left your <hi>Whirligig Members</hi> should
think me too severe, and judge that I write rather
out of spite and malice to your Person, than against
your Opinion (which you and your Dearly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
have already proclam'd though Heaven
knows for what!) be pleas'd to remember, that
from <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. to <hi>Pag.</hi> 27. in my <hi>Observations,</hi> I
demonstrate, <hi>by the Old Scale, by the brief Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of it, and by the several Examples there
inserted,</hi> the Conveniency and Necessity of the
Cliffs, as they are universally received, <hi>on the one
side;</hi> and the intricacy and perplexity which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
attends your B M T's mutability (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which you cannot advantagiously write any
thing according to your own Rule that has the
extent of a well-design'd Composition) <hi>on the other.</hi>
But what's your Answer to this? not one word,
<hi>though it be the Hinge on which the whole Discourse
depends, as to Practical Musick, and which was your
Task;</hi> but (after a long Digression from it, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd
with all kind of abusive Language) an old
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57311:6"/>
stoln Cycle, to tell us, an <hi>Octave</hi> is an <hi>Octave,</hi>
that <hi>Musick</hi> is part of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> which
no Man yet ever doubted of that pretended to
Musick; and an Argument (if any one will take it
for such) back'd with such a Scheme, as being truly
applied, undeniably destroys all you pretend to
build, and confirms what so furiously you would
destroy; notwithstanding your desperate threatning
<hi>to pull down</hi> (Sampson-like) <hi>the Observer in your
ruin, and crush him with five times the weight of his
own Objection:</hi> For, those absurdities which you
charge the Old Scale with, are really none, but evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Fortifiers of its certainty; being that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the <hi>C sol favt Cliff</hi> is placed, the second Space
below is perpetually <hi>G sol re vt.</hi>

            <p>This, Sir, is so evident in it self, that it needs
neither Argument nor Scheme to maintain or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
it to any Person indued with Common
Sense. And truly, Sir, according to this Rate, this
excellent Method of Proving, you may Write and
Answer Books, with as much ease as you pretend
you could Command the World; for nothing can
come amiss to so great a Mind; the Examples of
ruin'd Monarchs touch you not; the Infamy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Libellous Scriblers holds not your hands;
what you will, must be; what not, not: And this
is that, and only that, which I can any way perceive
the World is ever like to have from you, excepting
your new invented <hi>Wheel of Seven Spokes</hi> for a
Tyler or Carpenter to reach the top of a House
with, instead of his old Ladder; your New Way
of Account, to tell a Farmer <hi>Paul</hi>'s Fair will be <hi>D</hi>
in the fourth <hi>Octave,</hi> instead of the Twenty fifth
of <hi>Ianuary;</hi> and the incomparable B M T for a fair
Lady to Learn (with all Expedition) the singing of
a <hi>Base</hi> in Confort: which Posterity may admire
you for, though the present Age be not so good
natur'd. But to proceed:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57311:7"/>In my <hi>Observations (Pag. 33. &amp; 34.)</hi> I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the ridiculousness of confining the <hi>Viol</hi> to a
Tuning, incapable of being used well in more than
one Key, whereas the Old Way injoyed all; and
particularly do manifest your contradicting your
own Rule <hi>of keeping every Octave and Part within
the System of Four Lines,</hi> by planting the first
Note of an Example taken from Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> in a
Sixth Line, and putting the same Note that is to be
Plaid on the same String and Fret, here in the Line,
there in the Space, then again in the Line, after
that in the Space, and so forward to the End of the
Lesson. This, Sir, to any Mans thinking might
have deserv'd some Answer! but 'tis put off with
a bare imploying your Conjuring Exoticks, and
telling the World I understand not the <hi>Viol;</hi> which
how true 'tis, and how much to your pretended
relieving the Fland, Eye, and Understanding from
those troublesome and needless perplexities you
charge the Old Scale and Tuning with, I leave to

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57311:8"/>This, Sir, though you are resolv'd not to be
Confuted, may at long run Convince you, that I do
understand the <hi>Viol;</hi> that 'tis impossible to perform
it on your new confin'd Tuning; and that you have
undertook what you understand not; nor are ever
likely to bring to pass, the way you go to work.
And indeed, no one that does understand Musick
can expect other: For while we must be one while
in the Line with a Note, another while in Space
with the same Note; one while condemn the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosyllables
for Gibberish, Conjuring, and the learning
of them the very drudgery of Musick; another
while command the use of them, then eat them;
here to fix <hi>Mi</hi> in one of two places only, there in
any place; here obliged to the use of four Lines
only, there to fourteen, or as many as you please;
here tied to the use of Notes as the most easie and
intelligible way, thare to the lazy-witted Invention
of Tablature; here to express Musick in the most
familiar words, there to abandon the plain <hi>English</hi>
of a great or lesser Third, Fourth, Fifth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the old Heathen <hi>Greek</hi> Terms, and what not?
while I say we are brav'd from our own fixedness
to those pitiful shilly-shally's, and altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant
and impertinent pretences; what, Sir,
can be expected? Truely nothing that I can any
way imagin; except perhaps that thereby we might
be made instrumental to proclame to the World.
<hi>That a young Graduate had lately Published Two
Books, as exactly agreeing with their Titles as a
Pretended Gospel-Minister's Sermon in the late Civil
Wars did to his Text</hi> (the one being <hi>Fear God,
Honour the King;</hi> the other, <hi>an impudent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57311:9"/>
to carry on the begun Schism and Rebellion:)
but not to so ill an End, though in all probability
with as much Pride and Contempt.</hi> Proportionably
you go on, trifling with the <hi>Harpsichord</hi> and <hi>Lute,</hi>
as if the <hi>One</hi> were previously made for the sole
use of your unbarb'd Jews-Trump, the <hi>Cycle,</hi> and
your Servants B M T; or the <hi>Other</hi> most elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Harmonious when untouch'd. For to what
end the first is made a <hi>Phanatick;</hi> the last, when
used, silent (for so, by a wilful mistake both of
my words and meaning, you have made them) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
to keep up the laudable custome of swelling
your Book, and amusing the Reader, I know not.</p>
            <p>I must confess, Sir, I have not the Practical Use of
the <hi>Lute;</hi> yet have Composed several things for it; and
from thence am sufficiently convinced, that the way of
Tablature is much easier and properer for that Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the expression of its excellency, than the
way of Notes; however I shall not judge, but refer it
to those to whom it properly belongs, <hi>viz. such Lute-Masters
as are qualified in both Capacities.</hi> But as to
the <hi>Harpsichord,</hi> I could smile at your idle Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that a Man must have two Heads for the using two
Staves of Lines, for his two Hands <hi>our Cliff-way;</hi>
and but one Head for the use of a like two Staves
and two Hands your BMT way, did I not fear
there might be a more than ordinary Mystery in it;
that is to say, One great Loggerhead with huge
great Saucer-Eyes, like those in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice,
to be Champion in the Cause; and then,
<hi>Woe and well-a-day!</hi> but I hope better things. In
confidence whereof, I shall boldly affirm, that
among the many ways of Writing for that Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57311:9"/>
the most intelligiblest to the Understanding,
and easiest to the Eye, is that which divides the
<hi>Staves of Lines, and Hands, on the middle Key there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi>
and so gives occasion to ascend and descend
(generally) without the least alteration of Cliffs.</p>
            <p>[See the second Example in Pag. 10.]</p>
            <p>This, Sir, your Four Line BMT way, is
wholly incapable of; and so incapable of, that in
the Example you took from Mr. <hi>Thetcher,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
in your <hi>Essay,</hi> you were forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
by several times chopping and changing <hi>your
signifying Letters</hi> in that short Lesson.</p>
            <p>To object, some things may notwithstanding be
done that way, is short of your Glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
where you undertake <hi>All, Easier, and in
half the Time;</hi> the contrary whereof is so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
known, that, besides the Masters, several
Lovers of Novelties, after a little experience,
have with scorn laid it aside. Among others, a
Person of Honour, Educated, in a School near this
City, had your <hi>Essay</hi> presented her piping hot,
with such Commendation as the Presenter thought
it really deserved; the Lady, with as much thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
received it, thinking every Minute a Day
till the presence and assistance of her Master might
make her happy in the injoyment of this new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Benefit. The Hour came, and to work
they went; but, <hi>O the fickle state of Lovers!</hi> e're
many days was expired, the heat was so abated,
that there was not Charity enough left to keep it
out o'th' fire, had not the Masters earnest intreaty
preserv'd it from that cruel Death: but all in vain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for the thing being heartless, after a short time,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57311:10"/>
consum'd by that lingring Disease which Squire
<hi>Ralpho</hi> long before Prophecied would be the end
on't; and so farewel it; but not, Sir, to your <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
of it: For there you promise such Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
as the World was ignorant of before;
there, the Reasons of what it Acted by; and there,
that All Compositions should with Ease be Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
from one Key to another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Very prety!
if a Man would believe it. Sir, the Advantages
you so perpetually boast of, are already sufficiently
manifested and known to be Mistakes, onely
to abuse the Masters and delude the Ignorant; and
consequently need no more taking notice of: Your
assuring the Dr. of the <hi>now</hi> easiness of transposing
Compositions from one Key to another, is a thing
so frequent, that no one is esteem'd a Master who
cannot do it <hi>Proper;</hi> and he the contrary, that does
it no better than you have done your <hi>Aurelia</hi> in
in your <hi>Essay.</hi> But, that Men should Act and Teach
Rationally, and not understand the Reason of their
so Acting and Teaching, till you peep'd into the
World; is to make them Beasts, and too too
subtle for any but your self to unriddle, who have
stock enough to say any thing.</p>
            <p>For my own part, Sir, I never pretended to more
of the Mathematicks than what was practicable in
Musick, and that I have so evidently demonstrated
(if you can but give credit to your self) that I stand
amazed at the confidence of Contradicting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>no
one till now, ever being so mad, after he had seen
a Man do a thing, to teach him how he should
do it; yet this is our Case; and this no Person can
be ignorant of, that is capable of apprehending,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57311:10"/>
that all Creatures that have Ears are apprehensive
of Sounds, but not of distinguishing them; those,
whose Ears Nature hath prepared for Practical
Musick, by dividing and sub-dividing a String (for
Example) come to experience their difference and
distances; and from thence, by comparing them,
to Tones, which (the Ear having distinguished into
Consonants and Dissonants) they Arithmetically
divide to the greatest quantity Practicable (<hi>viz.</hi> 32.)
and thence, by Harmonical Proportion of whole,
half, and quarter Tones (altogether sufficient for
use) advance to That we call <hi>Composition,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all Vocal and Instrumental Musick. More
of the Mathematicks than this, Sir, (excepting what
belongs to the Mechanical Pant thereof for the
Making Instruments) signifies nothing to us; <hi>This,</hi>
and not the poring after idle and unpracticable No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
being that which the Schools deservedly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
with the Degrees of <hi>Batchelor</hi> and <hi>Doctor,</hi>
above or equal to all other Sciences. The rest
therefore if you please (for you are infinitely free)
you may bestow on your unprofitable Speculators;
who, so long as they can think of lengthening a
<hi>String,</hi> or adding to <hi>Number,</hi> will never want
imployment. This I mention, not in the least to
contradict those Honourable and Excellent Persons,
whose very Recreations, by their diving into the
Bowels of Nature for the Improvement of Art,
prove daily advantagious to the World; or to prove
that Musick has got the whip-hand of her Sister
Sciences, and already arrived to the utmost of
Practical Excellency; and so needs none; but to
show, that after all your Hectorish Bravadoes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57311:11"/>
you have most manfully, like your self, quitted the
Field of <hi>Practical Musick,</hi> and run for shelter to
the <hi>Nature and Causes of Sounds,</hi> which properly
belongs to Philosophy, and which you, in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
perhaps that all Men would greedily swallow
your imaginary Gudgeon the <hi>Essay,</hi> particularly
waved in the last Page thereof.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I might with very much reason
finish my Letter; but least many of your admiring
Readers may be ignorant of the Subject you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to write on, it will not be amiss I think to give
them an Example or two within their own Spheres,
of the wild Consequences you draw from the
plain Words in my <hi>Observations;</hi> as also, to make
a particular inspection into some few (amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
of those obliging Favours, you, and your
<hi>Goodman, Mr. Sr. Min Heer, Monsieur, Senior
Don, Dominus sine Nomine de Norwich</hi> (that Grand
Master of Grammatical Criticism and Cocorism)
have so graciously Complemented me with, and so
conclude.</p>
            <p>Where, in my <hi>Observations,</hi> I give an account
of the timely check I took, when I thought my
self to be more than ordinarily knowing (a fault
Youth is too subject to) you infer <hi>All young Men
must be Fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I instance the continued Ignorance of the

you come out with your, <hi>Ergo, I turn all
those venerable Ancestors into Great Bears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I wonder, that throughout your whole
Discourse of Musicks Advantages over other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
you mention nothing of the Divine Use
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57311:11"/>
thereof, notwithstanding the many Commands and
Examples recounted in Holy Writ to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
you roundly conclude, <hi>I am ignorant that</hi>
God <hi>is a Scripture-Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I prove the <hi>Old Scale</hi> to be the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and easiest way, yet proposed, for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Musick, by the regular ballancing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Parts thereof with removing the <hi>C</hi> Cliff,
and the <hi>impertinency</hi> of yours, you cry out, <hi>I'd
build a Ladder to reach the Triple Tree of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I insert a Physicians probable ℞ for the
Explanation of the super-abundant Excellencies of
your B M T, you infer, <hi>I deter all that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
or profess Physick from the Study of Musick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These, and the like Patterns, your Northern
Hector has been exactly careful to conclude by;
for from the Exceptions I have made in some of
my Writings against the ill performance of some,
and needless Mathematical impositions of others,
he stoutly avers, <hi>I am the only Confounder of all
Musick;</hi> though almost in the same Breath, he
commends me for my Ability in that Art, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
perswades me to continue my Studies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Which I'le assure you, Sir, I take for no small
Favour, seeing that, by his Exception against <hi>Mood,
Time,</hi> and <hi>Prolation,</hi> without which, no Musick
ever was or can be made, he bountifully manifests
his wilful or real ignorance of the Subject he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to vindicate.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Trim Tram,</hi> 'tis all could be expected; the
whole business being as it seems, rather to write,
than what, or how? And truely, Sir, had I affected
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57311:12"/>
such kind of Fooling (to speak no worse on't) I
might with as much shew of reason conclude thus
from your Discourse and manner of Writing:</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Guido</hi> lived in an ignorant Age,</l>
            <l>But <hi>T. S.</hi> stands on <hi>Guido</hi>'s Shoulders:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> Those Venerable Ancestors</l>
            <l>
               <hi>T. S.</hi> has studied are Great Bears.</l>
            <p>And in all probability, might have given the
World as much satisfaction in that profound way
of Arguing, as either of you.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, you are not contented to let me escape
thus; my <hi>Heart</hi> as well as <hi>Opinion</hi> you dissect, and
there make such a discovery of Venome, if the <hi>unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished
Fame and sacred Credit</hi> your Epistoler gives
you, prove true; that I should wonder how I
lived, did not Experience give a better account of
my <hi>Vitals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first <hi>Viper</hi> you meet with, is <hi>Malice,</hi> which
doubtless is a Grand Imp of Iniquity wherever
found; but, Sir, that a bare opposing an Opinion

guilty of; but truly, Sir, were the <hi>Saddle</hi> set
on the right Horse, an Acquaintance of mine would
have a great Burthen; for he cannot be content
to belye his Neighbors, but himself too. Who,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57311:12"/>
but he, Sir, do you think would have affirmed,
<hi>That the Observer would have approv'd the Essay</hi>
(and render'd himself a Knave to Posterity) <hi>for a
good Fish-Dinner souc'd in Wine?</hi> Who, but he,
<hi>would protest that he never required or used more than
one ascititious Line over or under the five,</hi> when in
the Plate of his Diagram he adds another, and
both contrary to his first Principle, for <hi>Four Lines
only?</hi> Who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>that the Observer was forced
to quit, the Places of his Obligations at</hi> Hackney <hi>for
his ill behaviour?</hi> (the contrary whereof will with
Truth and Modesty, be testified by all the Persons,
from the Mistresses to the Servants, during his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
there.) And who, but he, or <hi>Old Nick</hi> for him,
<hi>That those excellent Young men of His Majesties
Chappel, did many of them perfectly understand the
Rudiments of Musick before His Majesties happy
Return?</hi> The contrary being so evident, that for
above a Year after the Opening of His Majesties
Chappel, the Orderers of the Musick there, were
necessitated to supply the superiour Parts of their
Musick with <hi>Cornets</hi> and <hi>Mens feigned Voices,</hi> there
being not one Lad, for all that time, capable of
Singing his Part readily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prophaneness</hi> and <hi>Immodesty</hi> advance next: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, I have not as yet attain'd to that Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical
Sanctity (or rather Hypocrisie) to justifie
every Word or Action of my Life, I am more
sensible of the Defects of Humane Nature, and
hope, shall be more and more, till my happy Change
come. But to write prophanely, is a thing I ever
abhorr'd, and in confidence I never was guilty of
that Sin, I challenge you, and your Brother Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57311:13"/>
to produce one Word that any rational Man
shall judge to be so. And for Immodesty, 'tis pleasant
to see, how, after you, and your angry Admirer's
detesting that <hi>Paw</hi> ℞ in my <hi>Observation,</hi> and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out against it, <hi>'tis such stuff as a Man would
not touch with a pair of Tongs</hi> (as if you were of
that <hi>Sect</hi> who pretend to have found an Art for
Propagating Mankind without Females) that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of you can keep it out of your Mouths, you
are so in love with it: A cunning way to correct
Vice, doubtless! and not much unlike those Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of iniquity, <hi>who could quickly espy a Mote
in their Brothers Eye, but not take the least notice
of the Beam in their own,</hi> planting themselves into
the <hi>Row</hi> of the Just, with this misapplied <hi>Salvo,
To the clean all things are clean.</hi> This is Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
too, Sir, is it? If it be, 'tis only to those
whose straight-laced Consciences will permit them
<hi>to strain at a Gnat, and swallow a Camel;</hi> not to
those who endeavour to walk by that great Law of
<hi>Doing as they would be done to.</hi> And so farewel
<hi>Prophaneness,</hi> and your never to be honoured <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal
Beast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ignorance</hi> succeeds; which I heartily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my self to be stored sufficiently with, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the <hi>Scholastick way of Railing,</hi> wherein
you, and your <hi>Honourable Hand-man</hi> are excellent:
But, that after the spending most part of my Studies
in Composing <hi>Divine Hymns</hi> and <hi>Psalms,</hi> both in
<hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> taken out of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi>
either immediately as they lie, or collected as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
requir'd, <hi>to remain ignorant that</hi> God <hi>is a
Scripture-Name;</hi> this, Sir, is a Favour above all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57311:13"/>
Favours, and which through <hi>my sides</hi> darts at all
the Lay Catholicks in the World, but I'le leave
them to answer for themselves. The reason of
this Charge was, because I said, <hi>you mention'd not
a word of the Divine Vse of Musick in your Essay;</hi>
which under favour, Sir, I must say, and say again;
for, for you to urge that God was the Author of
it, is short of the purpose, <hi>he being the Author
of every good and perfect Gift,</hi> whether used in or
out of his <hi>Divine Service;</hi> or, to say that 'twas
used as a means to allay <hi>Saul</hi>'s Anger; for the care
of his Courtiers, whether Priests, Prophets, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
were to find a <hi>Cunning Harper</hi> to quiet him,
not to procure an Act of Devotion in him; no
more than what is done in the Case of one bitten
by a <hi>Tarantula.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Case</hi> is thus: That as you begun your
Book <hi>with the Advantages of Musick above other
Recreations;</hi> so, after you had spun out your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and <hi>waved</hi> even Philosophy to mix with
it, which you know, Sir, is but the Hand-maid to
Divinity and Divine Worship; you conclude it,
without so much as taking notice of either, thus:
<hi>But this is so far from our Practical Proposal, that
it may suffice to have given these hints, and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
lest while I plead for Musick, as a noble and
lawful Divertisement, it should be found guilty of
encroaching upon those more serious Studies, to which
it is to be only a Recreation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what hath hitherto been said, I hope, Sir,
the indifferent Reader will be satisfied, that the
<hi>Malicious, Lying, Ignorant, Immodest, Prophane</hi>
Parts of your Charge against me, are not on my
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57311:14"/>
side; but have with as much Modesty as their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would permit, return'd from whence they
came; though from your self, nothing is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
being you have long since declared your
resolution, never to be convinced. There remains
now, one only little Favour, which you have been
pleased to bestow upon my <hi>Person,</hi> that <hi>Mind</hi> and
<hi>Body</hi> might be equally Habited, which is, your
rendering me Squint-Eyed; and truly, Sir, 'tis of
the same Tincture with the former.</p>
            <p>Had I been <hi>Purblind, Copper-Nos'd, Sparrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mouth'd,
Goggle-Ey'd, Hunch-Back'd,</hi> or the
like, (Ornaments which the best of my Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists
are adorn'd with) what work would there
have been with me? but, thanks be to Heaven,
Nature has done her part, and so prevented your
farther Liberality on this poor Body of mine, and
consequently saved me the Labour of following your
Tract into such unfrequented Paths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you have
been forc'd to run through, from the Subject you
first undertook, <hi>to Make a Book,</hi> that whosoever
shall put himself to the trouble of a serious perusal
of, will not at all wonder, that Books are Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
<hi>of the Contempt of the Clergy,</hi> when such as
you, who have undertaken the Cure of Souls,
should spend that Precious Time, in vilifying and

and Assistances to your self; the due reward where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Only as the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has his touches at

            <p>In the first place I observe, He has been
very kind to his Pamphlet, to commend
it into the Hands of a Person who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to be very little affected with the
Subject, either desiring his three <hi>dumb
Brats</hi> might be taught to speak, or else
reprieving his <hi>Infant Cogitations</hi> from the
Tragical Candle, or more dishonourable
death of the Close-stool; which else must
have been their certain Fate, had they
fall'n into the Hands of any other Man,
who (to use the Language of his own
Sect) had understood the <hi>empty Nothingness</hi>
thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. He wonders <hi>He should receive so
little respect,</hi> since he <hi>professes himself to be
a Graduate of one of the most Noble Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
in the World.</hi> And truly I wonder
how he durst profess himself one of the
number. Surely he was either a very
great Truant, or else of a very unperforable
Pericranium; for he shews but a slender
sign of his University-Education: Where
he seems to have spent his time rather in
the more laudable Exercises of Trap and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57311:17"/>
Cricket, than in any sound Reading; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only leisure to adorn, and all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck
his surreptitious Master-of-Art-Ship
with the flatulent, drossie, and unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
part of Mock-Learning. So that his
<hi>Alma Mater</hi> has the least reason in the
World to thank him for his taking notice
of her. Much better had it been, since
he would give himself the Title of <hi>Master
of Art,</hi> to have wrote himself <hi>ex Ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bajarum
Collegio;</hi> a thing we should have
much sooner believ'd, than his being of
<hi>Trinity College.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is very angry to be compar'd to the
<hi>Gentleman Vsher of the Bears,</hi> which he
out of his great Experience in reading
<hi>Venerable Ancestors,</hi> terms the <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis</hi>
of himself into a <hi>Iackanapes.</hi> For
my part, I confess, I can pick out no such
Meaning out of the Words; however 'tis
fitting the Gentleman should have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of his own Interpretation, since no
body knows what shape best becomes him,
better than himself.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>And all those Venerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
we read</hi>—Pray, good Sir, let me
entreat you to leave out the <hi>We:</hi> You read
<hi>Venerable Ancestors!—ridete mortales</hi>—
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57311:17"/>
Men that read <hi>Venerable Ancestors,</hi> never
want what is common to all Mortals, only
some few <hi>Masters of Art,</hi> the thing call'd
<hi>Common Sense;</hi> and when they take an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to pieces to answer him, never mistake
the plain and palpable Meaning of the
Words. I am not so fond, to think the
<hi>Observer</hi> so unwary, to compare such a
dwindling <hi>Vindicator</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> in that
sense which he assumes to himself, that is
not able to conquer the little <hi>wrigling Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots</hi>
he snaps at: Or to liken him to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi>
otherwise than as the Proverb led
the <hi>Observer,</hi> to shew, by his silly beginning,
what a wise end he was like to make.</p>
            <p>He now comes to an open Confession of
his Inabilities: though afterwards, out of
a most disingenious Repentance, he would
fain put it off with an Ironie, by which,
he endeavours to insinuate a larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of himself; but the Plot's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
and, as the Devil would have it,
by his own particular self; for he that a
little before was aspiring to be a <hi>Goliah,</hi> a
<hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Hercules,</hi> now condescends to be
<hi>granted</hi> a <hi>Sot,</hi> a <hi>Coxcomb,</hi> nay <hi>any thing,</hi>
rather than not have a Name in the World.
Truly 'tis pity no body will take the pains,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57311:18"/>
to make him the Subject of another <hi>Moriae
Encomium:</hi> I humbly conceive, it would
be no <hi>Paradox,</hi> as the <hi>Former</hi> was. He
makes a small attempt to be a kind of an <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dipus</hi>
also, and to put forth a Riddle;
talking, <hi>numine Fanatico afflatus,</hi> of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque
upon Poetry,</hi> and <hi>Verse upon Burlesque:</hi>
prety words indeed, however he had the
good luck to come by 'um; but since they
stand there without Rhyme or Reason, we
are bound to believe, that he made use of
'um only to shew us his great skill and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in <hi>Venerable Ancestors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on, with much meekness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
himself to be what indeed he is, a
very inconsiderable waster of clean Paper;
rendring himself much more contemptible
by that vain and ridiculous superbity, that
peeps through the Pillory of his own
feigned <hi>Humility.</hi> Truly those notable
Expressions of <hi>Augur-hole,</hi> and <hi>behind the
Wainscot,</hi> do very well become him: A
right worshipful <hi>Master of Arts,</hi> and of
long standing, and a very great Ornament
to <hi>one of the most Noble Vniversities in the
World,</hi> that has hardly yet forgot his
Childish Plays of <hi>All Hid,</hi> and <hi>Fools Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>

            <p>

strange <hi>Hobgoblin</hi> stands in his way, which
his foresaid <hi>Humility</hi> seems much to fear,
but his foregoing <hi>Pride</hi> seems much to scorn;
<hi>A terrible Fellow in Buff;</hi> to encounter
whom, he seems to have put a great share
of that little wit he has, upon the dry
Grindstone of his empty Common place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Book;
where after a long search, he finds
<hi>Mercury</hi> to be in Conjunction with <hi>Mars,</hi>
and therefore gives him the Title of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatical
Poetafter.</hi> See how this <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
Mushrome</hi> begins to swell with the
Poyson of his own conceited Imaginations.
He that has as little judgment in Poetry,
as he has in Musick, and understands an
Epigram no more than a wild Inhabitant
of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> will be nibling at <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,</hi>
as little to be regarded as his <hi>Ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

that follows.</p>

            <p>It might be expected perhaps the poor

but 'twas expected withall, that his <hi>Trinity

so ill use of his weak Artillery, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be so fetter'd and entangled in the

                  </gap>as</hi> was a <hi>Phrygian,</hi> a

Apollo</hi> laught at it, but because he

many others; and then returns an <hi>Answer.
Marsyas</hi> replyes, by way of <hi>Vindication.</hi>
But the Judges found the <hi>Essay</hi> and the

that they order'd <hi>Marsyas</hi> to be flead
alive for his presumption. This Story grates
upon the Ears of the <hi>Trinity Scholar</hi> (as it
behoves every Man to look to his own
Flesh) and therefore to allay the fury of
a certain Spirit in Buff, which his own
Guilt has discovered, he has provided
himself, from the Hands of some <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:57311:19"/>
Sorcerer, as is conjectur'd, of a most
powerful <hi>Charm</hi> or <hi>Spell,</hi> consisting of two
<hi>Trithemian</hi> Words, <hi>Epigrammatical</hi> and
<hi>Poetaster;</hi> for that you may be sure was his
intention, seeing most Charms are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
composed of insignificant Words. And
to make it the stronger, he has found out
another piece of Witchcraft, which he calls
<hi>Defunct.</hi> A word, which I do assure him the
<hi>Man in Buff</hi> never so much as dreamt of;
being nothing but what his quaint cunning
only did invent, to raise to himself the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure
of a paltry University Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that with so much straining at
wit, as easily discovers the costiveness of
his Brains. They that will take the pains
to read it, may thereby soon find out,
what a Great <hi>Master of Art</hi> can do, if he
be hard put to't. But had a Man prais'd
him, it had been all one, for 'tis not the
quality, but the quantity which he grumbles
at. For now he seems not so mad that
Verses were made upon him, but that
there were no more of the same kind; as
if he measur'd the goodness of Lines, by
the length of the Vicars Hour-glass, or
the tediousness of his own Repetitions.
Gentlemen, I am but one, and therefore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57311:20"/>
let me desire you to make a Collection
among ye, that this our second honest <hi>Tom

<hi>Vindicator in propria personâ,</hi> yclad not in
<hi>Buff,</hi> but in a colour something a kin to it,
with a little mixture of <hi>Red.</hi> If you like
him not in that shape, you may imagin him
to be some Mountebank curvetting upon
the Sage with a Remedy for Frenzies, or
a sleepy Potion for Chyrurgeons to use
while they cut off Gangren'd Limbs; for
the following Pages are such Hum-drum,
drowsie, heavy, impertinent stuff, that a
a Man can hardly read 'um over without
putting himself to all the inconveniences
of Opium: 'Tis like <hi>Lethe</hi> or the <hi>Lotos</hi>
Tree. And one would swear that the
Author had either drank the one, or eat
of the Fruit of the other, for he presently
falls into a fantastical Dream, and seems to
sit talking idly to himself of a certain A-rithmetical
Mystery of the Beast, which
he has compendiously reduc'd from the
Numbers 666 to the Number 81. A subtle
kind of trifle that might perhaps have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57311:20"/>
troubl'd the Brains of <hi>Napier</hi> or <hi>Broughton,</hi>
or somebody else as mad as they, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but never to be admitted within the

onely of the Folly of a contemptible

            <p>But now, guilty by his own confession of
the drowsie <hi>flatness</hi> of his foregoing Lines,
the Gentleman promises much Wit, an

of Wit; but proves the arrant'st Cheat in

believe that he writes man, before the poor
Child can speak plain. By which he thinks
to angle to himself a notable business: For,
quoth he to himself, If I could but perswade
the World, that all my <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> were
<hi>puppies</hi> to <hi>me;</hi> and that there was nothing
of <hi>true Musick</hi> upon the face of the Earth,
before I came to be Two and Twenty
Years of Age; then would all the ignorant

West; yea, from every point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
to learn <hi>Musick</hi> of <hi>Me:</hi> And I should
be the only Teacher under the spreading
Canopy of Heav'n. Now that this is the
<hi>Advancement of Musick,</hi> which he so craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
designs, is as plain as his pretty picture
before his Book, for why? He is come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
from <hi>proposing,</hi> to <hi>professing;</hi> and to
shew what high things he aims at, he invites
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57311:22"/>
all <hi>His Majesties honourable Servants</hi> to go
to School to him at <hi>Hackney,</hi> Famous for the
Seminaries of young Girls; but never fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
that ever I heard of before for the
Instruction of <hi>His Majesties Honourable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:</hi>
They may take their Bottles and
their Baskets, and go if they please; but
I fear the blemish he has laid upon them of
wanting the knowledge of the <hi>Nature</hi> and
<hi>reasons of Musick,</hi> till furnish'd from such a
<hi>Bawble-stall</hi> as his, has quite knock'd out
the brains of his Infant project. And so
Gentlemen, you may safely pass over to his
<hi>32 p.</hi> without the least detriment to your
future knowledge: For I'le say that for
him and a fig for him, that he is the most
cautious person how he puts his Friends to
the trouble or necessity of writing much,
that ever I met with.</p>
            <p>In his 32 <hi>p.</hi> you may find him simp'ring to
himself, with a <hi>Sardonick</hi> smile to see his
<hi>publisher,</hi> (as he out of his copious stock of
most ingenious and scurrilous Eloquence
terms it) so <hi>arrogantly</hi> assaulted. See how
this little fly upon the Coach-wheel, would
vaunt and strut if it could! Good lack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day!
what a crime it was to assault his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher?
How the poor thing begs and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57311:23"/>
scrapes for applause! as if his deserts were
such as could keep his publisher from being
assaulted. Alass, we understood the worth
of his <hi>Publisher,</hi> without the assistance of
his lean Commendations: And we hope so
well of him, that when he was pleased to
countenance such a parcel of Thrums and
Mop-rags, as was the worshipful <hi>Essay,</hi>
'twas only in compliance with <hi>Horace,</hi> a
better Author than ever he will be; who
tells ye, that sometimes it is—<hi>Dulce desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere

to believe, because it is very credibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that the Gentleman has since openly
and candidly disclaim'd and deserted the
Vindicator's forlorn cause as altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worty
of his Patronage, declaring, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave him countenance or Commission
to write so many extravagant falsities and

within the verge of his protection.</p>

upon the <hi>Observer,</hi> as if he were ignorant
of <hi>the Names</hi> of <hi>God, Iubal,</hi> or <hi>Saul,</hi> as it
is a cavil founded upon a shallow surmise of
his own; an unseemly reflection, without
any ground, upon a man's Religion, so it
betrayes him not only to a hard opinion of
his Scholarship, but of his Gentility, and
that he has converst more with Kitts and
Petticoats, than with men of Education.</p>
            <p>But now the Scene alters, and enter <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator,</hi>

Twenty Bears in Twenty Years cannot lick

            <p>That way which requires an absurdity five
times over is much more to be exploded than
that which requires it but once.</p>
            <p>But the Observers Old way does require the
same (condemning) absurdity five times,
which the Essayers New one requires but
once.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Observers Old way is much
more to be exploded than the Essayers New
one.</p>
            <p>My first Objection against this Sillogism
(shame faw the lugs of our Master of Art)
is, that though it consist of <hi>English</hi> words,
yet that it is neither true sense, nor true
<hi>English:</hi> A sad story, that a Master of Art
cannot make <hi>English</hi> of <hi>English. That way
which requires an absurdity five times over,</hi>
and <hi>that way which requires it but once.</hi> Did
ever any Master of Art so forget himself,
as to grant that any Art or Science can
<hi>require an Absurdity?</hi> For,
<q>Dato uno Absurdo sequuntur Mille.</q>

            <p>Behold here a <hi>Trinity</hi> Fly entangled in

the bragging <hi>Puller down</hi> and <hi>Crusher</hi> that
Rodomontado'd so but just now? View
where the mighty <hi>Sampson</hi> lies with the
locks of his own ambitious strength quite
cutt off by his own <hi>Dalilahs</hi> BMT. And
now Master of Art, have a care, have a

The Common Law of Sense and Reason
which thou hast broken, Prosecutes thee.
<hi>Thomas Salmon,</hi> M. A. of <hi>Trin. Coll. Oxon,</hi>
hold up thy Hand; for thou standest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
for the felonious murder of a Sillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism,
contrary to the Statutes of Logick
in that case made and provided; and more
than that, for counterfeiting the Kings <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
and the Stamp of Soveraign Reason;
of all which thy Country hath found thee
guilty: And now what hast thou to say
why Sentence should not pass against thee
according to Law? March to the Place of
Execution; and so the Lord have mercy
on thee, for a Poor Scholar.</p>
            <p>Having objected against the <hi>English;</hi> I
am in the next place to condemn the <hi>form</hi>
of the <hi>Sillogism;</hi> For this is a certain Rule,
<q>Conclusio non differt a questione.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:57311:25"/>But his <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Conclusion</hi> are so far
from agreeing, that the Conclusion which
ought to be a part of the Argument, quite
varies from it. His Major is,</p>
            <p>That way which requires an absurdity five
times over, is much more to be exploded then
that which requires is but once.</p>
            <p>His inference is,</p>
            <p>Therefore the Observers old way is much
more to be exploded than the Essayers New
one.</p>
            <p>Let them that are dim-sighted put on
their Spectacles, and try if they can find
the <hi>Essayers New one</hi> in the <hi>Major;</hi> which
ought, as he intended his Sillogism, to have
been the extream term of his first Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
which being left out in the Major,
dashes his whole Sillogism in pieces against
the known Maxim of Logick.</p>
            <q>Quòd non debet esse plus aut minus in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusione,

            <p>In the next place, there ought not in a

in the <hi>Medium</hi> of this Sillogism you shall
find a <hi>fourth Term</hi> by the name of the <hi>Same
Condemning</hi> shoulder'd in; to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</p>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57311:26"/>And thus much as concerning a thing
call'd a Sillogism, the <hi>Author</hi> of which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a certain young man, I advise to take
the <hi>Observers Horn-book,</hi> and his <hi>Accidence,</hi>
and two pieces of Bread and Butter clapp'd
together, and get him to School again,
and to leave off his Fooling with <hi>Essayes</hi>
and <hi>Vindications,</hi> and diving into Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
till he have got more Wit and more
Learning.</p>
            <p>But because the Sillogism will not take,
he is resolv'd to be-lye the <hi>Observer;</hi> telling
ye an idle story, that the <hi>Observer</hi> makes the
Sillable <hi>Vt</hi> to <hi>force the Tongue against the
Roof of the Mouth.</hi> This is altogether
false: He tells ye indeed, that there are
Consonants which will do it, as most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there are; but ascribes no such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
to that particular <hi>Sillable,</hi> as he with
his usual gift of mistaking, endevours to
demonstrate. And therefore his supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the <hi>Observers Tongue hung the
wrong way,</hi> was but an effect of the wrong
hanging of his own giddy Brains.</p>
            <p>But this is common: Even in the next
page, behold another piece of his wonted
mis-quotation. The Observer cries out,
<hi>O Resormation! how amiable art thou in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57311:26"/>
Nostrils of them that cannot see! Was it ever
heard, felt, or understood, that the Toning of
the Voice must take its rise from a Semi-tone,</hi>
&amp;c. This the <hi>Vindicator</hi> calls a resolution
in the <hi>Observer to be for the future guided by
his seeing, feeling, and understanding No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils,</hi>
and terms it <hi>a most excellent expression
to shew</hi> a further <hi>advancement of his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
A meaning he could never have
pick'd out of the words, had not some
<hi>Iacob Behmen</hi> enlightened his Pericranium,
as indeed 'tis very fit that one <hi>Heretick</hi>
should help <hi>another.</hi> But 'tis a strange
thing, that he that so much scorns the <hi>Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book,</hi>
should want a fescue for his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
Is it not a miracle, that a
<hi>Vindicator</hi> should so grope in the dark, and
blunder through his adversaries text, that
carries such a spiritual Lanthorn about him,
besides the <hi>Flambeaus</hi> of his own Wit and
Memory.</p>
            <p>But so it is, that now again because he
cannot Answer the Question proposed, (as
no body did ever expect he should,) that
therefore he gives his old preceptor <hi>Misquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
a Letter of Attorney to speak for
him. Truly, my dear Friend, three false
Quotations in less than two Pages, are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57311:27"/>
not so commendable a virtue as you may
imagin. What will the World think of
your Book, cramm'd with so many imperfect
and insipid untruths? A most special <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator,</hi>
who because he cannot answer Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
propos'd, will raise other stupid
ones of his own, which he thinks himself to
have a more facil way of confuting. For
whereas the Observer thought it strange,
that the <hi>Toning of the Voice should take its
rise from a Semi-tone.</hi> He taxes the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
of accusing him for beginning to
learn <hi>the Monosyllables from a Hemi-tone.</hi>
To which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> answers, <hi>p.</hi> 54,
That those Sillables are not <hi>learnt for any
airy pleasantness in themselves, but as rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to distinguish Notes and half Notes,</hi>
&amp;c. Gentlemen you hear his acute and
pertinent reply, set off with a ridiculous
<hi>Though I have often told him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a <hi>Magnificent Bubble</hi> is this, to talk
of <hi>telling</hi> and <hi>answering,</hi> and at the same
time to betray such a sottish dotage, as not
to know what a true answer is. The thing
is so plain, that 'twould be a <hi>Vindicators</hi>
folly to insist further on it.</p>
            <p>The conceit of having so exquisitely
answer'd that Objection, has set him a crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57311:27"/>
most violently upon his own dung-hill.
His imagination is highly tickl'd with the
Observers telling him that <hi>Mistress Mi is
rambled out of her Apartiment and turn'd
Quean. But</hi> quoth he, <hi>Let her ramble into
all the Apartiments about the Town, she shall
never want a gentleman Vsher, as long as he
is able to man her.</hi> And of this, he is as
sure as that <hi>four two pences make two groats.</hi>
How pleasant the Gentleman is, now he has
got an oportunity to fancy himself in <hi>Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners-Lane;</hi>
for you may guess at his haunts,
by his single Money. You see, as early day as
it is, how expert he is: And would you have
thought such a modest young man had been
creeping into the Houses of Iniquity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready?
But the Devil oft-times carries
youth to those places, out of his great zeal
to make them detest their Vices. Come,
come, ne're blush for't: As good abroad
as at home; For if <hi>Mistriss Mi</hi> be a Quean,
she's one of his own making; (perhaps
not the first has been made at a Boarding-School,)
and so the Gentleman-Usher
returns back to his Bed-Chamber, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
to advise him, to look well to the
Calves of his own Leggs, and not to be so
vainly merry with his smutty and ungentle
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57311:28"/>
flections upon other mens Conversations.</p>
            <p>He tells ye, <hi>he honours Mr. Simpson,</hi> and
yet some Pages before, looks upon him so
much beneath his <hi>great reading,</hi> that he only
thinks him a Companion for the <hi>Observers
mean Capacity.</hi> The best on't is, we look
upon him as a <hi>real Exception</hi> to all true
<hi>Maxims.</hi> For if <hi>honour</hi> were in <hi>honorante,</hi>
while he is the bestower, sad were our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
But there is no such thing in him,
or that can come from him; it is rather a
blemish, than a praise, to be well spoken of
by him; and therefore let him honour
e'ne who he pleases.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to a great Astonishment at
the <hi>Observers resentment, against any propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
the knowledge of Musick,</hi> thereby
<hi>thinking</hi> to raise to himself a vain ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own endeavours. He means
doubtless, the famous <hi>Essay:</hi> A worshipful
<hi>Advancement of Musick</hi> indeed, which the
most ingenious Author durst not trust into
the World, without the strong recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and most notable blessing of a
Publishers Preface. For which courtisie
of helping a lame dog, <hi>Ferunt &amp; aiunt,</hi>
that some body or other had paid him in
<hi>pecuniis numeratis</hi> four Pound ten Shillings,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57311:28"/>
which render'd that some-body a wise man,
and the Counterfeit Essayer a meer Musical
Cully: And shews you how little Wit or
Memory he had, to tax the Observer for
being Mr. <hi>Playfords hireling.</hi> Alas! had
the Gentleman found there had been any
reputation to have been gotten by the
<hi>Essay,</hi> He would soon have wrench'd it
out of the <hi>Vindicators</hi> feeble hands, and
assum'd it to himself.</p>
            <p>And therefore I would have this idle
contemner of the <hi>Observer,</hi> forbear those
<hi>Hackney</hi>-windy-Bottle-Ale-expressions <hi>of
my Essay, my way, my Octaves, my Circulation.</hi>
'Twere a modesty more becoming him,
than the folly of an impertinent <hi>Vindicator,</hi>
and more worth his while, for the fame he
will get by his works. But amongst the
rest of his <hi>My's,</hi> What think you of <hi>My
Stationer?</hi> By my troth, he is well hope
up with an <hi>Author.</hi> I pity the poor man's
case, for in a short time the City will find
him out, and then he must either fine or
hold.</p>
            <p>In his 70. <hi>p.</hi> he prosecutes the Observer
for <hi>spoiling his Marriage,</hi> as he pretends,
for declaring him to have a <hi>rubical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</hi>
What a strange <hi>Map of Modesty</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57311:29"/>
this is, to be dash'd out of Countenance by
his own Face? No, No, my dear Friend,
'tis not the Colour will injure you; but
you are so bashful, so modest, so nice, so
startled at the very sound of a baudy
word, that it makes the Women believe
you have only a little heat in your Face,
and none no where else. Otherwise a
Masculine complexion would rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
than disappoint your <hi>Conjugal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</hi>
Nay, I dare affirm, (if it be not
as I say) that the Ladies are so mild, so
courteous, so meek, so endearing, so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging,
so tender-hearted, and merciful,
that they will never reject a young mans
suit for a pimple upon his Nose; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to that wicked intention of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server;
or rather, that wilful mistake of
his, of throwing dust in a Squires Face,
where he should have daub'd his <hi>Pomma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
But whence comes this red Face?
not by Drinking, nor Smoaking. But as
Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> learnedly tells ye, Ladies; <hi>lib.
de Sanguine,</hi> a Book which ye have all read,
<hi>by the errancy of the Blood,</hi> which causes <hi>a
great confluence of Spirits to the Brains.</hi>
A reason well urg'd to understanding Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Maids, but not to Illiterate men.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57311:29"/>
For how can this be apply'd to a person that
has neither <hi>Brains</hi> nor <hi>Spirits?</hi> 'Tis you,
therefore, (Ladies) that are guilty, and not
the <hi>Observer.</hi> 'Tis you that have kindled
those fires in his Breast, that have so sadly
scorch'd his Countenance; Disdain not
therefore <hi>your own Martyr.</hi> What though
you have tann'd his Face with the flaming
beams of your Beauty; yet is his Mind as
white as Snow, and his Thoughts as pure
as <hi>Lambs-Conduit</hi>-Water. For surely no
<hi>Pharisee</hi> did ever pretend to more Piety
and Virtue, than he assumes to himself on
every slight occasion. <hi>Nihil est te Sanctius
uno</hi>—Nay, this very redness of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
forsooth, must be the Gentleman-Usher
to his Godly life. He'l make ye
believe shortly, that his Nose is the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
of the Gospel. But all is not gold
that glisters; for methinks, with a little
crum of Riboldry, as he terms it, in the
Observers Answer, (such as has been ever
allowed in Satyrical replies) I thought
at first the modest maidenly Gentleman
would have fall'n into a Fit of the Mother;
but when I found him chomping and chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it so often in his Vindication, it was
apparent then, that 'twas not Anger which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57311:30"/>
had overcome him; but the sweetness, and
Honey-combness of the expression, that
had so ravish'd his pallate, so that he could
even have swallow'd it. He does so
tongue it, and lick it, as if 'twere his dear
Concubine BMT. So often and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessly
repeated, as if he took occasion to
scold at the <hi>Observer,</hi> only that he might
have an oppotunity to dandle the delicious
<hi>sucket</hi> upon the tip of his lascivions In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of tasting.</p>
            <p>He endeavours now of his great grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
to the Observer, to shew you, that
he has not been only at the University, but
at School too, though where with most
advantage to his Learning, will puzzle a
good Casuist to judge. However, in Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul,</hi> he has made a hard
shift to transcribe a certain Epigram out of
<hi>Val. Martial,</hi> as he calls him; a way of citing
<hi>Martial</hi> that I never knew a Scholar much
guilty of; but perhaps he took <hi>Val</hi> for <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi>
Christen name, and then I cannot blame
him for using that cunning mark of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.
But what has <hi>Martial</hi> to do with
the <hi>Observer?</hi> why, nothing that I know
of; but only to tell ye, that the Observer
wears a Peruque as many other men do,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57311:30"/>
and that he has made use of a youthful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
to put a deserved mockery upon
the Harlotry <hi>Dalilah's,</hi> of such a young
<hi>Pragmaticus.</hi> Who, if he had so pleas'd,
might have observ'd, that the very Author
whom he cites, makes use of far more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldry
(as he calls it) when he meets with
such an Impertinent, as the <hi>Essayer,</hi> and
thinks it convenient to have his guils well
rubb'd with his Satyrick Salt. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
being to reprehend the folly of some
trifling <hi>Essayer</hi> or other of his time, a great
Braggard, though but a small performer,
and Scandalously invective against his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niours
and Superiours; He handles him
without Mittins, as you may perceive in the
following lines presented the Vindicator

            <p>This, in brief, since he is pleas'd to remit
the <hi>Observer</hi> to my <hi>Construction,</hi> is all the
Character that I can give of his Works.
For what has <hi>Green tail,</hi> and <hi>Onion-like For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicotar</hi>
to do with a difference about the
<hi>Gamut.</hi> But the Gentleman must be <hi>al a
mode;</hi> For now we can neither plead nor
argue contrary, but the particular lives
and conversations of men must be ravel'd
into, to make slender arguments for weak
Themes, and feeble Causes: A kind of
unmannerly Oratory, that deserves to be
convinc'd rather by Horse-Logick, than by
replies of Pen and Ink.</p>
            <p>Page 78. He sayes there is <hi>one serap of
an Argument</hi> behind yet. That <hi>these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi>
meaning the Kings Servants, <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd</hi>
to their <hi>eminence in Musick</hi> by the
Old Scale. What fairer Argument would
this great Musitian have, than such a one,
to prove that there is no need of his <hi>Ledger
du main?</hi> If the Scale now in use be a
sufficient <hi>cause,</hi> what need He, or any other
such unskilful Busie-body trouble their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57311:31"/>
brains whether it be the <hi>Causa sine qua non,</hi>
or no? <hi>'Twere pity,</hi> quo he, <hi>but the Scale
were cut in Alablaster, and shew'd among the
Tombs.</hi> And 'twere pity, quo I, but His
geugaw, BMT, were cut in Paper for
Comfit-makers Boxes; or more seriously
lay'd up among <hi>Iohn Tradescants</hi> Bawbles.
Surely since those Gentlemen he speaks of
did not attain to their <hi>Eminency</hi> by inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as no question but their own Mortality
will confess the contrary; 'tis a very strange
piece of over-weening rancour in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatour,
to deprive the Poor Harmless
<hi>Gamut,</hi> of that petty Honour, which is due
to the rudiments of all Sciences: Just like
the Mountebank <hi>Paedagogues</hi> about the
Town, that will be reviling the stanch
Foundations of Ancient <hi>Lilly,</hi> to usher
in their pedantical lucubrations, and to
get themselves a silly credit in the World,
by seeking to cajole the Parents of their
Scholars with their own new-fangled Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.
And all this while, where lyes the
stress of so much <hi>Trinitonian</hi> fury, but only
against the miserable <hi>Vt,</hi> and forlorn <hi>Re?</hi>
For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Mi, Fa, Sol, La,</hi> are his white Boys still,
and admitted into the School-Room to
converse with his young Gentlewomen,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57311:32"/>
BMT as formerly. Would ye know
the reason; on my word 'tis a profound
one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, thinks he, now the <hi>Gamut</hi> is
gelt, it may be trusted among Maiden Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen,
which before was somewhat
dangerous, when it had the two testicles of
<hi>Vt</hi> and <hi>Re,</hi> annexed to it. Though I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how BMT themselves scape his lash,
there being as much reason why <hi>Base, Mean,</hi>
and <hi>Treble,</hi> damm'd obsolete Terms of
Musick, should suffer the scourge of this
Innovating Whipping <hi>Tom,</hi> as <hi>Gam ut</hi> and
<hi>A re.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore might our worthy Vindicator
have spar'd his frivolous conceit, that
<hi>Those</hi> Gentlemen <hi>came to be no more eminent
for having read the Scale,</hi> than the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
for conquering the World, because his
name was Alexander.</hi> An inference that
has no more coherence with sense than
<hi>Bedlam</hi> with any thing of <hi>Trinity-College</hi>
but himself.</p>
            <p>'Tis a <hi>Ianus</hi>-like fansie, that looks two
ways at once; one part of his Argument
rows one way, and the other looks another
way; or to make it yet plainer, as if one
Waterman should row one way at the head,
and another the quite contrary way at the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57311:32"/>
stern, till they pull the Boat in pieces;
which indeed is the true Character of all
the Arguments in his Book. True reason
would have kept him close to his text, and
have told him there was as much likelihood
of <hi>Alexanders</hi> learning the principles of
War, as there was, that the other should
be taught the Rudiments of Musick; so
that if he will grant our Musitians to be
eminent, It will be an easie thing, without
his assistance, to prove that the first ground
and source of their Eminency arose from
their knowledge of the Scale, which is
the first principle of Musick; as we may
well believe the first rise of the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's</hi>
greatness was from the great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he had of the first Elements of War;
which being the primary grounds of his
Knowledge, were the primary cause of
that greatness which he attain'd by his
Knowledge. And thus I suppose, the Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book
and Primar were the first Originals
of that great learning to which our Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
imagins himself to have so sublimely
clamber'd. But this is common sense, and
therefore a thing too mean for him to take
notice of, or else without the verge of his
understanding.</p>

concluded with the grossest brand of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
that ever was fix'd upon the <hi>sober</hi>

            <p>Thus much for <hi>Tobit,</hi> now for his <hi>Little

that with much Imprudence,
nothing of Truth; much of Confidence,
nothing of Learning; comes a day after
the Fair, to set his <hi>probatum est</hi> to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebankeries
of his Master Quack. He was
mightily overseen that he did not fix a
Label of the Musical Cures wrought by
his Benefactor, like a <hi>Covent-Garden Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latan:</hi>
Then might the worshipful Title
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57311:33"/>
of the <hi>Essay</hi> and <hi>Vindication</hi> have been
more happily exalted, as frequently they
were, by the Industrious Stationer, jigg by

the City, when back'd with so many At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
as one of <hi>Melpomene</hi>'s Knights of
the Post, with a little labour could have
easily brought him. You may know what
part of the Creation he is, by his Braying.
This is he that follows the Vindicator, as
the Bell-man's Cur follows his Master. A
kind of Beetle engender'd by the heat of
a <hi>Trinity</hi> Meteor, who while the most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant
Luminary mov'd in our Hemisphere,
slept all the time, but He being set in the
Ocean of his own Fopperies, up comes
this drowsie Insect, buzzing into your

This is he, who being perhaps as
well pay'd for his Letter, as the other was
for his Preface, stands ready like the Fool
in the Play, to justifie whatever mistakes
the Vain glorious Squire shall be guilty of.
I should have expected this Miserable <hi>Too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
with his diminutive Trumpet to have
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57311:34"/>
stood at the Dore of the <hi>Monstrous Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
to draw in Customers, with a <hi>step in
Gentlemen;</hi> and not to have come sneaking
at the end of a Pamphlet, as if he were
only the Vindicators Excrement, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that very Apocriphal Fart he speaks
of, fizzled from the tayl of his own Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Pedagogue, and fasten'd upon him, as
my Lady puts her scapes upon <hi>Button.</hi>
You may easily take the Height of his
Knowledge without a <hi>Iacobs</hi> Staff; for he
tells ye, he has <hi>receiv'd considerable advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
from the <hi>Essayer.</hi> This is just according
to the Proverb <hi>Asinus Asinum scabit.</hi>
But now—

            </p>
            <p>By'r leave, Gentlemen, for a <hi>Hyperbole,</hi>

<hi>is too Sacred</hi>—Sure the Vindicator must
be either a <hi>Nazarite</hi> from his Cradle, or
some particular vow of separation to the
Lord; else how ridiculously looks the
grand and Royal Title of <hi>Sacred</hi> so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decently
bestowed upon the low Credit of
a bare Young BMT-monger, and more
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57311:34"/>
indiscreetly suffer'd by an Ostentatious
Vindicator. But let him write another
Pamphlet, though ne're so simple, and
Majesty shall hardly suffice him; let him
but add a fourth, and you shall find <hi>N. E.</hi>

find you can part with your Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at a cheap rate: Though I had
thought, men ought to have valu'd their

Herrings and Mackaril. But this it is,
when inconsiderate start-ups will be scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that know not how to guide their
Pens. In my opinion we will allow the
puff'd up Vindicator to take all <hi>N. E</hi>'s.
petition'd-for Praises to himself, and make
his best of them. Let him but wear them
a little in the wind, and he'l soon discover
the baseness of their Metal: For is there
any person so mad, as to think <hi>Sodomy</hi> the
more commendable, beause a Cardinal once
wrote in praise of it. However we find
large Commendations given to the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense
and arrogance of an <hi>Essay,</hi> and a
more unnecessary and loathsome <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Which indeed renders the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mender
the greater Impostor of the two.
Thus they that will undertake to praise
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57311:35"/>
and sell their tinsel Wares for right Silver
or Gold, are far greater Cheats than they
who make them for such. Men, and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
especially, that intend their Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums
should be believ'd, should consider
whom and what they praise; and not
with such an insipid Prodigality wast the
Jewels of Commendation, as if they were
casting Beans by peck-fulls to fat Boars.
Such Magnifyings, rather become Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations,
while the unwary Epistle-maker
does but baffle his own good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to his Friend. So that if any of
the Two, be happy in the Famous <hi>Letter</hi> of
<hi>N. E.</hi> 'tis the Observer, while his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
grows to be the more notorious, by
the weak endeavour of a frivolous Author
to load him with a heap of paltry Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
and empty Forgeries. A lewd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toller,
and by consequence a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
dispraiser. 'Tis well known that
the soundness, if not profoundness of the
Observers Judgement and Skill in Musick,
and the Excellency of his performance fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by so great a Monarch and his
Queen, both whom he serves in fair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
are far above the envy of such a
Momus as <hi>N. E.</hi> or the hairbrain'd Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57311:35"/>
of BMT. And therefore,

of long Notes;</hi> which if Fidlers, and

yet such <hi>strict Observances,</hi> as render them

however, I shall do my endeavour to write more
civilly than you, though in a more homely Stile.
The Thanks, Sir, which I intend to return, is only
a brief accompt of those few Inspections which I
have made into your new and elaborate <hi>Essay to the
Advancement of Musick, &amp;c.</hi> with some short Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply's
in defence of the Old Scale of Musick. This
being a Work of no great difficulty, I have the
more readily and willingly undertaken it; and (for a
return of your Favours) shall make bold to present
you with these my Remarques.</p>
            <p>First, Before your Title Page appears the Picture
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57311:37"/>
of a Fine young Lady (of Musical Education in
<hi>Hackney</hi> School no doubt) Playing and Singing to
her Lute. 'Twas excellent policy to fix such a fair
Bait there, for it will most certainly catch both the
Eyes and Hearts of all our new soft-headed Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants;
and undoubtedly draw more Spectators to
your Book than ever Merry <hi>Andrew</hi> did to his
Master <hi>Iacob Halls</hi> Stage.</p>
            <p>Next is the Title, or a Description of what is
held forth in your Book, in as many large promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Words and Truths, as there is in those Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank
Doctors Bills; which are pasted up at every
pissing Corner; (and it was ingeniously done of
your Stationer Mr. <hi>Car</hi> to paste your Title also in
the same places, since they do so well correspond;)
'tis in these words, <hi>An Essay to the Advancement of
Musick, by casting away the perplexity of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Cliffs, and uniting all sorts of Musick, Lute,
Viol, Violin, Organ, Harpsichord, Voice,</hi> (with &amp;c.
to include all other kinds, as Bagpipes Jews-trump,
Drums, Trumpets, Tongs, <hi>&amp;c.) in one Vniversal
Character.</hi> And that we might not think this
Work designed by a mean or obscure Person, it
follows, <hi>By</hi> THOMAS SALMON, <hi>Master
of Arts of</hi> Trinity College <hi>in</hi> Oxford. But how
well this is made out by you in your following
Discourse, I leave to the judgment of all ingenious
Musicians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the following Page is an Epistle by Mr.</hi> Iohn
Birchensha, <hi>your Publisher, no mean Person in
the Science of Musick, witness his Learned</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum
Musicum, <hi>and this his Epistle, or</hi> Flambeau,
<hi>to Light all Musicians out of their</hi> Egyptian <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57311:37"/>
to behold the</hi> New Light <hi>or</hi> Musical Elysium
<hi>held forth in your</hi> Essay: <hi>And this Commendatory
Epistle is so subtlely and plausibly done, to the
Advancement of your new Reformation, that he
deserves double the Reward he received for it. It
begins thus:</hi> There is not any Art, which at this
day is more Rude, Vnpolish'd, and Imperfect in the
Writings of the Ancient and Modern Authors, than
Musick; for the Elementary part thereof, is little
better than an indigested Mass, and confused Chaos
of impertinent Characters, and insignificant Signs.
It is intricate and difficult to be understood; it afflicts
the Memory, and consumeth much time, before the
knowledge thereof can be attained: Because the
Cliffs are divers; their Transpositions frequent; the
Order and places of Notes very mutable; and their
denominations alterable and unfix'd. These things
being considered by the ingenious Author of this Book,
(who endeavoureth only a reformation of the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Principles of Practical Musick) he hath here
presented thee with an Eexpedient, for the redress of
these Obstacles, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, you being that ingenious Author here
mentioned, which has by your elaborate Pains,
great Learning, and subtle Invention, found out this
new Expedient or Reformation, I shall leave the
Publisher and Epistle, and proceed to examin the
several Particulars and great Advantages proposed
to us by your Book.</p>
            <p>The first Chapter is nothing to the purpose of
Reformation, but a bare Discourse of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Musick, which is frequent in all Authors
that have written of that Science.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:57311:38"/>The second Chapter is entituled, <hi>The Gamut Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd:</hi>
Here the Axe is laid to the Root, and you
begin your Reformation thereof in words of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and defamation, thus: <hi>That which first of all
terrifies a Beginner, is a long Discourse of Gibbrish,
a fardle of hard Names and fictitious Words, called
the</hi> Gamut, <hi>presented to him perfectly to be learned
without Book, till he can readily repeat it backwards
and forwards; as though a man must be exact in the
Art of Conjuring before he might enter upon Musick.</hi>
Are not these prety Bugbear Words, to fright Boys
and Girls ever from learning Musick by such a
<hi>Gamut,</hi> that is compounded of hard insignificant
Words to Conjure up Devils? This, Sir, shews,
that because you understand not the excellent Use of
that <hi>Gamut,</hi> and its Words or Names, you are
therefore offended with it, and endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
others to the same opinion with your self,
which is ever the practice of Innovators. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Sir, Men of greater knowledge in the Science
of Musick than you can pretend to, have declared
them of better Use; who tell us, That they are
Words or Names, by which Notes or Sounds are
called and known in their distinct and proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and Notes or Sounds comprehend Musick,
and Musick is known rather to expel Devils than
raise them; it did out of <hi>Saul,</hi> but, Sir, what
operation it may have upon you, I know not. You
go on in these Words, <hi>But I am certain if he can say,</hi>
G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, <hi>it will do to all intents and
purposes [as well].</hi> We thank you for this <hi>as well,</hi>
but, Sir, will it do no better? then why do you
propose it to us, when there's no advantage in it?
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57311:38"/>
Are we not much beholding to you, Sir, to deprive
us of our Old Scale, which is Universally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
and by known experience found to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and good. And impose upon us this New one
of your own production, lame and deformed,
a thin-gut Monster, which has neither Speech nor
Language, whereby it may be understood; yet are
you so in love with it, that you would fain lick it
into some kind of form: But your Tongue (though
well hung) is not long enough.</p>
            <p>Your next words are these, <hi>For the plain truth is,
there are but seven Notes in all, only repeated over and
over again in double and treble proportion.</hi> You
say very right, Sir, but this is demonstrated
more plain in the Old Scale than in your New one,
as thus it appears: In the Old Scale the seven Notes
and their Names are repeated three times over in
words at length, on their proper and assigned Rules
and Spaces: In yours but once, and that in single
Letters only; which you tell us is to be done over
and over in double and treble proportions. Surely
this needs must confound a Beginner, there being no
plain demonstration to guide him, but only your
Eight single Letters, and his own Imagination.</p>
            <p>Page 14. your words are these, <hi>Those afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
hard Names are nothing to the purpose, they
can't declare a Note to be in a different Octave.</hi>
This declares again, that you do not, or wilfully
will not understand the Old Scale, notwithstanding
Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> lately sent you an excellent pair of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Spectacles for that purpose, with which if
you view the Old Scale, you will see there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
names enough in each of the Octaves, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57311:39"/>
them in their proper places of <hi>Bass,
Mean,</hi> and <hi>Treble.</hi> Is not the Octave to <hi>Gam ut</hi>
in the <hi>Bass G sol re ut</hi> in the <hi>Mean?</hi> To <hi>A re,
A la mi re;</hi> To <hi>B mi, B fa b mi;</hi> To <hi>C fa ut,
C sol fa ut;</hi> To <hi>D sol re, D la sol re?</hi> Here are
diverse Names sufficient to distinguish between the
Octaves of the <hi>Bass</hi> and <hi>Mean.</hi> So in the <hi>Treble,</hi>
or higher Octave there are differe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Names, as
<hi>C sol fa, D la sol, E la;</hi> which Names are in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the lower Octaves of <hi>Mean</hi> and <hi>Bass.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Objection against the Old Scale is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and may be fixed more properly upon your
New one, which consists only of Eight single
Letters, set down in this Chap. Page 17. and there
named The <hi>New Gamut:</hi> So that all a Beginner
hath to distinguish your Octaves by, is to say <hi>A</hi> in
the first, and <hi>A</hi> in the second, and <hi>A</hi> in the third,
which is the whole design of your—what d'ye
call't—Hypothesis, or circulation of Octaves;
and probably might hold good, if all that learn'd
your way, were taught to Sing by Letters, or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blature;
for by Notes they cannot: And this it
was which made you scratch your head to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
But what will not a man do, before he will
scratch a hole in't: Alass, your New <hi>Gamut</hi> is so
young, it can't speak, nor ever would, unless you
seek out for help; wherefore, rather than it should
continue speechless, you'l take confidence, and
borrow out of the Old Scale those Gibbrish Words
or Names of Notes, <hi>Sol La Mi Fa, &amp;c.</hi> which
but a little before you render so terrible to a
Learner. He that shall read your Page 15. will
have cause to smile to hear how ridiculously you
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57311:39"/>
quarrel against the Old Scale; yet in the four last
Lines thereof your words are these—<hi>Wherefore
that We may know how to place</hi> Mi, <hi>They give us this
Rule,</hi> (not so, for you take it) <hi>which alwayes holds
good,</hi> (a civil acknowledgment) viz. <hi>before</hi> Mi <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
to name</hi> Fa Sol La, <hi>and after</hi> Mi <hi>descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
La Sol Fa.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, you have gotten this Old Rule, I will
insert your following words in the next Page, that
it may appear to all Judicious persons what a prety
confusion you make about ordering them for the
Mouth of your <hi>New Gamut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that which they are to be blamed for in this is,
that when they have given their Scholars a Notional
understanding of this direction, their practice is to
take their rise from <hi>Sol,</hi> and Sing <hi>Sol La Mi Fa Sol
La Fa Sol;</hi> as though <hi>Sol</hi> was the syllable from
whence they should take aim, by which means they never
perfect their main rule, and so as <hi>Mi</hi> alters, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in naming their Notes; whereas, if in their
practice they begin with <hi>Mi,</hi> and so Sing forwards,
<hi>Mi Fa Sol La Fa Sol La Mi,</hi> they would at once learn
to rise an Octave with their Voice, and gain a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
in this Rule, which they are always to account
by in whatsoever condition they find <hi>Mi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to no purpose to plead that <hi>Sol</hi> is for the most
part in the <hi>Cliff line,</hi> and therefore ready to begin
with as they go upward; because these syllables are
practiced only in order to other Singing; now Songs
begin not with <hi>Sol,</hi> and go forward in that method,
but upon any Note, and so skip about, that no Rule
can be observed, but that which we contend for always
to be practised.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:57311:40"/>This is indeed the language of your whole Book,
(as it will appear to such as shall read it) 'tis such a
<hi>Babel</hi> of confusion, Fardle of contradictions, and
Impossibilities: Such a Mathematical Rat-Trap of
Non-sense, as the like was never made in <hi>Crooked-Lane.</hi>
In the former Chapter you confine the
Notes, here the Names, and set them in the Stocks
together; as appears by these your next words,
Page 18.</p>
            <p>We are sure, what we have undertook, is sufficiently
proved, that <hi>G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G,</hi> will do as well
as the old hard Names; and for the placing of <hi>Mi,</hi>
you must take the usual Monosyllables, so you order
them in the most practicable method, viz <hi>Mi Fa
Sol la Fa Sol La Mi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that here <hi>Mi</hi> is always in your first line <hi>G,
Fa</hi> in <hi>A, Sol</hi> in <hi>B,</hi> and <hi>La</hi> in <hi>C;</hi> and so ascending
in your first Octave, you begin <hi>Mi</hi> again in the
second: All by way of Circulation.</p>
            <p>And so again in the <hi>20th</hi> Page of your <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
your words are these, <hi>How happy would it be
for the ease of Musick, and the exactness of Tuning,
if the same proportions were ever fixed to the same
places of the Septenary</hi> (or your Octaves) <hi>i. e.</hi> Mi
<hi>alwayes in</hi> B. And again, in Page 49. <hi>And about
the confinement of</hi> Mi <hi>with the avoiding regular</hi> flats
<hi>and</hi> sharps, <hi>I have delivered my Iudgement in the
Description of my Whirligig:</hi> (That is your Cart
Wheel with Seven Spokes:) The first beginning in
<hi>Mi</hi> and as it makes a turn round, it comes to <hi>Mi</hi>
again. So that all you give us for a New
<hi>Gamut,</hi> is your Whirligig, or Wheel of seven
Spokes, marked with <hi>G A B C D E F,</hi> which you
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57311:40"/>
say is a speedier way to attain Musick then to take
a long Journey on foot by the Old <hi>Gamut.</hi> And
since your nearest way to it is the furthest about, let
those that like it take it, and your second Chapter to
boot: I have done with it. If this won't do, I
have yet more in Vindication of the Old Scale of
<hi>Musick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come next to your Third Chapter, (in which and
the former is contained your whole Design) En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
<hi>The Cliffs reduced to one Vniversal Character.</hi>
The first Page of it is nothing to the purpose, but
a fardle of words about <hi>Tablature, &amp;c.</hi> But in the
middle of your next page your words are these,
<hi>The present Practice</hi> (or Old Way) <hi>is to make
three Cliffs, whose Notes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which they are called,
are a Fifth above one another; and according to the
most conveniency in writing, are usually assigned to
there places, as in the Scheme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since you have done us the kindness to insert a
Scheme of our three Cliffs, in your Book, (which
you borrow'd out of Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi>'s <hi>Compendium,</hi>
Page 4. as you do all your other Examples from
him and other men) I doubt not to prove that your
new Invented Cliffs BMT will <hi>Be-e</hi> M <hi>p</hi> T <hi>y</hi> of
any Invention you pretend to the Advancement of
<hi>Musick.</hi>
            </p>
            <figure>
               <head>An Example of the Three proper Cliffs
assigned to each Part.</head>

               <p>Bass. Mean. Treble.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57311:41"/>By these Three Cliffs, as they are thus planted
in there usual and proper places, may be Prick'd any
Song proper for that Part, and in the compass of
the Voice, and without any transposition (except
it be in the <hi>C sol fa ut</hi> Cliff) which is vniversally
proper to the inward or middle Parts, and is so
transposed sometimes for conveniency of Pricking;
especially in Cathedral Musick, where Anthems
and Services of five and six Parts do require it:
Nor doth the transposition of that Cliff create
any confusion to a Beginner, as you <hi>vainly</hi> alledge;
for Vocal Musick is seldom learn'd by men of
Forty or Fifty Years old, but by those that are
young, whose Voyces are proper to the <hi>Treble,</hi>
and by that Cliff are only taught; nor is the
<hi>C sol fa ut</hi> Cliff now much used (unless as I said
before) in Cathedral Musick. If you cast your
Eye upon those several Collections of Ayres and
Songs, which I have lately published, you will find
I have not made use of the <hi>C sol fa ut</hi> Cliff in all
the second Part of the <hi>Musical Companion,</hi> which
consists of Songs of Two, Three and Four Parts;
but Printed them all in the <hi>G,</hi> or <hi>Treble</hi> Cliff, as
proper to be Sung by Men or Boys. As to my
<hi>Psalms</hi> in Four Parts, which are Printed in three
<hi>Tenor</hi> Cliffs and a <hi>Bass;</hi> I could have Printed them
as well in Three <hi>Treble</hi> Cliffs, had I thought all had
been so ignorant in the use of our Cliffs as I am
assured you are: It being usual and common for
Men to Sing those Songs which are prick'd in a
<hi>Treble</hi> an Eighth lower, where the Parts are so
Composed, that they do not interfere with the <hi>Bass.</hi>
And if Musick be made difficult (as you say) by the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57311:41"/>
transposition of one of our Cliffs, I shall plainly
demonstrate that you have made it ten times more
difficult and confused, by the frequent transposition
of your Three new invented Cliffs BMT, in
your new whim-wham Circulation of Octaves;
which according to your Hypothesis is thus set
down in your Diagram.</p>
            <figure>
               <figDesc>music</figDesc>
               <p>Bass. Mean. Treble.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>
               <hi>In Page 38 and 39 you give us these following
Rules and Directions,</hi> viz. 1. In any place, where
the Notes rise or fall an Octave (which is
usually the cause of greatest distress in this case) set
the next Note in the same place, only changing the
letter of the Octave, which will direct you to Sing it
an eighth higher or lower; as you may see these three
Notes, which required three different Places, in three
different Cliffs, are here situated all upon the same
Line, only with the letters of their Octaves prefix'd
at first sight, palpably discovering what they stand for.</p>
            <p>By which means the Octave only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the Cliff is
altered, neither is there the lest shadow of the old
confusion; for the <hi>G,</hi> which I instanced in, or any other
Note in this case, will stand in every part in the same
place. And certainly, one that has but very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
skill in Singing, can rise or fall an Octave,
when the prefixed letter shall give him timely warning
of it. 2. If the Notes ascend, or descend by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and you have occasion to go far into anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57311:42"/>
Octave, when you come to an higher G, alter the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Letter, and it falls upon the lowermost Line; the
like discretion also must be used in descending: By
which means, and good fore-cast, no Song can be so
spiteful and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lucky, but may be evidently and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
written in the compass of four Lines, which
is the STATVTE OF OVR HYPOTHESIS,
the lowermost beginning with G, the uppermost ending
with F; and the higher and lower Notes than these,
by the change of the Signal Letter, ought to be lodged
in their own Octaves, to which they do belong.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I hope, Sir, I have proceeded fairly;
and because it shall appear so, I will here, according
to this <hi>Statute of your Hypothesis,</hi> give one or two
Examples of both together, and leave it to Judicious
Judgements to determine where the confusion, or
transposition of Cliffs is most frequent, and which
is most pleasant to the Eye of the Learner.</p>

            <p>Now behold, good Sir, is not this Tune prickt
according to the STATUTE of your <hi>Hypothesis</hi> or
new Method you would impose upon us? I am
sure it is. In our way there is no Transposition of
Cliffs, but in yours, in this short Tune of Twenty
eight Notes, your M T Cliffs are Transpos'd or
Impos'd no less than Eleven times; and are not the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57311:43"/>
Notes cunningly planted for a Beginner to <hi>Sol-Fa?</hi>
Tis so retrograde to our old Rule, that when our
Notes Rise your Notes Fall, and when ours Fall
yours Rise, to the Eye. Had I not heard otherwise,
I should have imagined you had been a <hi>Quaker,</hi> you
so imitate them, who act all by contraries, against
the established Rule both in Church and State; for
because our Three Cliffs, <hi>Bass, Mean,</hi> and <hi>Treble,</hi>
are distinguished by three known Characters out of
the Old Scale, your Three Cliffs must be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<hi>B</hi> for <hi>Bass, M</hi> for <hi>Mean,</hi> and <hi>Tr</hi> for <hi>Treble:</hi>
An excellent Reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to as much purpose,
as he that changed the Name <hi>Kingdom</hi> into <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I cannot find, Sir, in all your new <hi>Essay</hi> any
provision for <hi>Tenors</hi> and <hi>Contratenors;</hi> you never
thought of Cathedral Men, which are the greatest
number of Singers in the Land; sure your design
is, that since you cann't do as the late Reformers did,
sequester them of their Means, you will sequester
them of their Musical Cliffs, <hi>Tenors</hi> and <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenors:</hi>
For this, I remember Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> gave you a
Check in his <hi>Observations,</hi> and wondred you could
be so <hi>uncivil:</hi> to which (in the 49th Page of your
<hi>Vindication</hi>) you answer, <hi>if he still grumbles that
Scholars cann't tell which is a Contratenor, or lower
Mean, or the like, for them that cann't understand
the nature of the thing, let there be writ over them,</hi>
This is a Cock, <hi>and</hi> that is a Bull; <hi>which Itake to
be an easier remedy than to learn all the variety of old
Cliffs.</hi> From whence (according to your method)
I may draw this Inference, That the Gentlemen of
His Majesties Chappel, and all Catherdral Singing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57311:43"/>
are presented by you (for the <hi>Advancement</hi>
of their <hi>Musick</hi> with little better than a Story of
a COCK and a BULL; for which I shall leave
them to give you thanks, and proceed further in the
Vindication of our Cliffs.</p>
            <p>Since all your whole Design, Sir, is to have
Musick confin'd, and kept to the <hi>Statute Rule</hi> of
your <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> which is by three Octaves fix'd
to constant Rules and Spaces, in the compass of
Four Lines, for the Pricking of all Songs; why
did you not give us some Examples thereof in your
Book, but tell us, <hi>That no Song can be so spightful
or unlucky, but it may be evidently and conveniently
written in the compass of Four Lines, by the Rule of
OVR Hypothesis:</hi> Your omission in this case, gave
me occasion in insert for foregoing Tune of a
Psalm; I could have prick'd down many more (but
this may suffice any ingenious person) to have shewed
you the Beauty of the Mistress of your Invention; but
I suppose you perceived by her limping and hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
what was her Distemper, which made you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
her a <hi>Leiger-Line,</hi> and if that would not
perfect the Cure, then to add thereto an <hi>ascititious
Line,</hi> which together would prove an Infallible
Remedy for the Rickettiness of your dearly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
B M T, and no doubt enable her to walk
in the same path and state with the <hi>Old Scale:</hi>
For though in many places you plead hard for the
keeping to the <hi>Statute</hi> of your <hi>Hypothesis, viz.</hi> Four
Lines, as for instance, in pag. 73. your words are
these, <hi>But left any one should still run droaning in his
own way, I shall mind him of OVRS, and tell him
again, W E do not reckon upwards, as it the Lines
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57311:44"/>
were continued together; neither make WE any Cliffs
five Notes asunder, but WE compleat on Octave in
the Systeme of Four Lines, which reaches to Ffaut,
and then begin the Systeme of the next Four Lines in
the Middle Part with G again; as after</hi> Saturday
<hi>night comes</hi> Sunday <hi>morning;</hi> Or to explain your
meaning, 'tis thus; after you have gone up seven
Rounds of the Ladder, you must come down again
to the first to go the eighth: Yet notwithstanding
this, you tell us before in <hi>pag.</hi> 23. of certain Notes
which you call <hi>Pilgrim Notes, that have higher and
lower steps to go, and will not be fix'd in any constant
dwellings</hi> (now for these in your next words are
some Crums of Comfort, for you have provided
them Lodgings let them ramble whether they please)
<hi>but that the following Contrivance shews me it may,
and is here already adcomplished</hi> Welcome Leiger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Line
Handy-Pandy, now, shall we have a Leiger-Line,
or no Leiger Line? you resolve this doubt in
the aforesaid <hi>pag.</hi> 73. when you tell us, <hi>if for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of Pricking, WE allow the Systeme to be
of [Five] or [SIX] Lines, &amp;c.</hi> Rejoice O ye
Musical Notes, here's a Gaol-delivery! you shall
be no longer confin'd in the Prison of a Four-Line
<hi>Hypothesis.</hi> But till this was done, Sir, your
Mrs. <hi>Aurelia,</hi> with her Song of Four Parts, could
not appear; which you tell us, <hi>pag.</hi> 82. Mr. <hi>Theod.
Stefkins</hi> transcribed for you; I wonder, since you
were not capable of doing it yourself, you did not
require the assistance of your <hi>Publisher</hi> in that as
well as in all the rest: In <hi>pag.</hi> 37. where this Song
is fix'd as an Example, that it may be done your
Five-line way, and not in your Four-line way, your
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57311:44"/>
words and these; <hi>But that you may see how unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
those former various Cliffs are, how conveniently
a Song will fall in the Systeme of Five Lines, for
though an Octave is compleated in Four, yet you may
take such a liberty, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, Sir, that you
may see we can present you with this Song in less
various Cliffs than you have done, I have transcribed
it in the same Key you have put it in, that when it is
compared with yours, the World may judge wherein
lies the Advantages your propose.</p>

            <p>I have but one Example more, by which may be
judged now you have got a Leger Line to make Five
as well as we, whether you be not almost come back
into our Old Way of Pricking, as well as you
did before into the use of the Words of our <hi>Gamut.</hi>

            <p>Unisons out of their proper places.</p>
            <p>By this Example I prove your <hi>Universal Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter</hi>
of having <hi>G</hi> always on the First Line to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
whatever pretences and plausible words you
give us to the contrary: for to make the same Note
to be in two places at one time (in the Space in the
<hi>Bass</hi> and on the Rule in the <hi>Mean</hi>) is to sit between
two Stools, whereby the A—of your whole Design
will fall to the ground. If you could have kept to your
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57311:46"/>
first Rule of Four-line Octaves, you had committed
that absurdity but once, and that in your Octave
Note only, but now by your Leiger-Lines you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
it in as many Notes as you please; whereas
on the contrary, you may see dour Unisons of the <hi>Bass</hi>
when they come into the <hi>Mean,</hi> are, if in Space in
space, if on Rule on Rule, and the like 'twixt the
<hi>Mean</hi> and <hi>Treble.</hi> By all which it will appear, that
our <hi>Gamut</hi> is a perfect Rule, and so are our Cliffs in
their use, without any difficulty or confusion, how
ridiculously and ignorantly soever you have rendred
them.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have Vindicated the <hi>Old Scale;</hi> I could
have enlarged much further, but as I turn'd over
both your <hi>Essay</hi> and <hi>Vindication,</hi> I met with so many
impertinent Impossibilities and Contradictions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
about instrumental Musick, so confusedly
jumbled together; and not finding the <hi>Gittar</hi> (the
only School-Instrument) so much as mentioned in all
your Book, and your <hi>Hypothesis</hi> being so pertinent
to it; I had not patience, but threw them aside, as
unworthy the perusal of any Person skill'd in
Musick.</p>
