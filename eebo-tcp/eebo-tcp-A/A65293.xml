            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God first sent him to the Jews at <hi>Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and afterwards enlarged his-commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to preach to the Gentiles.

            <p>That which inclines me to think that Faith is seminally in the heart before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is this, because Repentance being a grace, must be acted by one that is living.

            </p>
            <p>Repentance is a pure Gospel-grace. The covenant of works admitted no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. There it was, <hi>sin and die:</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance comes in by the Gospel. Christ hath purchased in his blood that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinners shall be saved.

            <p>It doth not say, he that obeys not all things, let him <hi>repent,</hi> but, let him be <hi>cursed.</hi> So that Repentance is a Doctrine brought to light only by the Gospel.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Discovering the Deceits of Repentance.</head>
            <p>IT will next be enquired, what Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is. I shall first shew you what it is not. There are several Deceits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which might occasion that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Austin,</hi> That Repentance damns many. He means a false Repentance. A person may delude himself with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Repentance.</p>
            <p>1. The first Deceit of Repentance is<note place="margin">1. Deceit.</note> 
               <hi>legal Terrour.</hi> A man hath gone on long in sin, at last God arrests him, shews him what desperate hazard he hath run, and he is filled with anguish; within a while the tempest of conscience is blown over, and he is quiet; then he concludes he is a true penitent, because he hath felt some bitterness in sin: Be not deceived, this is not Repentance. <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> had some trouble of mind. It is one thing to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106546:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be a terrified sinner, and another thing to be a repenting sinner. Sense of guilt is enough to breed terrour; infusion of grace breeds Repentance. If pain and trouble were sufficient to Repentance, then the damned in Hell should be most penitent, for they are most in anguish. Repentance depends upon a change of heart. There may be terrour, yet no change of heart.</p>
            <p>2. Another Deceit about Repentance,<note place="margin">2 Deceit.</note> is, <hi>resolution against sin.</hi> A person may purpose and make vows, yet be no peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Thou saidst, I will not transgress.</hi> Here was a resolution; but see what follows; <hi>under every green tree, thou playedst the Harlot.</hi> Notwithstanding her solemn engagements, she played fast and loose with God, and ran after her Idols. We see by experience when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is on his sick-bed, what protestations will he make if God recover him again, yet he is as bad as ever: He shews his old heart in a new temptation. Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against sin may arise,</p>
            <p>1. From present extremity; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sin is sinful, but because it is painful. This Resolution will vanish.</p>
            <p>2. Resolution against sin may arise
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106546:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from fear of future evil; an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of death and Hell, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>I looked, and behold a pale horse,</hi>

               <hi>and his name that sate on him was death, and Hell followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him?</hi> What will not a sinner do? what vows will he not make, when he knows he must die and stand before the Judgement seat? Self-love raiseth a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vow, and love of sin will prevail against it. Trust not to a passionate reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, it is raised in a storm, and will die in a calm.</p>
            <p>3. The third Deceit about Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">3 Deceit.</note> is, <hi>the leaving many sinful courses.</hi> 'Tis a great matter I confess to leave sin: So dear is sin to a man, that he will rather part with a child than a lust, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Shall I give the fruit of my body, for the sin of my soul</hi>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>flagitant?</note>? But sin may be parted with, yet no Repentance.</p>
            <p>1. A man may part with some sins, and keep other. As <hi>Herod</hi> reformed many things amiss, but could not leave his incest.</p>
            <p>2. An old sin may be left to entertain a new <note n="*" place="margin">Serpens quotannis exuvias deponit. <hi>Causin. Hierogl.</hi>
               </note>. As you put off an old servant
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106546:10"/>
to take another. This is to exchange a sin. Sin may be exchanged, and the heart not changed. He who was a Prodigal in his youth, turns an Usurer in his old age. A slave is sold to a Jew, the Jew sells him to a Turk; here is the Master changed, but he is a slave still. So a man removes from one vice to another, but he is a sinner still.</p>
            <p>3. A sin may be left not so much from strength of grace, as from moral grounds. A man sees that though such a sin be for his <hi>Tooth,</hi> yet it is not for his <hi>interest:</hi> It will ecclipse his credit, prejudice his health, impair his estate; therefore upon prudential reasons he gives it a dismiss.</p>
            <p>The true leaving of sin, is, when the acts of sin cease from the infusion of a principle of grace: As the air ceaseth to be dark from the infusion of light.</p>

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. The true mourner weeps for the stirrings of pride and concupiscence; he grieves for <hi>the root of bitterness,</hi> though it never blossoms into act. A wicked man may be troubled for scandalous sins; a real convert laments heart-sins.</p>
               <p>2. Godly sorrow is <hi>ingenuous;</hi> it is<note place="margin">2.</note> more for the offence than the punishment. Gods Law is infringed, his love abused; this melts the soul in tears. A man may be sorry, yet not repent: As a thief is sorry when he is taken, not because he stole, but because he comes under the penalty. Hypocrites grieve only for the bitter consequence of sin. I have read of a fountain that never sends forth streams but the evening before a famine: So their eyes never pour out tears, but when Gods Judgements are approaching. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was more troubled for the froggs and River of blood, than for his sin. But godly sorrow is chiefly for the trespass against God; so that if there were no conscience to smite, no Devil to accuse, no Hell to punish, yet the soul would be grieved because of the prejudice done to God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 4. <hi>My sin is ever before me. David</hi> doth not say, the sword threatned is ever before me, but, <hi>my sin.</hi>

Oh that I should offend so good a God, that I should grieve my Comforter; this breaks my heart!</p>
               <p>Godly sorrow shews it self to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, because when a Christian knows he is out of the Gun-shot of hell, and shall never be damned; yet still he grieves for sinning against that free-grace which hath pardoned him.</p>
               <p>3. Godly sorrow is <hi>fiducial;</hi> it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed<note place="margin">3.</note> with faith, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>The Father of the child cryed out, and said with tears; Lord I believe.</hi> Here was sorrow for sin checkered with faith; as we have seen a bright Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow appear in a watry cloud.</p>

               <p>3. Sorrow for sin should be so great as to swallow up all other sorrow. As when

the pain of the Stone and Gout meet, the pain of the Stone swallows up the pain of the Gout.</p>
               <p>4. We are to find as much bitterness in weeping for sin, as ever we found sweetness in committing it. Sure <hi>David</hi> found more bitterness in Repentance, than ever he found comfort in <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Our sorrow for sin must be such as makes us willing to let go those sins which brought in the greatest income of profit or delight. Then the Physick hath been strong enough, when it hath purged out the disease: And then a Christian hath arrived at a sufficient measure of sorrow, when the love of sin is purged out.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106546:17"/>
Such are 1. The <hi>Papists,</hi> who leave out the very soul of Repentance; making all penitential work consist in fasting, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, pilgrimages; but there is nothing of spiritual sorrow in this; they torture their bodies, but their hearts are not rent. What is this but the carkass of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Carnal Protestants,</hi> who are strangers to godly sorrow; they cannot endure a serious thought, nor do they love to trouble their heads about sin. <hi>Paracelsus</hi> speaks of a Phrensie some have, which will make them die dancing. So sinners spend their lives in mirth; they sing away sorrow, and go dancing to damnation. Some have lived many years, yet never put a drop in Gods bottle, nor do they know what a broken heart means: they weep and wring their hands, as if they were undone, when their estates are gone, but have no agony of soul for sin.</p>
               <p>There is a twofold sorrow; 1. A <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> sorrow, which is an act of the soul, whereby it hath a displacency against sin, and chuseth any torture rather than to admit of sin. 2. There is a <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> sorrow, which is expressed by plenty of tears. The first of these is to be found
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106546:18"/>
in every child of God; but the other, which is a sorrow running out at the eye, all have not: yet it is very commendable to see a weeping penitent. Christ counts those the great beauties which are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-eyed; and well may sin make us weep. We usually weep for the loss of some great good: By sin we have lost the favour of God. If <hi>Micah</hi> did so weep for the loss of a false God, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>Ye have taken away my gods, and what have I more?</hi> Then well may we weep for our sins, which have taken away the true God from us.</p>

               <p>3. Confession must be sincere: our<note place="margin">3.</note> hearts must go along with our confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

As it is with a wounded man, he comes to the Chyrurgion, and shews him all his wounds; here I was cut in the head, there I was shot in the arm: So a mournful sinner confesseth the several distempers of his soul. <hi>Israel</hi> drew up a particular charge against themselves, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>Wee have served Baalim.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> recites the very sin which drew a curse along with it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9, 6. <hi>Neither have we hearkned unto thy servants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which spake in thy Name.</hi> By a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent inspection into our hearts we may find some particular sin indulged, point that sin with a tear.</p>

               <p>8. We must confess our sins with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution<note place="margin">8.</note> not to act them over again.

they are most guilty of; as rash anger, extortion, uncleanness. Like him in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who complained his stomach was not very good, when his lungs were bad, and his liver rotten. But if we do not confess all, how do we think God will pardon all?

               <p>It reproves them who do in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions<note place="margin">3 Branch.</note> mince and extenuate their sins. A gracious soul labours to make the worst of his sins, hypocrites make the best of them; they do not deny they are sinners, but yet do what they can to lessen their sins; they indeed offend sometimes, but it is their nature, and it is long of such occasions. These are rather <hi>excuses</hi> than <hi>confessions,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 24. <hi>I have sinned, I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, because I feared the people.

a spiritual ground. A man may restrain the acts of sin, yet not turn from sin in a right manner. Acts of sin may be restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of fear, or design; but a right penitentiary turns from sin out of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious principle, and that is, <hi>love to God.</hi> If sin did not bear such bitter fruit, if death did not grow on this tree, yet a gracious soul would forsake it out of love to God: This is the most kindly turning from sin. When things are frozen and congealed, the best way to separate them is by fire: When men and their sins are congealed together, the best way to separate them, is the fire of love. Three asking one another what made them leave sin; saith one, I think of the joys of Heaven; saith another, I think of the torments of Hell; but saith the third, I think of the love of God, and that makes me forsake it? How shall I offend the God of love?</p>

God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted a Law in the High Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that no sinner shall be saved but the repenting sinner; and he will not break his own Law. Though all the Angels should stand before God, and beg the life of an irrepenting person, God would not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106546:42"/>
grant it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>The Lord God, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious, keeping mercy for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and that will by no means clear the guilty.</hi> Though God is more full of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than the Sun is of light, yet he will not forgive a sinner while he goes on in his guilt: <hi>He will by no means clear the guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The pure nature of God denies<note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> communion with an impenitent creature.

            <p>3. Sinners continuing in impenitency,<note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> are out of Christs commission: See his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106546:43"/>

            <p>4. There is a great deal of equity in<note place="margin">Reason 4.</note> it, that we should repent. We have by sin wronged God; we have ecclipsed his honour; we have infringed his Law, and good reason we should make him some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. By Repentance we humble and judge our selves for sin; we set to our seal that God is righteous if he should destroy us: and thus we give glory to God, and do what in us lyes to repair his honour.</p>
            <p>5. If God should save men without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,<note place="margin">5.</note> making no discrimination, then by this Rule he must save all; not only men, but Devils, as <hi>Origen</hi> once held; and so consequently the decrees of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Reprobation must fall to the

O that it might be encompassed with a third Ocean, namely, repenting tears. If the Book of the Law chance to fall upon the ground, the Jews have a custom presently to proclaim a Fast. <hi>England</hi> hath let both Law and Gospel fall to the ground, therefore had need fast and mourn before the Lord: The <hi>Ephah</hi> of wickedness seems to be full, Good reason tears should empty apace, when sin fills so fast: Why then do not all faces gather paleness? Why are the Wells of Repentance stopped? Do not the sinners of the Land know they should repent? Have they had no warning? Have not Gods faithful Messengers <hi>lifted up their voice as a trumpet,</hi> and cryed to them to repent? but many of these Tools in the Ministry have been spent and worn out upon rocky hearts. Hath not God lighted strange <hi>Comets</hi> in the Heavens, as so many Preachers to call men to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but still they are <hi>settled on their lees, Zeph.</hi> 1. 12. Do we think God will alwaies put up our affronts? Will he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure thus to have his name and glory trampled upon?

God may a while reprieve this Land by <hi>Frerogative,</hi> but if ever he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> save it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance, he must go out of his ordinary Road: I say therefore with Mr. <hi>Bradford, REPENT O ENGLAND.</hi> Thou hast beleaper'd thy self with sin, and hadst need go and wash in the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Iordan.</hi> Thou hast kindled Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against thee, throw away thy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and bring thy holy Engines and Water-works, that God may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased in the blood of Christ. Let thy tears run, lest Gods roll of curses fly <note n="*" place="margin">Zach. 5. 2.</note>. Either men must turn, or God will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: Either the fallow ground of their hearts must be broken up, or the Land broken down. If no words will prevail with sinners, it is because God hath a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to slay them <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 25.</note>. Among the <hi>Romans,</hi> he who was for his capital offence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the use of water, was thereby concluded to be a condemned person.

There are some who get more by breaking, than others can by trading: these are like beggars that discolour and blister their arms, that they may move charity; they live by their sores: So these live by their breaking.

               </note> need <hi>no Repentance, Luke</hi> 15. 7. Their civility un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does them; they make a Christ of it, and so on this shelf suffer shipwrack. Morality shoots short of Heaven; it is only nature refined. A moral man is but <hi>old Adam</hi> dressed in fine cloths. The Kings Image counterfeited and stamped upon Brass, will not go currant. The civil person seems to have the Image of God, but he is but <hi>brass metal,</hi> which will never pass for currant: Civility is insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to salvation: though the life be moralized, the lust may be unmortified. The heart may be full of pride and Atheism. Under the fair leaves of a tree there may be a worm. I say not, repent that you are civil, but that you are no more than civil. The house that was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>swept and garnished,</hi> Satan entred into,

               <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 26. This was the emblem of a moral man, who is <hi>swept</hi> by civility, and <hi>garnished</hi> with common gifts, but is not washed by true Repentance; the unclean spirit enters into such an one. If civility were sufficient to salvation, Christ needed not to have died. The Civilian hath a fair Lamp, but it wants the oyl of grace.</p>

Indeed, if prayer doth not make a man leave sin, sin will make him leave prayer. The Hypocrite feigns humility, but it is that he may rise in the world; he is a pretender to faith, but he makes use of it rather for a <hi>cloak,</hi> than a <hi>shield;</hi> he carries his Bible under his arm, but not in his heart; his whole Religion is a demure lye, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11. 12.</p>

            <p>Let me speak my mind freely, none will find it more difficult to repent than Hypocrites; they have so jugled in Religion,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106546:50"/>
that their treacherous hearts know not how to repent. Hypocrisie is harder to cure than Phrensie <note n="*" place="margin">Difficilius curatur quàm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sania.</note>.

Oh how dismal is the case of this man, he is in Hell before his time! but you who repent betimes of your sinful courses, this is your privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, you will have the less to answer for; nay, let me tell you, you will have

            <p>1. How dost thou know thou shalt have a time of sickness? Death doth not alwaies shoot its warning-piece by a lingring consumption; some it arrests suddenly. What if God should present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly send thee a summons to surrender thy life!</p>
            <p>2. Suppose thou shouldest have a time of sickness, how dost thou know thou shalt have the use of thy senses? Many are distracted on their sick-bed.</p>
            <p>3. Suppose thou shouldest have thy senses, yet how dost thou know thy mind will be in frame for such a work as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? Sickness doth so discompose body and mind, that one is but in an ill posture at such a time to take care for his soul. In sickness a man is scarce fit to make his <hi>will,</hi> much less to make his peace. The Apostle saith, <hi>Is any sick among you, let him call for the Elders of the Church, Iam.</hi> 5. 14. He doth not say, is he sick, <hi>let him pray;</hi> but <hi>let him call for</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:106546:68"/>
               <hi>the Elders that they may pray over him.</hi> A sick man is very unfit to pray, or repent; he is like to make but sick work of it. When the body is out of tune, the soul must needs jar in its devotion. Upon a sick bed a person is more fit to exercise <hi>impatience,</hi> than <hi>Repentance.</hi> We read, that at the pouring out of the fourth Vial, when God did smite the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and scorched them with fire; <hi>They blasphemed the Name of God, and repented not, Rev.</hi> 16. 9. So when the Lord pours out his <hi>Vial,</hi> and scorcheth the body with a Feaver, the sinner is fitter to blaspheme than repent.</p>
            <p>4. How dost thou who puttest off all to a sick bed, know, that God will give thee in that very juncture of time grace to repent? The Lord usually punisheth neglect of Repentance in time of health, with hardness of heart in time of sickness <note n="*" place="margin">Multos peccati Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus ita con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>A.</hi> Though Repentance must be alwaies<note place="margin">Answ.</note> kept alive in the soul, yet there are two special times wherein we must renew our Repentance in an extraordinary manner.</p>
            <p>1. Before the receiving of the Lords<note place="margin">1.</note> Supper. This spiritual <hi>Passeover</hi> is to be eaten with <hi>bitter herbs.</hi> Now our eyes should be fresh broached with tears, and the stream of sorrow overflow. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting frame is a sacramental frame. A broken heart, and a broken Christ, do well agree. The more bitterness we taste in sin, the more sweetness we shall taste in Christ. When <hi>Iacob</hi> wept, he found God; <hi>And he called the name of the place Peniel, for I have seen God face to face, Gen.</hi> 32, 30. The way to find Christ comfortably in the Sacrament, is to go weeping thither. Christ will say to an humble penitent, as to <hi>Thomas, Reach</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:106546:74"/>

We should repent <hi>now,</hi> that we repented no sooner: that the garrisons of our hearts, held out so long against God, ere they were levelled by Repentance. We should repent <hi>now,</hi> that we have loved Christ no more; that we have fetched no more vertue from him, and brought no more glory to him. It should be our grief on our death-bed, that our lives have had so many <hi>blanks</hi> and <hi>blots</hi> in them; that our duties have been so fly-blown with sin; that our obedience hath been so imperfect, and we have gone so lame in the waies of God.

            <head>
               <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The removing the Impediments of Repentance.</head>
            <p>BEfore I lay down the Expedients and Means conducing to Repentance, I shall first remove the Impediments. In this great City, when you want water, you search the cause, whether the Pipes are broken or stopped, that the current of water is hindered: So when no water of Repentance comes (though we have the Conduit-pipes of Ordinances) see what the cause is; where is the stop that these penitential waters do not run. There are ten Impediments of Repentance.</p>
            <p>1. Men do not apprehend that they<note place="margin">1 Imped.</note> need Repentance; they thank God all is well with them, and they know nothing they should repent of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Thou sayest, I am rich, and have need of nothing.</hi> He who apprehends not any distemper in his body, will not take the Physick prescribed. This is the mischief sin hath done; it hath not only made us <hi>sick,</hi> but <hi>senseless.</hi> When the Lord bade the people
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106546:75"/>
               <hi>return to him</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Revertimini ad me per resipiscentiam, &amp; revertar ad vos per be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficentiam.</note>, they answered stubbornly, <hi>Wherein should we return? Mal.</hi> 3. 7. So when God bids men repent, they say, wherefore should they repent? they know nothing they have done amiss. Surely no disease worse than that which is Apoplectical.</p>
            <p>2. People conceit it an easie thing to<note place="margin">2 Imped.</note> repent: It is but saying a few prayers; a sigh, or a Lord have mercy, and the work is done. This conceit of the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Repentance, is a great hinderance to it. That which makes a person bold, and adventrous in sin, must needs obstruct Repentance; but this opinion doth make a person bold in sin. The Angler can let out his line as far as he will, and then pull it in again: So when a man thinks he can lash out in sin as far as he will, and then pull in by Repentance when he list, this must needs imbolden him in wickedness. But to take away this false conceit of the easiness of Repentance, consider, 1. A wicked man hath a mountain of guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and is it easie to rise up under such a weight? Is salvation <hi>per saltum?</hi> Can a man jump out of sin into Heaven? Can he leap out of the Devils arms into
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106546:75"/>
               <hi>Abrahams bosom?</hi> 2. If all the power in a sinner be employed against Repentance, then it is not easie. All the faculties of a natural man joyn issue with sin, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</hi> A sinner will rather lose Christ and Heaven, than his lusts: death, which parts man and wife, will not part a wicked man and his sins; and is it so easie to repent? The Angel rolled away the stone from the Sepulchre; but no Angel, only God himself can roll away the stone from the the heart.<note place="margin">3 Imped.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Presuming thoughts of Gods mercy. Many suck poison from this sweet flower. Christ who came into the world to save sinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. is accidentally the occasion of many a mans perishing. Though to the Elect he is <hi>the bread of life,</hi> yet to the wicked he is <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> his blood is sweet wine, to others the <hi>water of Marah.</hi> Some are softned by this <hi>Sun of Righteousness,</hi> others are hardned. Oh saith one, Christ hath died, he hath done all for me, therefore I may sit still and do nothing. Thus they suck death from the Tree of Life, and perish by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. So I may say of Gods mercy, it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106546:76"/>
is accidentally the cause of many a ones ruine: Because of mercy men presume, and think they may go on in sin: But, should a Kings clemency make his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects rebel? The Psalmist saith, there is mercy with God, <hi>that he may be feared, Psal.</hi> 130. 4. but not that we may sin. Can men expect mercy by provoking ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice? God will hardly shew them mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, who sin because mercy abounds.<note place="margin">4 Imped.</note>
            </p>
            <p>4. A supine sluggish temper. Repentance is looked upon as a tedious thing, and such as requires much industry, and men are <hi>settled upon their lees,</hi> and care not to stir: They had rather go sleeping to Hell, than weeping to Heaven, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 24. <hi>A slothful man hideth his hands in his bosom;</hi> he will not be at the labour of <hi>smiting on his breast</hi>

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Chrysost.</note>. Many will rather lose Heaven, than ply the oar, and row thither upon the waters of Repentance. We cannot have the world <hi>citra pulverem,</hi> without labour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and would we have that which is more excellent <note n="*" place="margin">Ut rosa de spinis nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur, sic de tristibus, &amp; asperis fructus capitur jucundissimus. <hi>Erasm.</hi>
               </note>? Sloth is the canker of the soul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 15. <hi>Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep.</hi> It was a witty fiction of the Poets, when <hi>Mercury</hi> had cast <hi>Argus</hi> into
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106546:76"/>
a sleep, and with an inchanted Rod closed his eyes, then he killed him. When Satan hath by his witcheries lull'd men asleep in sloth, then he destroyes them. Some report, while the Crocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dil sleeps with his mouth open, the Indian Rat gets into his belly, and eats up his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails: So while men sleep in security, they are devoured.</p>
            <p>5. Another obstruction of Repentance<note place="margin">5 Imped.</note> is the tickling pleasure of sin, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Who take pleasure in unrighteousness.</hi> Sin is a sugred draught, but mixed with poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The sinner thinks there is <hi>danger</hi> in sin, but there is <hi>delight,</hi> and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger doth not so terrifie him, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light bewitcheth him. <hi>Plato</hi> calls love of sin, <hi>a great Devil</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Magnus Daemon.</note>. Delighting in sin hardens the heart. In true Repentance there must be a grieving for sin; but how can one grieve for that which he loves. He who delights in sin can hardly pray against it; his heart is so inveagled with sin, that he is afraid of leaving it too soon. <hi>Sampson</hi> doted on <hi>Dalilahs</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and her lap proved his grave.

Ignorance is the womb of lust. Vapours arise most in the night: The black vapours of sin arise most in a dark ignorant soul.

Is sin ignorance? there's great cause to repent of ignorance.</p>
            <p>5. Sin is a piece of desperateness. In every<note place="margin">5.</note> transgression, a man runs an apparent hazard of his soul; he treads upon the brink of the <hi>bottomless pit.</hi> Foolish sinner, thou never committest a sin, but thou dost that which may undo thy soul for ever <note n="*" place="margin">Quae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When shall we dissolve into tears if not now? Gods judgements are so proper a means to work Repentance, that the Lord won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at it, and makes it his complaint, that his severity did not break men off from their sins, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 7. <hi>I have with-holden the Rain from you,</hi> vers. 9. <hi>I have smitten you with blasting and mildew,</hi> vers. 10. <hi>I have sent among you the Pestilence;</hi> but still this is the burden of the complaint, <hi>Yet ye have not returned to me.</hi> The Lord proceeds <hi>gradually</hi> in his judgements: First he sends a lesser cross, and if that will not do, then a greater. He sends upon one first a gentle fit of an Ague, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a burning Feaver. He sends upon another first a loss at Sea, then the loss of a child, then an husband.

How sad was it with the Prodigal before he returned to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! he had spent all; he had sinned himself into beggary, and he had nothing left but a few husks; he was fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoner with the Swine; but when he came home to his Father, then nothing was thought too good for him.

Yes, Faith breeds union with Christ, and there can be no separation from sin, till there be union with Christ. The eye of Faith looks on mercy, and that thaws the heart.
