            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O give you a more exact account of this ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter and death of Mr. <hi>Wolley;</hi> I hold it proper to impart to you the firſt riſe of their unhappy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; Mr. <hi>Wolley</hi> mounted on a ſprightly Maire (about a quarter of a year before the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) paſſed in the ſtreets at <hi>London,</hi> and riding in the <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> the Earle ſeeing and liking the Maire, diſpatcht a Foot-man to him, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Maire was to be ſold, or not; Mr. <hi>Wolley</hi> anſwered ſhe was if he might have his price, hereupon a ſecond meſſage was ſent to him to ſpeak with the Earle, which direction preſently obſerved, the Earle and he agreed of a price, eighteen pieces in gold, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the Earle was owner of the Maire, and the Gentleman of the money. And having acquainted the Earle in the preſence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Windam</hi> his friend (now of the Middle Temple) that the Maire, before he had her, was Major <hi>Salkills,</hi> who liveth in St. <hi>Martins-Lane;</hi> and that ſhe was a gift beſtowed on him; relating likewiſe that he reſided ſometimes at the Middle Temple, and ſometimes with his father at <hi>Hammer-ſmith,</hi> Whither he was then returning; his Lordſhip tendred Maſter <hi>Wolley</hi> his Coach to carry him thither, which civility refuſed, they then parted, from which time being about three moenths Maſter <hi>Wolley</hi> never ſaw the Earle, nor received a line or word from him, untill accidentally paſſing in the ſtreet on <hi>Saturday</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61605:2"/>
laſt, the Earle being in his Coach, ſeeing Maſter <hi>Wolley,</hi> called him to him, telling him that his Maire proved not according to his word, and therefore he required him to retake the Maire, and refund the money. To which Maſter <hi>Wolley</hi> replied, that he looked on that command of his Lordſhip, as neither reaſonable nor juſt, for that he never made him any ſuch promiſe, and therefore deſired his pardon, for he would not obey it in that particular. To which the Earle ſpeedily added that he ſhould expect then to hear further from him; ſo they parted at that time.</p>
            <p>It ſeems from theſe ſparks a greater fire was quickly kindled: on <hi>Monday</hi> morning following the Earle did haſten to <hi>Hammerſmith,</hi> where lighting at the Goat he diſpatched Maſter <hi>Philip Howard,</hi> ſon to the Earle of <hi>Berk-ſhire,</hi> to enquire for Maſter <hi>Wolley</hi> at his fathers houſe, meeting preſently with him, he deſired him to walk up to the Inne where the Earle of <hi>Chesterfield</hi> ſtayed, to which motion Maſter <hi>Wolley</hi> aſſented and went; but what paſſed betwixt the Earle and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Wolley</hi> is not yet diſcovered, his Lordſhip or Maſter <hi>Howard</hi> beſt know. After half an houre, or thereabouts, Maſter <hi>Wolley</hi> returning to his Fathers Houſe, and being demanded what was the reſult and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion with his Lordſhip; told his father that he was preſſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his Maire, but he reſolved the contrary; and ſaid that the Earl and he parted friendly; after dinner on <hi>Monday</hi> Maſter <hi>Wolley</hi> rode abroad, and pretended to viſit a Gentleman who lived not far from <hi>Fulham,</hi> and returned not till it began to grow dark, diſcovering no diſtemper either by his carriage or language: And in this compoſure having after Supper craved his parents bleſſing, he retyred to his Chamber, and ſo to Bed; the next morning being <hi>Tueſday,</hi> he roſe very early, and privately without noiſe got out of his Chamber, walking, as he was wont, towards the Stable (for ſo the Cook-maid obſerved him in his Gown) where he found his Groome. In the mean time his father having no ſuſpition of his ſons death and danger ſo neere, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his repoſe in his bed, untill in the revolution of ſome ſecond thoughts he knockt and call'd for his ſervant to come up, and directed her to wiſh his ſonne to come to his father; who when ſhe returned told her that Mr. <hi>Wolley</hi> was not to be found, then ſhe was deſired to enquire for his Groome, and ſhe returned with a ſecond anſwer that ſhe could not meet with him. The afflicted parents, in their bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd with theſe confuſed circumſtances roſe ſpeedily, and in their ſo divided and diſtracted thoughts knew not where to ſeek and ſearch for their ſonne; yet in their amaze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nts and affrights his father intreated a civil perſon who lodged in the houſe, and ſome neighbours to walk abroad and enquire after him; but no news was brought to the Doctor of his ſonne, until it was diſpatcht to him by a meſſenger ſent from Mr. <hi>Colebies</hi> of <hi>Kenſington,</hi> who told him, oh Sir your ſonne is ſlaine, and lies dead in a field below Mr. <hi>Colebies</hi> houſe, which ſadneſſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61605:2"/>
proved too true. The Corps gored with blood fallen on the ground had received two wounds; the one on the left hand, which tore and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the nerves and ſinews: The other paſſed quite thorough the body, making the orifice neer the right Pap, &amp; came forth on his back under the plate of his left ſhoulder. Having now as neer as I can related the occaſion and manner of his death, I ſhall impart to you what I obſerved at his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, which were honoured by many Templars and Perſons of quality as well as others, who with wet eyes, teſtified the dolour and ſadneſſe of their hearts for the Gentlemans violent and untimely death: but that which I conceived moſt obſervable was an elegant Oration of the preacher; <note place="margin">Mr. Fowler</note> who commended the Gentleman to the grave with a large Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and a Catalogue of many worthy vertues, which were eminent in him when he was alive; and therefore more happily now honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at his death: amongſt other graces and qualities he highly commended him for Piety towards God, Charity to the poore, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, Chaſtity, Temperance and Sobriety: and it was a ſincere note of his devotion; That in this Re'ncounter the Common-prayer Book was found in his pocket when he was dead, as his only beſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the laſt gaſp. The preacher gave him another encomium before he ſuffered the duſt to cover the Corps; That his lips were never accuſtomed or polluted with Lies, nor blaſphemous and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Oathes. And as for obedience to his parents; That he was an unparalell'd Example, and truely as he had ſome advantages by his four years travel abroad, ſo for his ſix yeares Reſidence in the Temple he was obſerved to be as civil and hopeful a Student as the choiceſt in that Society.</p>
