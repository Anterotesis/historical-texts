            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen in the Scale of Conscience
rightly informed, I weigh the
words of the <hi>Protestation,</hi> and
of this Exhortation of the Holy
GHOST together, I cannot but
tremble, when I see what small
account most men doe make of so
solemne a Vow, as they so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
take upon them in the said PROTESTATION.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93203:3"/>
For when Ministers and People have taken the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,</hi>
and have solemnly vowed to maintaine the
Doctrine of our Church, so far as it is opposite to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;
Doe they withall presently set upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of this their <hi>Vow?</hi> Doe they not further deferre
to pay it? Surely if they doe deferre it, the holy Ghost
cals them <hi>fooles,</hi> in whom God hath <hi>no pleasure.</hi> And
it had beene better for them never to haye <hi>vowed,</hi> then
to <hi>vow</hi> and not pay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But how doe they deferre to pay their <hi>Vow</hi>
thus made?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In that they doe not presently renounce, and
protest against all Popery, and for ever disclaime and
abandon all Communion with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Why, will they say, what Communion have
we Protestants with Popery? We do all renounce it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In words we doe renounce it, but indeed wee
retaine it, and have close Communion with it: so farre
are we from keeping the <hi>Vow</hi> thus made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But what Popery doe wee Protestants of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> retaine with us, or hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Wee hold Communion with Popery, so long
as wee doe publikely retaine and maintaine any of the
Doctrines of Popery. And the Doctrines of Popery
which wee retaine and maintaine, are these. First, The
imposition of the Liturgie. Secondly, The Discipline.
Thirdly, The Government. Fourthly, The Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But these being as yet established by Law, wee
may not cast them off, till the Law which set them up,
be abrogated, which must be by Act of <hi>Parliament.</hi> And
we protest against Popery to cast it out, as farre as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
we may, and no otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93203:3"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, All Lawes are to be interpreted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their cleare intention and end. Now the Law
for Reformation never intended to allow or set up Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
in this Church of <hi>England.</hi> Secondly, If any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Lawes be found to be contrary to Gods Word,
they are invalid and void <hi>ipso facto.</hi> And it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
that imposition of a devised Liturgie, humane
Rites and Ceremonies, Praelaticall government and
Discipline, are directly contrary to Gods word. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Having once made this solemne <hi>Protestation</hi> and <hi>vow,</hi>
against all Popery, and finding that the particulars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
are branches of Popery, wee are bound <hi>ipso
facto</hi> forthwith to have no more <hi>Communion</hi> with them,
but utterly to renounce them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But what if the <hi>Parliament</hi> did not intend or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by Popery, the foresaid things, as the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
Discipline, Government, Ceremonies used in our
Church, and by Law established? Shall we presume to
extend the sense of the <hi>Protestation</hi> further then the
first makers thereof intended. And the Prelates (wee
presume) would never so readily have subscribed to the
<hi>Protestation,</hi> had they dreamed any such sense to lye hid
under the name of Popery, as their Hierarchy, with
their Liturgie, Rites, Ceremonies, Discipline, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for then they had in the <hi>Protestation</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
against all these, and should have given their
hands and votes, for the rooting of them out of this
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, This we are sure of, and 'tis most cleare
by the expresse words of the <hi>Protestation,</hi> that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it against all Popery. Secondly, They expresse
themselves and professe thus farre, that the words of the
<hi>Protestation</hi> are not to be extended to the maintaining of
<pb facs="tcp:93203:4"/>
any forme of Worship, Discipline, or Government;
nor of any Rites or Ceremonies in the said Church of
<hi>England. Ergo,</hi> wee doe not, we may not protest for the
maintenance of these. Thirdly, suppose that at the first
making of the <hi>Protestation</hi> in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
afore-mentioned were not reckoned in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of all Popery: yet no good Christian will or
can deny, that the Honourable House of Commons did
not at all intend to exclude what ever should be found
to pertaine to <hi>Popery</hi> as a branch thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may boldly conclude, that if the forementioned
things shall be found to be, and that no small branches
of Popery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Protestation</hi> hath an edge to cut them off
all at one stroke. Fourthly, we are all in an erected hope
of such a Reformation intended by this most noble <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
as cannot justly challenge the name of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
unlesse all Popery be made to be packing, which
of necessity must carry with her all trinkets and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
with all her pompous equipage, among whose
sumpters, the Hierarchy, with all its <hi>Pontificalibus</hi> of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
Ceremonies, Discipline, Traine, Courts may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to goe in the formost ranke. Fiftly, and lastly,
suppose it could be supposed by any rationall man, that
the House of Commons could have no such thought as
implicitely to include the aforesaid particulars in the
fardell of Popery: or that they could possibly intend
the maintaining of those things still, of which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
say, <hi>That the words of the</hi> Protestation <hi>are not to
bee extended to the maintaining of any Forme of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
Discipline, or Governement, Rites or Ceremonies;</hi>
or that these things should not be removed but maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
still: What then? Shall private and particular
Christians, knowing these things to be Popery and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian,
<pb facs="tcp:93203:4"/>
being also bound by their solemne <hi>Vow</hi> and
<hi>Protestation,</hi> never reforme themselves, untill they see a
generall Reformation over the whole Land? What
if they shall never live to see this? Will they against
their Conscience, against their knowledge, against their
<hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>Protestation,</hi> live and die Votaries and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants
in that Service, Schoole-boyes and Punies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Ferula</hi> of that Discipline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vassals under that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
Conformists to those Rites and Ceremonies,
all which are very Popery and Popish Innovations?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But how doth it appeare, that the fore-mentioned
particulars are branches of Popery? If our Conscience
could be convinced hereof by the Word of God, then
surely are we bound both by Gods Word, and by our
<hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>Protestation</hi> presently to renounce and abandon
these things, and to have no longer any Communion
with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is most true, that nothing can resolve, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
and settle the Conscience, but the Word of God
in the evidence of it. Now most cleare it is by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the Liturgie, Discipline, Government, Rites
and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are all of
them so many branches of Popery. For proofe hereof:
first for the Liturgie; this is a branch of Popery in two
generall respects: First, in regard of the whole frame
and matter of it, as being translated out of the Romish
Latin Liturgie, as is confessed in the Booke of Martyrs;
see for this the late Parallel between the English Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
and the Masse-booke. I omit to say any thing heere
of the many vitious particulars throughout the Service-booke,
which run as the corrupt blood through all the
veines of it, and are by others sufficiently discovered.
This is enough to shew it to be Popish. The second ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb facs="tcp:93203:5"/>
is, the imposition of it upon all mens Consciences.
Which bare imposition alone, were the Liturgie in it
selfe never so free from other faults, yet being a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of mens devising, the imposition (I say) makes it a
branch of Popery. For Popery (wee know) is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianisme.
And Antichristianisme is an opposition
to Christ, so as this imposition upon the Conscience is
an opposing and overthrowing of Christs Kingly Office,
who is the sole King and Lord over the Soule and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
an office incommunicable to any Creature, or
Power in Heaven or Earth. Whereupon <hi>John</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Who is a lyar, but he that denyeth that Iesus is the Christ, He
is Antechrist.</hi> Now to deny <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the sole annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
King of his Church, is to deny him to be <hi>the Christ.</hi>
And he that sets up man as Lord over the Conscience,
in prescribing and imposing what Service of God hee
pleaseth of humane invention, denyeth Iesus to bee the
Christ, to wit, to be the sole King of his Church, who
is the sole Law-giver to the Common-wealth of Israel,
in his spirituall Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And for this cause the Pope is proved to be that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
who is<note n="*" place="margin">

God sitteth</hi> in or over <hi>the Temple of God</hi> (which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
mans conscience) <hi>shewing himselfe that he is</hi> GOD.
Now in nothing doth Antichrist exalt himselfe more,
then in usurping Christs power in giving Lawes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee exerciseth a Tyranny over the true Temple of
God, over the spirituall Kingdome of Christ. And this
tyranny is cheifly exercised in usurping dominion over
our Faith and Conscience in the worship and service of
God, which they place in the Liturgie. This is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pride and presumption of Antichrist that possibly

can be. This is that <hi>Wil-worship,</hi> or a worship invented

For in nothing (I say) doe they differ, so as Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb facs="tcp:93203:6"/>
of our Church being false, and counterfeit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Popish; and so our Church wanting the true Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
which ought to be one of the three markes of a
vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ble true Church, as it is noted in our Homilies: the
Church of <hi>England</hi> wants this marke at the least. And if
the <hi>Sacraments</hi> be not <hi>duty administred,</hi> as being mixed
and corrupted with a service of mans devising, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
pell mell (as in the Lords Super) to ignorant and
profane persons: then for ought I see, it wants a second
marke of a visible true Church. And if (as lately, and
still in many places) the word of God in the preaching
of it be generally corrupted, as when the full, and free
liberty of it in sundry points of Evangelicall truth, is
restrained and prohibited by orders and edicts, not yet
called in, and damned; by this reckoning it should want
the third marke, &amp; so much the more, in case the calling
of the Ministery it selfe should prove a peice of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
too. But this by the way onely it leads us the way to
the next point, which is the Government of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly then, for the Goverment of the Church of
England, by Archbishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons,
D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anes, Commissaries, Officials, and the rest of that fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity:
if this be not Popery, yea and a top-branch of
it, I know not what is? sure we are, not any one of all
this rabble is found to be in the Scripture; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of divine Institution this Government is not: And
consequently, Christian it is not. It must needs then
be of Antichrists Order, and Papall meerely. So as if
Romes Hierarchy be the top-branch of Popery in that
Church: how can it be denyed, that the Hierarchy here
in <hi>England</hi> is the top-branch of Popery in this Church?
For if we looke upon this Hierarchy from <hi>Canterbury</hi> to
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arlile,</hi> and goe through all their Courts, their Officers,
<pb facs="tcp:93203:6"/>
their Offices, and Administrations therein, wee shall
therein behold the perfect image of the Papall Beast,
from horne to hoofe. And if any will object here that
the subordinate Ministers beare a part in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
(alas!) that's but a meere mockery. For these
are but the Prelates <hi>Curates,</hi> and a company of Priests
little differing from Romes Order of Priestho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in the
estimate of our Prelates, saving that they are not sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and have beene of late prevented of being Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
But a part in the Hierarchicall Government they
have none, unlesse a dumb Priest commonly, or some
Doctor now and then be the mouth to thunder out Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
in their Courts, which the poore Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
at the Commissaries beck must publish in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
And to these Curates consideration I refer
it, whether they be able truely out of good premises to
conclude themselves to be the Ministers of Christ law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called, whom all of them doe immediately derive
their Ministry from the Antichristian Hierarchy, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Prelacie, as the sole foundation thereof. But this
suffice briefly to prove the government of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> by Arch-Bishops and Bishops, &amp;c. (False and
usurped Titles) to be a top-branch of Popery.<note place="margin">Object.</note> If here
it be objected, that the Government of Arch-Bishops
and Diocesan Bishops was before Popery came up, or
Antichrist was mounted on his throne: I answer, first,
that the Government of Arch-Bishops and Diocesan
Bishops was anciently much different from the Papall
Hierarchicall Government afterwards, whose Courts
and sole Prelaticall Jurisdictions were not known in the
Primitive Ages long after the Apostles. Secondly, the
Government of Arch-Bishops and Diocesan Bishops, at
the very best, and when they first sprung up, was even
<pb facs="tcp:93203:7"/>
from the wel-head corrupted, as being an huma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> device,
and the first spring of the Mistery of iniquity which the

upon it, that our Hierarchicall Goverment being
a limb of the Papall, and so a top-branch of Popery, it
is now universally of all good Christians in <hi>England
protested</hi> against, as worthy to be cut off and cast out, as
a fruitlesse withering branch, and to be plucked up by

and Ceremonies, in stead thereof.</p>
            <p>I answere briefly: First, understanding the Church
of <hi>England</hi> to be none other, then a nationall Church
it will be very difficult, if not rather impossible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
it so, as is agreeable in all points to a true and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Congregation of Christ. For a particular Church,
or congregation rightly collected and constituted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of none, but such as are visible living members of
Christ the head, and visible Saints under him, the one
and onely King of Saints: but so is it not with a Natio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall
Church: all the members thereof are not visible
Saints, or visible living members, when the greatest

saith, Though the Children of Israel bee as the sand of
the Sea, yet but a remnant shall be saved. And yet that
was a Nationall Church without parallel: so as in the
Reformation of such a nationall Church as this, which
hath been so universally overspread with profanenesse,

shall wee begin to reforme? Alas! in comparison of the

but in power not in a bare name of Christianity, but in
<pb facs="tcp:93203:8"/>
the nature of it; not in the mixture of mens inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but in the purity of Christs owne Ordinances)
the Religion in <hi>England</hi> is very farre degenerate, and
but a while agoe was almost wholly slidden back into
the very puddle of Popery: yet not all, but as it was
said of the Church of <hi>Sardis, Thou hast a name that thou

then shall the Reformation begin now in <hi>England?</hi> sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

without sin? For where are not the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
mixed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true, that if there be none other Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
allowed, but such as are in Parishes, this confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
cannot be avoyded. Therfore of necessity there
must be Liberty granted of setting up Churches, or
Congregations, where <hi>Christs</hi> Ordinances are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
in their <hi>purity,</hi> and so where none are admitted
members of the Congregation, but such as are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of by the whole Assembly for their <hi>profession</hi> and
<hi>conversation,</hi> as against which there is no just exception.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But would you have other Congregations, then
such as are limited to every Parish? How will this stand
with a Nationall Church, such as is the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
This would make a division, and separation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We must look in the first place, what <hi>Christ</hi>
commandeth, and what manner of Congregations he
requireth, and how qualified. If a State will set up a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Church, wherein many things out of reason of
State are tolerated, and prescribed for <hi>order</hi> sake (as they
call it) and if there be such a necessity, necessity hath no
Law: but let not this exclude and barre out the free
use of such Congregations, as whereof the spirituall
Common-wealth of <hi>Israel</hi> consisteth, over which <hi>Christ</hi>
as King immediately raigneth by his Spirit and Word
in the beauty and purity of his <hi>ordinances.</hi> Let not the
Consciences of <hi>Gods</hi> people be bound, where <hi>Christ</hi>
hath purchased <hi>liberty.</hi> And where <hi>Christs</hi> Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:93203:10"/>
are set up, however they are separate from the world
in the corruptions thereof, yet they are not separate
from the Civil State, but are peaceable members ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
subject and obedient to all the good and just Laws
thereof. Yea where such Congregations are erected
and allowed or by a Civil State, they are both a strength
and beauty,<note place="margin">

For Christs Kingdome being spirituall, is so farr from
being any prejudice to Civil states, that it is the very
glory and safety of them. And therefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Domilian</hi> (under whom was moved the second

this goverment, this may be a meanes to soment facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and envious emulations in a State, to the disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the peace thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> For this, first, there be good Lawes for civill
government. Seriously, that any one among the exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Congregations doe incorrigably misbehave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs,
the Law can take order with them. Thirdly, let no
man blame them, before they cry them. Fourthly, it
hath beene an old stratageme of Satan still to lay all the
blame of what ever disaster, upon the Christians, as
<hi>Nero</hi> did. Fiftly, it cannot be expected, but where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Gospel commeth in its power and purity, it will
kindle coales, and stirre up debate, as <hi>Christ</hi> saith, it sets
the <hi>Father against the Sonne, and the Sonne against the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

objects it meetes withall, though naturall too,
in respect of the good subjects, in whom it is, and by
whom it is sincerely professed, for it fills them with
zeale and plaine dealing in reproving of sinne, which
the world cannot away withall. Thus it hath done in
all ages. And God in the<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               </note> beginning after the fall,
upon the revealing of <hi>Christ,</hi> put an unreconcileable
enmity, and deadly forehead betweene the seed of the
Serpent, and of the woman, betweene the Elect and
Reprobate to the worlds end. And if for this every ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
state should shut out the true Religion, where
would there be left any true Church upon the earth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Church-way of independency is too strict,
and cannot be content with a mediocrity, but aspires
to such a perfection of purity, as men are not capable
of; and therefore such will of necessity be envied and
<pb facs="tcp:93203:11"/>
maligned, which will be cause of divisions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> As i fall true Christians were not exhorted ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, and so bound, to strive for perfection, so much
as is possible, As we read <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 20. 48. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Col.</hi>
1. 28. and 4. 12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. and every where in the
Scripture is perfect holinesse required, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 12.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Let us</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>cleanse our selves
from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holinesse
in the feare of God.</hi> See also <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. and 6. 1. &amp;c. And
for envy, were there but once set up amongst us some
such Congregations, as come neerest to the rule of
Gods Word, both in Church-constitutions, and in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
sutable, they would draw no lesse love and liking to
them, when we should see in them the beauty and
glory of Christ more shining forth in them, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this Land hath yet seene. And however the world
accounts strictnesse, yet none are admitted members
thereof, but such as are both willing and desirous, and
doe freely enter into Covenant to observe all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diditions
and orders thereof according to Gods Word:
and who so are over, in, and of this Congregation, they
find in it nothing that is grievous, but Christs sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 11. 29, 30.</note> whose yoake is easie, and his burthen light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if such Congregations were set up, which
are not confined to any one Parish, but collected out of
many places, or out of many Parishes, it would perhaps
stirre up the Patochiall Ministers, or some at least, to
envy and malignity, when they should see the best
Christians in all their Parish to be under another Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
and members of another Congregation, and by
this meanes also should their wages be diminished.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, if Christians, living in a Parish, shall find
just cause of separating themselves from such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
<pb facs="tcp:93203:11"/>
as wherein great Scandalls and offences are
constantly given, so as they cannot with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and without dishonour to God and his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
communicate with such an assembly, wherof the
greatest part consists of prophane and ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(as aforesaid) but are forced to joyne themselves
with such Congregations, where no such offences be:
shall any Ministers be so unchristian, as to envy this?
Or if they doe, let them reforme their owne Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and take away all such scandalls, and separate
the precious from the vile, and administer the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Christ purely and holily, and set up Christs
government in their Congregations, that so they may
retaine those honest soules, which otherwise are forced
to forsake the pudled streames, to injoy the sweet, fresh,
and pure fountaine of living waters. Nor will the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and Pastors of such Independent Congregations
looke after any such wages, as the Parochiall Ministers
challenge to themselves, as Tithes, or the like. No sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they are, and will be content that such competent
maintenance as the members of their severall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
respectively, shall freely, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
(as is used in Tithes) allow unto them. Now
let any that professe to be the Ministers of Christ, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne
other, either Ministers or people, who are desirous
to injoy Christs Ordinances, in as much purity as may
be, and with as much liberty of conscience, as <hi>Christ</hi>
hath priviledged them withall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Parliament now being about a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
as the removing of all Antichristianisme and
Popery, as the Hierarchicall Government, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
purged, the Liturgie, and Discipline, what
government shall be set up in this Nationall <hi>Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93203:12"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Lord strengthen and direct the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in so great and glorious a Worke; and blessed be
God who hath raised up such instrumens for such a
worke, and who hath put in their hearts to be so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and unanimous for the perfecting of it so farre as is
possible, and may stand with the nature of a Nationall
Church. But as for the manner of Government of a
Nationall Church, because it hath no patterne in the
Scripture now under the <hi>Gospell,</hi> who can herein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
or advise any thing. But first of all, if good
Preachers be set up in every Parish, the noughty and
scandalous being removed, and then for the better and
speedier supply hereof, the Universities and Grammer
Schooles be purged, and better Governors and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
set up: so shall the people be taught, that they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
not for want of knowledge. As for the manner of
Government of Parishes, whether by a Presbytry, or
otherwise, that (as being, for its externall forme and
frame, of a politicke Nation) I leave to the prudence
of those, in whose hands it is put: let it be what it will,
so as still a due respect be had to those Congregations,
and Churches, which desire an exemption and liberty
of injoying Christs ordinances in such a purity, as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Church, is not possibly capable of. And what
ever Liturgie, or Ceremonies, or Discipline, are left to
accompany this Naturall Church-government, tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
with us, so we may injoy our Christian
liberty in the true use of such ordinances, and of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Church-government, as Christ the onely
Law-giver of his Church, and Lord of the conscience,
hath left unto us in his word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But independent Churches, being absolute
in themselves, and exempted from a superior Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:93203:12"/>
of others, and yet not exempt from posibility of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
what Law is left to reduce them from their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?
or that they persist in their obstinacy, what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
shall
censure, or correct them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, they have Christs Law to regulate them.
Secondly, they have the Law of Christ, which is by
love to serve one another. They have the law of associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and confederation with other Churches to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult,
advise, and conferre with, in matters of doubt or
question. And if after all other remedies any be obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in his, or their errour, they are liable to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
either in the same Congregation, if it be a
particular person, and the error great, or from other
Churches, if the whole Congregation have offended,
and do stiffely maintaine a dangerous errour, which yet
is rarely seene in a well constituted Congregation,
consisting of meet members. And if at any time
such a thing should fall out, which cannot grow but
from some roote of apostacy, particular or generall: if
the offence doe reflect also upon the Laws of the civill
state, which are made against knowne Heresies, or blas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phemy,
or Idolrtry, and the like, the offenders are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the civill power. So little feare there is, that
any independant Congregation, or any member thereof,
should be exempt from condigne censure, where just
cause is given either Ecclesiasticall or civill.</p>
