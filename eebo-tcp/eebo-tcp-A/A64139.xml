            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Have now by the assistance of God, and the advantages of your many favours, finished a <hi>Year of Sermons;</hi> which if, like the first year of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours preaching, it may be <hi>annus acceptabilis,</hi> an <hi>acceptable year</hi> to God, and his afflicted hand-maid the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a reliefe to some of her new necessities, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution or assistance to any soule; I shall esteem it among those honors and blessings, with which God uses to reward those good intentions which himselfe first puts into our hearts, and then recompenses upon our heads. My Lord, They were first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to God in the ministeries of your family: For this is a blessing for which your Lordship is to blesse
<pb facs="tcp:48497:3"/>
God, that your Family is like <hi>Gideons</hi> Fleece, <hi>irriguous</hi> with a dew from heaven, when much of the <hi>voicinage</hi> is dry; for we have cause to remember that <hi>Isaac</hi> complain'd of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> who fill'd up his wells with stones, and rubbish, and left no beauvrage for the Flocks; and therefore they could give no milke to them that waited upon the Flocks, and the flocks could not be gathered, nor fed, nor defended. It was a designe of ruine, and had in it the greatest hostility; and so it hath been lately;</p>

            </q>
            <p>But, My Lord, this is not all: I would faine also complaine that men feele not their greatest evill, and are not sensible of their danger, nor covetous of what they want, nor strive for that which is forbidden them; but that this complaint would suppose an unnaturall evill to rule in the hearts of men; For who would have in him so little of a Man, as not to be greedy of the Word of God, and of holy Ordinances, even therefore because they are so hard to have? and this evill, although it can have no excuse, yet it hath a great and a certain cause;
<pb facs="tcp:48497:3"/>
for the Word of God still creates new appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, as it satisfies the old; and enlarges the capacity, as it fils the first propensities of the Spirit. For all Spirituall blessings are seeds of Immortality, and of infinite felicities, they swell up to the comprehensions of Eternity; and the desires of the soule can never be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but when they are decayed; as the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach will be craving every day, unlesse it be sick and abused. But every mans experience tels him now, that because men have not Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, they lesse desire it; their long fasting makes them not to love their meat; and so wee have cause to feare, the people will fall to an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> then to a loathing of holy food, and then Gods anger will follow the method of our sinne, and send a famine of the Word and Sacraments. This we have the greatest reason to feare, and this feare can be relieved by nothing but by notices and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the greatnesse of the Divine mercies and goodnesse.</p>
            <p>Against this danger in future, and evill in present, as you and all good men interpose their prayers, so have I added this little instance of my care and services; being willing to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in all offices and varieties of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that so I may <hi>by all meanes save some,</hi> and confirme others; or at least, that my selfe may be accepted of God in my desiring it.
<pb facs="tcp:48497:4"/>
And I thinke I have some reasons to expect a speciall mercy in this, because I finde by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Divine providence, and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall affaires, that all the great necessities of the Church have been served by the zeale of preaching in publick, and other holy ministeries in publick or private, as they could be had. By this the Apostles planted the Church, and the primitive Bishops supported the faith of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> and the hardinesse of <hi>Confessors,</hi> and the austerity of the <hi>Retired.</hi> By this they confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Hereticks, and evill livers, and taught them the wayes of the Spirit, and left them without pertinacy, or without excuse. It was Preaching that restored the splendour of the Church, when Barbarisme, and Warres, and Ignorance either sate in, or broke the Doctors Chaire in pieces: For then it was that divers Orders of <hi>religious,</hi> and especially of <hi>Preachers</hi> were erected; God inspiring into whole companies of men a zeal of Preaching: And by the same instrument God restored the beauty of the Church, when it was necessary shee should be reformed; it was the assiduous and learned preaching of those whom God chose for his Ministers in that work, that wrought the Advantages and persuaded those Truths, which are the <hi>enamel</hi> and beautie of our Churches. And because by the same meanes all things are preserved, by which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, it cannot but be certaine, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="tcp:48497:4"/>
state of the Church requires a greater care and prudence in this Ministerie then ever; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since by Preaching some endevour to supplant Preacbing, and by intercepting the fruits of the flocks to dishearten the Shepheards from their attendances.</p>
            <p>My Lord, your great noblenesse and religious charitie hath taken from mee some portions of that glory which I designed to my selfe in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> towards the <hi>Corinthian Church;</hi> who esteemed it his honour to preach to them without a revenue; and though also like him I have a trade, by which as I can be more usefull to others, and lesse burthensome to you, yet to you also under God, I owe the quiet and the opportunities and circumstances of that, as if God had so interweaved the support of my affaires with your charitie, that he would have no advantages passe upon mee, but by your interest; and that I should expect no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the issues of my Calling, unlesse your Lordship have a share in the blessing.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I give God thanks that my lot is fallen so fairely, and that I can serve your Lordship in that ministerie, by which I am bound to serve God, and that my <hi>gratitude</hi> and my <hi>duty</hi> are bound up in the same bundle; but now, that which was <hi>yours</hi> by a right of propriety, I have made publick, that it may still be more <hi>yours,</hi> and you derive to your
<pb facs="tcp:48497:5"/>
selfe a comfort, if you shall see the necessitie of others serv'd by that which you heard so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and accepted with so much pietie, and I am persuaded have entertain'd with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and obedience, which is the dutie of all those who know, that Sermons are arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, unlesse they make us better; and that no Sermon is received as it ought, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it makes us quit a vice, or bee in love with vertue; unlesse we suffer it in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or degree to doe the work of God upon our soules.</p>
            <p>My Lord, in these Sermons I have medled with no mans interest, that onely excepted, which is <hi>Eternall;</hi> but if any mans vice was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, I have done it with as much severitie as I ought; some cases of Conscience I have here determined; but the speciall designe of the whole, is to describe the greater lines of Dutie, by speciall arguments: and if any <hi>witty Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> shall say, that I tell him nothing but what he knew before; I shall be contented with it, and rejoyce that he was so well instructed, and wish also that he needed not a <hi>Remembrancer:</hi> but if either in the first, or in the second; in the institution of some, or the reminding of others, I can doe God any service; no man ought to be offended, that Sermons are not like curious <hi>inquiries</hi> after <hi>New-nothings,</hi> but <hi>pursuances</hi> of <hi>Old truths.</hi> However, I have already
<pb facs="tcp:48497:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many faire earnests that your Lordship will bee pleased with this tender of my service, and expression of my great and dearest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, which you daily renew or continue upon,</p>

               <q>For we must all appear before the Judgment seat of CHRIST, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ertue and Vice are so essentially distinguished, and the distinction is so necessary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in order to the well being of men, in private, and in societies, that to divide them in themselves, and to separate them by suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient notices, and to distinguish them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, hath been designed by all Laws, by the sayings of wise men, by the order of things, by their proportions to good or evill; and the expectations of men have been fram'd accordingly; that Vertue may have a proper seat in the will and in the affections, and may become amiable by its own excellency and its appendant blessing; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that Vice may be as naturall an enemy to a man as a Wolf to the Lamb, and as darknesse to light; destructive of its being, and a contradiction of its nature. But it is not enough that all the world hath armed it self against Vice, and by all that is wise and sober amongst men, hath taken the part of Vertue, adorning it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48497:9"/>
with glorious appellatives, encouraging it by rewards, entertaining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it with sweetnesses, and commanding it by edicts, fortifying it with defensatives, and twining with it in all artificiall compliances; all this is short of mans necessity; for this will in all modest men secure their actions in Theatres, and High-wayes, in Markets, and Churches, before the eye of Judges, and in the society of Witnesses. But the actions of closets and chambers, the designs and thoughts of men, their discourses in dark places, and the actions of retirements and of the night, are left indifferent to Vertue or to Vice; and of these, as man can take no cognisance, so he can make no coercitive; and therefore above one half of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> humane actions is by the Laws of man left unregarded, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided for: and besides this, there are some men who are big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then Lawes, and some are bigger then Judges, and some Judges have lessened themselves by fear and cowardize, by bridery and flattery, by iniquity and complyance; and where they have not, yet they have notices but of few causes; and there are some sins so popular and universall, that to punish them is either impossible or intolerable; and to question such, would betray the weaknesse of the publick rods and axes, and represent the sinner to be stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the power that is appointed to be his bridle; and after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all this, we finde sinners so prosperous, that they escape, so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that they fear not, and sin is made safe when it growes great,</p>

            </q>
            <p>and innocence is oppressed, and the poor cry, and he hath no helper; and he is oppressed, and he wants a Patron: and for these and many other concurrent causes, if you reckon all the causes that come before all the Judicatories of the world, though the litigious are too many, and the matters of <hi>instance</hi> are intricate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and numerous, yet the personall and criminall are so few, that of 20000 sins that cry aloud to God for vengeance, scarce two are noted by the publick eye and chastis'd by the hand of Justice; it must follow from hence, that it is but reasonable for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of vertue and the necessities of the world, that the private should be judg'd, and vertue should be tyed upon the spirit, and the poor should be relieved, and the oppressed should appeal, and the noise of Widows should be heard, and the Saints should stand upright, and the Cause that was ill judged should be judged over <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> again, and Tyrants should be call'd to account, and our thoughts should be examined, and our secret actions view'd on all sides, and the infinite number of sins which escape here should not escape finally; and therefore God hath so ordained it, that there shall be a day of doom wherein all that are let alone by men shall be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48497:9"/>
question'd by God, and every word and every action shall receive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> its just recompence of reward. <hi>For we must all appear before the Judgement seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>

of its terror and our dear concernment, that it much increases it: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for although concerning Precepts and Discourses we are apt to neglect in particular what is recommended in generall, and in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidencies of Mortality and sad events the singularity of the chance heightens the apprehension of the evill; yet it is so by accident and only in regard of our imperfection; it being an effect of self-love or some little creeping envie which adheres too often to the infortunate and miserable; or else because the sorrow is apt to increase by being apprehended to be a rare case and a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular unworthinesse in him who is afflicted, otherwise then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the sons of men, companions of his sin, and brethren of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his nature, and partners of his usuall accidents; yet in finall and extreme events the multitude of sufferers does not lessen but increase the sufferings; and when <hi>the first day of Judgement</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, that (I mean) of the universall deluge of waters upon the old World, the calamity swell'd like the floud, and every man saw his friend perish, and the neighbours of his dwelling, and the relatives of his house, and the sharers of his joyes, and yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies bride, and the new born heir, the Priest of the Family, and the honour of the Kindred, all dying or dead, drench'd in water and the divine vengeance; and then they had no place to flee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> no man cared for their souls; they had none to goe unto for counsell, no sanctuary high enough to keep them from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance that raip'd down from heaven: and so it shall be at the day of Judgement, when that world and this and all that shall be born hereafter, shall passe through the same Red sea, and be all baptized with the same fire, and be involv'd in the same cloud, in which shall be thundrings and terrors infinite; every Mans fear shall be increased by his neighbours shriekes, and the amazement that all the world shall be in, shall unite as the sparks of a raging furnace into a globe of fire, and roul upon its own principle, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> increase by direct appearances, and intolerable reflexions. He that stands in a Church-yard in the time of a great plague, and hears the Passing-bell perpetually telling the sad stories of death, and sees crowds of infected bodies pressing to their Graves, and others sick and tremulous, and Death dress'd up in all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of sorrow round about him, is not supported in his spirit by the variety of his sorrow: and at Dooms-day, when the terrors are universall, besides that it is in it self so much greater because it can affright the whole world, it is also made greater by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and a sorrowfull influence; Grief being then strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infections: when there is no variety of state but an intire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Kingdome of fear; and amazement is the King of all our passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all the world its subjects: and that shrieke must needs be terrible, when millions of Men and Women at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant shall fearfully cry out, and the noise shall mingle with the

Trumpet of the Archangell, with the thunders of the dying and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> groaning heavens, and the crack of the dissolving world, when the whole fabrick of nature shall shake into dissolution and eternall ashes. But this generall consideration may be hightned with four or five circumstances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider what an infinite multitude of Angels and Men and Women shall then appear; it is a huge assembly when the Men of one Kingdome, the Men of one Age in a single Province are gathered togother into heaps and confusion of disorder; But then all Kingdomes of all ages, all the Armies that ever mustered, all that World that <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> taxed, all those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hundreds of Millions that were slain in all the <hi>Roman</hi> Wars from <hi>Numa</hi>'s time till <hi>Italy</hi> was broken into Principalities and small <hi>Exarchats,</hi> all these, and all that can come into numbers, and that did descend from the loins of <hi>Adam,</hi> shall at once be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented; to which account if we adde the Armies of Heaven, the nine orders of blessed Spirits, and the infinite numbers in every order, we may suppose the numbers fit to expresse the Majesty of that God, and the terror of that Judge, who is the Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all that unimaginable multitude. <hi>Erit terror ingens tot simul tantorúmque populorum.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In this great multitude we shall meet all those who by their example and their holy precepts have like tapers enkindled with a beam of the Sun of righteousnesse enlightned us, and taught us to walk in the paths of justice. There we shall see all those good men whom God sent to preach to us, and recall us from humane follies and inhumane practises: and when we espie the good man that chid us for our last drunkennesse or adulteries, it shall then also be remembred how we mocked at counsell, and were civilly modest at the reproof, but laugh'd when the man was gone, and accepted it for a religious complement, and took our leaves and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> went and did the same again. But then things shall put on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther face, and what we smil'd at here, and slighted fondly, shall then be the greatest terror in the world; Men shall feel that they once laugh'd at their own destruction, and rejected health when it was offered by a man of God upon no other condition, but that they would be wise, and not be in love with death. Then they shall perceive, that if they had obeyed an easie and a sober counsell, they had been partners of the same felicity which they see so illustrious upon the heads of those Preachers <hi>whose work is with the Lord,</hi> and who by their life and Doctrine endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to snatch the Soul of their friend or relatives from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> misery. But he that sees a crown put upon their heads that give good counsell, and preach holy and severe Sermons with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of charity and piety, will also then perceive that God did not send Preachers for nothing, on trifling errands and without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48497:11"/>
regard: but that work which he crowns in them he purposed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> should be effective to us, perswasive to the understanding, and active upon our consciences. Good Preachers by their Doctrine, and all good men by their lives are the accusers of the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and they shall rise up from their seats, and judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the follies of those who thought their piety to be want of courage, and their discourses pedanticall, and their reproofs the Priests trade, but of no signification, because they prefer'd moments before eternity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There in that great assembly shall be seen all those Converts who upon easier terms, and fewer miracles, and a lesse experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and a younger grace, and a seldomer Preaching, and more unlikely circumstances have suffered the work of God to prosper upon their spirits, and have been obedient to the heavenly calling. There shall stand the men of <hi>Ninevch,</hi> and they <hi>shall stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in Judgement,</hi> for they at the preaching of one man in a lesse space then forty dayes <hi>returned unto the Lord their God;</hi> but we have heard him call all our lives, and <hi>like the deaf Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der stopt our ears against the voice</hi> of Gods servants, <hi>charme they never so wisely.</hi> There shall appear the men of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and the <hi>Queen of the South,</hi> and the <hi>Men of Berea,</hi> and the first fruits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the Christian Church, and the holy Martyrs, and shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to all the world that it was not impossible to do the work of Grace in the midst of all our weaknesses, and accidentall disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages: and that <hi>the obedience of Faith,</hi> and <hi>the labour of Love,</hi> and the contentions of chastity, and the severities of temperance and self-deniall, are not such insuperable mountains, but that an honest and a sober person may perform them in acceptable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, if he have but a ready ear, and a willing minde, and an honest heart: and this seen of honest persons shall make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Judgement upon sinners more reasonable and apparently just; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in passing upon them the horrible sentence; for why cannot we as well serve God in peace as others served him in war? why cannot we love him as well when he treats us sweetly and gives us health and plenty, honours or fair fortunes, reputation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentednesse, quietnesse and peace, as others did upon gibbets and under axes, in the hands of tormentors, and in hard wildernesses, in nakednesse and poverty, in the midst of all evill things and all sad discomforts? Concerning this no answer can be made.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But there is a worse sight then this yet, which in that great assembly shall distract our sight and amaze our spirits. There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> men shall meet the partners of their sins, and them that drank the round when they crown'd their heads with folly and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and their cups with wine and noises. There shall ye see that poor perishing soul whom thou didst tempt to adultery and wantonnesse, to drunkennesse or perjury, to rebellion or an
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48497:11"/>
evill interest, by power or craft, by witty discourses or deep <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dissembling, by scandall or a snare, by evill example or perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious counsell, by malice or unwarinesse; and when all this is summ'd up, and from the variety of its particulars is drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an uneasie load and a formidable summe, possibly we may finde sights enough to scare all our confidences, and arguments enough to presse our evill souls into the sorrowes of a most intolerable death. For however we make now but light accounts and evill proportions concerning it, yet it will be a fearfull circumstance of appearing, to see one, or two, or ten, or twenty accursed souls despairing, miserable, infinitely miserable, roaring and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and fearfully cursing thee as the cause of its eternall sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. Thy lust betray'd and rifled her weak unguarded inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; thy example made thy servant confident to lye, or to be perjur'd; thy society brought a third into intemperance and the disguises of a beast; and when thou feest that soul with whom thou didst sin drag'd into hell, well maist thou fear to drink the dregs of thy intolerable potion; And most certainly it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of evils to destroy a soul for whom the Lord Jesus dyed, and to undoe that grace which our Lord purchased with so much sweat and bloud, pains and a mighty charity. And because very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sins, are sins of society and confederation; such are fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, drunkennesse, bribery, simony, rebellion, schisme, and many others, it is a hard and a weighty consideration what shall become of any one of us who have tempted our Brother or Sister to sin and death: for though God hath spar'd our life, and they are dead and their debt-books are sealed up till the day of account, yet the mischief of our sin is gone before us, and it is like a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but more execrable, the soul is dead in trespasses and sins, and sealed up to an eternall sorrow, and thou shalt see at Dooms-day what damnable uncharitablenesse thou hast done. That soul <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that cryes to those rocks to cover her, if it had not been for thy perpetuall temptations, might have followed the Lamb in a white robe; and that poor man that is cloathed with shame and flames of fire, would have shin'd in glory, but that thou didst force him to be partner of thy basenesse. And who shall pay for this losse? a soul is lost by thy means; thou hast defeated the holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of the Lord's bitter passion by thy impurities; and what shall happen to thee by whom thy Brother dies eternally? Of all the considerations that concern this part of the horrors of Dooms-day nothing can be more formidable then this, to such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whom it does concern: and truly it concerns so many, and amongst so many, perhaps some persons are so tender, that it might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright their hopes and discompose their industries and spritefull labours of repentance; but that our most mercifull Lord hath in the midst of all the fearfull circumstances of his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48497:12"/>
interwoven this one comfort relating to this, which to my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sense seems the most fearfull and killing circumstance: Two shall be grinding at one mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two shall be in a bed; the one shall be taken, and the other left; that is, those who are confederate in the same fortunes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, and actions, may yet have a different sentence: for an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and an active repentance will wash off this account, and put it upon the tables of the Crosse; and though it ought to make us diligent and carefull, charitable and penitent, hugely penitent, even so long as we live, yet when we shall appear together, there is a mercy that shall there separate us, who sometimes had blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> each other in a common crime. Blessed be the mercies of of God, who hath so carefully provided a fruitfull shower of grace to refresh the miseries and dangers of the greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> was used to beg of God that he might never be tempted from his low fortune to Prelacies and dignities Ecclesiasticall; and that his minde might never be discomposed or polluted with the love of any creature; and that he might by some instrument or other understand the state of his deceased Brother; and the story sayes, that he was heard in all: In him it was a great curiosity, or the passion and impertinencies of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> uselesse charity to search after him, unlesse he had some other personall concernment, then his relation of kindred. But truly, it would concern very many to be solicitous concerning the event of those souls with whom we have mingled death and sin; for many of those sentences which have passed and decreed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our departed relatives, will concern us dearly, and we are bound in the same bundles, and shall be thrown into the same fires, unlesse we repent for our own sins, and double our sorrows for their damnation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We may consider that this infinite multitude of men and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> women, Angels and Devils, is not ineffective as a number in <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Tables, but must needs have influence upon every spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that shall there appear. For the transactions of that court are not like Orations spoken by a <hi>Grecian</hi> Orator in the circles of his people, heard by them that croud nearest him, or that sound li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the circles of aire, or the inclosure of a wall; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is represented to every person, and then let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, when thy shame and secret turpitude, thy midnight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and secret hypocrisies, thy lustfull thoughts, and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous designes, thy falshood to God and startings from thy holy promises, thy follies and impieties shall be laid open before all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> world, and that then shall be spoken by the trumpet of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell upon the house top, the highest battlements of Heaven, all those filthy words and lewd circumstances which thou didst act secretly, thou wilt find that thou wilt have reason strangely to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48497:12"/>
be ashamed. All the wise men in the world shall know how vile thou hast been: and then consider; with what confusion of face wouldst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thou stand in the presence of a good man and a severe, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure he should suddenly draw thy curtain, and finde thee in the sins of shame and lust; it must be infinitely more, when God and all the Angels of heaven and earth, all his holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads, and all his redeemed Saints shall stare and wonder at thy impurities and follies. I have read a story that a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being passionately by his mother disswaded from entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the severe courses of a religious and single life, broke from her importunity by saying, <hi>Volo servare animam meam, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by all means to save my soul.</hi> But when he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a rule with passion, he performed it carelesly and remisly, and was but lukewarm in his Religion, and quickly proceeded to a melancholy and wearied spirit, and from thence to a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and the neighbourhood of death; but falling into an ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and a phantastick vision, dream'd that he saw himself sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd before Gods angry throne, and from thence hurryed into a place of torments, where espying his Mother, full of scorn she upbraided him with his former answer, and asked him, <hi>Why he did not save his soul, by all means,</hi> according as he undertook. But when the sick man awaked and recovered, he made his words <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> good indeed, and prayed frequently, and fasted severely, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured humbly, and conversed charitably, and mortified himself severely, and refused such secular solaces which other good men received to refresh and sustain their infirmities, and gave no other account to them that asked him but this: If I could not in my extasie or dream endure my Mothers upbraiding my follies and weak Religion, how shall I be able to suffer, that God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dargue me at Dooms-day, and the Angels reproach my luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse, and the Devlls aggravate my sins, and all the Saints <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of God deride my follies and hypocrisies? The effect of that mans consideration may serve to actuate a meditation in every one of us: for we shall all be at that passe, that unlesse our shame and sorrowes be cleansed by a timely repentance, and cover'd by the Robe of Christ, we shall suffer the anger of God, the scorn of Saints and Angels, and our own shame in the generall assembly of all mankind. This argument is most considerable to them who are tender of their precious name and sensible of honour; if they rather would chuse death then a disgrace, poverty rather then shame, let them remember that a sinfull life will bring them to an intolerable shame at that day, when all that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in heaven and earth shall be summon'd as witnesses and parties in a fearfull scrutiny. The summe is this; All that are born of <hi>Adam</hi> shall appear before God and his Christ, and all the innumerable companies of Angels and Devils shall be there:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48497:13"/>
and the wicked shall be afrighted with every thing they see; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and there they shall see those good men that taught them the waies of life, and all those evill persons whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have tempted into the waies of death, and those who were converted upon easier termes, and some of these shall shame the wicked, and some shall curse them, and some shall upbraid them, and all shall amaze them, and yet this is but the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the beginning of those evils which shall never end till eternity hath a period; but concerning this they must first be judged; and that's the second generall consideration, <hi>We must appear before the Judgement seat of Christ,</hi> and that's a new state of terrors and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> afrightments. Christ who is our Saviour, and is our Advocate, shall then be our Judge, and that will strangely change our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and all the face of things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That's then the place and state of our appearance, <hi>Before the Judgement seat of Christ:]</hi> For Christ shall rise from the right hand of his Father, he shall descend towards us and ride upon a cloud, and shall make himself illustrious by a glorious Majesty, and an innumerable retinue and circumstances of terror and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power: and this is that which <hi>Origen</hi> affirms to be the sign of the Son of Man. <hi>Remalcus de Vaux in Harpocrate divino</hi> affirms <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that all the Greek and Latine Fathers <hi>consentientibus animis asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, hoc signo Crucem Christi significari,</hi> do unanimously affirm that the representment of the Crosse, is the sign of the Son of Man spoken of <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. And indeed they affirm it very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, but <hi>Origen</hi> after his manner is singular, <hi>hoc signum Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis erit, cum Dominus ad judicandum venerit,</hi> so the Church used to sing, and so it is in the Sibyls verses;</p>
            <q>

            </q>
            <p>The sign of the Crosse is that sign of the Son of Man, when the Lord shall come to Judgement: and from those words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture [They shall look on him whom they have pierced] it hath been freely entertain'd at the day of Judgement, Christ shall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his person by something that related to his passion, his crosse, or his wounds, or both. I list not to spin this curious cobweb; but <hi>Origen</hi>'s opinion seems to me more reasonable; and it is more agreeable to the Majesty and Power of Christ to signifie himself <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with proportions of his glory rather then of his humility, with effects of his being exalted into Heaven, rather then of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and sorrowes upon Earth; and this is countenanced better by some Greek copies; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the signe of the Son of man who is in the heavens; not that the signe shall bee imprinted on a cloud, or in any part of the heavens, but that hee who is now in the heavens, shall when he comes down, have a signe and signification of his own, that is, proper to him, who is there glorified, and shall return in glory; and he disparages the beauty of the Sun, who inquires for a Rule to know when the Sun shines, or the light breaks forth from its chambers of the East; and the Son of man shall need no other signification, but his infinite retinue, and all the Angels of God worshipping him, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sitting upon a cloud, and leading the heavenly Host, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Elect with him, and being clothed with the robes of Majesty, and trampling upon Devils, and confounding the wicked, and destroying Death: but all these great things shall be invested with such strange circumstances, and annexes of Mightynesse, and Divinity, that all the world shall confesse the glories of the Lord; and this is sufficiently signified by St. <hi>Paul, We shall all be</hi>

            <p n="1">1. IF we consider the person of the Judge, we first perceive that he is interested in the injury of the crimes he is to sentence. <hi>Videbunt quem crucifixerunt,</hi> and <hi>they shal look on him whom they have pierced.</hi> It was for thy sins that the Judge did suffer such unspeakable pains as were enough to reconcile all the world to God: The summe and spirit of which pains could not be better understood then by the consequence of his own words, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> meaning, that he felt such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, pure, unmingled sorrowes, that although his humane nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was personally united to the Godhead, yet at that instant he felt no comfortable emanations by sensible perception from the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but he was so drenched in sorrow, that the Godhead see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have forsaken him. Beyond this, nothing can be added: but then, that thou hast for thy own particular made all this in vain and ineffective, that Christ thy Lord and Judge should be tormented for nothing, that thou wouldst not accept felicity and pardon when he purchased them at so dear a price, must needs be an infinite condemnation to such persons. How shalt thou look upon him that fainted and dyed for love of thee, and thou didst scorn his miraculous mercies? How shall we dare to behold that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> holy face that brought salvation to us, and we turned away and fell in love with death, and kissed deformity and sins? and yet in the beholding that face consists much of the glories of eternity. All the pains and passions, the sorrowes and the groans, the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and poverty, the labours and the watchings, the Prayers and the Sermons, the miracles and the prophecies, the whip and the nails, the death and the buriall, the shame and the smart, the Crosse and the grave of Jesus shall be laid upon thy score, if thou hast refused the mercies and design of all their holy ends and purposes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And if we remember what a calamity that was which broke the Jewish Nation in pieces, when Christ came to judge them for their murdering him who was their King and the Prince of life, and consider that this was but a dark image of the terrors of the day of Judgement, we may then apprehend that there is some
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48497:16"/>
strange unspeakable evill that attends them that are guilty of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> death, and of so much evill to their Lord. Now it is certain if thou wilt not be saved by his death; you are guilty of his death; if thoa wilt not suffer him to save thee, thou art guilty of destroying him; and then let it be considered what is to be expected from that Judge before whom you stand as his murtherer and betrayer. * But this is but half of this consideration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Christ may be <hi>crucified again,</hi> and upon a new account <hi>put to an open shame.</hi> For after that Christ had done all this by the direct acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Priestly Office, of sacrificing himself for us, he hath also done very many things for us which are also the fruits of his first love <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and prosecutions of our redemption. I will not instance in the strange arts of mercy that our Lord uses to bring us to live holy lives; But I consider, that things are so ordered, and so great a value set upon our souls since they are the images of God, and redeemed by the Bloud of the holy Lamb, that the salvation of our souls is reckoned as a part of Christs reward, a part of the glorification of his humanity. Every sinner that repents causes joy to Christ, and the joy is so great that it runs over and wets the fair brows and beauteous locks of Cherubims and Seraphims, and all the Angels have a part of that banquet; Then it is that our blessed Lord feels the fruits of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> holy death, the acceptation of his holy sacrifice, the graciousnesse of his person, the return of his prayers. For all that Christ did or suffer'd, and all that he now does as a Priest in heaven, is to glorifie his Father by bringing souls to God: For this it was that he was born and dyed, that he descended from heaven to earth, from life to death, from the crosse to the grave; this was the purpose of his resurrection and ascension, of the end and design of all the miracles and graces of God manifested to all the world by him; and now what man is so vile, such a malicious fool, that will refuse to bring joy to his Lord by doing himself the greatest good in the world? They who refuse to do this, are said to <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>the Lord of life again, and put him to an open shame:</hi> that is, they, as much as in them lies, bring Christ from his glorious joyes to the labours of his life, and the shame of his death; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his enemies, and refuse to advance the Kingdome of their Lord; they put themselves in that state in which they were when Christ came to dye for them; and now that he is in a state that he may rejoyce over them, (for he hath done all his share towards it) every wicked man takes his head from the blessing, and rather chuses that the Devill should rejoyce in his destruction, then that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his Lord should triumph in his felicity. And now upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of these premises, we may imagine that it will be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite amazement to meet that Lord to be our Judge whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we have murdered, whose honour we have disparaged, whose purposes we have destroyed, whose joyes we have lessened, whose
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48497:16"/>
passion we have made ineffectuall, and whose love we have tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under our profane and impious feet. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But there is yet a third part of this consideration. As it will be inquir'd at the day of Judgement concerning the dishonours to the person of Christ, so also concerning the profession and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ, and concerning his poor Members; for by these also we make sad reflexions upon our Lord. Every man that lives wickedly disgraces the religion and institution of Jesus, he discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages strangers from entring into it, he weakens the hands of them that are in already, and makes that the adversaries speak reproachfully of the Name of Christ; but although it is certain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our Lord and Judge will deeply resent all these things, yet there is one thing which he takes more tenderly, and that is, the uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablenesse of men towards his poor: It shall then be upbraided to them by the Judge, that himself was hungry and they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to give meat to him that gave them his body and heart-bloud, to feed them and quench their thirst; that they denyed a robe to cover his nakednesse, and yet he would have cloathed their souls with the robe of his righteousnesse, lest their souls should be found naked in the day of the Lords visitation; and all this unkindnesse is nothing but that evill men were uncharitable to their Brethren, they would not feed the hungry, nor give drink to the thirsty, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> cloath the naked, nor relieve their Brothers needs, nor forgive his follies, nor cover their shame, nor turn their eyes from deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their affronts and evill accidents; this is it which our Lord will take so tenderly, that his Brethren for whom he died, who suck'd the paps of his Mother, that fed on his Body and are nourished with his Bloud, whom he hath lodg'd in his heart and entertains in his bosome, the partners of his Spirit and co-heirs of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, that these should be deny'd relief and suffered to go away ashamed, and unpitied; this our blessed Lord will take so ill, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all those who are guilty of this unkindnesse, have no reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the favour of the Court.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To this if we adde the almightinesse of the Judge, his infinite wisdome and knowledge of all causes, and all persons, and all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that he is infinitely just, inflexibly angry, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in his sentence, there can be nothing added either to thè greatness or the requisites of a terrible and an Almighty Judge. For who can resist him who is Almighty? Who can evade his scrutiny that knows all things? Who can hope for pity of him that is inflexible? Who can think to be exempted when the Judge is righteous and impartial? But in all these annexes of the great Judge, that which I shall now remark, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is that indeed which hath terror in it, and that is, the severity of our Lord. For then is the day of vengeance and recompenses, and no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at all shall be shewed, but to them that are the sons of mercy; for the other, their portion is such as can be expected from these premises.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48497:17"/>
1. If we remember the instances of Gods severity in this life, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
in the daies of mercy and repentance, in those dayes when Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment waits upon Mercy, and receives lawes by the rules and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of pardon, and that for all the rare streams of loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse issuing out of Paradise and refreshing all our fields with a moisture more fruitfull then the flouds of <hi>Nilus,</hi> still there are mingled some stormes and violences, some fearfull instances of the Divine Justice, we may more readily expect it will be worse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely worse at that day, when Judgement shall ride in triumph, and Mercy shall be the accuser of the wicked. But so we read, and are commanded to remember, because they are written for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that God destroyed at once five cities of the plain, and all the country; and <hi>Sodome</hi> and her sisters are <hi>set forth for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, suffering the vengeance of eternall fire.</hi> Fearfull it was when God destroyed at once 23000 for fornication, and an extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Angell in one night killed 185000 of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and the first born of all the families of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and for the sin of <hi>David</hi> in numbring the people threescore and ten thousand of the people dyed, and God sent ten tribes into captivity and eternall oblivion and indistinction from a common people for their idolatry. Did not God strike <hi>Corah</hi> and his company with fire from Heaven? and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the earth open'd and swallowed up the congregation of <hi>Abiram?</hi> And is not evill come upon all the world for one sin of <hi>Adam?</hi> Did not the anger of God break the nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> all in pieces with judgements so great, that no nation ever suffered the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none ever sin'd so? And at once it was done, that God in anger destroyed all the world, and eight persons only escaped the angry Baptisme of water, and yet this world is the time of mercy; God hath open'd here his Magazines, and sent his holy Son as the great channell and fountain of it too: here he delights in mercy, and in judgement loves to remember it, and it triumphs over all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his works, and God contrives instruments and accidents, chances and designs, occasions and opportunities for mercy: if therefore now the anger of God makes such terrible eruptions upon the wicked people that delight in sin, how great may we suppose that anger to be, how severe that Judgement, how terrible that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, how intolerable those inflictions which God reserves for the full effusion of indignation on the great day of vengeance?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may also guesse at it by this; if God upon all single in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and in the midst of our sins, before they are come to the full, and sometimes in the beginning of an evill habit be so fierce in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his anger, what can we imagine it to be, in that day when the wicked are to drink the dregs of that horrid potion, and count over all the particulars of their whole treasure of wrath? <hi>This is the</hi>

               <hi>I will restore it in the day of vengeance, for the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants.</hi> For so did the <hi>Lybian</hi> Lion that was brought up under discipline, and taught to endure blowes, and eat the meat of order and regular provision, and to suffer gentle usages, and the familiarities of socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but once he brake out into his own wildnesse, <hi>Dedidicit pacem subitò feritate reversâ,</hi> and kil'd two <hi>Roman</hi> boyes; but those that sorrage in the <hi>Lybian</hi> mountains tread down and devour all that they meet or master; and when they have fasted two dayes, lay up an anger great as is their appetite, and bring certain death to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all that can be overcome: God is pleased to compare himself to a Lion; and though in this life he hath confin'd himself with promises and gracious emanations of an infinite goodnesse, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himself by conditions and covenants, and suffers himself to be overcome by prayers, and himself hath invented wayes of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expiation, yet when he is provoked by our unhandsome and unworthy actions, he makes sudden breaches, and tears some of us in pieces, and of others he breaks their bones or affrights their hopes and secular sayeties, and fils their house with mourning and Cypresse, and groans and death: But when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this Lion of the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> shall appear upon his own moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>the mountain of the Lord,</hi> in his naturall dresse of Majesty, and that Justice shall have her chain and golden fetters taken off, then Justice shall strike, and Mercy <hi>shall not</hi> hold her hands; she shall strike sore strokes, and pity <hi>shall not</hi> break the blow; and God shall account with us by minutes, and for words, and for thoughts, and then he shall be <hi>severe to mark what is done amisse;</hi> and that Justice may reign intirely, God shall open the wicked mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and tell the sums, and weigh grains and scruples: <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3. We may guesse at the severity of the Judge by the lesser strokes of that Judgement which he is pleased to send upon sinners in this world, to make them afraid of the horrible pains of Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: I mean the torments of an unquiet conscience, the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confusions of some sins and some persons. For I have sometimes seen persons surpriz'd in a base action, and taken in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> circumstances of crafty theft, and secret unjustices before their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse was ready; They have changed their colour, their speech hath faltered, their tongue stammer'd, their eyes did wander and fix no where, till shame made them sink into their hollow eye-pits to retreat from the images and circumstances of discovery; their wits are lost, their reason uselesse, the whole order of their soul is discomposed, and they neither see, nor feel, nor think as they use to do, but they are broken into disorder by a stroke of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a lesser stripe of hell; but then if you come to observe a guilty and a base murtherer, a condemned traytor, and see him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> harrassed first by an evill conscience, and then pull'd in pieces by the hangmans hooks, or broken upon sorrows and the wheel, we may then guesse (as well as we can in this life) what the pains of that day shall be to accursed souls: But those we shall consider afterwards in their proper scene; now only we are to estimate the severity of our Judge by the intolerablenesse of an evill conscience; if guilt will make a man despair, and despair will make a man mad, confounded and dissolved in all the regions of his senses and more noble faculties, that he shall neither feel, nor hear, nor see any thing but spectres and illusions, devils and frightfull dreams, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and hear noises, and shriek fearfully, and look pale and distracted like a hopelesse man from the horrors and confusions of a lost battell upon which all his hopes did stand, then the wicked must at the day of Judgement expect strange things and fearfull, and such which now no language can expresse, and then no patience can endure.</p>

5. But the matter is still of more concernment. The Pharisees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> beleeved that they were innocent if they abstained from criminall actions, such as were punishable by the Judge; and many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians think all is well with them, if they abstain from such sins as have a name in the Tables of their Lawes: But because some sins are secret and not discernible by man; others are publick, but not punished, because they are frequent and perpetuall, and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall mischiefs in some instances, and only provocations against God; men think that in their concernments they have no place: and such are <hi>jeering</hi> and many instances of wantonnesse, and revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, doing petty spites, and doggednesse, and churlishnesse, lying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and pride: and beyond this, some are very like vertues; as <hi>too much gentlenesse</hi> and slacknesse in government, or <hi>too great severity</hi> and rigor of animadversions, <hi>bitternesse</hi> in reproof of sinners, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civill circumstances,</hi> imprudent handlings of some criminals, and <hi>zeal;</hi> Nay there are some vile things, which through the evill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursings and worse manners of men are passed into an artificiall and false reputation, and men are accounted <hi>wits</hi> for talking <hi>Atheistically,</hi> and <hi>valiant</hi> for being <hi>murderers,</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> for <hi>decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> and circumventing our Brothers; and many irregularities more, for all which we are safe enough here. But when the day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Judgement comes, these shall be called to a severe account, for the Judge is <hi>omniscient</hi> and knows all things, and his tribunall takes cognisance of all causes, and hath a coërcitive for all, <hi>all things are naked and open to his eyes</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul)</hi> therefore nothing shall <note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> escape for being secret:</p>

            <p n="1">1. Christ shall be their accuser, not only upon the stock of those direct injuries (which I before reckoned) of crucifying the Lord of life, once and again, &amp;c. But upon the titles of contempt and unworthinesse, of unkindnesse and ingratitude; and the accusation
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48497:20"/>
will be nothing else but a plain representation of those artifices and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> assistances, those bonds and invitations, those constrainings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities which our dear Lord used to us to make it almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to lye in sin, and necessary to be sav'd. For it will, it must needs be a fearfull exprobration of our unworthinesse, when the Judge himself shall bear witnesse against us, that the wisdome of God himself was strangely imployed in bringing us safely to felicity. I shall draw a short Scheme, which although it must needs be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly short of what God hath done for us, yet it will be enough to shame us. * God did not only give his Son for an example, and <note place="margin">1.</note> the Son gave himself for a price for us, but both gave the holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Spirit to assist us in mighty graces, for the verifications of Faith, and the entertainments of Hope, and the increase and perseverance of Charity. * God gave to us a new nature, he put another prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <note place="margin">2.</note> into us, a third part of a perfective constitution: we have the Spirit put into us, to be a part of us, as properly to produce acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a holy life, as the soul of man in the body does produce the naturall. * God hath exalted humane nature, and made it in <note place="margin">3.</note> the person of Jesus Christ, to sit above the highest seat of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and <hi>the Angels</hi> are made <hi>ministring spirits,</hi> ever since their Lord became our Brother. * Christ hath by a miraculous Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">4.</note>

            <p>* Adde to this account that God did heap blessings upon us <note place="margin">8.</note> without order, infinitely, perpetually and in all instances, when we needed, and when we needed not. * He heard us when we pray'd, <note place="margin">9.</note> giving us all and giving us more then we desired; * He desired <note place="margin">10.</note> that we should aske, and yet he hath also prevented our desires; * He watch'd for us, and at his own charge sent a whole order of men whose imployment is to minister to our souls: and if all this <note place="margin">11.</note> had not been enough, he had given us more also. * He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">12.</note> heaven to our obedience, a Province for a dish of water, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Kingdome for a prayer, satisfaction for desiring it, grace for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and more grace for accepting and using the first. * He <note place="margin">13.</note> invited us with gracious words and perfect entertainments; * He <note place="margin">14.</note> threatned horrible things to us if we would not be happy; * He <note place="margin">15.</note> hath made strange necessities for us, making our very repentance to be a conjugation of holy actions, and holy times, and a long suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; * He hath taken away all excuses from us, he hath called <note place="margin">16.</note> us off from temptation, he bears our charges, he is alwaies before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with us in every act of favour, and perpetually slow in stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and his arrowes are unfeathered, and he is so long, first in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> drawing his sword, and another long while in whetting it, and yet longer in lifting his hand to strike, that before the blow comes the man hath repented long, unlesse he be a fool and impudent; and then God is so glad of an excuse to lay his anger aside, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if after all this we refuse life and glory, there is no more to be said; this plain story will condemn us: but the story is very much longer, and as our conscience will represent all our sins to us, so the Judge will represent all his Fathers kindnesses, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> when he was to make the justice of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sentence appear against him. * Then it shall be remembred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that the joyes of every daies piety would have been a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <note place="margin">17.</note> every night, then the remembrance of every nights sin could have been in the morning; * That every night, <hi>the trouble and labour</hi> of the daies vertue would have been as much passed and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">18.</note> to as very a nothing, as <hi>the pleasure</hi> of that daies sin; but that they would be infinitely distinguished by the remanent effects. <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi> it signifies this also, that not only the Justice of God shall be confessed by us in our own shame and condemnation, but the evill of the sentence shall be received into us, to melt our bowels and to break our heart in pieces within us, because we are the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of our own death, and our own inhumane hands have torn our souls in pieces. Thus farre the horrors are great, and when evill men consider it, it is certain they must be afraid to dye.

Although this is apt to represent every mans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> condition more of lesse, yet concerning persons of wicked lives, it hath in it too many sad degrees of truth; they are impatient of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and justly fearfull of death, because they know not how to comfort themselves in the evill accidents of their lives; and their conscience is too polluted to take death for sanctuary, and to hope to have amends made to their condition by the sentence of the day of Judgement. Evill and sad is their condition who cannot be contented here, nor blessed hereafter; whose life is their misery, and their conscience is their enemy, whose grave is their prison, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and death their undoing, and the sentence of Dooms-day, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of an intolerable condition.</p>

also interpose, and against all these things shall oppose the passion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of our blessed Lord, and upon all their defects shall cast <hi>the robe of his righteousnesse;</hi> and the sins of their youth shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail so much as the repentance of their age; and their omissions be excused by probable intervening causes, and their little escapes shall appear single, and in disunion, because they were alwaies kept asunder by penitentiall prayers and sighings, and their seldome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of sin by their daily watchfulnesse, and their often infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the sincerity of their souls, and their scruples by their zeal, and their possions by their love, and all by the mercies of God and the sacrifice which their Judge offer'd, and the holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Spirit made effective by daily graces and assistances. These there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore infallibly go to the portion of the right hand, because the Lord our God shall answer for them. <hi>But as for the wicked, it is not so with them;</hi> for although the plain story of their life be to them a sad condemnation, yet what will be answered when it shall be told concerning them, that they despised Gods mercies, and feared not his angry judgements; that they regarded not his word, and loved not his excellencies; that they were not perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the promises, nor afrighted by his threatnings; that they neither would accept his government, nor his blessings; that all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sad stories that ever hapned in both the worlds, (in all which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did escape till the day of his death, and was not concerned in them save only that he was called upon by every one of them, which he ever heard or saw or was told of, to repentance, that all these) were sent to him in vain? But cannot the Accuser truly say to the Judge concerning such persons, They were thine by creation, but mine by their own choice: Thou didst redeem them indeed, but they sold themselves to me for a trifle, or for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfying interest: Thou diedst for them, but they obeyed my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: I gave them nothing, I promised them nothing but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the filthy pleasures of a night, or the joyes of madnesse, or the delights of a disease: I never hanged upon the Crosse three long hours for them, nor endured the labours of a poor life 33 years together for their interest; only when they were thine by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of thy death, they quickly became mine by the demerit of their ingratitude, and when thou hadst cloathed their soul with thy robe, and adorned them by thy graces, we strip'd them naked as their shame, and only put on a robe of darknesse, and they thought themselves secure and went dancing to their grave like a drunkard to a sight, or a flie unto a candle; and therefore they that did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with us in our faults, must divide with us in our portion and fearfull interest? This is a sad story because it ends in death, and there is nothing to abate or lessen the calamity. It concerns us therefore to consider in time, that he that tempts us will accuse us, and what he cals <hi>pleasant</hi> now he shall then say was <hi>nothing,</hi> and

all the gains that now invite earthly souls and mean persons to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was nothing but the <hi>seeds</hi> of folly, and the <hi>harvest</hi> is pain and sorrow, and shame eternall. * But then since this horror pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon the account of so many accusers, God hath put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our power by a timely accusation of our selves in the tribunall of the court Christian to prevent all the arts of aggravation which at Dooms-day shall load foolish and undiscerning souls. He that accuses himself of his crimes here, means to forsake them, and looks upon them on all sides, and spies out his deformity, and is taught to hate them, he is instructed and prayed for, he prevents the anger of God and defeats the Devils malice, and by making <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> shame the instrument of repentance, he takes away the sting, and makes that to be his medicine which otherwise would be his death: and concerning this exercise, I shall only adde what the <hi>Patriarch of Alexandria</hi> told an old religious person in his <hi>hermitage;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving asked him what he found in that desert; he was answered, <hi>only this, Indesinenter culpare &amp; judicare meipsum;</hi> to judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn my self perpetually, that is the imployment of my solitude. The Patriarch answered, <hi>Non est alia via, There is no other way.</hi> By accusing our selves we shall make the Devils malice uselesse, and our own consciences dear, and be reconciled to the Judge by the severities of an early repentance, and then we need to fear no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

            <p>But so it is, there are two great days in which the fate of all the world is transacted. This life is mans day, in which man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> does what he please, and God holds his peace. Man destroys his Brother, and destroyes himselfe, and confounds Governments, and raises Armies, and tempts to sin, and delights in it, and drinks drunk, and forgets his sorrow, and heaps up great estates, and raises a family and a name in the Annals, and makes others fear

him, and introduces new Religions, and confounds the old, and changeth Articles as his interest requires, and all this while <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God is silent, save that he is loud and clamorous with his holy precepts, and over-rules the event; but leaves the desires of men to their owne choice, and their course of life such as they generally choose. But then, God shall have his day too; the day of the Lord shall come, in which <hi>he</hi> shall speak, and no man shall answer, he shall speak in the voyce of thunder and fearfull noyses, and man shall doe no more as he please, but must suffer as he hath deserved. When <hi>Zedekiah</hi> reigned in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and persecuted the Prophets, and destroyed the interests of Religion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and put <hi>Jeremy</hi> into the Dungeon, God held his peace; save onely that he warned him of the danger, and told him of the disorder; but it was <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s day, and he was permitted to his pleasure. But when he was led in chains to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his eyes were put out with burning Basons and horrible circles of reflected fires, then was Gods day, and his voyce was the accent of a fearfull anger, that broke him all in pieces. It will be all our cases, unlesse we hear God speak now, and doe his work, and serve his interest, and bear our selves in our just proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is, <hi>as such,</hi> the very end of whose being, and all our faculties is to serve God, and doe justice, and charities to our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Brother. For if we doe the work of God in our own day, wee shall receive an infinite mercy in the day of the Lord. But what that is, is now to be inquired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What wee have done in the body]</hi> But certainly this is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test terror of all. The thunders and the fires, the earthquakes and the trumpets, the brightnesse of holy Angels, and the horror of accursed Spirits, the voyce of the Archangel (who is the Prince of the heavenly host) and the Majesty of the Judge, in whose service all that Army stands girt with holinesse and obedience, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all those strange circumstances which have been already reckoned, and all those others which wee cannot understand, are but little praeparatories and umbrages of this fearfull circumstance. All this amazing Majesty and formidable praeparatories are for the passing of an eternall Sentence upon us according to what we have done in the body. Woe and alas! and God help us all. All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is an enemy to God, his nature is accursed, and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are depraved.

Every fox is crafty and mischievous, and if you gather a whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> herd of them there is not a good natur'd beast amongst them all; so it is with man; by nature he is <hi>the child of wrath,</hi> and by his manners he is the child of the Devill; wee call <hi>Christian,</hi> and wee dishonour our Lord, and we are Brethren, but we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and murther one another; it is a great degree of sanctity now a-days not to be so wicked as the worst of men; and wee live at the rate as if the best of men did design to themselves an easier condemnation; and as if the generality of men consider'd not concerning the degrees of death, but did beleeve that in hell no man shall perceive any ease or refreshment in being tormented <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with a slower fire. For consider what <hi>we doe in the body;</hi> 12 or 14 years passe before we choose good or bad; and of that which remaines above halfe is spent in sleep and the needs of Nature; for the other halfe it is divided as the Stag was when the beasts went a hunting, the Lyon hath five parts of sixe: The businesse of the world takes so much of our remaining portion, that Religion and the service of God have not much time left that can be spar'd; and of that which can, if we consider how much is allowed to crasty arts of cousenage, to oppression and ambition, to greedy desires, and avaritious prosecutions, to the vanities of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our youth, and the proper sins of every age, to the meer idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of man and doing nothing, to his fantastick imaginations of greatnesse, and pleasures, of great and little devices, of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent law-suites and uncharitable treatings of our Brother; it will be intolerable when we consider that we are to stand or fall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, according to what we have done in the body. Gather it all together, and set it before thy eyes; <hi>Almes</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> are the summe of all thy good. Were thy prayers made in feare and holinesse, with passion and desire? Were they not made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, weakly, and wandringly, and abated with sins in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> greatest part of thy life? Didst thou pray with the same affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and labour as thou didst purchase thy estate? Have thy alms been more then thy oppressions, and according to thy power? and by what means didst thou judge concerning it? How much of our time was spent in that? and how much of our estate was spent in this? But let us goe one step further: How many of us love our enemies? or pray for, and doe good to them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute and affront us? or overcome evill with good, or turn the face again to them that strike us, rather then be reveng'd? or suffer our selves to be spoil'd or robbed without contention and uncharitable courses? or lose our interest rather then lose our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> charity? And yet by these precepts we shall be judged. I instance but once more. Our blessed Saviour spake a hard saying: <hi>Every</hi>

These things are to be considered, for by <hi>our own words we stand or fall,</hi> that is, as in humane Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the confession of the party, and the contradiction of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or the failing in the circumstances of his story, are the confidences or presumptions of law, by which Judges give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> so shall our words be, not onely the means of declaring a secret sentence, but a certain instrument of being absolved or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. But upon these premises, we see what reason we have to fear the sentence of that day, who have sinned with our tongues so often, so continually, that if there were no other actions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48497:25"/>
to be accounted for, we have enough in this account to make us die, and yet have committed so many evill actions that if our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> words were wholly forgotten, wee have infinite reason to seare concerning the event of that horrible sentence. The effect of which consideration is this, that we set a guard before our lips, and <hi>watch over our actions with a care, equall to that fear which shall be at Doomes-day, when we are to passe our sad accounts.</hi> But I have some considerations to interpose.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But (that the sadnesse of this may a little be relieved, and our <note place="margin">1.</note> endevours be encouraged to a timely care and repentance) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that this great sentence, although it shall passe concerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>little things,</hi> yet it shall not passe by <hi>little portions,</hi> but by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall measures; not by the little errors of one day, but by the great proportions of our life; for God takes not notice of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of honest persons that alwayes endevour to avoid every sin, but in little intervening instances are surprized; but he judges us by <hi>single actions,</hi> if they are <hi>great,</hi> and of <hi>evill effect;</hi> and by <hi>little small instances,</hi> if they be <hi>habituall.</hi> No man can take care concerning every minute; and therefore concerning it Christ will not passe sentence but by the discernible portions of our time, by <hi>humane</hi> actions, by things of choice and deliberation, and by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> generall precepts of care and watchfulnesse, this sentence shall be exacted. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The sentence of that day shall be passed, not by <note place="margin">2.</note> the proportions of an Angell, but by the measures of a Man; the first follies are not unpardonable, but may bee recovered; and the second are dangerous, and the third are more fatall; but nothing is unpardonable but perseverance in evill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The last Judgement shall bee transacted by the same <note place="margin">3.</note> Principles by which we are guided here: not by strange and secret propositions, or by the fancies of men, or by the subtilties of uselesse distinctions, or evill perswasions; not by the scruples of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the credulous, or the interest of sects, nor the proverbs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, nor the uncertain definitions of them that give laws to subjects by expounding the decrees of Princes; but by the plain rules of Justice, by the ten Commandements, by the first apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of conscience, by the plain rules of Scripture, and the rules of an honest mind, and a certain Justice. So that by this restraint and limit of the finall sentence, we are secur'd we shall not fall by scruple or by ignorance, by interest or by faction, by false per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of others, or invincible prejudice of our own, but we shall stand or fall by plain and easie propositions, by chastity or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> uncleannesse, by justice or unjustice, by robbery or restitution: and of this wee have a great testimony by our Judge and Lord himselfe; <hi>Whatsoever yee shall bind in earth shall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and whatsoever yee loose shall be loosed there;</hi> that is, you shall stand or fall according to the Sermons of the Gospel, as the

Ministers of the Word are commanded to preach, so yee must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> live here, and so yee must be judged hereafter; yee must not look for that sentence by secret decrees or obscure doctrines, but by plain precepts and certain rules. But there are yet some more degrees of mercy. 4. That sentence shall passe upon us not after <note place="margin">4.</note> the measures of Nature, and possibilities, and utmost extents, but by the mercies of the Covenant; we shall be judged as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians rather then as men, that is, as persons to whom much is pardoned, and much is pityed, and many things are (not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, but consequently) indulged, and great helps are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, and many remedies supplyed, and some mercies extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> conveyed, and their hopes enlarged upon the stock of an infinite mercy, that hath no bounds but our needs, our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and our proportions to glory. 5.

            <p>It is a day of recompenses, in which all our sorrowes shall be turn'd into joyes, our persecutions into a crown, the Crosse into a Throne, poverty to the riches of God, losse, and affronts, and inconveniences, and death, into scepters, and hymnes, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, and Hallellujahs, and such great things which are fit for us to hope, but too great for us to discourse of, while we see as in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a glasse darkly and imperfectly.

Better it is to suffer here, and to stay till the day of restitution for the good and the holy portion; for it will recompense both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for the suffering and the stay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how if the portion be bad?</hi> It shall be bad to the greatest part of mankinde; that's a fearfull consideration; the greatest part of men and women shall dwell in the portion of Devils to eternall ages. So that these portions are like the Prophets figs in the vision; the good are the best that ever were, and the worst are so bad that worse cannot be imagined. For though in hell the accursed souls shall have no worse then they have deserved, and there are not there overrunning measures as there are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore that the joyes of heaven are infinitely greater joyes then the pains of hell are great pains, yet even these are a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> full measure to a full iniquity, pain above patience, sorrowes without ease, amazement without consideration, despair without the intervals of a little hope, indignation without the possession of any good, there dwels envie and confusion, disorder and sad remembrances, perpetuall woes and continuall shriekings, uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and all the evils of the soul. But if we will represent it in some orderly circumstances, we may consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That here, all the troubles of our spirits are little participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">1.</note> of a disorderly passion; A man desires earnestly, but he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not, or he envies because another hath something besides him, and he is troubled at the want of one, when at the same time he hath a hundred good things; and yet ambition and envie, impatience and confusion, covetousnesse and lust are all of them very great torments; but there these shall be in <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>abstracted beings;</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48497:26"/>
               <hi>the spirit of envie,</hi> and <hi>the spirit of sorrow;</hi> Devils, that shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict all the whole nature of the evill and pour it into the minds of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> accursed men; where it shall sit without abatement: for he that envies there, envies not for the eminence of another that sits a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above him, and excels him in some one good; but he shall envie <hi>for all;</hi> because the Saints have all, and they have none; therefore all their passions are integral, abstracted, perfect passions; and all the sorrow in the world at this time, is but a portion of sorrow; every man hath his share, and yet besides that which all sad men have, there is a great deal of sorrow which they have not, and all the Devils portion besides that; but in hell, they shall have the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whole passion of sorrow in every one, just as the whole body of the Sun is seen by every one in the same Horizon; and he that is in darknesse enjoyes it not by parts, but the whole darknesse is the portion of one as well as of another. If this consideration be not too Metaphysicall, I am sure it is very sad, and it relies upon this; that as in heaven there are some holy Spirits whose crown is <hi>all love;</hi> and some in which the brightest jewell is <hi>understanding;</hi> some are <hi>purity,</hi> and some are <hi>holinesse</hi> to the Lord: so in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of sorrow, <hi>evill</hi> and <hi>sorrow</hi> have an essence and proper being, and are set there to be suffer'd intirely by every undone man that dies there for ever. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The evils of this world are materiall and bodily; the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of a shoulder, or the straining of a joynt; the dislocation of a bone, or the extending of an artery; a bruise in the flesh, or the pinching of the skin; a hot liver, or a sickly stomach; and then the minde is troubled because its instrument is ill at ease; but all the proper troubles of this life are nothing but the effects of an uneasie body, or an abused fancy, and therefore can be no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a blow or a cousenage, then a wound or a dream; only the trouble increases as the soul works it; and if it makes reflex <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> acts and begins the evill upon its own account, then it multiplies and doubles, because the proper scene of grief is open'd, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row peeps through the corners of the soul. But in those regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and daies of sorrow when the soul shall be no more depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the body, but the perfect principle of all its actions, the actions are quick, and the perceptions brisk, the passions are extreme and the motions are spirituall; the pains are like the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of a Devill, and the groans of an evill spirit; not slow like the motions of a heavie foot, or a loaden arme, but quick as an Angels wing, active as lightning; and a grief <hi>then,</hi> is nothing like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a grief <hi>now,</hi> and the words of mans tongue which are fitted to the uses of this world, are as unfit to signifie the evils of the next, as <hi>person,</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>hand,</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> and <hi>passion</hi> are to represent the effects of the Divine attributes, actions and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence.</p>

3. The evill portions of the next world is so great, that God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> did not create or design it in the first intention of things, and production of essences; he made <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi>

            <p n="4">4. And when God did create and prepare that place, he did not at all intend it for man, it was <hi>prepared for the Divill and his</hi>

               <hi>which my Father prepared for the Devill,</hi> so some copies read it: God intended it not for man, but man would imitate the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils pride, and listen to the whispers of an evill spirit, and follow his temptations, and rebell against his Maker; and then God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so against his first design resolved to throw such persons into that place that was prepared for the Devill: for so great was the love of God to mankind, that he prepared joyes infinite and never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ceasing for man before he had created him; but he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determine him to any evill; but when he was forced to it by mans malice, he doing what God forbad him, God cast him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where he never intended him; but it was not mans portion: he designed it not at first, and at last also he invited him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and when nothing could do it, he threw man into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers portion, because he would not accept of what was designed to be his own.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The evill portion shall be <hi>continuall</hi> without intermission of evill; no dayes of rest, no nights of sleep, no ease from labour, no periods of the stroke, nor taking off the hand, no intervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> blow and blow; but a continued stroke, which neither shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the life, nor introduces a brawny patience, or the toleration of an oxe, but it is the same in every instant, and great as the first stroke of lightning; the smart is great for ever as at the first change, from the rest of the grave to the flames of that horrible burning. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> amongst some other strange opinions hath inserted this one into her publick Offices; that the perishing souls in hell may have sometimes remission and refreshment like the fits of an intermitting feaver: for so it is in the <hi>Roman Missal</hi> printed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> at <hi>Paris,</hi> 1626. in the Masse for the dead; <hi>Ut quia de ejus vitae qualitate diffidimus, &amp; si plenam veniam animaipsius obtinere non potest, saltem vel inter ipsa tormenta quae forsan patitur, refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium de abundantia miserationum tuarum sentiat:</hi> and something like this is that of <hi>Prudentius, Sunt &amp; Spiritibus saepè nocentibus,</hi>

            <p>They then thought that when the Paschall taper burn'd, the flames of hell could not burn, till the holy wax was spent: but because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this is a fancy without ground or revelation, and is against the Analogie of all those expressions of our Lord, <hi>Where the worm dyeth not, and the fire is never quenched,</hi> and divers others, it is sufficient to have noted it without further consideration; the pains of hell have no rest, no drop of water is allowed to cool the tongue, there is no advocate to plead for them, no mercy belongs to their portion, but fearfull wrath and continuall burnings.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And yet this is not the worst of it; for as it is <hi>continuall</hi> during its abode: so its abode is for ever, it is <hi>continuall</hi> and <hi>eternall.

            <p>So <hi>Prudentius</hi> eternall wormes, and unextinguished flames, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall punishment is prepared for the ever-never dying souls of wicked men. <hi>Origen</hi> is charged by the ancient Churches for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that after a long time the Devils and the accursed souls shall be restored to the Kingdome of God; and that after a long time again they shall be restored to their state; and so it was from their fall and shall be forever; and it may be that might be the meaning of <hi>Tertullians</hi> expression, of <hi>cruciatus non diuturni sed sempiterni. Epiphanius</hi> charges not the opinion upon <hi>Origen,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> yet he was free enough in his animadversion and reproof of him; but S. <hi>Austin</hi> did, and confuted the opinion in his books <hi>De civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei.</hi> However, <hi>Origen</hi> was not the first that said the pains of the damned should cease; <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> expresses it thus. <hi>Neither do I say that all the souls do dye,</hi>

               <hi>then? the souls of the godly in a better place, of the wicked in a worse, do tarry the time of Judgement; then they that are worthy shall never dye again; but those that are designed to punishment shall abide so long as God please to have them to live and to be punished:</hi> But I observe, that the primitive Doctors were very willing to believe that the mercy of God would finde out a period to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of accursed fouls; but such a period, which should be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>eternall destruction,</hi> called by the Scripture <hi>the second death:</hi> only <hi>Origen</hi> (as I observed) is charg'd by S. <hi>Austin</hi> to have said they shall return into joyes; and back again to hell by an eternall revolution. But concerning the death of wicked souls, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and its being broke into pieces with fearfull torments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed with the wrath of God, they had entertain'd some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent fancies very early in the Church, as their sentences are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by S. <hi>Hierome</hi> at the end of his Commentaries upon <hi>Isay;</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>all,</hi> so long as God please, some for ever and ever, and some not so severely; And whereas the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> generall sentence is given to all wicked persons, to all on the left hand, to go into <hi>everlasting fire:</hi> it is answered, that the fire indeed is everlasting, but not all that enters into it is everlasting; but only the Devils for whom it was prepared and others more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty criminals (according as S. <hi>John</hi> intimates) though also <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi> signifies only to the end of its proper period.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Doctrine of theirs so severe, and yet so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, there is lesse to be objected then against the supposed fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Origen:</hi> for it is a strange consideration to suppose an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> torment to those to whom it was never threatned; to those who never heard of Christ; to those that liv'd probably well, to heathens of good lives; to ignorants and untaught people; to people surprised in a single crime; to men that dye young in their naturall follies and foolish lusts; to them that fall in a sudden

gaiety and excessive joy; to all alike; to all infinite and eternall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> even to unwarned people; and that this should be inflicted by God who infinitely loves his creature, who dyed for them, who pardons easily, and pities readily, and excuses much, and delights in our being saved, and would not have us dye, and takes little things in exchange for great: it is certain that Gods mercies are infinite, and it is also certain that the matter of eternall torments cannot truly be understood; and when the School-men go about to reconcile the Divine justice to that severity, and consider why God punishes eternally a temporall sin or a state of evill, they speak variously, and uncertainly, and unsatisfyingly. But that in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we may separate the certain from the uncertain;</p>
            <p n="1">1.

For if <hi>life</hi> be reckoned a <hi>blessing,</hi> then to be destitute of all blessing is to have no life, and therefore to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> miserable is this second death, that is, <hi>death eternall.</hi>

And yet if God should deal with man hereafter more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and proportionably to his weak nature, then he does to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and as he admits him to repentance here, so in hell also to a period of his smart, even when he keeps the Angels in pain for ever; yet he will never admit him to favour, he shall be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond all the measure of humane ages, and be destroyed for ever and ever.</p>

More reasonable it is, that we despise the world and lay up for heaven, that we heap up treasures by giving almes, and make friends of unrighteous Mammon; but at no hand to enter into a state of life, that is all the way a hazard to the main inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,

               <q>Now wee know that God heareth not sinners, but if any man be a worshipper of God and doth his will, him he heareth.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know not which is the greater wonder, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> either that prayer, which is a duty so easie and facile, so ready and apted to the powers, and skill, and opportunities of every man, should have so great effects, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of such mighty blessings; or that we should be so unwilling to use so easie an instrument of procuring so much good. The first declares Gods goodnesse, but this publishes mans folly and weaknesse, who finds in himself so much difficulty to perform a condition so easie and full of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But the order of this infelicity is knotted like the foldings of a Serpent; all those parts of easinesse which invite us to doe the duty, are become like the joynts of a bulrush, not bendings, but consolidations and stiffenings; the very facility becomes its objection, and in every of its stages, wee make or finde a huge uneasiresse. At first wee doe not know what we ask, and when we doe, then we finde difficulty to bring our wils to desire it; and when that is instructed and kept in awe, it mingles interest, and confounds the purposes; and when it is forc'd to ask <hi>honestly</hi> and <hi>severely,</hi> then it <hi>wills</hi> so coldly, that God hates the prayer; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and if it desires <hi>fervently,</hi> it sometimes turns that into passion, and that passion breaks into murmurs or unquietnesse; or if that be avoyded, the indifferency cooles into death, or the fire burns violently, and is quickly spent; our desires are dull as a rock, or fugitive as lightening; either wee aske ill things earnestly, or
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48497:30"/>
good things remissely; we either court our owne danger, or are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not zealous for our reall safety; or if we be right in our matter, or earnest in our affections, and lasting in our abode, yet we misse in the manner; and either we aske for evill ends, or without religion and awefull apprehensions; or we rest in the words and signification of the prayer; and never take care to passe on to action; or else we sacrifice in the company of <hi>Corah</hi> being part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a schisme, or a rebellion in religion; or we bring unhul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed censers; our hearts send up to God an unholy smoak, a cloud from the fires of lust, and either the flames of <hi>lust</hi> or <hi>rage,</hi> of <hi>wine</hi> or <hi>revenge</hi> kindle the beast that is laid upon the altar; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or we bring swines flesh, or a dogs neck; whereas God never accepts, or delights in a prayer, unlesse it be <hi>for a holy thing, to a lawfull end, presented unto him upon the wings of Zeal and love,</hi> of <hi>religious sorrow</hi> or <hi>religious joy;</hi> by <hi>sanctified lips,</hi> and <hi>pure hands,</hi> and a <hi>sincere heart.</hi> It must be the prayer of a gracious man; and he is onely gracious before God, and acceptable, and effective in his prayer, <hi>whose life is holy,</hi> and <hi>whose prayer is holy;</hi> For both these are necessary ingredients to the constitution of a prevailing prayer; there is a holinesse peculiar to the man, and a holinesse peculiar to the prayer, that must adorn the prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it can be united to the intercession of the Holy <hi>Jesus,</hi> in which union alone our prayers can be prevailing.</p>

               <hi>God heareth not sinners:]</hi> so the blind man in the text, and confidently <hi>[this we know:]</hi> he had reason indeed for his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; it was a proverbiall saying, and every where recorded in their Scriptures, which were <hi>read in the synagogues every Salbath day.

            </p>
            <p>Which proposition let us first consider in the sense of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose which the blind man spoke it in, and then in the utmost
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48497:31"/>
extent of it, as its analogie and equall reason goes forth upon us and our necessities. The man was cured of his blindnesse, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> being examined concerning him that did it, named and gloryed in his Physician: but the spitefull Pharisees b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him give glory to God, and defie the Minister; for God indeed was good, but he wrought that cure by a wicked hand. No (says he) this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. If this man were a sinner and a false Prophet (for in that instance the accusation was intended) God would not hear his prayers, and work miracles by him in verification of a lye. <hi>A false Prophet could not work true miracles;</hi> this hath received its diminution when the case was changed; for at that time when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Christ preached, Miracles was the onely, or the great verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any new revelation; and therefore it proceeding from an Almighty God, must needs be the testimony of a Divine truth; and if it could have been brought for a lye, there could not then have been sufficient instruction given to mankind, to prevent their beleef of false Prophets, and lying doctrines. But when Christ proved his doctrine by miracles, that no enemy of his did ever doe so great before or after him; then he also told, that after him his friends should doe greater; and his enemies should do some, (but they were fewer, and very inconsiderable) and therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> could have in them no unavoydable cause of deception; because they were discovered by a Prophesie; and caution was given against them by him that did greater miracles; and yet ought to have been beleeved if he had done but one; because against him there had been no caution, but many prophesies creating such expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning him, which he verified by his great works. So that in this sense of working miracles, though it was infinitely true that the blind man said, <hi>then when he said it,</hi> yet after that the case was alter'd: and Sinners, Magicians, Astrologers, Witches, Hereticks, Simoniacks and wicked persons of other instances, have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> done miracles, and God hath heard sinners, and wrought his own works by their hands, or suffered the Devill to doe his works under their pretences; and many at the day of Judgment shall plead that they have done miracles in Christs name, and yet they shall be rejected; Christ knows them not, and their portion shall bee with dogs, and goats, and unbeleevers.</p>
            <p>There is in this case onely this difference, that they who doe miracles in opposition to Christ, doe them by the power of the Devill, to whom it is permitted to doe such things which wee think miracles; and that is all one as though they were: but the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> danger of them is none at all, but to them that will not beleeve him that did greater miracles, and prophesied of these lesse, and gave warning of their attending danger, and was confirmed to be a true teacher by voices from heaven, and by the resurrection of his body after a three days buriall: So that to these the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48497:31"/>
still remains true, <hi>God hears not sinners,</hi> God does not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> work those miracles; but concerning <hi>sinning Christians,</hi> God in this sense and towards the purposes of miracles does hear them, and hath wrought miracles by them, for they doe them <hi>in the name of Christ,</hi> and therefore Christ said, <hi>cannot easily speak ill of him;</hi> and although they either prevaricate in their lives, or in superinduced doctrines, yet because the miracles are a verification of the Religion, not of the opinion, of the power or truth of Christ, not of the veracity of the man, God hath heard such persons many times whom men have long since, and to this day call <hi>Hereticks,</hi> such were the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Arrians;</hi> For to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Heathens they could onely prove their Religion by which they stood distinguished from them; but we find not that they wrought miracles among the Christians, or to verifie their superstructures and private opinions. But besides this yet, we may also by such means arrest the forwardnesse of our judgments and condemnations of persons disagreeing in their opinions from us; for those persons whose faith God confirmed by miracles was an intire faith, and although they might have false opinions, or mistaken explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of true opinions, either inartificiall or misunderstood, yet we have reason to beleeve their faith to be intire, for that which God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> would have the Heathen to beleeve, and to that purpose prov'd it by a miracle, himselfe intended to accept first to a holy life, and then to glory. The false opinion should burn, and themselves escape. One thing more is here very considerable, that in this very instance of working miracles, God was so very carefull not to hear sinners or permit sinners, till he had prevented all dangers to good and innocent persons, that the case of Christ and his Apostles working miracles was so clearly separated and remarked by the finger of God, and distinguished from the impostures and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all the many Antichrists that appeared in <hi>Palestine, Cyprus,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>Crete, Syria,</hi> and the voicinage, that there were but very few Christians that with hearty perswasions fell away from Christ, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, said <hi>Galen,</hi> It is not easie to teach anew him that hath been taught by Christ: And St. <hi>Austin</hi> tels a story of an unbeleeving man, that being troubled that his wife was a Christian, went to the Oracle to aske by what means hee should alter her perswasion; but he was answered, it could never be done, he might as well imprint characters upon the face of a torrent or a rapid river, or himself fly in the air, as alter the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of a hearty and an honest Christian; I would to God it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> were so now in all instances, and that it were so hard to draw men from the severities of a holy life, as of old they could be cousened, disputed, or forced out of their faith. Some men are vexed with hypocrisie, and then their hypocrisie was punished with infidelity and a wretchlesse spirit. <hi>Demas,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48497:32"/>
and <hi>Ecebolius,</hi> and the lapsed Confessors are instances of humane craft <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or humane weaknesse; but they are scarce a number that are remarked in Ancient story to have fallen from Christianity by direct persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the efficacy of abusing arguments and discourses. The reason of it is the truth in the text; God did so avoyd hearing sinners in this affair, that he never permitted them to doe any miracles so as to doe any mischief to the souls of good men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said, the enemies of Christ came <hi>in the power of signes and wonders able to deceive (if it were possible) even the very elect;</hi> but <hi>that was not possible;</hi> without their faults it could not be; the elect were sufficiently strengthened, and the evidence of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Christs being heard of God, and that none of his enemies were heard of God to any dangerous effect, was so great, that if any Christian had apostatized or fallen away by direct perswasion, it was like the sin of a falling Angell, of so direct a malice that he never could repent, and God never would pardon him, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> twice remarks in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The result of this discourse is the first sense and explication of the words, <hi>God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not sinners, viz.</hi> in that in which they are sinners: a sinner in his manners may be heard in his prayer in order to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his faith, but if he be a sinner in his faith God hears <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him not at all in that wherein he sins; for God is truth and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not confirm a lye, and when ever he permitted the Devill to doe it, he secur'd the interest of his Elect, that is, of all that beleeve in him and love him, <hi>lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That which yet concerns us more neerly is, that <hi>God heareth not sinners,</hi> that is, if wee be not good men, our prayers will doe us no good: wee shall be in the condition of them that never pray at all. The prayers of a wicked man are like the breath of corrupted lungs, God turns away from such unwholsome brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But that I may reduce this necessary doctrine to a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; I shall consider that there are some persons whose prayers are sins; and some others whose prayers are ineffectuall: some are such who doe not pray lawfully; they sin when they pray while they remain in that state and evill condition; others are such who doe not obtain what they pray for, and yet their prayer is not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect sin: the prayer of the first is a direct abomination, the prayer of the second is hindred; the first is corrupted by a direct state of sin, the latter by some intervening imperfection and unhandsome circumstance of action; and in proportion to these, it is required, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 1. that he be in a state and possibility of acceptation; and 2. that the prayer it selfe be in a proper disposition. 1. Therefore wee shall consider what are those conditions which are required in every person that prays, the want of which makes the prayer to be a sin? 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. What are the conditions of a good mans prayer, the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48497:32"/>
absence of which makes that even his prayer returns empty? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. What degrees and circumstances of piety are required to make a man fit to be an intercessor for others, both with holinesse in himself and effect to them he prays for? And 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. as an appendix to these considerations, I shall adde the proper <hi>indices</hi> and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations by which we may make a judgment whether God hath heard our prayers or no.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whosoever prays to God while he is in a state, or in the affection to sin, his prayer is an abomination to God. This was a truth so beleeved by all Nations of the world, that in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions they ever appointed baptismes and ceremoniall expiations to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> cleanse the persons before they presented themselves in their holy offices. <hi>Deorum Templa cum adire disponitis ab, omni vos labe puros, lautos, castissimósque praestatis,</hi> said <hi>Arnobius</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles: When you addresse your selves to the Temples of your Gods, you keep your selves chast, and clean, and spotlesse.</hi> They washed their hands, and wore white garments, they refused to touch a dead boyd, they avoyded a spot upon their clothes as they avoyded a wound upon their head, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That was the religious ground they went upon; an impure thing ought not to touch that which is holy, much lesse to approach the Prince of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> purities; and this was the sense of the old world in their lustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their preparatory baptismes; they wash'd their hands to signifie that they should <hi>cleanse them from all iniquity,</hi> and keep them pure from bloud and rapine; they washed their garments, but that intended they should <hi>not be spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the flesh;</hi> and their follies consisted in this, that they did not looke to the bottome of their lavatories; they did not see through the vail of their ceremonies. <hi>Flagitiis omnibus inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati veniunt ad precandum, &amp; se piè sacrificasse opinantur, si cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem laverint, tanquam libidines intra pectus inclusas ulla amnis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luat,</hi>

               <q>This is the true purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not that which most men doe, superstitiously cleansing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their hands and washing when they go to prayers, but cleansing the soul from all impiety, and leaving every affection to sin; then they come pure to God:</q> And this is it which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle also signifies, having translated the Gentile and Jewish cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony into the spirituality of the Gospell, <hi>I will therefore that men</hi>

               </gap>, so it is in the <hi>Greek, holy hands:</hi> That's the purity that God looks for upon them that lift up their hands to him in prayer: and this very thing is founded upon the Naturall constitution of things, and their essentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to each other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is an act of profanation for any unholy person to handle holy things, and holy offices. For if God was ever carefull to put all holy things into cancels, and immure them with acts and laws and cautions of separation; and the very sanctisication of them was nothing else but the solemn separating them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon usages, that himself might bee distinguished from men by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> actions of propriety; it is naturally certain, he that would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenc'd from common things, would be infinitely divided from things that are wicked: If things that are <hi>lawfull</hi> may yet be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy</hi> in this sense; much more are unlawfull things most unholy in all senses. If God will not admit of that which is <hi>beside Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> he will lesse endure that which is <hi>against Religion.</hi> And therefore if a common man must not serve at the altar, how shall he abide a wicked man to stand there? No: he will not indure him, but he will cast him and his prayer into the separation of an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> infinite and eternall distance. <hi>Sic profanatis sacris peritura Troja perdidit primùm Deos,</hi> So <hi>Troy</hi> entred into ruine when their prayers became unholy, and they profan'd the rites of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A wicked person while he remains in that condition is not the naturall object of pity: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, said <hi>Zeno; Mercy is a sorrow or a trouble at that misery which falls upon a person which deserv'd it not.</hi> And so <hi>Aristotle</hi> desines it, it is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>When we see the person deserves a better fortune,</hi> or is dispos'd to a fairer intreaty, then wee naturally pity him, and <hi>Sinon</hi> pleaded for pity to the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> saying,</p>
            <q>—Miserere animi non digna serentis.</q>
            <p>For who pityeth the tears of a base man who hath treacherously murthered his friend? or who will lend a friendly sigh when he sees a traitor to his country passe forth through the execrable gates of cities? and when any circumstance of basenesse, that is, any thing that takes off the excuse of infirmity, does accompany a sin (such as are <hi>ingratitude, perjury, perseverance, delight, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>treachery)</hi> then every man scorns the <hi>criminall,</hi> and God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and rejoyces in, and laughs at the calamity of such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. When <hi>Vitellius</hi> with his hands bound behind him, his Imperiall robe rent, and with a dejected countenance and an ill name was led to execution, every man cursed him, but no man
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48497:33"/>
wept. <hi>Deformitas exitus misericordiam abstulerat,</hi> saith <hi>Tacitus,</hi> The filthinesse of his life and death took away pity. So it is with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> us in our prayers; while we love our sin we must nurse all its children; and when we roare in our lustfull beds, and groane with the whips of an exterminating Angell, chastising those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as <hi>Aretas</hi> calls them) the lusts of the lower belly, <hi>wantonnesse,</hi> and its mother <hi>intemperance,</hi> we feel the price of our sin, that which God foretold to be their issues, that which he threatned us withall, and that which is the naturall consequent, and its certaine expectation, that which we delighted in, and chose, even then when we refused God, and threw away felicity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and hated vertue. For punishment is but the latter part of sin; it is not a new thing and distinct from it: or if we will kisse the <hi>Hyaena,</hi> or clip the <hi>Lamia</hi> about the neck, we have as certainly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the taile, and its venemous embraces, as the face and lip. Every man that sins against God, and loves it, or, which is all one, continues in it, for by interpretation that is love, hath all the circumstances of unworthinesse towards God; hee is unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and a breaker of his vowes, and a despiser of his mercies, and impudent against his judgments, he is false to his profession, false to his faith, hee is an unfriendly person, and useth him bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously who hath treated him with an affection not lesse then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> infinite; and if any man does half so much evill, and so unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely to a man, we stone him with stones and curses, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and an unrelenting scorn. And how then shall such a person hope that God should pity him? for God better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands, and deeper resents, and more essentially hates, and more severely exacts the circumstances and degrees of basenesse then we can doe; and therefore proportionably scorns the person and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides the calamity. Is not unthankfulnesse to God a greater base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and unworthinesse then unthanfulnesse to our Patron? And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is not hee as sensible of it and more then wee? These things are more then words; and therefore if <hi>no man</hi> pities a base person, let us remember that <hi>no man</hi> is so base in any thing as in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome demeanour towards God. Doe wee not professe our selves his servants, and yet serve the Devill? Doe we not live upon Gods provision, and yet stand or work at the command of lust, or avarice, humane regards and little interests of the world? We call him <hi>Father</hi> when we desire our portion, and yet spend it in the society of all his enemies. In short: Let our actions to God and their circumstances be supposed to be done towards men, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we should scorn our selves; and how then can we expect God should not scorne us, and reject our prayer when we have done all the dishonour to him, and with all the unhandsomnesse in the world? Take heed lest we fall into a condition of evill, in which it shall be said, <hi>You may thank your selves;</hi> and be infinitely afraid lest at
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48497:34"/>
the same time we be in a condition of person in which God will upbraid our unworthinesse, and scorne our persons, and rejoyce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in our calamity. The first is intolerable, the second is irremedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; the first proclaims our folly, and the second declares Gods finall justice; in the first there is no comfort, in the latter there is no remedy; <hi>that</hi> therefore makes us miserable, and <hi>this</hi> renders us desperate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This great truth is further manifested by the necessary and convenient appendages of prayer requir'd, or advis'd, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in holy Scripture. For why is <hi>Fasting</hi> prescribed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with prayer? For neither if we eat are we the better, neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if we eat not are we the worse; and God does not delight in that service, the first, second, and third part of which is nothing but pain and self-affliction. But therefore fasting is usefull with prayer, because it is a penall duty, and an action of repentance; for then onely God hears sinners, when they enter first into the gates of repentance, and proceed in all the regions of sorrow, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse; and therefore we are commanded to fast, that we may pray with more spirituality, and with repentance, that is, without the loads of meat, and without the loads of sin. Of the same consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration it is that <hi>almes</hi> are prescribed, together with prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it is a part of that charity without which our soules are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to all that which ought to be equally valued with our owne lives. But besides this, we may easily observe what speciall unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies there are, which besides the generall malignity and demerit, are speciall <hi>deleteries</hi> and hinderances to our prayers, by irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the person of him that prays.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first is unmercyfulnesse. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, said one in <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> and they were well joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together. He that takes Mercy from a Man is like him that takes an Altar from the Temple; the Temple is of no use without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> an Altar, and the Man cannot pray without mercy; and there are infinite of prayers sent forth by men which God never attends to, but as to so many sins; because the men live in a course of rapine, or tyranny, or oppression, or uncharitablenesse, or something that is most contrary to God, because it is unmercifull. Remember, that God sometimes puts thee into some images of his own relation. We beg of God for mercy, and our Brother begs of us for pity: and therefore let us deal equally with God and all the world. I see my selfe fall by a too frequent infirmity, and still I beg for pardon, and hope for pity; thy brother that offends thee, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he hopes so too, and would fain have the same measure, and would be as glad thou wouldst pardon him, as thou wouldest rejoyce in thy own forgivenesse. I am troubled when God rejects my prayer, or in stead of hearing my petition, sends a judgement: Is not thy Tenant, or thy Servant, or thy Client so to thee? does
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48497:34"/>
not he tremble at thy frown, and is of an uncertaine soule till thou speakest kindly unto him, and observes thy lookes as hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> watches the colour of the bean coming from thy box of Sentence, life or death depending on it? when he begs of thee for mercy, his passion is greater, his necessities more pungent, his apprehension more brisk, and sensitive, his case dressed with the circumstances of pity, and thou thy selfe canst better feel his condition then thou doest usually perceive the earnestnesse of thy own prayers to God; and if thou regardest not thy brother whom thou seest, whose case thou feelest, whose circumstances can afflict thee, whose passion is dressed to thy fancy, and proportioned to thy capacity, how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> shall God regard thy distant prayer, or be melted with thy cold desire, or softned with thy dry story, or moved by thy unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting soul? If I be sad, I seek for comfort, and goe to God and to the ministry of his creatures for it; and is it not just in God to stop his own fountaines, and seal the cisterns and little emanations of the creatures from thee, who shuttest thy hand, and shuttest thy eye, and twistest thy bowells against thy brother, who would as fain be comforted as thou? It is a strange <hi>Iliacall passion</hi> that so hardens a mans bowells, that nothing proceeds from him but the name of his own disease, a <hi>Miserere mei Deus,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a prayer to God for pity upon him that will not shew pity to others. We are troubled when God through severity breaks our bones, and hardens his face against us; but we think our poor brother is made of iron, and not of flesh and bloud, as we are. God hath bound mercy upon us by the iron bands of necessity; and though Gods mercy is the measure of his justice, yet justice is the measure of our mercy, and as we doe to others it shall be done to us, even in the matter of pardon and of bounty, of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse and remission, of bearing each others burdens, and faire interpretation; <hi>Forgive us our trespasses as wee forgive them that</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>trespasse against us,</hi> so we pray. The finall sentence in this affair is recorded by St. <hi>James, Hee that shews no mercy shall have</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 13.</note> 
               <hi>justice with out mercy:</hi> as thy poor brother hath groan'd under thy cruelty and ungentle nature without remedy, so shalt thou before the throne of God; thou shalt pray, and plead, and call, and cry, and beg again, and in the midst of thy despairing noyses be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the regions of sorrow, which never did, and never shall feel a mercy. <hi>God never can heare the prayers of an unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>uncleannesse</hi> is a direct enemy to the <hi>Praying man,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and an obstruction to his prayers; for this is not onely a propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but a direct sacriledge; it defiles a Temple to the ground; it takes from a man all affection to spirituall things, and mingles his very soul with the things of the world; it makes his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing low, and his reasonings cheap and foolish, and it destroys
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48497:35"/>
his confidence, and all his manly hopes; it makes his spirit light, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> effeminate, and fantastick, and dissolves his attention, and makes his mind so to disaffect all the objects of his desires, that when he prays he is as uneasy as an impaled person, or a condemned criminall upon the hook or wheel; and it hath in it this evill quality, that a lustfull person cannot pray heartily against his sin; he cannot desire his cure, for his will is contradictory to his Collect, and he would not that God should hear the words of his prayer, which he poor man never intended. For no crime so seises upon the will as that; some sins steale an affection, or obey a temptation, or secure an interest, or work by the way of understanding, but lust seises directly upon the will, for the Devil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> knows well that the lusts of the body are soon cured; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easynesse that dwels there is a disease very tolerable, and every degree of patience can passe under it. But therefore the Devill seises upon the will, and that's it that makes adulteries and all the species of uncleannesse; and lust growes so hard a cure, because the formality of it is, that it will not be cured; the will loves it, and so long as it does, God cannot love the Man; for God is the Prince of purities, and the Son of God is the King of Virgins, and the holy Spirit is all love, and that is all purity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and all spirituality: And therefore the prayer of an Adulterer, or an uncleane person, is like the sacrifices to <hi>Moloch,</hi> or the rites of <hi>Flora,</hi> ubi <hi>Cato spectator esse non potuit,</hi> a good man will not endure them, much lesse will God entertaine such reekings of the Dead sea and clouds of <hi>Sodome.</hi> For so an impure vapor begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the slime of the earth, by the feavers and adulterous heats of an intemperate Summer sun, striving by the ladder of a mountaine to climbe up to heaven, and rolling into various figures by an uneasy, unfixed revolution, and stop'd at the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the aire, being thrown from his pride and attempt of passing towards the seat of the stars, turnes into an unwholsome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> flame, and like the breath of hell is confin'd into a prison of darknesse, and a cloud, till it breaks into diseases, plagues and mildews, stink and blastings: so is the prayer of an unchast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it strives to climbe the battlements of heaven, but because it is a flame of sulphur, salt and <hi>bitumen,</hi> and was kindled in the dishonorable regions below, deriv'd from hell, and contrary to God, it cannot passe forth to the element of love, but ends in barrennesse and murmur, fantastick expectations, and trifling imaginative confidences, and they at last end in sorrows and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> * Every state of sin is against the possibility of a mans being accepted; but these have a proper venome against the graciousnesse of the person, and the power of the prayer. God can never accept an unholy prayer, and a wicked man can never send forth any other; the waters passe thorough impure aquaeducts
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48497:35"/>
and channels of brimstone, and therefore may end <hi>in brimstone</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>and fire,</hi> but never in forgivenesse, and the blessings of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall charity.</p>
            <p>Henceforth therefore, never any more wonder that men pray so seldome; there are few that feel the relish, and are enticed with the deliciousnesse, and refreshed with the comforts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed with the sanctity, and acquainted with the secrets of a holy prayer: But cease also to wonder, that of those few that say many prayers, so few find any return of any at all. To make up a good and a lawfull prayer there must be charity, with all its daughters, <hi>almes, forgivenesse,</hi> not judging uncharitably; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there must be purity of spirit, that is, purity of intention; and there must be purity of the body and soule, that is, the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of chastity; and there must be no vice remaining, no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to sin: for he that brings his body to God, and hath left his will in the power of any sin, offers to God the calves of his lips, but not a whole burnt-offering; a lame oblation, but not a <hi>reasonable sacrifice;</hi> and therefore their portion shall be amongst them whose prayers were never recorded in the book of life, whose tears God never put into his bottle, whose desires shall remaine ineffectuall to eternall ages. Take heed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> you doe not lose your prayers; <hi>for by them you hope to have eternall life;</hi> and let any of you whose conscience is most religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and tender, consider what condition that man is in, that hath not said his prayers in thirty or forty years together; and that is the true state of him who hath lived so long in the course of an unsanctified life; in all that while he never said one prayer that did him any good; but they ought to be reckoned to him upon the account of his sins. Hee that is in the <hi>affection,</hi> or in the <hi>habit,</hi> or in the <hi>state</hi> of any one sin whatsoever, is at such distance <hi>from</hi> and contrariety <hi>to</hi> God, that he provokes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God to anger in every prayer hee makes: And then adde but this consideration; that prayer is the great summe of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is the <hi>effect,</hi> and the <hi>exercise,</hi> and the <hi>beginning,</hi> and the <hi>promoter of all</hi> graces, and the <hi>consummation</hi> and <hi>perfection of many;</hi> and all those persons who pretend towards heaven, and yet are not experienced in the secrets of Religion, they reckon their piety, and account their hopes, onely upon the stock of a few prayers; it may be they pray twice every day, it may be thrice, and blessed be God for it; so farre is very well; but if it shall be remembred and considered, that this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> course of piety is so farre from warranting any one course of sin, that any one habituall and cherished sin destroyes the effect of all that piety, wee shall see there is reason to account this to be one of those great arguments with which God hath so bound the duty of holy living upon us, that without a holy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48497:36"/>
life we cannot in any sense be happy, or have the effect of one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> prayer. But if we be <hi>returning</hi> and <hi>repenting sinners,</hi> God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to hear, because he delights to save us:</p>

For every sort of man hath some religion or other, by the measures of which they proportion their lives and their prayers; Now as the holy Spirit of God teaching us to pray, makes us like himself in order to a holy and an effective prayer; and no man prayes well, but he that prays by the Spirit of God, <hi>the Spirit of holinesse,</hi> and he that prayes with the Spirit must be made like to the Spirit, he is first sanctified and made holy, and then made fervent, and then his prayer ascends beyond the cloud; first he is renewed in the spirit of his minde, and then he is inflamed with holy fires, and guided by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a bright starre; first purified and then lightned, then burning and shining: so is every man in every of his prayers.

Since therefore no prayer can be good but that which is taught by the Spirit of grace, none holy but the man whom Gods Spirit hath sanctified, and therefore none heard to any purposes of blessing which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost does not make for us (for he makes intercession for the Saints, the Spirit of Christ is the <hi>praecentor</hi> or the <hi>rector chori</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Master of the Quire) it followes that all other prayers being made with an evill Spirit must have an evill portion; and though the Devils by their Oracles have given some answers, and by their significations have foretold some future contingencies, and in their government and subordinate rule have assisted some armies, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered some treasures, and prevented some snares of chance, and accidents of men, yet no man that reckons by the measures of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or religion, reckons witches and conjurors amongst blessed and prosperous persons: these and all other evill persons have an evill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by the measures of which their desires begin and proceed on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to issue; but this successe of theirs neither comes from God, nor brings felicity: but if it comes from God, <hi>it is anger,</hi> if it descends upon good men, it <hi>is a curse,</hi> if upon evill men, it is <hi>a sin,</hi> and then it is a present curse, and leads on to an eternall infelicity. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports that the <hi>Tyrians</hi> tyed their gods with chains, because certain persons did dream that <hi>Apollo</hi> said he would leave their City, and go to the party of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who then besieged the town: and <hi>Apollodorus</hi> tels of some that tied the image of <hi>Saturne</hi> with bands of wooll upon his feet. So are some Christians; they think God is tyed to their sect, and bound to be of their side and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of their opinion; and they think he can never go to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies party so long as they charme him with certain formes of words or disguises of their own; and then all the successe they have, and all the evils that are prosperous, all the mischiefs they do, and all the ambitious designs that do succeed, they reckon upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their prayers; and well they may; for their prayers are sins, and their desires are evill, they wish mischief, and they act ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and they enjoy their sin: and if this be a blessing or a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, themselves shall then judge, and all the world shall perceive, when the accounts of all the world are truly stated; then when prosperity shall be called to accounts, and adversity shall receive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> its comforts, when vertue shall have a crown, and the satisfaction of all sinfull desires shall be recompensed with an intolerable sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and the despair of a perishing soul. <hi>Nero</hi>'s <hi>Mother</hi> prayed pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately that her son might be Emperor; and many persons of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48497:37"/>
whom S. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks, <hi>pray to spend upon their lusts,</hi> and they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> heard too: some were not; and very many are: and some that sight against a just possessor of a country pray that their wars may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous, and sometimes they have been heard too: and <hi>Julian the Apostate</hi> prayed, and sacrificed, and inquired of <hi>Daemons,</hi> and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mans flesh, and operated with secret rites, and all that he might craftily and powerfully oppose the religion of Christ, and he was heard too, and did mischief beyond the malice and effect of his predecessors, that did swim in Christian bloud: but when we sum up the accounts at the foot of their lives, or so soon as the thing was understood, and finde that the effect of <hi>Agrippina</hi>'s prayer was, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that her son murdered her; and of those lustfull petitioners, in St. <hi>Iames,</hi> that they were given over to the tyranny and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their passions, and baser appetites; and the effect of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate's prayer was, that he liv'd and died a professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Christ; and the effect of the prayers of usurpers is, that they do mischief, and reap curses, and undoe mankinde, and provoke God, and live hated, and die miserable, and shall possesse the fruit of their sin to eternall ages; these will be no objections to the truth of the former discourse, but greater instances, that if by <hi>hearing our prayers</hi> we mean, or intend a <hi>blessing,</hi> we must also by <hi>making prayers</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> mean, that <hi>the man</hi> first <hi>be holy</hi> and his <hi>desires just</hi> and <hi>charitable,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be admitted to the throne of grace, or converse with God by the entercourses of a prosperous prayer.</p>
            <p>That's the first generall. 2. Many times good men pray, and their prayer is not a sin, but yet it returns empty; because although the man be, yet the prayer is not in proper disposition; and here I am to account to you concerning the collaterall and accidentall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances of the prayer of a good man.</p>
            <p>The first thing that hinders the prayers of a good man from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining its effect is a violent anger, a violent storm in the spirit of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him that prayes. For anger sets the house on fire, and all the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are busie upon trouble, and intend propulsion, defence, displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or revenge; it is a short madnesse, and an eternall enemy to to discourse, and sober counsels, and fair conversation; it intends its own object with all the earnestnesse of perception, or activity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, and a quicker motion of a too warm and distempered bloud; it is a feaver in the heart, and a calenture in the head, and a fire in the face, and a sword in the hand, and a fury all over; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can never suffer a man to be in a disposition to pray. For prayer is an action and a state of entercourse, and desire, exactly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> contrary to this character of anger. Prayer is an action of likenesse to the holy Ghost, the Spirit of gentlenesse and dove-like simplicity; an imitation of the holy Jesus, whose Spirit is meek up to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the biggest example, and a conformity to God whose an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is alwaies just, and marches slowly, and is without transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48497:38"/>
and often hindred, and never hasty, and is full of mercy; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is the peace of our spirit, the stilnesse of our thoughts, the evennesse of recollection, the seat of meditation, the rest of our cares, and the calme of our tempest; prayer is the issue of a quiet minde, of untroubled thoughts, it is the daughter of charity, and the sister of meeknesse; and he that prayes to God with an angry, that is, with a troubled and discomposed spirit, is like him that retires into a battle to meditate, and sets up his closet in the out quarters of an army, and chooses a frontier garrison to be wise in. Anger is a perfect alienation of the minde from prayer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is contrary to that attention which presents our prayers in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> right line to God. For so have I seen a lark rising from his bed of grasse and soaring upwards singing as he rises, and hopes to get to heaven, and climbe above the clouds; but the poor bird was beaten back with the loud sighings of an eastern winde, and his motion made irregular and unconstant, descending more at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry breath of the tempest, then it could recover by the libration and frequent weighing of his wings; till the little creature was forc'd to sit down and pant, and stay till the storm was over, and then it made a prosperous slight, and did rise and sing as if it had learned musick and motion from an Angell as he passed sometimes through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the aire about his ministeries here below: so is the prayers of a good man; when his affairs have required businesse, and his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was matter of discipline, and his discipline was to passe upon a sinning person, or had a design of charity, his duty met with the infirmities of a man, and anger was its instrument, and the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment became stronger then the prime agent, and raised a tempest, and overrul'd the man; and then his prayer was broken, and his thoughts were troubled, and his words went up towards a cloud, and his thoughts pull'd them back again, and made them without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and the good man sighs for his infirmity, but must be content to lose that prayer, and he must recover it when his anger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is removed and his spirit is becalmed, made even as the brow of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and smooth like the heart of God; and then it ascends to heaven upon the wings of the holy dove, and dwels with God till it returnes like the usefull Bee, loaden with a blessing and the dew of heaven.</p>
            <p>But besides this; anger is a combination of many other things every one of which is an enemy to prayer; it is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, so it is in the severall definitions of it, and in its naturall constitution. It hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in it the trouble of <hi>sorrow,</hi> and the heats of <hi>lust,</hi> and the disease of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> and the boylings of a <hi>feaver,</hi> and the rashnesse of <hi>praecipitancy,</hi> and the disturbance of <hi>persecution;</hi> and therefore is a certain effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive enemy against prayer which ought to be a spirituall joy, and an act of mortification; and to have in it no hears but of charity
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48497:38"/>
and zeal; and they are to be guided by prudence and consideration, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and allayed with the deliciousnesse of mercy, and the serenity of a meek and a quiet spirit; and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave caution, that <hi>the sun should not go down upon our anger,</hi> meaning, <hi>that it should not stay upon us till evening prayer;</hi> for it would hinder our evening sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; but the stopping of the first egressions of anger, is a certain artifice of the Spirit of God to prevent unmercifulnesse, which turns not only our desires into vanity, but our prayers into sin; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Elijah</hi>'s anger, though it was also <hi>zeal,</hi> had so discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his spirit when the two Kings came to inquire of the Lord, that though he was a good man and a Prophet, yet he could not pray, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he <hi>could not inquire of the Lord,</hi> till by rest and musick he had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered himself into the evennesse of a dispassionate and recollected minde; therefore let your prayers be without wrath. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for God by many significations hath taught us, that when men go to the altars to pray, or to give thanks, they must bring no sin, or violent passion along with them to the sacrifice, said <hi>Philo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Indifferency</hi> and <hi>easinesse</hi> of desire is a great enemy to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of a good mans prayer; When <hi>Plato</hi> gave <hi>Diogenes</hi> a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vessell of Wine who ask'd but a little, and a few Carrawaies, the <hi>Cynic</hi> thank'd him with his rude expression; <hi>Cum interrogaris quot sint duo &amp; duo, respondes viginti; ita non secundum ea quae rogaris das, nec ad ea quae interrogaris respondes:</hi> 
               <q>Thou neither answerest to the question thou art asked, nor givest according as thou art desired; but being inquired of, how many are two and two, thou answerest twenty.</q> So it is with God and us in the intercourse of our prayers: we pray for health, and he gives it us, it may be, a sicknesse that carries us to eternall life; we pray for necessary support for our persons and families, and he gives us more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we need; we beg for a removall of a present sadnesse, and he gives us that which makes us able to bear twenty sadnesses, a cheerfull spirit, a peacefull conscience, and a joy in God, as an antepast of eternall rejoycings in the Kingdome of God; But then although God doth very frequently give us beyond the matter of our desires, yet he does not so often give us great things beyond the spirit of our desires, beyond the quicknesse, vivacity, and fervor of our minds; for there is but one thing in the world that God hates besides sin, that is, <hi>indifferency</hi> and <hi>lukewarmnesse;</hi> which although it hath not in <note place="margin">See 2. Sermon of lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and zeal.</note> it the direct nature of sin, yet it hath this testimony from God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that it is loathsome and abominable, and excepting this thing alone, God never said so of any thing in the New Testament, but what was a direct breach of a commandement. The reason of it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>lukewarmnesse</hi> or an <hi>indifferent spirit</hi> is an undervaluing of God and of Religion, it is a separation of reason from affections,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48497:39"/>
and a perfect conviction of the understanding to the goodnesse of a duty, but a refusing to follow what we understand. For he that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is <hi>lukewarm</hi> alwaies understands the better way, and seldome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues it; he hath so much reason as is sufficient, but he will not obey it; his will does not follow the dictate of his understanding, and therefore it is unnaturall. It is like the phantastick fires of the night, where there is <hi>light and no heat,</hi> and therefore may passe on to the reall fires of hell, where there is <hi>heat and no light;</hi> and therefore although <hi>an act of lukewarmnesse</hi> is only an undecency, and no sin; yet <hi>a state of lukewarmnesse</hi> is criminall, and sinfull state of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and undecency; an <hi>act of indifferency</hi> hinders <hi>a single prayer</hi> from being accepted; but <hi>a state</hi> of it makes <hi>the person ungracious</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and despised in the Court of heaven: and therefore S. <hi>Iames</hi> in his accounts concerning an effective prayer, not only requires that he be a just man who prayes, but his prayer must be <hi>fervent;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>an effectuall fervent prayer,</hi> so our English reads it; it must be an intent, zealous, busie, operative prayer; for consider what a huge undeceney it is, that a man should speak to God for a thing that he values not; or that he should not value a thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he cannot be happy; or that he should spend his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon a trifle; and if it be not a trifle, that he should <hi>not spend</hi> his affections upon it. If our prayers be for temporall things, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> shall not need to stirre up your affections to be passionate for their purchase; we desire them greedily, we run after them intemperately, we are kept from them with huge impatience, we are delayed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite regret, we preferre them before our duty, we aske them unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, we receive them with our own prejudice, and we care not, we choose them to our hurt and hinderance, and yet delight in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase; and when we do pray for them, we can hardly bring our selves to it, to submit to Gods will, but will have them (if we can) whether he be pleased or no; like the Parasite in the Comedy, <hi>Qui comedit quod fuit &amp; quod non fuit,</hi> he eat all and more then all, what was set <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> before him, and what was kept from him. But then for spirituall things, for the interest of our souls, and the affairs of the Kingdome, we pray to God with just such a zeal as a man begs of the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to cut him of the stone; or a condemned man desires his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner quickly to put him out of his pain, by taking away his life; when things are come to that passe, it must be done, but God knows with what little complacency and desire, the man makes his request: And yet the things of religion and the spirit, are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things that ought to be desired vehemently, and pursued passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, because God hath set such a value upon them that they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the effects of his greatest loving kindnesse; they are the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Christs bloud, and the effect of his continuall intercession, the fruits of his bloudy sacrifice, and the gifts of his healing and saving mercy, the graces of Gods Spirit, and the only instruments
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48497:39"/>
of felicity; and if we can have fondnesses for things indifferent, or dangerous, our prayers upbraid our spirits when we beg coldly and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> tamely for those things for which we ought to dye, which are more precious then the globes of Kings, and weightier then Imperiall Scepters, richer then the spoils of the Sea, or the treasures of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> hils.</p>
            <p>He that is cold and tame in his prayers, hath not tasted of the deliciousnesse of Religion, and the goodnesse of God; he is a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the secrets of the Kingdome, and therefore he does not know what it is either to have hunger or satiety; and therefore neither are they hungry for God, nor satisfied with the world, but remain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> stupid and inapprehensive, without resolution and determination, never choosing clearly, nor pursuing earnestly; and therefore never enter into possession, but alwaies stand at the gate of wearinesse, unnecessary caution, and perpetuall irresolution. But so it is too often in our prayers; we come to God because it is civill so to do, and a generall custome, but neither drawn thither by love, nor pinch'd by spirituall necessities, and pungent apprehensions; we say so many prayers because we are resolved so to do, and we passe through them sometimes with a little attention, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with none at all, and can we think that the grace of Chastity can be obtain'd at such a purchase, that grace that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hath cost more labours then all the persecutions of faith, and all the disputes of hope, and all the expence of charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, amounts to? Can we expect that our sinnes should be washed by a lazie prayer? Can an indifferent prayer quench the flames of hell, or rescue us from an eternall sorrow? Is lust so soon overcome, that the very naming it can master it? Is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill so slight and easie an enemy, that he will fly away from us at the first word, spoken without power, and without vehemence? Read and attend to the accents of the prayers of Saints. <hi>I cryed</hi>

               <q>Being destitute of all help I threw my self down at the feet of Jesus; I water'd his feet with tears, and wiped them with my hair, and mortified the lust of my flesh with the abstinence and hungry diet of many weeks; I remember that in my crying to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God, I did frequently joyn the night and the day, and never did intermit to call, nor cease from beating my brest, till the mercy of the Lord brought to me peace and freedome from temptation.

For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayer we make is considered by God, and recorded in heaven; but cold prayers are not put into the account in order to effect and acceptation; but are laid aside like the buds of roses which a cold wind hath nip'd into death, and the discoloured <hi>tawny face of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian slave:</hi> and when in order to your hopes of obtaining a great blessing, you reckon up your prayers with which you have soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> your suit in the court of heaven, you must reckon, not by the number of the collects, but by your sighs and passions, by the vehemence of your desires, and the fervour of your spirit, the apprehension of your need, and the consequent prosecution of your supply. <hi>Christ</hi> pray'd <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3. Under this title of lukewarmnesse and tepidity may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised also these Cautions: that a good mans prayers are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hindred by <hi>inadvertency,</hi> sometimes by <hi>want of perseverance.</hi> For inadvertency or want of attendance to the sense and intention of our prayers, it is certainly an effect of lukewarmnesse, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain companion and appendage to humane infirmity; and is only so remedyed as our prayers are made zealous, and our infirmities
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48497:40"/>
passe into the strengths of the Spirit. But if we were quick in our perceptions, either concerning our danger, or our need, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the object, or the glories of God, or the niceties and perfections of Religion, we should not dare to throw away our prayers so like fools, or come to God and say a prayer with our minde standing at distance, trissing like untaught boyes at their books, with a truantly spirit. I shall say no more to this, but that in reason we can never hope that God in heaven will hear our prayers, which we our selves speak and yet hear not at the same time when we our selves speak them with instruments joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our ears; even with those organs which are parts of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hearing faculties. If they be not worth our own attending to, they are not worth Gods hearing; If they are worth Gods at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to, we must make them so by our own zeal, and passion, and industry, and observation, and a present and a holy spirit.</p>
            <p>But concerning <hi>perseverance,</hi> the consideration is something distinct. For when our prayer is for a great matter, and a great necessity, strictly attended to, yet we pursue it only by chance or humour, by the strengths of fancy, and naturall disposition; or else our choice is cool as soon as hot, like the emissions of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or like a sun-beam often interrupted with a cloud, or cool'd with intervening showers: and our prayer is without fruit because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the desire lasts not, and the prayer lives like the repentance of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or the trembling of <hi>Felix,</hi> or the Jewes devotion for seven dayes of unleavened bread, during the Passeover or the feast of Tabernacles; but if we would secure the blessing of our prayers, and the effect of our prayers, we must never leave till we have obtain'd what we need.</p>
            <p>There are many that pray against a temptation for a moneth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and so long as the prayer is servent, so long the man hath a nolition, and a direct enmity against the lust; he consents not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all that while; but when the moneth is gone, and the prayer is removed, or becomes lesse active, then the temptation returnes, and forrages, and prevails, and seises upon all our unguarded strengths. There are some desires which have a period, and Gods visitations expire in mercy at the revolution of a certain number of dayes; and our prayer must dwell so long as Gods anger abides; and in all the storm we must out cry the noyse of the tempest, and the voices of that thunder. But if we become hardned, and by custome and cohabitation with the danger lose our fears, and abate of our desires and devotions, many times we shall finde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that God by a sudden breach upon us will chastise us for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our hands go down. <hi>Israel</hi> prevailed no longer then <hi>Moses</hi> held up his hands in prayer; and he was forced to continue his prayer, till the going down of the Sun; that is, till the danger was over, till the battell was done. But when our desires, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48497:41"/>
prayers are in the matter of spirituall danger, they must never be remitted, because our danger continues for ever, and therefore so must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> our watchfulnesse, and our guards. <hi>Vult n. Deus rogari, vult cogi, vult quâdam importunitate vinci</hi> (sayes S. <hi>Gregory)</hi> God loves to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, intreated, importun'd</hi> with an unquiet, restlesse desire and a persevering prayer. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, said <hi>Proclus.</hi> That's a holy and a religious prayer, that never gives over, but renewes the prayer, and dwels upon the desire; for this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is effectuall. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God hears the persevering man, and the unwearied prayer. For it is very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that we be very curious to observe; that many times a lust is <hi>sopita, non mortua,</hi> it is asleep; the enemy is at truce, and at quiet for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a while, but not conquered, not dead; and if we put off our armour too soon, we lose all the benefit of our former war, and are surprised by indiligence and a carelesse guard. For God sometimes binds the Devill in a short chain, and gives his servants respite, that they may feel the short pleasures of a peace, and the rest of innocence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what are the eternall felicities of heaven, where it shall be so for ever; But then we must return to our warfare again; and every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond assault is more troublesome, because it finds our spirits at ease, and without watchfulnesse, and delighted with a spirituall rest, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> keeping holiday. But let us take heed; for whatsoever temptation we can be troubled withall by our naturall temper, or by the condition of our life, or the evill circumstances of our condition, so long as we have capacity to feel it, so long we are in danger, and must <hi>watch thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with prayer</hi> and continuall diligence. And when your temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons let you alone, let not you God alone; but lay up prayers and the blessings of a constant devotion against the day of tryall. Well may your temptation sleep, but if your prayers do so, you may chance to be awakened with an assault that may ruine you. However, the rule is easie: Whatsoever you need, aske it of God so long as you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> want it, even till you have it. For God therefore many times defers to grant, that thou mayst persevere to aske; and because every holy prayer is a glorification of God by the confessing many of his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, a lasting and a persevering prayer is a little image of the Allel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs and services of eternity; it is a continuation to do that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our measures which we shall be doing to eternall ages: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think not that five or six hearty prayers can secure to thee a great blessing, and a supply of a mighty necessity. He that prays so, and then leaves off, hath said some prayers, and done the ordinary offices of his Religion, but hath not secured the blessing, nor used <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> means reasonably proportionable to a mighty interest.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The prayers of a good man are oftentimes hindered, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their effect for want of praying in good company; for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an evill or an obnoxious person hath so secured and ascertained a mischief to himself, that he that stayes in his company or his crat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48497:41"/>
must also share in his punishment: and the <hi>Tyrian</hi> sailers with all their vows and prayers could not obtain a prosperous voyage so long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as <hi>Jonas</hi> was within the Bark; for in this case the interest is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the publick sin prevails above the private piety. When the Philosopher asked a penny of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> he told him it was too little for a <hi>King</hi> to give; when he asked a talent, he told him it was too much for a <hi>Philosopher</hi> to receive; for he did purpose to cousen his own charity, and elude the others necessity, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a double inequality. So it is in the case of a good man mingled in evill company: if a curse be too severe for a good man, a mercy is not to be expected by evill company; and his prayer, when it is made in common, must partake of that event of things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which is appropriate to that society. The purpose of this caution is, that every good man be carefull that he do not mingle his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the communions of hereticall persons, and in schismaticall conventicles; for although he be like them that follow <hi>Absalom</hi> in the simplicity of their heart, yet his intermediall fortune, and the event of his present affairs may be the same with <hi>Absaloms;</hi> and it is not a light thing, that we curiously choose the parties of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. I do not say it is necessary to avoid all the society of evill persons; for then <hi>we must go out of the world;</hi> and when we have thrown out a drunkard, possibly we have entertain'd an hypocrite; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or when a swearer is gone, an oppressor may stay still; or if that be remedied, yet pride is soon discernible, but not easily judicable: but that which is of caution in this question is, that we never min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with those, whose very combination is a sin; such as were <hi>Corah</hi> and his company that rebelled against <hi>Moses their Prince;</hi> and <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> that made a schisme in Religion against <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron the Priest:</hi> for so said the Spirit of the Lord, <hi>Come out from the congregation of these men, lest ye perish in their company;</hi> and all those that were abused in their communion, did <hi>perish in the gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>of</hi> Corah. It is a sad thing to see a good man cousened by fair pretences, and allured into an evill snare; for besides, that he dwels in danger, and cohabits with a dragon, and his vertue may change by evill perswasion, into an evill disposition, from sweetnesse to bitternesse, from thence to evill speaking, from thence to beleeve a lye, and from beleeving to practise it; besides this, it is a very great sadnesse, that such a man should lose all his prayers to very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purposes: God will not respect the offering of those men who assemble by a peevish spirit; and therefore although God in pity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the desires of a good man if innocently abused, yet as it unites <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in that assembly, God will not hear it to any purposes of blessing, and holinesse; unlesse we <hi>keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> we cannot have the blessing of the Spirit in the returns of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer; and all those assemblies which meet together against God or Gods Ordinances, may pray and call, and cry loudly, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48497:42"/>
and still they provoke God to anger; and many times he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> will not have so much mercy for them as to deny them; but lets them prosper in their sin, till it swels to intolerable and impardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. * But when good men pray with one heart, and in a <hi>holy assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> that is, <hi>holy in their desires, lawfull in their authority,</hi> though the persons be of different complexion, <hi>then</hi> the prayer flies up to God like the hymns of a Quire of Angels; for God that made body and soul to be one man, and God and man to be one Christ, and three persons are one God, and his praises are sung to him by Quires, and the persons are joyned in orders, and the orders into hierarchies, and all, that God may be served by unions and communities, loves that his Church should imitate the Concords of heaven, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> unions of God, and that every good man should promote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of his prayers by joyning in the communion of Saints in the unions of obedience and charity, with the powers that God and the Lawes have ordained.</p>
            <p>The sum is this, If the man that makes the prayer be an unholy person, his prayer is not the instrument of a blessing, but a curse; but when the sinner begins to repent truly, then his desires begin to be holy. But if they be holy, and just, and good, yet they are without profit and effect, if the prayer be made in schisme, or an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> evill communion, or if it be made without attention, or if the man soon gives over, or if the prayer be not zealous, or if the man be angry. There are very many waies for a good man to become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed and unthriving in his prayers, and he cannot be secure unlesse he be in the state of grace, and his spirit be quiet, and his minde be attentive, and his society be lawfull, and his desires carnest, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate, and his devotions persevering, lasting till his needs be served, or exchanged for another blessing: so that, what <hi>Laelius (apud Cicer. de senectute)</hi> said concerning old age, <hi>neque in summâ inopiâ levis esse senectus potest, ne sapienti quidem, nec insipienti etiam in summâ</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>coptâ non gravis; that a wise man could not bear old age if it were extremely poor; and yet if it were very rich, it were intolerable to a fool;</hi> we may say concerning our prayers; they are sins and unholy, if a wicked man makes them, and yet if they be made by a good man they are ineffective, unlesse they be improved by their proper dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. A good man cannot prevail in his prayers, if his desires be cold, and his affections trifling, and his industry soon weary, and his society criminall; and if all these appendages of prayer be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, yet they will do no good to an evill man, for his prayer that begins in sin, shall end in sorrow. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

            <p n="3">3. NExt I am to inquire and consider; what degrees and circumstances of piety are requir'd to make us fit to be intercessors for others, and to pray for them with probable effect? I say <hi>with probable effect;</hi> for when the event principally depends upon that which is not within our own election, such as are the lives and actions of others, all that we can consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this affair is, whether wee be persons fit to pray in the behalf of others that hinder not, but are persons within the limit and possibilities of the presentmercy. When the Emperour <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was smitten with the wrath of God, and a sore disease for his cruell persecuting the Christian cause, and putting so many thousand innocent and holy persons to death, and he understood the voice of God and the accents of thunder, and discerned that cruelty was the cause, he revoked their decrees made against the Christians, recall'd them from their caves and deserts, their sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, and retirements, and enjoyned them to pray for the life and health of their Prince. They did so, and they who could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand mountaines to remove, and were obeyed, they who could doe miracles, they who with the key of prayer could open Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> four closets, of the <hi>wombe</hi> and the <hi>grave,</hi> of <hi>providence</hi> and <hi>rain,</hi> could not obtain for their bloudy Emperour one drop of mercy, but he must die miserable for over. God would not be intreated for him, and though he loved the prayer because he loved the Advocates, yet <hi>Maximinus</hi> was not worthy to receive the blessing. And it was threatned to the rebellious people of <hi>Israel,</hi> and by them to all people that should sin grievously against the Lord, <hi>God would break their staffe of bread,</hi> and even the righteous should not be prevailing intercessors; <hi>Though</hi> Noah, Job, <hi>or</hi> Daniel <note place="margin">Ezek. 14. 14.</note> 
               <hi>were there, they should deliver but their own souls by their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>saith the Lord God:</hi> and when <hi>Abraham</hi> prevailed very far with God in the behalf of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and the five Cities of the Plain; it had its period; If there had been ten righteous in <hi>Sodom</hi> it should have been spared for their sakes, but four onely were found, and they onely delivered their own souls too; but neither their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48497:43"/>
righteousnesse, nor <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayer prevailed any further; and we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> have this case also mentioned in the New Testament: <hi>If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall aske and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 16.</note> 
               <hi>he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.</hi> At his prayer the sinner shall receive pardon; God shall <hi>give him life for them,</hi> to him that prays in their behalf that sin; provided it be <hi>not a sin unto death.</hi> For <hi>there is a sin unto death, but I doe not say that he shall pray for it.</hi> There his Commission expires, and his power is confin'd. For there are some sins of that state and greatnesse that God will not pardon. S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his books <hi>de sermone Domini in monte</hi> affirms it, concerning some one single sin of a perfect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> It was also the opinion of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by venerable <hi>Bede;</hi> and whether the Apostle means a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar state of sin, or some one single great crime which also supposes a precedent and a present state of criminall condition; it is such a thing as will hinder our prayers from prevailing in their behalf; we are therefore not encouraged to pray, because they cannot receive the benefit of Christs intercession, and therefore much lesse of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, which onely can prevail by vertue and participation of his mediation. For whomsoever Christ prays, for them wee pray, that is, for all them that are, within the covenant of repentance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for all whose actions have not destroyed the very being of Religion, who have not renounc'd their faith, nor voluntarily quit their hopes, nor openly opposed the Spirit of grace, nor grown by a long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse to a resolute and finall impiety, nor done injustices greater then <hi>sorrow,</hi> or <hi>restitution,</hi> or <hi>recompense,</hi> or <hi>acknowledgment.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though it may be uncertain and disputed concerning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>sins unto death,</hi> and therefore to pray, or not to pray, is not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of duty; yet it is all one, as to the effect, whether we know them or no; for though we intend charity when we pray for the worst of men, yet concerning the event God will take care, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> return thy prayer upon thy own head, though thou didst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it should water and refresh thy neighbors drynesse; and St. <hi>John</hi> so expresses it as if he had left the matter of duty undetermin'd; because the instances are uncertain; yet the event is certainly none at all, therefore because we are not encouraged to pray, and because it is a <hi>sin unto death,</hi> that is, such a sin that hath no portion in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of life, and the state of repentance. But now, suppose the man for whom wee pray to be capable of mercy, within the covenant of repentance, and not farre from the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

Apostle to him to make him a Christian; the meaning of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which observation is, that we may understand, that as in the person prayed for, there ought to be the great disposition of being in a save<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition; so there ought also to be all the intermediall aptnesses: for just as he is disposed, so can we prevail, and the prayers of a good man first prevail in behalf of a sinner, that he shall be invited, that he shall be reproved, and then that he shall attend to it, then that he shall have his heart open'd, and then that he shall repent: And still a good mans prayers follow him thorough the severall stages of pardon, of sanctification, of restraining graces, of a mighty providence, of great assistance, of perseverance, and a holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> death. No prayers can prevaile upon an undisposed person. For the Sun himself cannot enlighten a blind eye, nor the soule move a body whose silver cord is loosed, and whose joints are untyed by the rudenesse and dissolutions of a pertinacious sicknesse. But then, suppose an eye quick, and healthfull, or apt to be refreshed with light and a friendly prospect, yet a glow-worm or a diamond, the shels of pearl, or a dead mans candle, are not enough to make him discern the beauties of the world, and to admire the glories of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the persons must be capable for whom we pray, so they that pray for others must be persons extraordinary in something: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 1. If persons be <hi>of an extraordinary piety,</hi> they are apt to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors for others. This appeares in the case of <hi>Job:</hi> When the wrath of God was kindled against <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and his two friends, <note place="margin">Chap. 42. 7, 8.</note> God commanded them to offer a sacrifice; but <hi>my servant</hi> Job <hi>shall pray for you, for him will I accept:</hi> and it was so in the case of the prevaricating <hi>Israelites;</hi> God was full of indignation against them, and smote them, <hi>Then stood up</hi> Phinehas <hi>and prayed, and the plague ceased.</hi> For this man was a good man, and the spirit of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary zeal filled him, and he did glory to God in the execution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> upon <hi>Zimri</hi> and his fair <hi>Madianite.</hi> And it was a huge blessing that was intail'd upon the posterity of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had a great Religion, a great power with God, and their <hi>extraordinary</hi> did consist especially in the matter of prayers and devotion; for that was eminent in them besides their obedience: for so <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells concerning them, that <hi>Abraham</hi> first instituted <hi>Morning prayer.</hi> The affairs of Religion had not the same constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then as now. They worshipped God never but at their <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,</hi> and in <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>seldome times</hi> of separation. The bowed their head when they came to a hallowed stone, and upon <hi>the top</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>of their staffe,</hi> and worshipped when they came to a <hi>consecrated pillar,</hi> but this was seldome; and they knew not the secrets and the priviledges of a frequent prayer, of intercourses with God by ejaculations, and the advantages of importunity: and the Doctors of the <hi>Jews</hi> that record the prayer of <hi>Noah,</hi> who in all reason knew
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48497:44"/>
the secret best, because he was to teach it to all the world, yet have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> transmitted to us but a short prayer of some seaven lines long; and this he onely said within the Ark, in that great danger, once on a day, provoked by his fear, and stirred up by a Religion then made actuall, in those days of sorrow and penance. But in the descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ages, when God began to reckon a Church in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family, there began to be a new institution of offices, and <hi>Abraham</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that God should be prayed to <hi>every morning. Isaac</hi> being taught by <hi>Abraham,</hi> made a law, or at least commended the practise, and adopted it into the Religion, that God should be worshipped by <hi>decimation</hi> or <hi>tithing</hi> of our goods; and he added <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> an order of prayer to be said in the <hi>afternoon;</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to make up the office compleat added <hi>evening prayer;</hi> and God was their God, and they became fit persons to <hi>blesse,</hi> that is, of procuring blessings to their relatives; as appears in the instances of their own families; of the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Cities of the Plain. For a man of an ordinary piety is like <hi>Gideons</hi> fleece, wet in its own locks; but it could not water a poor mans Garden. But so does a thirsty land drink all the dew of heaven that wets its face, and a great shower makes no torrent, nor digs so much as a little furrow that the drils of the water might passe into rivers, or refresh their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wearinesse; but when the earth is full, and hath no strange consumptive needs, then at the next time when God blesses it with a gracious shower, it divides into portions, and sends it abroad in free and equall communications, that all that stand round about may feel the shower. So is a good mans prayer; his own cup is full, it is crowned with health, and overflowes with bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and all that drink of his cup, and eat at his table are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed with his joys, and divide with him in his holy portions. And indeed he hath need of a great stock of piety, who is first to provide for his own necessities, and then to give portions to a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous relation. It is a great matter that every man needs for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> himself; the daily expences of his own infirmities, the unthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving state of his omission of duties, and recessions from perfection, and sometimes the great losses and shipwracks, the plundrings and burning of his house by a fall into a deadly sin; and most good men are in this condition, that they have enough to doe to live, and keep themselves above water; but how few men are able to pay their own debts, and lend great portions to others? The number of those who can effectually intercede for others to great purposes of grace and pardon, are as soon told as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of wise men, as the gates of a City, or the entries of the river <hi>Nilus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then doe but consider what a great ingagement this is to a very strict and holy life. If we chance to live in times of an extraordinary trouble, or if our relatives can be capable of great

dangers, or great sorrows, or if we our selves would doe the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> noblest friendship in the world, and oblige others by acts of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test benefit; if we would assist their souls, and work towards their salvation; if we would be publick ministers of the greatest usefulness to our countrey; if we would support Kings, and relieve the great necessities of Kingdoms; if we would be effective in the stopping of a plague, or in the successe of armies; a great and an exemplar piety, and a zealous and holy prayer can do all this. <hi>Semper tu hoc facito ut cogites, Id optimum esse, tute ut sis optimus; si id nequeas, saltem ut optimis sis proximus.</hi> He that is the best man towards God, is certainely the best Minister to his Prince or Countrey, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> doe thou endevour to be so; and if thou canst not be so, be at least next to the best. For in that degree in which our Religion is great, and our piety exemplar, in the same we can contribute towards the fortune of a Kingdome: and when <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken into heaven, <hi>Elisha</hi> mourn'd for him because it was a losse to <hi>Israel: My Father, my father, the chariots of</hi> Israel <hi>and horsemen thereof:</hi> But consider how uselesse thou art, when thou canst not by thy prayers obtain so much mercy as to prevaile for the life of a single Trooper, or in a plague beg of God for the life of a poor Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant; but the ordinary emanations of providence shall proceed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to issue without any arrest, and the sword of the Angel shall not be turn'd aside in one single infliction. Remember, although he is a great and excellent person that can prevaile of God for the interest of others, yet thou that hast no stock of grace and favour, no interest in the Court of heaven, art but a mean person; extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in nothing; thou art unregarded by God, cheap in the sight of Angels, uselesse to thy Prince or Countrey; thou maist hold thy peace in a time of publick danger. For, Kings never pardon Murtherers at the intercession of Theeves; and if a mean Mechanick should beg a Reprieve for a condemned Traitor, he is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ridiculous and impudent; so is a vicious Advocate or an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary person with God. It is well if God will hear him beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for his owne pardon; hee is not yet disposed to plead for others.</p>
            <p>And yet every man that is in the state of grace, every man that can pray without a sinfull prayer, may also intercede for others; and it is a duty for all men to doe it; all men I say who can pray at all acceptably; <hi>I will therefore that prayers, and supplications, and intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men;</hi> and this is a duty that is prescrib'd to all them that are concern'd in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> duty and in the blessings of Prayer; but this is it which I say; if their piety be but ordinary, their prayer can be effectuall but in easy purposes, and to smaller degrees; but he that would work effectively towards a great deliverance, or in great degrees towards the benefit or ease of any of his relatives, can be confident of his successe but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48497:45"/>
in the same degree in which his person is gracious. <hi>There are strange</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>things in heaven;</hi> judgments there are made of things and persons by the measures of Religion; and a plain promise produces effects of wonder and miracle; and the changes that are there made are not effected by passions, and interests, and corporall changes, and the love that is there is not the same thing that it is here, it is more beneficiall, more reasonable, more holy, of other designes, and strange productions; and upon that stock it is that a holy poor man that possesses no more (it may be) then an Ewe-lambe, that eats of his bread, and drinks of his cup, and is a daughter to him, and is all his temporall portion, this poor man is ministred to by Angels, and attended to by God, and the Holy Spirit makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for him, and Christ joyns the mans prayer to his own advocation, and the man by prayer shall save the City, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the fortune of a Tyrant army, even then when God sees it good it should be so; for he will no longer deny him any thing, but when it is no blessing; and when it is otherwise, his prayer is most heard when it is most denyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That we should prevaile in intercessions for others, we are to regard and to take care, that as our piety, so also must our offices be extraordinary. He that prays to recover a family from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> an hereditary curse, or to reverse a Sentence of God, to cancell a Decree of heaven gone out against his friend, hee that would heale the sick with his prayer, or with his devotion prevaile against an army, must not expect such great effects upon a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Evening Collect, or an honest wish put into the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of a prayer, or a period put in on purpose. <hi>Mamercus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> seeing his City and all the Diocese in great danger of perishing by an earthquake, instituted <hi>great Letanies,</hi> and solemn supplications, besides the ordinary devotions of his usuall hours of prayer; and the Church from his example took up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the practise, and translated it into an anniversary solemnity, and upon St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s day did solemnly intercede with God to divert or prevent his judgments falling upon the people, <hi>majoribus Litaniis,</hi> so they are called; with the more solemn supplications they did pray unto God in behalf of their people. And this hath in it the same consideration that is in every great necessity; for it is a great thing for a man to be so gracious with God, as to be able to prevaile for himself and his friend, for himself and his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and therefore in these cases, as in all great needs, it is the way of prudence and security, that we use all those greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> offices which God hath appointed as instruments of importunity, and arguments of hope, and acts of prevailing, and means of great effect and advocation: such as are, separating days for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayer, all the degrees of violence, and earnest addresse, fasting and prayer, almes and prayer, acts of repentance and prayer,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48497:45"/>
praying together in publick with united hearts, and above all, praying in the susception and communication of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the effects and admirable issues of which we know not, and perceive not; we lo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e because we desire not, and choose to lose many great blessings rather then purchase them with the frequent commemoration of that sacrifice which was offered up for all the needs of Mankind, and for obtaining all favours and graces to the Catholick Church. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>God never refuses to hear a holy prayer,</hi> and our prayers can never be so holy, as when they are offered up in the union of Christs sacrifice: For Christ by that sacrifice reconcil'd God and the world. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our needs continue, therefore we are commanded to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the memory, and to represent to God that which was done to satisfie all our needs: Then we receive Christ; we are after a secret and mysterious, but most reall and admirable manner made all one with Christ; and if God giving us his Son could not but with him give us all things else, how shall he refuse our persons when we are united to his person, when our souls are joined to his soul, our body nourished by his body, and our souls sanctified by his bloud, and cloth'd with his robes, and marked with his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and sealed with his Spirit, and renewed with holy vows, and consign'd to all his glories, and adopted to his inheritance? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when we represent his death, and pray in vertue of his passion, and imitate his intercession, and doe that which God commands, and offer him in our manner that which he essentially loves? can it be that either any thing should be more prevalent, or that God can possibly deny such addresses, and such importunities? Try it often, and let all things else be answerable, and you cannot have greater reason for your confidence. Doe not all the Christians in the world that understand Religion, desire to have the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament when they die; when they are to make their great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> before God, and to receive their great consignation to their eternall sentence, good or bad? And if <hi>then</hi> be their greatest needs, <hi>that</hi> is their greatest advantage, and instrument of acceptation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you have a great need to be serv'd, or a great charity to serve, and a great pity to minister, and a dear friend in a sorrow, take Christ along in thy prayers, in all thy ways thou canst take him; take him in affection, and take him in a solemnity, take him by obedience and receive him in the Sacrament; and if thou then offerest up thy prayers and makest thy needs known, if thou nor thy friend be not relieved, if thy party be not prevalent, and the war be not appeased, or the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> plague be not cured, or the enemy taken off, there is something else in it; but thy prayer is good and pleasing to God, and dressed with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of advantage, and thy person is apt to be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, and thou hast done all that thou canst; the event must be left to God; and the secret reasons of the deniall either thou shalt find

in time, or thou maist trust with God, who certainly does it with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the greatest wisdome, and the greatest charity. I have in this thing onely one caution to insert, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in our importunity and extraordinary offices for others, we must nor make our accounts by multitude of words, and long prayers, but by the measures of the Spirit, by the holynesse of the soul, and the just nesse of the desire, and the usefulnesse of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and its order to Gods glory, and its place in the order of providence, and the sincerity of our heart, and the charity of our wishes, and the perseverance of our advocation. There are some (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> observes) <hi>qui loquacitatem facundiam existimant, at impudentiam constantiam deputant; They are praters, and they are</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>impudent, and they call that constancy and importunity:</hi> concerning which, the advice is easy: Many words or few are extrinsecall to the <hi>nature,</hi> and not at all considered in the <hi>effects of prayer;</hi> but much desire and much holinesse, are essentiall to its constitution; but we must be very curious that our importunity do not degenerate into impudence and a rude boldnesse. <hi>Capitolinus</hi> said of <hi>Antonius</hi> the Emperour and Philosopher, <hi>sanè quamvis esset constans, erat etiam verecundus;</hi> he was modest even when he was most perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious in his desires. So must wee; though wee must not be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ashamed to aske for whatsoever we need, <hi>Rebus semper pudor absit in arctis,</hi> and in this sense it is true that <hi>Stasimus</hi> in the Comedy said concerning Mear, <hi>Verecundari neminem apud mensam decet, Nam ibi de divinis &amp; humanis cernitur:</hi> Men must not be bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full so as to lose their meat; for that is a necessity that cannot bee dispensed withall: so it is in our prayers, whatsoever our necessity calls to us for, we must call to God for; and he is not pleased with that rusticity or fond modesty of being ashamed to ask of God any thing that is honest and necessary; yet our importunity hath also bounds of modesty, but such as are to be expressed with other significations; and he is rightly modest towards God, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> without confidence in himself, but not without confidence in Gods mercy, nor without great humility of person, and reverence of addresse, presents his prayers to God as earnestly as he can; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided alwayes, that in the greatest of our desires, and holy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, we submit to Gods will, and desire him to choose for us. Our modesty to God in prayers hath no other measures but these: 1. <hi>Distrust of our selves:</hi> 2. <hi>Confidence in God:</hi> 3. <hi>Humility of person:</hi> 4. <hi>Reverence of addresse:</hi> and 5. <hi>Submission to Gods will:</hi> These are all, unlesse also you will adde that of <hi>Solomon:</hi>

            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The last great advantage towards a prevailing intercession for others, is, that the person that prayes for his relatives, be a <hi>person of an extraordinary dignity, imployment or designation.</hi> For God hath appointed some persons and callings of men to pray for others, such are Fathers for their Children, Bishops for their Dioceses, Kings for their Subjects, and the whole Order Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall for all the men and women in the Christian Church. And it is well it is so; for as things are now, and have been too long, how few are there that understand it to be their duty, or part of their necessary imployment, that some of their time, and much of their prayers, and an equall portion of their desires be spent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> upon the necessities of others? All men doe not think it necessary, and fewer practise it frequently; and they but coldly, without interest, and deep resentment: it is like the compassion we have in other mens miseries, we are not concerned in it, and it is not our case, and our hearts ake not when another mans children are made fatherlesse, or his wife a sad widow: and just so are our prayers for their relief: If we thought their evils to be ours, if wee and they as members of the same body had sensible and reall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of good and evill; if we understood what is really meant by being <hi>members one of another,</hi> or if we did not think it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a spirituall word of art, instrumentall onely to a science, but no part of duty, or reall relation, sure we should pray more earnestly one for another then we usually doe. How few of us are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when he sees his brother wicked, or dishonorably vicious? Who is sad and melancholy when his neighbour is almost in hell? when he sees him grow old in iniquity? How many days have we set apart for the publick relief and interests of the Kingdome? How earnestly have we fasted, if our Prince be sick or afflicted? What almes have we given for our brothers conversion? or if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this be great, how importunate and passionate have we been with God by prayer in his behalf, by prayer and secret petition? But however, though it were well, very well, that all of us would think of this duty a little more; because besides the excellency of the duty it self, it would have this blessed consequent, that for whose necessities we pray, if we doe desire earnestly they should be relieved, we would, <hi>when ever we can,</hi> and <hi>in all we can,</hi> set our hands to it; and if we pity the Orphan children, and pray for them heartily, we would also, when we could, relieve them charitably: but though it were therefore very well that things were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thus with all men, yet God who takes care for us all, makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for us in speciall manner; and the whole Order of the Clergy are appointed by God to pray for others, to be Ministers of Christs Priesthood, to be followers of his Advocation, to stand between God and the people, and present to God all their needs,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48497:47"/>
and all their desires. That this God hath ordained and appointed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and that this rather he will blesse and accept, appears by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God himself, for he onely can be witnesse in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; for it depends wholly upon his gracious favour and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was the case of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Abimelech: Now therefore</hi>

               <hi>him send for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him:</hi> meaning that God hath appointed them especially, and will accept them in ordinary, and extraordinary; and this is that which is meant by <hi>blessing.</hi> A Father blesses his childe, and <hi>Solomon</hi> blessed his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> people, and <hi>Melchisedec</hi> the Priest blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> blessed the Sons of <hi>Israel,</hi> and God appointed the Leviticall Priests to <hi>blesse the congregation;</hi> and this is more then can be done by the people; for though they can say the same prayer, and the People pray for their Kings, and Children for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and the Flock for the Pastor, yet they cannot blesse him as he blesses them; <hi>for the lesse is blessed of the greater, and not the greater of the lesse;</hi> and this is <hi>without all contradiction,</hi> said S. <hi>Paul:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 7.</note> the meaning of the mysterie is this, That God hath appointed the Priest to pray for the People, and because he hath made it to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be his ordinary office and imployment, he also intends to be seen in that way which he hath appointed, and chalked out for us; his prayer, if it be <hi>found in the way of righteousnesse,</hi> is the surer way to prevaile in his intercessions for the people.</p>
            <p>But upon this stock comes in the greatest difficulty of the text: for if <hi>God heareth not sinners,</hi> there is an infinite necessity that the Ministers of Religion should be very holy: For all their ministeries consist in <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>praying;</hi> to these two are reducible, all the ministeries Ecclesiasticall which are of divine institution: so the Apostles summ'd up their imployment; <hi>But we will give our selves</hi>

To <hi>prayer</hi> is reduced <hi>administration of the Sacraments:</hi> but <hi>binding and loosing,</hi> and <hi>visitation of the sick</hi> are mixt offices, partly relating to one, partly to the other. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Word of God preached, will have a great effect, even though it be preached by an evill Minister, a vicious person; yet it is not so well there, as from a pious man; because by prayer also his preaching is made effectuall, and by his good example his Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Sermons are made active; and therefore it is very necessary in respect of this half of the Ministers office, <hi>[The preaching of</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 1. <hi>Maledicam benedictionibus vestris, I will curse your blessings;</hi> upon the stock of these Scriptures, reasons, and authorities, we may see how we are to understand this advantage of intercession. The prayer and offices of holy Ministers are of great advantages for the interest of the people; but if they be ministred to by evill men, by vicious, and scandalous Ministers, this extraordinary advantage is lost, they are left to stand alone, or to fall by their own crimes; so much as is the action of God, and so much as is the piety of the man that attends and prayes in the holy place with the Priest, so far he shall prevail, but no further; and therefore the Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hath taught her Ministers to pray thus in her preparatory prayer to consecration, <hi>Quoniam me peccatorem inter te &amp; eundem populum Medium esse voluisti, licet in me boni operis testimonium non agnoscas, officium dispensationiis creditae non recuses, nec per me indignum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulum tuum eorum salutis pereat pretium, pro quibus victima factus salutaris, dignatus es fieri redemptio.</hi> For we must know that God hath not put the salvation of any man into the power of another. And although the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by calling the Priests actuall intention simply necessary, and the Sacraments also indispensably necessary, hath left it in the power of every Curate to damn very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> many of his Parish; yet it is otherwise with the accounts of truth, and the Divine mercy; and therefore he will never exact the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of us by the measures and proportions of an evill Priest, but by the piety of the communicant, by the prayers of Christ,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48497:48"/>
and the mercies of God. But although the greatest interest of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> depends not upon this Ministery, yet as by this we receive many advantages, if the Minister be holy: so if he be vicious, we lose all that which could be conveyed to us by his part of the holy Ministration; every man and woman in the assembly prays and joynes in the effect, and for the obtaining the blessing; but the more vain persons are assembled, the lesse benefits are received even by good men there present: and therefore much is the losse, if a wicked Priest ministers, though the summe of affairs is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely turned upon his office or default; yet many advantages are. For we must not think that the effect of the Sacraments is indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> done, at once, or by one ministery; but they operate by parts, and by morall operation, by the length of time, and a whole order of piety, and holy ministeries; every man is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker with God</hi> in the work of his salvation; and as in our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no one prayer of our own alone prevails upon God for grace and salvation, but all the devotions of our life are upon Gods account for them; so is the blessing of God brought upon the people by all the parts of their religion, and by all assistances of holy people, and by the ministeries not of one, but of all Gods Ministers, and relies finally upon our own faith, and obedience, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and the mercies of God in Jesus Christ; but yet for want of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons to minister, much diminution of blessing, and a losse of advantages is unavoidable; therefore if they have great necessities, they can best hope that God will be moved to mercy on their behalf, if their necessities be recommended to God by <hi>persons of a great piety, of a holy calling,</hi> and by <hi>the most solomn offices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, I promised to consider concerning the signs of having our prayers heard; concerning which, there is not much of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular observation; but if our prayers be according to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Gods Word, if we aske according to Gods will, things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> honest and profitable, we are to relye upon the promises, and we are sure that they are heard; and besides this, we can have no sign but <hi>the thing signified;</hi> when we feel the effect, then we are sure God hath heard us; but till then we are to leave it with God, and not to aske a sign of that, for which he hath made us a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. And yet <hi>Cassian</hi> hath named one sign, which if you give me leave I will name unto you. <hi>It is a sign we shall prevail in our</hi>

                  <hi>Collat.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 32.</note> 
               <hi>prayers, when the Spirit of God moves us to pray, cum fiduciâ &amp; quasi securitate impetrandi,</hi> with a confidence and a holy security of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving what we aske. But this is no otherwise a sign, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it is a part of the duty; and trusting in God is an endearing him, and doubting is a dishonour to him; and he that doubts hath no faith; for all good prayers relye upon Gods Word; and we must judge of the effect by prudence: for he that askes what is <hi>not lawfull,</hi> hath made an unholy prayer; if it be lawfull and <hi>not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:48497:49"/>
we are then heard when God denies us; and if both these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be in the prayer, <hi>he that doubts is a sinner,</hi> and then God will not hear him; but beyond this I know no confidence is warrantable; and if this be a signe of prevailing, then all the prudent prayers of all holy men shall certainely be heard, and because that is certain, we need no further inquiry into signes.</p>
            <p>I summe up all in the words of God by the Prophet: <hi>Run</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 5. 1.</note> 
               <hi>to and fro thorow the streets of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and see, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can finde a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh truth,</hi> virum quaerentem fidem, <hi>a man that seeketh for faith,</hi> &amp; propitius ero ei, <hi>and I will pardon it.</hi> God would pardon all <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> good mans sake; there are such dayes and opportunities of mercy when God at the prayer of one holy person will save a people; and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> spake a great thing, but it was hugely true: <hi>Quis dubitet mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum stare precibus sanctorum?</hi> the world it self is established and kept from dissolution by the prayers of Saints; and the prayers of Saints shall hasten the day of Judgement; and we cannot easily find two effects greater. But there are many other very great ones; for the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of holy men appease Gods wrath, drive away temptations, resist and overcome the Devill: Holy prayer procures the ministery and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> service of Angels, it rescinds the Decrees of God, it cures sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and obtains pardon, it arrests the Sun in its course, and staies the wheels of the Charet of the Moon; it rules over all Gods creatures, and opens and shuts the storehouses of rain; it unlocks the cabinet of the womb, and quenches the violence of fire, it stops the mouthes of Lions, and reconciles our sufferance and weak faculties, with the violence of torment, and sharpnesse of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution; it pleases God and supplies all our needs. But <hi>Prayer</hi> that can do thus much for us, can do nothing at all without <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi> for <hi>God heareth not sinners, but if any man be a worshipper of</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>we have grace,</hi> by which we do serve; and it is something better consonant to the discourse of the Apostle. For having enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated the great advantages which the Gospell hath above those of the Law, he makes an argument <hi>à majori;</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> answers a tacite objection. The Law was delivered by Angels, but the Gospell by the Son of God: The Law was delivered from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Gospell from Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> from <hi>the heavenly Jerusalem:</hi> The Law was given with terrors and noises, with amazements of the standers by, and <hi>Moses</hi> himself <hi>the Minister did exceedingly quake and fear,</hi> and gave demonstration how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous it was by breaking that Law to provoke so mighty a God, who with his voice did shake the earth; but the Gospell was given by a meek Prince, a gentle Saviour, with a <hi>still voice,</hi> scarce heard in the streets. But that this may be no objection, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he proceeds and declares the terror of the Lord; Deceive not your selves, our Law-giver appeared so upon earth, and was so truly, but now he is ascended into heaven, and from thence he speaks to us. <hi>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh, for if they escaped not</hi>

               <hi>if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:</hi> for as God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> once shaked the earth, and that was full of terror, so our Lawgiver shall do, and much more, and be farre more terrible, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is in the Prophesie; <hi>I will shake not the earth only, but also heaven</hi> with a greater terror then was upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with the voice of an Archangell, with the trump of God, with a concussion so great, that heaven and earth shall be shaken in pieces, and new ones come in their room. This is an unspeakable and an unima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable terror: <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> was shaken, but it stands to this day, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when that shaking shall be, <hi>the things that are shaken shall be no more; that those things that cannot be shaken may remain,</hi> that is, not only that the clestiall Jerusalem may remain for ever, but that you who do not turn away from the faith and obedience of the Lord Jesus, you who cannot be shaken nor removed from your duty, you may remain for ever; that when the rocks rend, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains flie in pieces like the drops of a broken cloud, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens shall melt, and the Sun shall be a globe of consuming fire, and the Moon shall be dark like an extinguish'd candle, then you poor men who could be made to tremble with an ague, or shake by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the violence of a Northern winde, or be remov'd from your dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings by the unjust decree of a persecutor, or be thrown from your estates by the violence of an unjust man, yet could not be removed from your duty, and though you went trembling, yet would go to death for the testimony of a holy cause, and you that would dye for your faith would also live according to it; you shall be established by the power of God, and supported by the arme of your Lord, and shall in all this great shaking be unmovable as the corner stone of the gates of the new Jerusalem, you shall remain and abide for ever. This is your case. And to summe up the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> whole force of the argument, the Apostle addes the words of <hi>Moses:</hi> as it was then, so it is true now, <hi>Our God is a consuming fire:</hi> He <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 24.</note> was so to them that brake the Law, but he will be much more to them that disobey his Son, he made great changes then, but those which remain are farre greater, and his terrors are infinitely more intolerable; and therefore although he came not in the spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> but with meeknesse and gentle insinuations, soft as the breath of heaven, not willing to disturb the softest stalk of a violet, yet his second coming shall be with terrors, such as shall amaze all the world, and dissolve it into ruine, and a <hi>Chaos.</hi> This truth is of so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> great efficacy to make us do our duty, that now we are sufficiently enabled with this consideration. This is the grace which we have to enable us, this terror will produce fear, and fear will produce obedience, and <hi>we therefore have grace,</hi> that is, we have such a motive to make us reverence God and fear to offend him, that he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48497:50"/>
that dares continue in sin and refuses to hear him that speaks to us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> from heaven, and from thence shall come with terrors, this man despises the grace of God, he is a gracelesse, fearlesse, impudent man, and he shall finde that true in <hi>hypothesi,</hi> and in his own ruine, which the Apostle declares in <hi>thesi,</hi> and by way of caution, and provisionary terror, <hi>Our God is a consuming fire;</hi> this is the sense and design of the text.</p>
            <p>Reverence and godly fear, they are the effects of this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are the duties of every Christian, they are the grace of God. I shall not presse them only to purposes of awfulnesse and modesty of opinion, and prayers against those strange doctrines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which some have introduc'd into Religion, to the destruction of all manners and prudent apprehensions of the distances of God and man; such as are the Doctrine of necessity of familiarity with God, and a civill friendship, and a parity of estate, and an unevennesse of adoption; from whence proceed rudenesse in prayers, flat and undecent expressions, affected rudenesse, superstitious sitting at the holy Sacrament, making it to be a part of Religion to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear and reverence; the stating of the Question is a sufficient reproof of this folly; whatsoever actions are brought into Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without <hi>reverence and godly fear,</hi> are therefore to be avoided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they are condemned in this advice of the Apostle, and are destructive of those effects which are to be imprinted upon our spirits by the terrors of the day of Judgement.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is not a distinct duty, but a word signifying something besides it self; and therefore cannot come into the consideration of this text. Therefore 3. <hi>Fear</hi> as it is a religious passion is divided as the two Testaments are; and relates to the old and new Covenant, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly hath its distinction. <hi>In the Law,</hi> God used his people like <hi>servants; in the Gospell,</hi> he hath made us to be <hi>sons. In the Law he enjoyn'd</hi> many things, hard, intricate, various, painfull, and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; <hi>in the Gospell</hi> he gave commandements, not hard, but full of pleasure, necessary and profitable to our life, and well being of single persons and communities of men. <hi>In the Law,</hi> he hath exacted those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> many precepts by the covenant of exact measures, grains and scruples; <hi>in the Gospel,</hi> he makes abatement for humane infirmities, temptations, morall necessities, mistakes, errors, for every thing that is pitiable, for every thing that is not malicious, and voluntary. <hi>In the Law,</hi> there are many threatnings, and but few promises, the promise of temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperities branch'd into single instances; <hi>in the Gospell,</hi> there are but few threatnings, and many promises: And when God by <hi>Moses</hi> gave the 10 Commandements, only one of them was sent out with a promise, the precept of obedience to all our parents and superiors; but when Christ in his first Sermon recommended 8 duties, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duties to the College of Disciples, every one of them begins <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with a blessing and ends with a promise, and therefore <hi>grace</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the <hi>Law.</hi> So that upon these differing interests, the world <note place="margin">Mat. 5. ad v. 10.</note> put on the affections of Servants, and Sons: They of old feared God <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 17.</note> as a severe Lord, much in his commands, abundant in threatnings, <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14, 15.</note> angry in his executions, terrible in his name, in his Majesty, and appearance, dreadfull unto death; and this the Apostle cals <gap reason="foreign">

But that we may take more exact measures, I shall describe the proportions of <hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>godly fear</hi> by the following propositions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Godly fear is ever without despair;</hi> because Christian fear is an instrument of duty, and that duty without hope can never go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For what should that man do who like <hi>Nausiclides</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hath neither spring nor harvest, friends nor children, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards nor hopes? A man will very hardly be brought to deny his own pleasing appetite, when for so doing he cannot hope to have a recompense; when the mind of a man is between hope and fear, it is intent upon its work; <hi>at post quam adempta spes est, lassus, curâ confectus stupet,</hi> if you take away the hope the minde is weary, spent with care, hindred by amazements; <hi>aut aliquem sumpserimus teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rariâ in Deos desperatione,</hi> saith <hi>Arnobius;</hi> a despair of mercy makes men to despise God; and the damned in hell when they shall for ever be without hope, are also without fear; their hope is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> despair, and their fear into blasphemy, and they curse the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of blessing, and revile God to eternall ages. When <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant imposed intolerable tributes upon his <hi>Sicilian</hi> subjects, it amazed them, and they petitioned and cryed for help, and flatter'd him, and fear'd and obey'd him carefully, but he impos'd still new ones, and greater, and at last left them poor as the valleys of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suvius,</hi> or the top of <hi>Aetna;</hi> but then all being gone, the people grew idle, and carelesse, and walked in the markets, and publick places, cursing the Tyrant, and bitterly scoffing his person and vices; which when <hi>Dionysius</hi> heard, he caused his Publicans and Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to withdraw their impost; for now, sayes he, they are dangerous, because they are desperate, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> when men have nothing left they will despise their Rulers: and so it is in Religion; <hi>audaces cogimur esse metu.</hi> If our fears be unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, our diligence is none at all, and from whom we hope for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither benefit nor indemnity, we despise his command and break his yoke, and trample it under our most miserable feet. And therefore <hi>Aeschylus</hi> cals these people <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hot, mad, and furious, carelesse of what they do, and he opposes them to pious and holy people. Let your confidence be allayed with fear, and your fear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be sharpned with the intertextures of a holy hope, and the active powers of our souls are furnished with feet and wings, with eyes and hands, with consideration and diligence, with reason and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But despair is part of the punishment that is in hell, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48497:52"/>
the Devils still do evill things because they never hope to receive a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> good, nor finde a pardon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Godly fear must alwaies be with honourable opinion of God,</hi> without disparagements of his mercies, without quarrellings at the intrigues of his providence, or the rough wayes of his Justice, and therefore it must be ever relative to our selves and our own fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and imperfections. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God never walks perversely towards us, unlesse we walk crookedly towards him. And therefore persons that only consider the greatnesse and power of God, and dwell for ever in the meditations of those severe executions which are transmitted to us by story, or we observe by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> accident, and conversation, are apt to be jealous concerning God, and fear him as an enemy, or as children fear fire, or women thunder, only because it can hurt them; <hi>Saepius illud cogitant quid possit is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus in ditione sunt, quàm quid debeat facere (Cicero pro Quinctio)</hi> they remember oftner what God can do then what he will; being more afrighted at his Judgements, then delighted with his mercy. Such as were the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> when ever they saw a man grow popular, or wise, or beloved, and by consequence powerfull, they turned him out of the countrey: and because they were afraid of the power of <hi>Ismenias,</hi> and knew that <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and <hi>Pherenicus</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>Androclydes</hi> could hurt them, if they listed, they banished them from <hi>Sparta,</hi> but they let <hi>Epaminondas</hi> alone, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as being studious and therefore unactive, and poor and therefore harmlesse; It is harder when men use God thus, and fear him as the great Justiciar of the world, who sits in heaven, and observes all we do, and cannot want excuse to punish all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. But this caution I have now inserted for their sakes whose Schooles and Pulpits raise doctrinall fears concerning God, which if they were true, the greatest part of mankinde would be tempted to think they have reason not to love God, and all the other part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that have not apprehended a reason to hate him, would have very much reason to suspect his severitie, and their own condition. Such are they which say that God hath decreed the greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde to eternall damnation, and that only to declare his severity and to manifest his glory by a triumph in our torments, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings in the gnashing of our teeth. And they also fear God unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably, and speak no good things concerning his Name, who say that God commands us to observe Lawes which are impossible; that think he will condemn innocent persons for errors of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they cannot avoid, that condemn whole Nations for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> different opinions, which they are pleased to call <hi>Heresie;</hi> that think God will exact the duties of a man by the measures of an Angell, or will not make abatement for all our pitiable infirmities. The precepts of this caution are, that we remember Gods mercy to be over all his works, that is, that he shewes mercy to all his creatures
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48497:53"/>
that need it; that God delights to have his mercy magnified in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> things, and by all persons, and at all times, and will not suffer his greatest honour to be most of all undervalued; and therefore as he that would accuse God of injustice were a blasphemer, so he that suspects his mercy, dishonours God as much, and produces in himself that fear which is the parent of trouble, but no instrument of duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, <hi>Godly fear is operative, diligent, and instrumentall to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and strict walking:</hi> for so fear is the mother of holy living; and the Apostle urges it by way of upbraiding: <hi>What! doe wee</hi>

And here heighten your apprehensions of the Divine power, of his justice, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, of the fiercenesse of his anger, and the sharpnesse of his sword, the heavynesse of his hand, and the swiftnesse of his arrows, as much as ever you can; provided the effect passe on no further, but to make us <hi>reverent</hi> and <hi>obedient:</hi> but that fear is unreasonable, servile, and unchristian, that ends in bondage and servile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, scruple and trouble, vanity and incredulity, superstition and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> desperation: Its proper bounds are <hi>humble and devout prayers,</hi> and <hi>a strict and a holy piety,</hi> (according to his laws) and <hi>glorifications of God,</hi> or speaking good things of his holy Name; and then it cannot be amisse: wee must be full of confidence towards God, we must with cheerfulnesse relye upon Gods goodnesse for the issue of our souls, and our finall interest, but this expectation of the Divine mercy must be in the ways of piety. <hi>Commit your selves</hi>

For he is our <hi>Creator,</hi> and he is <hi>faithfull;</hi> he is our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and he bought them at a dear rate; he is our <hi>Lord,</hi> and they are his own; <hi>he prays for them</hi> to his heavenly Father, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and therefore he is <hi>an interested person.</hi> So that he is a <hi>Party,</hi> and an <hi>Advocate,</hi> and a <hi>Judge</hi> too; and therefore there can be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter security in the world on Gods part: and this is our hope, and our confidence: but because we are but earthen vessels, under a law, and assaulted by enemies, and endangered by temptations, therefore
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48497:53"/>
it concerns us to fear, lest we make God our enemy, and a <hi>party</hi>

            <p n="1">1. I shall not here insist upon the generall reasons of feare, which concern every man, though it be most certain, that every one hath cause to fear, even the most confident, and holy, because his way is dangerous and narrow, troublesome and uneven, full of ambushes and pitfalls; and I remember what <hi>Polynices</hi> said in <note place="margin">Apud Eurip. in Phoenissis.</note> the Tragedy when he was unjustly throwne from his Fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and refused to treat of peace but with a sword in his hand, <gap reason="foreign">

But I shall onely instance in some pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar sorts of men, who it may be, least think of it, and therefore have most cause to fear. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

There are a great many sorts of such persons: some when they are full, are content, and rejoyce in Gods providence, but murmur and are amazed when they fall into po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. They are chaste so long as they are within the protection of marriage, but when they return to liberty they fall into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and complain they cannot help it; They are temperate and sober, if you let them alone at home, but call them abroad and they will lose their sober thoughts, as <hi>Dinah</hi> did her honour, by going into new company. These men in these estates think they stand, but God knows they are soon weary, and stand stiffe as a Cane, which the heat of the <hi>Sirian</hi> star or the flames of the Sun cannot bend; but one sigh of a Northern wind shakes them into the tremblings of a palsey: In this the best advice is, that such persons should watch their own infirmities, and see on which side they are most open, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and by what enemies they use to fall, and to fly from such parties as they would avoid death. But certainly they have great cause to fear, who are sure to be sick when the weather changes; or can no longer retain their possession but till an enemy please to take it away, or will preserve their honour but till some smiling temptation aske them to forgoe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, They also have great reason to fear whose repentance is broken into fragments, and is never a whole or entire change of life: I mean those that resolve against a sin, and pray against it, and hate it in all the resolutions of their understanding, till that unlucky period comes in which they use to act it, but then they sin as certainly as they will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> infallibly repent it, when they have done: these are a very great many Christians who are esteemed of the better sort of penitents, yet feel this feaverish repentance to be their best state of health; they fall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the returns of the same circumstances, or at a certain distance
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48497:54"/>
of time, but God knows they doe not get the victory over their sin, but are within its power. For this is certain, they who sin and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and sin again in the same or the like circumstances, are in some degree under the power and dominion of sin; <hi>when their actions can be reduc'd to an order or a method, to a rule or a certainty, that oftner hits then fails, that sin is habituall;</hi> though it be the least habit, yet a habit it is; every course, or order, or method of sin; every constant or periodicall return, every return that can be regularly observed, or which a man can foresee, or probably foretell, even then when he does not intend it, but prays against it, every such sin is to be reckoned not for a single action, or upon the accounts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of a pardonable infirmity, but it is a combination, an evill state, such a thing as the man ought to feare concerning himselfe, lest he be surpriz'd and call'd from this world before this evill state be altered: for if he be, his securities are but slender, and his hopes will deceive him.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and is hugely agreeable to the discipline of the Primitive Church: And it is a truth of so great severity, that it ought to quicken the repentance and sowre the gayeties of easy people, and make them fear, whose repentance is therefore ineffectuall, because it is not inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grall or united, but broken in pieces by the intervention of new crimes; <hi>so</hi> that the repentance is every time to begin anew; and then let it be considered what growth that repentance can make that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver above a week old, that is for ever in its infancy, that is still in its birth, that never gets the dominion over sin. These men, I say, ought to fear, lest God reject their persons, and deride the folly of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their new begun repentances, and at last be weary of giving them more opportunities, since they approve all, and make use of none, their <hi>understanding</hi> is right and their <hi>will</hi> a slave, their reason is for God and their affections for sin; these men (as the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is) <hi>walk not as wise but as fools:</hi> for we deride the folly of those men that resolve upon the same thing a thousand times, and never keep one of those resolutions.

            <p n="3">3. THey have great reason to feare, whose sins are not yet remitted; for they are within the dominion of sin, within the Kingdome of darknesse, and the regions of feare: Light makes us confident, and Sin checks the spirit of a man into the pusillanimity and cowardize of a girle or a conscious boy: and they doe their work in the days of peace and a wealthy fortune, and come to pay their symbole in a warre or in a plague; then they spend of their treasure of wrath, which they laid up in their vessels of dishonour! And indeed, want of feare brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them to it; for if they had known how to have accounted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the changes of mortality, if they could have reckoned right concerning Gods judgements falling upon sinners, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that themselves are no more to God then that Brother of theirs that died in a drunken surfeit, or was kill'd in a Rebell warre, or was before his grave corrupted by the shames of lust; if they could have told the minutes of their life, and passed on towards their grave at least in religious and sober thoughts, and consider'd that there must come a time for them to die, and <hi>after death comes judgement,</hi> a fearfull and an intolerable judgement, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> would not have come to this passe, in which their present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs doe amaze them, and their sin hath made them lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto death, and that death is the beginning of an eternall evill. In this case it is naturall to fear; and if men consider their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and know that all the felicity, and all the security they can have, depends upon Gods mercy pardoning their sins, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose but fear infinitely, if they have not reason to hope that their sins are pardoned. * Now concerning this, men indeed have generally taken a course to put this affair to a very speedy issue. <hi>God is mercifull,</hi> and <hi>God forgive mee,</hi> and all is done: or it may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be a few sighs, like the deep sobbings of a man that is almost dead with laughter, that is, a trifling sorrow returning upon a man after he is full of sin, and hath pleased himselfe with violence, and revolving onely by a naturall change from sin to sorrow, from laughter to a groan, from sunshine to a cloudy day; or it may
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48497:56"/>
be the good man hath left some one sin quite, or some degrees of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all sin, and then the conclusion is firm, he is <hi>rectus in Cur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>â,</hi> his sins are pardoned, he was indeed in an evill condition, but <hi>now he is purged, he is sanctified</hi> and clean. These things are very bad, but it is much worse that men should continue in their sin, and grow old in it, and arrive at confirmation, and the strength of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall wickednesse, and grow fond of it, and yet think if they die, their account stands as fair in the eyes of Gods mercy, as St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s after his tears and sorrow. <hi>Our sins are not pardoned easily and quickly;</hi> and the longer and the greater hath been the iniquity, the harder and more difficult and uncertain is the pardon; it is a great progresse to return from all the degrees of death to life, to motion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to quicknesse, to purity, to acceptation, to grace, to contention, and growth in grace, to perseverance, and <hi>so to pardon.</hi> For pardon stands no where but at the gates of heaven. It is a great mercy that signifies a finall and universall acquittance. God sends it out in little scroles, and excuses you from falling by the sword of the enemy, or the secret stroke of an Angell in the days of the plague; but these are but little entertainments and inticings of our hopes to work on towards the great pardon which is regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in the leaves of the Book of Life. And it is a mighty folly to think, that every little line of mercy signifies <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from the eternall wrath of God; and therefore it is not to be wondred at, that wicked men are unwilling to dye; it is a greater wonder that many of them dye with so little resentment of their danger and their evill. There is reason for them to tremble when the Judge summons them to appear. When his messenger is clothed with horror, and speaks in thunder; when their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is their accuser, and their accusation is great, and their bills uncancell'd, and they have no title to the crosse of Christ, no advocate, no excuse; when God is their enemy, and Christ is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> injur'd person, and the Spirit is grieved, and sicknesse and death come to plead Gods cause against the man; then there is reason that the naturall fears of death should be high and pungent, and those naturall fears encreased by the reasonable and certain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that anger which God hath laid up in heaven for ever, to consume and destroy his enemies.</p>
            <p>And indeed if we consider upon how trifling and inconsiderable grounds most men hope for pardon (if at least that may be call'd hope, which is nothing but a carelesse boldnesse, and an unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wilfull confidence) we shall see much cause to pity very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> many who are going merrily to a sad and intolerable death. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sins is a mercy which Christ purchased with his dearest blood, which he ministers to us upon conditions of an infinite kindnesse, but yet of great holinesse and obedience, and an active living faith; it is a grace, that the most holy persons beg of God
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48497:56"/>
with mighty passion, and labour for with a great diligence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with trembling fears, and concerning it many times suffer sadnesses with uncertain soules, and receive it by degrees, and it enters upon them by little portions, and it is broken as their sighs and sleeps. But so have I seen the returning sea enter upon the strand, and the waters rolling towards the shore, throw up little portions of the tide, and retire as if nature meant to play, and not to change the abode of waters; but still the floud crept by little steppings, and invaded more by his progressions then he lost by his retreat, and having told the number of its steps, it possesses its new portion till the Angell calls it back, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that it may leave its unfaithfull dwelling of the sand: so is the pardon of our sins, it comes by slow motions, and first quits a present death, and turnes, it may be, into a sharp sicknesse; and if that sicknesse prove not health to the soul, it washes off, and it may be will dash against the rock again, and proceed to take off the severall instances of anger, and the periods of wrath; but all this while it is uncertain concerning our finall interest, whether it be <hi>ebbe</hi> or <hi>floud;</hi> and every hearty prayer, and every bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full almes still enlarges the pardon, or addes a degree of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and hope; and then a drunken meeting, or a covetous desire, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or an act of lust, or looser swearing, idle talk, or neglect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, makes the pardon retire; and while it is disputed between Christ and Christs enemy who shall be Lord, the pardon fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates like the wave, striving to climbe the rock, and is wash'd off like its own retinue, and it gets possession by time and uncertainty, by difficulty, and the degrees of a hard progression. When <hi>David</hi> had sinned but in one instance, interrupting the course of a holy life by one sad calamity, it pleased God to pardon him; but see upon what hard terms: He prayed long, and violently, he wept sorely, he was humbled in sackcloth and ashes, he eat the bread of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> affliction, and drank of his bottle of tears; he lost his Princely spirit, and had an amazing conscience; he suffer'd the wrath of God, and the sword never did depart from his house, his Son rebell'd, and his Kingdome revolted; he fled on foot, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Spies against his childe, hee was forc'd to send an army against him that was dearer then his owne eyes, and to fight against him whom he would not hurt for all the riches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> his concubines were desir'd by an incestuous mixture, in the face of the sun before all <hi>Israel,</hi> and his childe that was the fruit of his sin, after a 7 days feaver dyed, and left him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of his sin to show, but sorrow, and the scourges of the Divine vengeance; and after all this, God pardoned him finally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was for ever sorrowfull, and never did the sin againe. He that hath sinned a thousand times for <hi>David</hi>'s once, is too confident, if he thinks that all his shall be pardoned at a lesse
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48497:57"/>
rate then was used to expiate that one mischief of the religious King: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>The son of David</hi> died for his father <hi>David,</hi> as well as he did for us; he was <hi>the Lambe slain from the beginning of the world;</hi> and yet that death, and that relation, and all the heap of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favours which crown'd <hi>David</hi> with a circle richer then the royall diadem, could not exempt him from the portion of sinners, when he descended into their pollutions. I pray God we may find the <hi>sure mercies of David,</hi> and may have our portion in the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption wrought by the <hi>Son of David;</hi> but we are to expect it upon such terms as are revealed, such which include time, and labour, and uncertainty, and watchfulnesse, and fear, and holy living. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it is a sad observation that the case of pardon of sins is so admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, that they that are most sure of it have the greatest fears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, and they to whom it doth not belong at all are as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as children and fooles, who believe every thing they have a mind to, not because they have reason so to doe, but because without it they are presently miserable. The godly and holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Church, <hi>work out their salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;</hi> and the wicked goe to destruction with gayety and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: these men think all is well, while they are <hi>in the gall of bitternesse,</hi> and good men are tossed in a tempest, crying and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for a safe conduct, and the sighs of their feares, and the wind of their prayers waft them safely to their port. Pardon of sins is not easily obtain'd; because they who onely certainly can receive it, find difficulty, and danger, and fears in the obtaining it; and therefore their case is pityable and deplorable, who when they have least reason to expect pardon, yet are most confident and carelesse.</p>
            <p>But because there are sorrows on one side and dangers on the other, and temptations on both sides, it will concern all sorts of men to know when their sins are pardoned. For then when they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> can perceive their signes certain and evident, they may rest in their expectations of the Divine mercies; when they cannot see the signes, they may leave their confidence, and change it into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and watchfulnesse, and stricter observation; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this, I shall tell you that which shall never faile you; a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine signe that you may know <hi>whether or no,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>in what degree</hi> your persons are pardoned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I shall not consider the evils of sin by any Metaphysicall and abstracted effects, but by sensible, reall, and materiall. Hee that revenges himself of another, does something that will make his enemy grieve, something that shall displease the offender as much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as sin did the offended; and therefore all the evills of sin are such as relate to us, and are to bee estimated by our apprehensions. Sin makes God angry, and Gods anger if it be turned aside will make us miscrable and accursed, and therefore in proportion to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48497:57"/>
this we are to reckon the proportions of Gods mercy in forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or his anger in retaining.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin hath obliged us to suffer many evills, even whatsoever the anger of God is pleased to inflict; sicknesse and dishonour, poverty and shame, a caytive spirit, and a guilty conscience, famine and war, plague and pestilence, sudden death and a short life tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death or death eternall, according as God in the severall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the Law and Gospel hath expressed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For in the law of <hi>Moses</hi> sin bound them to nothing but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall evills, but they were sore, and heavy, and many; but these only there were threatned; in the Gospel Christ added the menaces of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> evills, spirituall and eternall.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The great evill of the <hi>Jews</hi> was their abscission and cutting off from being Gods people, to which eternall damnation answers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us; and as sicknesse, and war, and other intermediall evills were lesser strokes in order to the finall anger of God against their Nation, so are these and spirituall evills intermediall, in order to the Eternall destruction of sinning and unrepenting Christians.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When God had visited any of the sinners of <hi>Israel</hi> with a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sicknesse, then they lay under the evil of their sin, and were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not pardoned till God took away the sicknesse; but the taking the evill away, the evill of the punishment, was the pardon of the sin; <hi>to pardon the sin is to spare the sinner:</hi> and this appears; For when Christ had said to the man sick of the palsey, <hi>Son thy sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 2.</note> 
               <hi>thee,</hi> the Pharisees accused him of blasohemy, because none had power to forgive sins but God onely; Christ to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe gives them an ocular demonstration, and proves his words: <hi>that yee may know the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins, he saith to the man sick of the palsey, Arise and walk;</hi> then he pardoned the sin, when he took away the sicknesse, and proved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the power by reducing it to act; for if pardon of sins be any thing else, it must be <hi>easier</hi> or <hi>harder:</hi> if it be <hi>easier,</hi> then sin hath not so much evill in it as a sicknesse, which no Religion as yet ever taught. If it be <hi>harder,</hi> then Christs power to doe that which was harder, could not be proved by doing that which was easier. It remaines therefore, that it is the same thing to take the punishment away, as to procure or give the pardon; because as the retaining the sin was an obligation to the evill of punishment, so the remitting the sin is the disobliging to its penalty. So farre then the case is manifest. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The next step is this, that although in the Gospel God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes sinners with temporall judgements, and sicknesses, and deaths, with sad accidents, and evill Angels, and messengers of wrath; yet besides these lesser strokes, he hath scorpions to chastise, and loads of worse evils to oppresse the disobedient; he punishes one sin with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48497:58"/>
another, vile acts with evill habits, these with a hard heart, and this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with obstinacy, and obstinacy with impenitence, and impenitence with damnation. Now because the worst of evills which are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to us are such which consign to hell by persevering in sin, as God takes off our love and our affections, our relations and bondage under sin, just in the same degree he pardons us; because the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sin being taken off and pardoned, there can remaine no guilt. Guiltinesse is an unsignificant word, if there be no obligation to punishment. Since therefore spirituall evils, and progressions in sin, and the spirit of reprobation, and impenitence, and accursed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and perseverance in iniquity are the worst of evils, when these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are taken off, the sin hath lost its venome, and appendant curse; for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sin passes on to eternall death onely by the line of impenitence, and it can never carry us to hell, if we repent timely and effectually; in the same degree therefore that any man leaves his sin, just in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree he is pardoned, and he is sure of it. For although curing the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall evill was the pardon of sins among the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet wee must reckon our pardon by curing the spirituall. If I have sinned against God in the shamefull crime of Lust, then God hath pardoned my sins, when upon my repentance and prayers he hath given me the grace of Chastity. My Drunkennesse is forgiven, when I have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> acquir'd the grace of Temperance, and a sober spirit. My Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse shall no more be a damning sin, when I have a loving and charitable spirit; loving to do good, and despising the world: for every further degree of sin being a neerer step to hell, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence the worst punishment of sin, it follows inevitably, that according as we are put into a contrary state, so are our degrees of pardon, and the worst punishment is already taken off. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall find that the great blessing, and pardon, and redemption which Christ wrought for us, is called <hi>sanctification, holinesse,</hi> and <hi>turning us away from our sins:</hi> So St. <hi>Peter, Yee know that you</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>your vain conversation;</hi> that's your redemption, that's your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: you were taken from your sinfull state, that was the state of death, this of life and pardon; and therefore they are made <hi>Synonyma</hi> by the same Apostle, <hi>According as his divine power hath given us all things that pertain to life and godlinesse: to live</hi> and <note place="margin">2 Ep. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>to be godly,</hi> is all one; <hi>to remain in sin</hi> and <hi>abide in death,</hi> is all one; to <hi>redeem us from sin,</hi> is to snatch us from hell; he that gives us godlinesse, gives us life, and that supposes pardon, or the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rites of eternall death: and this was the conclusion of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, and the summe totall of our redemption and of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 3. 26.</note> our pardon; <hi>God having raised up his Son, sent him to blesse us in turning away every one of you from your iniquity;</hi> this is the end of Christs passion and bitter death, the purpose of all his and all our preaching, the effect of baptisme, <hi>purging, washing, sanctifying;</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48497:58"/>
the work of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the same body <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that was broken, and the same blood that was shed for our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, is to conform us into his image and likenesse of living and dying, of doing and suffering; The case is plain, just as we leave our sins, so Gods wrath shall be taken from us; as we get the graces contrary to our former vices, so infallibly we are consign'd to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. If therefore you are in contestation against sin; while you dwell in difficulty, and sometimes yeeld to sin, and sometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, your pardon is uncertain, and is not discernible in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse; but when sin is mortified and your lusts are dead, and under the power of grace, and you are <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> all your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fears concerning your state of pardon are causelesse, and afflictive without reason; but so long as you live at the old rate of lust or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, of covetousnesse or vanity, of tyranny or oppression, of carelesnesse or irreligion, flatter not your selves, you have no more reason to hope for pardon then a begger for a Crown, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned criminall to be made Heir apparent to that Prince whom he would traiterously have slain.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They have great reason to fear concerning their condition, who having been in the state of grace, who having begun to lead a good life, and give their names to God by solemne deliberate acts of will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and understanding, and made some progresse in the way of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if they shall retire to folly, and unravell all their holy vows, and commit those evils from which they formerly run as from a fire or inundation, their case hath in it so many evills that they have great reason to fear the anger of God, and concerning the finall issue of their souls. For return to folly hath in it many evils beyond the common state of sin and death; and such evils which are most contrary to the hopes of pardon. 1. He that falls back into those sins he hath repented of, does <hi>grieve the holy Spirit of God by which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>he was sealed to the day of redemption.</hi> For so the <hi>Antithesis</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> plain and obvious; If <hi>at the conversion of a sinner there is joy before</hi> the beatified Spirits, <hi>the Angels of God,</hi> and that is the consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our pardon and our consignation to felicity, then we may imagine how great an evill it is to <hi>grieve the Spirit of God,</hi> who is greater then the Angels. The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were carefully warned that they should not offend the Angel: <hi>Behold, I send an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>

enemy to Gods servants; if you grieve Gods Spirit, you cast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him out; for he cannot dwell with sorrow and grieving; unlesse it be such a sorrow which by the way of vertue passes on to joy and never ceasing felicity.

Fear is the duty we owe to God as being the God of power and Justice, the great Judge of heaven and earth, the avenger of the cause of Widows, the Patron of the poor, and the Advocate of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, a mighty God and terrible, and so essentiall an enemy to sin, that he spared not his own Son, but gave him over to death, and to become a sacrifice, when he took upon him our Nature, and became a person obliged for our guilt. <hi>Fear</hi> is the great bridle of intemperance, the modesty of the spirit, and the restraint of gaieties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and dissolutions; it is the <hi>girdle</hi> to the soul, and the handmaid to repentance, the arrest of sin, and the cure or antidote to the spirit of reprobation; it preserves our apprehensions of the divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and hinders our single actions from combining to sinfull habits; it is the mother of consideration, and the nurse of sober counsels, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48497:62"/>
it puts the soul to fermentation and activity, making it to passe from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> trembling to caution, from caution to carefulnesse, from carefulnesse to watchfulnesse, from thence to prudence, and by the gates and progresses of repentance, it leads the soul on to love, and to felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to joyes in God that shall never cease again. Fear is the guard of a man in the dayes of prosperity, and it stands upon the watch-towers and spies the approaching danger, and gives war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to them that laugh loud, and feast in the chambers of rejoycing, where a man cannot consider by reason of the noises of wine, and jest, and musick: and if prudence takes it by the hand, and leads it on to duty, it is a state of grace, and an universall instrument to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> infant Religion, and the only security of the lesse perfect persons; and in all senses is that homage we owe to God who sends often to demand it, even then when he speaks in thunder, or smites by a plague, or awakens us by threatning, or discomposes our easinesse by sad thoughts, and tender eyes, and fearfull hearts, and trembling considerations.</p>
            <p>But this so excellent grace is soon abused in the best and most tender spirits; in those who are softned by Nature and by Religion, by infelicities or ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, by sudden accidents or a sad soul; and the Devill observing, that fear like spare diet starves the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of lust, and quenches the flames of hell, endevours to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this abstinence so much as to starve the man, and break the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into timorousnesse and scruple, sadnesse and unreasonable trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, credulity and trifling observation, suspicion and false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of God; and then vice being turned out at the gate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in at the postern, and does the work of hell and death by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too inconsiderately in the paths which seem to lead to heaven. But so have I seen a harmlesse dove made dark with an artificiall night, and her eyes ceel'd and lock'd up with a little quill, soaring upward and flying with amazement, fear and an undiscerning wing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> she made toward heaven, but knew not that she was made a train and an instrument, to teach her enemy to prevail upon her and all her defencelesse kindred: so is a superstitious man, zealous and blinde, forward and mistaken, he runs towards heaven as he thinks, but he chooses foolish paths; and out of fear takes any thing that he is told or fancies; and guesses concerning God by measures ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his own diseases and imperfections. But fear when it is inordinate, is never a good counsellor, nor makes a good friend; and he that fears God as his enemy is the most compleatly mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable person in the world. For if he with reason beleeves God to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be his enemy, then the man needs no other argument to prove that he is undone then this, that the fountain of blessing (in this state in which the man is) will never issue any thing upon him but cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. But if he fears this without reason, he makes his fears true by the very suspicion of God, doing him dishonour, and then do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48497:63"/>
those fond and trifling acts of jealousie which will make God to be what the man feared he already was; We do not know God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> if we can think any hard thing concerning him. If God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, let us only fear to offend him; but then let us never be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that he will destroy us when we are carefull not to displease him. There are some persons so miserable and scrupulous, such perpetuall tormentors of themselves with unnecessary fears, that their meat and drink is a snare to their consciences; if they eat, they fear they are gluttons, if they fast, they fear they are hypocrites, and if they would watch, they complain of sleep as of a deadly sin; and every temptation though resisted, makes them cry for pardon; and every return of such an accident, makes them think God is angry; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and every anger of God will break them in pieces.</p>
            <p>These persons do not beleeve noble things concerning God, they do not think that he is as ready to pardon them, as they are to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a sinning servant; they do not beleeve how much God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in mercy, nor how wise he is to consider and to make abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our unavoidable infirmities; they make judgement of themselves by the measures of an Angell, and take the accounts of God by the proportions of a Tyrant. The best that can be said concerning such persons is, that they are hugely tempted, or huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant. For although <hi>ignorance</hi> is by some persons named <hi>the</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>mother of devotion;</hi> yet if it fals in a hard ground, it is <hi>the mother of Atheisme,</hi> if in a soft ground, it is <hi>the parent of superstition:</hi> but if it proceeds from evill or mean opinions of God, (as such scruples and unreasonable fears do many times) it is an evill of a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and in some sense, and if it were in equall degrees, is as bad as Atheisme; for he that sayes there was no such man as <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> does him lesse displeasure, then he that sayes there was, but that he was a Tyrant, and a bloudy parricide. And the <hi>Cimmerians</hi> were not esteemed impious for saying that there was no sun in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> heavens; But <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> was esteemed irreligious for saying the sun was a very stone: And though to deny there is a God is a high impiety and intolerable, yet: he sayes worse, who beleeving there is a God sayes, he delights in humane sacrifices, in miseries and death, in tormenting his servants, and punishing their very infelicities and unavoidable mischances. To be God, and to be essentially and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely good, is the same thing, and therefore to deny either is to be reckoned among the greatest crimes in the world.</p>
            <p>Adde to this, that he that is afraid of God, cannot in that disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion love him at all; for what delight is there in that religion which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> drawes me to the Altar as if I were going to be sacrificed, or to the Temples as to the Dens of Bears? <hi>Oderunt quos metuunt, sed colunt tamen:</hi> whom men fear they hate certainly, and flatter readily, and worship timorously; and he that saw <hi>Hermolaus</hi> converse with <hi>Alexander;</hi> and <hi>Pausanias</hi> follow <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Macedonian;</hi> or <hi>Chaereas</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:48497:63"/>
kissing the feet of <hi>Cajus Caligula</hi> would have observed how sordid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> men are made with fear, and how unhappy and how hated Tyrants are in the midst of those acclamations, which are loud, and forc'd, and unnaturall, and without love or fair opinion. And therefore although the <hi>Atheist</hi> sayes there is no God, the <hi>scrupulous, fearfull,</hi> and <hi>superstitious man</hi> does heartily wish what the other does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
            <p>But that the evill may be proportionable to the folly, and the punishment to the crime, there is no man more miserable in the world, then the man who fears God as his enemy, and Religion as a snare, and duty as intolerable, and the Commandements as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and his Judge as implacable, and his anger as certain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable, and unavoidable: whither shall this man goe? where shall he lay his burden? where shall he take sanctuary? for he fears the Altars as the places where his soul bleeds and dies; and God who is his Saviour he looks upon as his enemy; and because he is Lord of all, the miserable man cannot change his service un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be apparently for a worse. And therefore of all the evils of the minde, <hi>fear</hi> is certainly the worst and the most intolerable; <hi>levity</hi> and <hi>rashnesse</hi> have in it some spritefulnesse, and greatnesse of action; <hi>anger</hi> is valiant; <hi>desire</hi> is busie and apt to hope; <hi>creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is oftentimes entertain'd and pleased with images and appearances: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> But <hi>fear</hi> is dull, and sluggish, and treacherous, and flattering, and dissembling, and miserable, and foolish. Every false opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God is pernicious and dangerous; but if it be joyned with trouble of spirit, as fear, scruple or superstition are, it is like a wound with an inflamation, or a strain of a sinew with a contusion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the part, painfull and unsafe; it puts on to actions when it self is driven; it urges reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and circumscribes it, and makes it pityable, and ridiculous in its consequent follies; which if we consider it, will sufficiently reprove the folly, and declare the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> danger.</p>
            <p>Almost all ages of the world have observed many instances of fond perswasions and foolish practises proceeding from violent fears and scruples in matter of Religion. <hi>Diomedon</hi> and many other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were condemned to dye, because after a great <hi>Naval victory</hi> they pursued the flying enemies, and did not first bury their dead. But <hi>Chabrias</hi> in the same case first buryed the dead, and by that time the enemy rallyed, and returned and beat his Navy, and made his masters pay the price of their importune superstition; they fear'd where they should not, and where they did not, they should. From <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hence proceeds observation of signs, and unlucky dayes; and the people did so when the <hi>Gregorian</hi> account began, continuing to call those unlucky dayes which were so signed in their tradition or <hi>Erra pater,</hi> although the day upon this account fell 10 dayes soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and men were transported with many other trifling contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48497:64"/>
and little accidents; which when they are one entertain'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by weaknesse, prevail upon their own strength, and in sad natures and weak spirits have produced effects of great danger and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. <hi>Aristodemas</hi> King of the <hi>Messenians</hi> in his warre against the <hi>Spartans,</hi> prevented the sword of the enemies by a violence done upon himself, only because his dogs howl'd like wolves, and the Soothsayers were afraid because the <hi>Briony</hi> grew up by the wals of his Fathers house: and <hi>Nicias</hi> Generall of the <hi>Athenian</hi> forces sate with his armes in his bosome, and suffered himself and 40000 men tamely to fall by the insolent enemy, only because he was afraid of the labouring and eclipsed Moon. When the Marble statues in <hi>Rome</hi> did sweat (as naturally they did against all rainy weather) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the <hi>Augures</hi> gave an alarum to the City; but if lightning struck the spire of the Capitoll, they thought <hi>the summe of affairs,</hi> and the Commonwealth it self was indanger'd. And this <hi>Heathen folly</hi> hath stuck so close to the <hi>Christian,</hi> that all the Sermons of the Church for 1600 years have not cured them all: But the practises of weaker people and the artifice of ruling Priests have superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many new ones. When Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> sang Masse at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and some few drops from the Chalice were spilt upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was thought to foretell mischief, warres, and bloud, to all Christendome, though it was nothing but carelesnesse and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the Priest: and because <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> sang the Masse of <hi>Requiem</hi> upon the day he was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to his Prince, it was thought to foretell his own death by that religious office: and if men can listen to such whispers, and have not reason and observation enough to confute such trifles, they shall still be afrighted with the noise of birds, and every night-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shall foretell evill as <hi>Micaiah</hi> to the King of Israel, and every old woman shall be a Prophetesse, and the events of humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs which should be managed by the conduct of counsell, of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and religion, shall succeed by chance, by the slight of birds, and the meeting with an evill eye, by the falling of the salt, or the decay of reason, of wisdome, and the just religion of a man.</p>
            <p>To this may be reduc'd the observation of dreams, and fears commenced from the fancies of the night. For the superstitious man does not rest, even when he sleeps, neither is he safe because dreams usually are false, but he is afflicted for fear they should tell true. Living and waking men have one world in common, they use the same air and fire, and discourse by the same principles of Logick and reason; but men that are asleep have every one a world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to himself, and strange perceptions; and the superstitious hath none at all; his reason sleeps, and his fears are waking, and all his rest, and his very securities to the fearfull man turn into afrights and insecure expectation of evils, that never shall happen; they make their rest uneasie and chargeable, and they still vex their weary

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and therefore if the sleep be troublesome, the mans cares be without remedy till they be quite destroyed. Dreams follow the temper of the body, and commonly proceed from trouble or disease, businesse or care, an active head and a restlesse minde, from fear or hope, from wine or passion, from fulnesse or emptinesse, from phantastick remembrances or from som <hi>Daemon</hi> good or bad: they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rule and without reason, they are as contingent as if a man should study to make a Prophesie, and by saying 10000 things may hit upon one true, which was therefore not foreknown though it was forespoken: and they have no certainty because they have no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> causality nor proportion to those effects which many times they are said to foresignifie. The dream of the yolk of an egge importeth gold (saith <hi>Artemidorus)</hi> and they that use to remember such phantastick idols are afraid to lose a friend when they dream their teeth shake, when naturally it will rather signifie <hi>a scurvy;</hi> for a naturall indisposition and an imperfect sense of the beginning of a disease, may vex the fancy into a symbolicall representation; for so the man that dreamt he swam against a stream of bloud, had a Plurisie beginning in his side: and he that dreamt he dipt his foot in water, and that it was turn'd to a Marble, was intic'd into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fancie by a beginning dropsie: and if the events do answer in one instance, we become credulous in twenty; for want of reason we discourse our selves into folly and weak observation, and give the Devill power over us in those circumstances in which we can least resist him. <gap reason="foreign">

Let the grounds of our actions be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, beginning upon reason, proceeding with prudence, measured by the common lines of men, and confident upon the expectation of an usuall providence.

For though it be lawfull to be afraid in a storm, yet it is not lawfull to leap into the sea; though we may be more carefull for our fears, yet we must be faithfull too; and we may flie from the persecution till it overtakes us, but when it does, we must not change our Religion for our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or leave the robe of Baptisme in the hand of the tempter, and run away <hi>by all means.</hi> St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> for 46 years did run and fight, he disputed with the <hi>Arrians</hi> and fled from their Officers; and that flies, may be a man worth preserving, if he bears his faith along with him, and leaves nothing of his duty behinde; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when duty and life cannot stand together, he that then flies a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by delivering up his soul, is one that hath no charity, no love to God, no trust in promises, no just estimation of the rewards of a noble contention. <hi>Perfect love casts out fear</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) that is, he that loves God will not fear to dye for him, or for his sake to be poor. In this sense no man can fear man and love God at the same time; and when St. <hi>Laurence</hi> triumph'd over <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerianus,</hi> St. <hi>Sebastian</hi> over <hi>Diocletian,</hi> St. <hi>Vincentius</hi> over <hi>Dacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and the armies of Martyrs over the <hi>Proconsuls,</hi> accusers, and executioners, they shew'd their love to God by triumphing over <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> fear, and <hi>leading captivity captive</hi> by the strength of their Captain, whose <hi>garments were red from Bozrah.</hi>

               <hi>visu formae,</hi> the sight seems full of horror, but touch them and they are very nothing, the meer daughters of a sick brain, and a weak heart, an infant experience and a trifling judgement: so are the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions of a weak piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or an unskilfull unconsident soul; they fancy to see mountains of difficulty, but touch them and they seem like clouds riding upon the wings of the winde, and put on shapes as we please to dream. He that denies to give almes for fear of being poor, or to entertain a Disciple for fear of being suspected of the party, or to own a duty for fear of being put to venture for a crown, he that takes part of the intemperance because he dares not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the company, or in any sense fears the fears of the world, and not the fear of God, this man enters into his portion of fear betimes, but it will not be finished to eternall ages. To fear the censures of men when God is your Judge, to fear their evill when God is your defence, to fear death when he is the entrance to life and felicity, is unreasonable and pernicious; but if you will turn your passion into duty, and joy, and security, fear to offend God, to enter voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into temptation, fear the alluring face of lust, and the smooth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of intemperance, fear the anger of God when you have deserved it, and when you have recover'd from the share, then infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fear to return into that condition, in which whosoever dwels is the heir of fear and eternall sorrow.</p>
            <p>Thus farre I have discoursed concerning good fear and bad, that is, <hi>filiall</hi> and <hi>servile:</hi> they are both good, if by <hi>servile</hi> we intend <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall</hi> or the new beginning fear of penitents; a fear to offend God upon lesse perfect considerations: But <hi>servile</hi> fear is vitious when it still retains the affection of slaves, and when its effects are hatred, wearinesse, displeasure, and want of charity: and of the same cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are those fears which are superstitious, and worldly.</p>
            <p>But to the former sort of vertuous fear, some also adde another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which they call <hi>Angelicall,</hi> that is, such a fear as the blessed Angels have, who before God hide their faces, and tremble at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and <hi>fall down before his footstool,</hi> and are ministers of his anger and messengers of his mercy, and night and day worship him with the profoundest adoration. This is the same that is spoken of in the Text: <hi>Let us serve God with reverence and godly fear;</hi> all holy fear partakes of the nature of this which Divines call <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> and it is expressed in acts of adoration, of vowes, and holy prayers, in hymnes, and psalmes, in the eucharist and reverentiall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses; and while it proceeds in the usuall measures of common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> duty, it is but <hi>humane;</hi> but as it arises to great degrees, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it is <hi>Angelicall</hi> and <hi>Divine;</hi> and then it appertains to <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Theologie,</hi> and therefore is to be considered in another place; but for the present, that which will regularly concern all our duty, is this, that when the fear of God is the instrument of our duty,

or Gods worship, the greater it is, it is so much the better. It was an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> old proverbiall saying among the <hi>Romans, Religentem esse oportet, religiosum, nefas; Every excesse in the actions of religion is crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;</hi> they supposing that in the services of their gods, there might be too much. True it is, there may be too much of their unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent expressions, and in things indifferent, the very multitude is too much, and becomes an undecency: and if it be in its own nature undecent or disproportionable to the end, or the rules, or the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Religion, it will not stay for numbers to make it intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but in the direct actions of glorifying God, in doing any thing of his Commandements, or any thing which he commands, or counsels, or promises to reward, there can never be excesse or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> superfluity: and therefore in these cases, <hi>do as much as you can;</hi> take care that your expressions be prudent, and safe, consisting with thy other duties; and for the passions or vertues themselves, let them passe from beginning to great progresses, from man to Angel, from the imperfection of man to the perfections of the sons of God; and when ever we go beyond the bounds of Nature, and grow up with all the extention, and in the very commensuration of a full grace, we shall never go beyond the excellencies of God: For ornament may be too much, and turn to curiosity; cleanlinesse may be changed into nicenesse; and civill compliance may become flattery; and mobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of tongue may rise into garrulity; and fame and honour may be great unto envie; and health it self, if it be athletick, may by its very excesse become dangerous: but wisdome, and duty, and comelinesse, and discipline, a good minde, and eloquence, and the fear of God, and doing honour to his holy Name, can never exceed: but if they swell to great proportions, they passe through the measures of grace, and are united to felicity in the comprehensions of God, in the joyes of an eternall glory.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the beginning of days Man hath been so crosse to the Divine commandements, that in many cases there can be no reason given why a man should choose some ways, or doe some actions, but onely because they are forbidden; When God bade the <hi>Isaaelites</hi> rise and goe up against the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and possesse the Land, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they would not stirre; the men were <hi>Anakims,</hi> and the Cities were impregnable, and there was a <hi>Lyon in the way;</hi> but presently after, when God forbad them to goe, they would and did goe, though they died for it. I shall not need to instance in particulars, when the whole life of man is a perpetuall contradiction; and the state of Disobedience is called the <hi>contradiction of Sinners;</hi> even the man in the Gospell that had two sons, they both crossed him, even he that obeyed him, and he that obeyed him not: for the one said, he would, and did not; the other said, he would not, and did: and so doe we; we promise faire, and doe nothing; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they that doe best are such as come out of darknesse into light, such as said <hi>they would not,</hi> and at last have better bethought themselves; And who can guesse at any other reason why men should refuse to be temperate? for he that refuses the commandement, first does vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the commandement, and puts on a proeternaturall appetite,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48497:67"/>
he spoils his health, and he spoils his understanding; he brings to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> himself a world of diseases, and a healthlesse constitution, smart and sickly nights, a loathing stomach, and a staring eye, a giddy brain, and a swell'd belly, gouts and dropsies, catarrhes and oppila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If God should enjoyne man to suffer all this, heaven and earth should have heard our complaints against unjust laws, and <hi>impossible commandements:</hi> for we complain already, even when God commands us to drink so long as it is good for us; this is one of his impossible laws: it is impossible for us to know when we are dry, or when we need drink; for if we doe know, I am sure it is possible enough, not to lift up the wine to our heads. And when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our blessed Saviour hath commanded us to love our enemies, we think we have so much reason against it, that God will easily excuse our disobedience in this case, and yet there are some enemies whom God hath commanded us not to love, and those we dote on, we cherish and feast them, and as S. <hi>Paul</hi> in another case, <hi>upon our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely parts we bestow more abundant comelinesse.</hi> For whereas our body it self is a servant to our soule, we make it <hi>the heir of all things,</hi> and treat it here already, as if it were in <hi>Majority;</hi> and make that which at the best was but a weak friend, to become a strong enemy; and hence proceed the vices of the worst, and the follies and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the best; the spirit is either in slavery, or in weaknesse, and when the flesh is not strong to mischief, it is weak to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and even to the Apostles our blessed Lord said, <hi>the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</hi>

            <p>There is nothing that creeps upon the earth, nothing that ever God made, weaker then Man; for God fitted Horses and Mules with strength, Bees and Pismires with sagacity, Harts and Hares with swiftnesse, Birds with feathers and a light aëry body; and they all know their times, and are fitted for their work, and regularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the proper end of their creation; but man that was designed to an immortall duration, and the fruition of God for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knows <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not how to obtain it; he is made upright to look up to heaven, but he knows no more how to purchase it then to climbe it. Once, man went to make an ambitious tower to outreach the clouds, or the praeternaturall risings of the water, but could not do it; he cannot promise himself the daily bread of his necessity upon the stock of his own wit or industry; and for going to heaven, he was so far from doing that naturally, that as soon as ever he was made he became the son of death, and he knew not how to get a pardon for eating of an apple against the Divine commandement: <gap reason="foreign">

The Divine love must come upon us and snatch us from our imperfection, enlighten our understanding, move and stirre our affections, open the gates of heaven, turn our nature into grace, entirely forgive our former prevarications, take us by the hand, and lead us all along, and we onely contribute our assent unto it; just as a childe when he is tempted to learne to goe, and called upon, and guided, and upheld, and constrain'd to put his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> feet to the ground, lest he feel the danger by the smart of a fall; just so is our nature and our state of flesh. God teaches us, and invites us, he makes us willing and then makes us able, he lends us helps, and guides our hands, and feet; and all the way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains us, but yet so as a reasonable creature can be constrained; that is, made willing with arguments, and new inducements, by a state of circumstances, and conditionall necessities: and as this is a great glorification of the free grace of God, and declares our manner of cooperation, so it represents our nature to be weak as a childe, ignorant as infancy, helplesse as an orphan, averse as an uninstructed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> person, in so geat degrees that God is forced to bring us to a holy life by arts great and many as the power and principles of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; with this onely difference, that the subject matter and object of this new creation is a free agent; in the first it was purely obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiall and passive; and as the passion of the first was an effect of the same power that reduced it to act; so the freedome of the second is given us in our nature by him that onely can reduce it to act; for it is a freedome that cannot therefore choose, because it does not understand, nor taste, nor perceive the things of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must by Gods grace be reduced to action, as at first the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> whole matter of the world was by Gods Almightynesse; for so God worketh in us to will and to doe of his owne good pleasure.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Let him but have money for rehearsing his Comedy, he cares not whether you like it or no; and if a temptation of money comes strong and violent, you may <hi>as well tye a wilde dog to quietuesse with the guts of a tender Kid,</hi> as suppose that most men can doe vertuously when they may sin at a great price. Men avoyd po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, not onely because it hath some inconveniencies; for they are few and little; but because it is the nurse of vertue; they run <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from it as Children from strict Parents and Tutors, from those that would confine them to reason, and sober counsels, that would make them labour, that they may become pale and lean, that they may become wise: but because <hi>Riches</hi> is attended by pride and lust, tyranny and oppression, and hath in its hand all that it hath in its heart; and Sin waits upon Wealth ready dress'd and fit for action, therefore in some temptations they confesse how little their souls are, they cannot stand that assault; but because this passion is the daughter of Voluptuousnesse, and very often is but a servant sin, ministring to sensuall pleasures, the great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the flesh is more seen in the matter of carnall crimes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

But the weaknesse of the flesh, and the empire of lust is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in nothing so much, as in the captivity and folly of wise men. For you shall see some men fit to governe a Province, sober in their counsells, wise in the conduct of their affaires, men of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and reason, fit to sit with Princes, or to treat concerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> peace and warre, the fate of Empires, and the changes of the world, yet these men shall fall at the beauty of a woman as a man dies at the blow of an Angell, or gives up his breath at the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and decree of God. Was not <hi>Solomon</hi> glorious in all things but when he bowed to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s daughter, and then to Devils? and is it not published by the sentence and observation of all the world, that the bravest men have been softned into effeminacy by the lisping charms, and childish noyses of Women and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect persons? A faire slave bowed the neck of stout <hi>Polydamas,</hi> which was stiffe and inflexible to the contentions of an enemy: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and suppose a man set like the brave boy of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media</hi> in the midst of temptation by a witty beauty, tyed upon a bed with silk and pretty violences, courted with musick and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, with promises and easie postures, invited by opportunity and importunity, by rewards and impunity, by privacy and a

guard; what would his nature doe in this throng of evils and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vile circumstances? The grace of God secur'd the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Spirit rode in triumph; but what can <hi>flesh</hi> do in such a day of danger? Is it not necessary that we take in auxiliaries from Reason and Religion, from heaven and earth, from observation and experience, from hope and fear, and cease to be what we are, lest we become what we ought not? It is certain that in the cases of temptations to voluptuousnesse, a man is naturally, as the Prophet said of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> like a Pigeon that hath no heart, no courage, no conduct, no resolution, no discourse, but falls as the water of <hi>Nilus</hi> when it comes to its cataracts, it falls infinitely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restraint; And if we consider how many drunken meetings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Sunne sees every day, how many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Markets and Faires and Clubs, that is, so many solemnities of drunkennesse, are at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant under the eye of heaven; that many <hi>Nations</hi> are marked for intemperance, and that it is lesse noted because it is so popular, and universall, and that even in the midst of the glories of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity there are so many persons drunk, or too full with meat, or greedy of lust, even now that the Spirit of God is given to us to make us sober, and temperate, and chaste, we may well imagine, since all men have flesh, and all men have not the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> spirit, the flesh is the parent of sin, and death, and it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else.</p>
            <p>And it is no otherwise when we are tempted with pain. We are so impatient of pain, that nothing can reconcile us to it; not the laws of God, not the necessities of nature, not the society of all our kindred, and of all the world, not the interest of vertue, not the hopes of heaven; we will submit to pain upon no terms, but the basest and most dishonorable; for if sin bring us to pain, or affront, or sicknesse, we choose that, so it be in the retinue of a lust, and a base desire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we accuse Nature, and blaspheme God, we murmur and are impatient when pain is sent to us from him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that ought to send it, and intends it as a mercy when it comes. But in the matter of afflictions and bodily sicknesse we are so weak and broken, so uneasie and unapt to sufferance, that this alone is beyond the cure of the old Philosophy. Many can endure poverty, and many can retire from shame and laugh at home, and very many can endure to be slaves; but when pain and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse are to be endured for the interests of vertue, we finde but few Martyrs; and they that are, suffer more within themselves by their fears and their temptations, by their uncertain purposes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> violences to Nature, then by the Hang-mans sword; the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is within; and then he hath won his Crown, not when he hath suffered the blow, but when he hath overcome his fears, and made his spirit conqueror. It was a sad instance of our infirmity, when of the 40 Martyrs of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> set in a freezing lake, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

consummate, and an Angell was reaching the Crowne, and placing it upon their brows, the flesh fail'd one of them, and drew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the spirit after it; and the man was called off from his Scene of noble contention, and dyed in warm water:</p>

            </q>
            <p>We carry about us the body of death, and we bring evils upon our selves by our follies, and then know not how to bear them; and the flesh forsakes the spirit. And indeed in sicknesse the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity is so very great, that God in a manner at that time hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> reduced all Religion into one vertue, <hi>Patience</hi> with its appendages is the summe totall of almost all our duty that is proper to the days of sorrow: and we shall find it enough to entertain all our powers, and to imploy all our aids; the counsels of wise men, and the comforts of our friends, the advices of Scripture, and the results of experience, the graces of God, and the strength of our own resolutions are all then full of imployments, and find it work enough to secure that one grace. For then it is that a cloud is wrapped about our heads, and our reason stoops under sorrow, the soul is sad, and its instrument is out of tune, the auxiliaries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are disorder'd, and every thought sits heavily, then a comfort cannot make the body feel it, and the soule is not so abstracted to rejoyce much without its partner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that the proper joyes of the soul, such as are hope, and wise discourses, and satisfactions of reason, and the offices of Religion, are felt, just as we now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the joyes of heaven, with so little relish, that it comes as news of a victory to a man upon the Rack, or the birth of an heir to one condemned to dye; he hears a story which was made to delight him, but it came when he was dead to joy and all its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and therefore sicknesse, though it be a good <hi>Monitor,</hi> yet it is an ill stage to act some vertues in; and a good man cannot <hi>then</hi> doe much, and therefore he that is in the state of flesh and blood, can doe nothing at all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But in these considerations we find our nature in disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; and a strong man may be overcome when a stronger comes to disarme him; and pleasure and pain are the violences of choice and chance; but it is no better in any thing else: for nature is weak in all its strengths, and in its fights, at home, and abroad, in its actions and passions; we love some things violently, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hate others unreasonably; any thing can fright us when we should be confident, and nothing can scare us when we ought to feare; the breaking of a glasse puts us into a supreme anger, and we are dull and indifferent as a <hi>Stoick</hi> when we see God dishonour'd; we passionately desire our preservation, and yet we violently destroy

our selves, and will not be hindred; we cannot deny a friend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> when he tempts us to sin and death, and yet we daily deny God when he passionately invites us to life and health; we are greedy after money, and yet spend it vainly upon our lusts; we hate to see any man flatter'd but our selves; and we can endure folly if it be on our side, and a sin for our interest; we desire health, and yet we exchange it for wine and madnesse; we sink when a persecution comes, and yet cease not daily to persecute our selves, doing mischiefs worse then the sword of Tyrants, and great as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of a Devill.</p>

But to summe up all the evills that can be spoken of the infirmities of the flesh; the proper nature and habitudes of men are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> so foolish and impotent, so averse and peevish to all good, that a mans will is of it self onely free to choose evils. Neither is it a contradiction to say <hi>liberty,</hi> and yet <hi>suppose it determin'd to one object onely;</hi> because that one object is the thing we choose. For although God hath set life and death before us, fire and water, good and evill, and hath primarily put man into the hands of his owne counsell, that he might have chosen good as well as evill, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did not, but fell into an evill condition and corrupted manners, and grew in love with it, and infected all his children with vicious examples; and all nations of the world have contracted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> some universall stains, and <hi>the thoughts of mans hearts are onely evill, and that continually,</hi> and <hi>there is not one that doth good, no not one that sinneth not:</hi> since (I say) all the world have sinned, we cannot suppose <hi>a liberty of indifferency</hi> to good and bad; it is impossible in such a liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there should be no variety, that all should choose the same thing; but <hi>a liberty of complacency</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> we may suppose; that is so, that though naturally he might choose good, yet morally he is so determin'd with his love to evill, that good seldome comes into dispute; and a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> runs to evill as he runs to meat or sleep; for why else should it be, that every one can teach a childe to be proud, or to swear, to lie, or to doe little spites to his play-fellow, and can traine him up to infant follies? But the severity of Tutors and the care of Parents, discipline and watchfulnesse, arts and diligence, all is too little to make him love but to say his prayers, or to doe that which becomes persons design'd for honest purposes, and his malice shall out-run his yeares; he shall be a man in villany before he is by law capable of choice or inheritance; and this indisposition lasts upon us for ever, even as long as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we live, just in the same degrees as flesh and blood does rule us: <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In some dispositions that are forward and apt, busie and unquiet, when the grace of God hath taken possessions, and begins to give laws, it seems so pleasant and gay to their undiscerning spirits, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the sottishnesse of lust, and the follies of drunkennesse, that reflecting upon the change, they begin to love themselves too
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48497:71"/>
well, and take delight in the wisdome of the change, and the reasonablenesse of the new life; and then they by hating their own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> follies, begin to despise them that dwell below; It was the tricke of the old Philosophers whom <hi>Aristophanes</hi> thus describes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; pale, and barefoot, and proud; that is, persons singular in their habit, eminent in their institution, proud and pleased in their persons, and despisers of them that are lesse glorious in their vertue then themselves; and for this very thing our blessed Saviour remarks the Pharisees; they were severe and phantasticall advancers of themselves, and Judgers of their neighbors; and here, when they have mortified <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> corporall vices, such which are scandalous and punishable by men, they keep the spirituall, and those that are onely discernible by God: these men doe but change their sin from scandall to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that they may sin more safely they sin more spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes the passions of the flesh spoyle the changes of the Spirit, by naturall excesses, and disproportion of degrees; it mingles violence with industry, and fury with zeale, and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablenesse with reproofe, and censuring with discipline, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with desires, and immortifications in all the appetites and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> prosecutions of the soule. Some think it is enough in all instances, if they pray hugely and fervently; and that it is religion, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to desire a victory over our enemies, or the life of a childe, or an heir to be born; they call it <hi>holy,</hi> so they desire it <hi>in prayer;</hi> that if they reprove a vicious person, they may say what they list, and be as angry as they please; that when they demand but reason, they may enforce it <hi>by all means;</hi> that when they exact duty of their children, they may be imperious and without limit; that if they designe a good end, they may prosecute it by all instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that when they give God thanks for blessings, they may value the thing as high as they list, though their persons come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> into a share of the honour; here the spirit is <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> but the flesh creeps too busily, and insinuates into the substance of good actions, and spoyles them by unhandsome circumstances; and then the prayer is spoil'd for want of prudence of conformity to Gods will, and discipline and government is imbittered by an angry spirit; and the Fathers authority turns into an uneasie load, by being thrust like an unequall burden to one side, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing equall measures to the other: And if we consider it wisely, we shall find that in many good actions the flesh is the bigger ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and we betray our weak constitutions even when we do <hi>Justice</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> or <hi>Charity;</hi> and many men <hi>pray in the flesh,</hi> when they pretend they <hi>pray by the spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In the first changes and weak progresses of our spirituall life, we find a long weaknesse upon us, because we are long before we
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48497:71"/>
begin, and the flesh was powerfull and its habits strong, and it will mingle indirect pretences with all the actions of the spirit; If we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> mean to pray, the flesh thrusts in thoughts of the world; and our tongue speaks one thing and our heart means another; and we are hardly brought to say our prayers, or to undertake a fasting day, or to celebrate a Communion: and if we remember that all these are holy actions, and that we have many opportunities of doing them all, and yet doe them very seldome, and then very coldly, it will be found at the foot of the account, that our flesh and our naturall weaknesse prevailes oftner then our spirituall strengths: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that are bound long in chains feel such a lamenesse in the first resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of their liberty, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by reason of the long accustomed chain and pressure, that they must stay till Nature hath set them free, and the disease be taken off as well as the chain; and when the soul is got free from her actuall pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of sins, still the wound remaines, and a long habitude, and longing after it, a looking back, and upon the presenting the old object, the same company, or the remembrance of the delight, the fancy strikes, and the heart fails, and the temptations returne and stand dressed in form and circumstances, and ten to one but the man dies again. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Some men are wise and know their weaknesses, and to prevent their startings back, will make fierce and strong resolutions, and bind up their gaps with thornes, and make a new hedge about their spirits; and what then? this shews indeed that <hi>the spirit is willing;</hi> but the storm arises, and windes blow, and rain descends, and presently the earth trembles, and the whole fabrick falls into ruine and disorder. A resolution (such as we usually make) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little trench which every childe can step over; and there is no civill man that commits a <hi>willing sin,</hi> but he does it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>against his resolution;</hi> and what Christian lives, that will not say, and think, that he hath repented in some degree; and yet still they commit sin, that is, they break all their holy purposes as readily as they lose a dream; and so great is our weaknesse, that to most men the strength of a resolution is just such a restraint as he suffers who is imprisoned in a curtain, and secured with dores and bars of the finest linnen: for though <hi>the spirit be strong</hi> to resolve, <hi>the flesh is weak</hi> to keep it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But when they have felt their follies, and see the linnen vail rent, some that are desirous to please God, back their <hi>resolutions</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with <hi>vows,</hi> and then the spirit is fortified, and the flesh may tempt and call, but the soul cannot come forth, and therefore it triumphs and acts its interest easily and certainly; and then the flesh is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; It may be so. But doe not many of us inquire after a vow? And we consider it may be it was rash, or it was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48497:72"/>
matter, or without just consideration, and weighing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> circumstances, or the case is alter'd, and there is a new emergent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, or a vow is no more then a resolution made in matter of duty; both are made for God, and in his eye and witnesse; or if nothing will doe it, men grow sad and weary, and despaire, and are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and bite the knot in pieces, with their teeth, which they cannot by disputing, and the arts of the tongue. A vow will not secure our duty, because it is not stronger then our appetite; and the spirit of man is weaker then the habits and superinduced na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the flesh; but by little and little it falls off, like the finest thread twisted upon the traces of a chariot; it cannot hold long. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Beyond all this, some choose excellent guides, and stand within the restraints of modesty, and a severe Monitor; and the Spirit of God hath put a veile upon our spirits, and by <hi>modesty</hi> in women and young persons, by <hi>reputation</hi> in the more aged, and by <hi>honour</hi> in the more noble, and by <hi>conscience</hi> in all, have fortified the spirit of Man, that men dare not prevaricate their duty though they be tempted strongly, and invited perpetually; and this is a partition wall that separates the spirit from the flesh, and keeps it in its proper strengths and retirements. But here the spirit of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> man, for all that it is assisted, strongly breaks from the inclosure, and runnes into societies of flesh, and sometimes despises <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and sometimes supplies it with little arts of flattery, and self-love, and is modest as long as it can be secret, and when it is discovered, it growes impudent; and a man shelters himselfe in crouds and heaps of sinners, and beleeves that it is no worse with him then with other mighty criminals, and publick persons, who bring sin into credit amongst fooles and vicious persons; or else men take false measures of fame or publick honesty, and the world being broken into so many parts of disunion, and agreeing in nothing but in confederate vices, and grown so remisse in governments, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> accounts, every thing is left so loose, that <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick fame, modesty,</hi> and <hi>shame,</hi> are now so slender guards to the spirit, that the flesh breaks in and makes most men more bold against God then against men, and against the laws of Religion, then of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When the spirit is made willing by the grace of God, the flesh interposes in deceptions and false principles. If you tempt some man to a notorious sin, as to rebellion, to deceive his trust, or to be drunk, he will answer, he had rather die then doe it: But put the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sin civilly to him, and let it be disguised with little excuses, such things which indeed are trifles, but yet they are colours fair enough to make a weak pretence, and the spirit yeelds instantly. Most men choose the sin, if it be once disputable whether it be a sin or no? If they can but make an excuse, or a colour, so that it shall not rudely
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48497:72"/>
dash against the conscience with an open professed name of Sin, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they suffer the temptation to doe its worst. If you tempt a man, you must tell him 'tis no sin, or it is excusable: this is not rebellion, but necessity, and selfe defence; it is not against my allegiance, but is a performing of my trust; I doe it for my friend, not against my Superiour; I doe it for a good end, and for his advantage; this is not drunkennesse, but free mirth, and fair society; it is refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and entertainment of some supernumerary hours; but it is not a throwing away my time, or neglecting a day of salvation; and if there be any thing more to say for it, though it be no more then <hi>Adams</hi> fig-leaves, or the excuses of children and truants, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> shall be enough to make the flesh prevail, and the spirit not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; for so great is our folly, that the flesh always carries the cause, if the spirit can be cousen'd.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The flesh is so mingled with the spirit, that we are forced to make distinctions in our appetite, to reconcile our affections to God and Religion, lest it be impossible to doe our duty; we weep for our sins, but we weep more for the death of our dearest friends, or other temporall sadnesses; we say we had rather die then lose our faith, and yet we doe not live according to it; we lose our estates and are impatient, we lose our vertue and bear it well enough; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> what vertue is so great, as more to be troubled for having sin'd, then for being asham'd, and begger'd, and condemn'd to die? Here we are forced to a distinction: there is a <hi>valuation of price,</hi> and a <hi>valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of sense:</hi> or the spirit hath <hi>one rate</hi> of things, and the flesh hath <hi>another;</hi> and what we beleeve the greatest evill, does not alwayes cause to us the greatest trouble; which shews plainly, that we are imperfect carnall persons, and the flesh will in some measure prevaile over the spirit; because we will suffer it in too many instances, and cannot help it in all.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The spirit is abated and interrupted by the flesh, because the flesh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> pretends it is not able to doe those ministeries which are appointed in order to Religion; we are not able to fast, or if we watch, it breeds gouts and catarrhes; or charity is a grace too expensive, our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are too big to do it; or we cannot suffer pain; and <hi>sorrow breeds death,</hi> and therefore our repentances must be more gentle, and we must support our selves in all our calamities: for we cannot beare our crosses without a freer refreshment, and this freedome passes on to licence, and many melancholy persons drowne their sorrows in sin and forgetfulnesse, as if sin were more tolerable then sorrow, and the anger of God an easier load then a temporall care: here the flesh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> betrayes its weaknesse and its follies: For the flesh complains too soon, and the spirit of some men like <hi>Adam</hi> being too fond of his <hi>Eve,</hi> attends to all its murmurs and temptations; and yet the flesh is able to bear farre more then is required of it in usuall duties. Custome of suffering will make us endure much, and <hi>feare</hi> will make
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48497:73"/>
us suffer more, and <hi>necessity</hi> makes us suffer any thing; and <hi>lust</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> makes us to endure more then God is willing we should; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and yet we are nice, and tender, and indulgent to our weaknesses, till our weaknesses grow too strong for us. And what shall we doe to secure our duty, and to be delivered of our selves, that the body of death which we bear about us may not destroy the life of the spirit?</p>
            <p>I have all this while complain'd, and you see not without cause; I shall afterwards tell you the remedies for all this evill. In the mean time, let us have but mean opinions of our selves; let us watch every thing of our selves as of suspected persons, and magnifie the grace of God, and be humbled for our stock and spring of follies, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> let us look up to him who is the fountaine of grace and spirituall strengths.</p>

For our nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was not made evill but by our selves; but yet we are <hi>naturally evill,</hi> that is, by a superinduced nature; just as drunkards and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate persons have made it necessary to drink extremely, and their nature requires it, and it is health to them; they dye without it, because they have made to themselves a new constitution, and <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature,</hi> but much worse then that which God made; their sin made this <hi>new nature;</hi> and this <hi>new nature</hi> makes sin necessary and unavoidable: so it is in all other instances; Our nature is evill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have spoil'd it; and therefore the removing the sin which we have brought in, is the way to cure our nature: for this evill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> nature is not a thing which we cannot avoid; we made it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must help it; but as in the superinducing this evill nature, we were thrust forward by the world and the Devill, by all objects from without, and weaknesse from within; so in the curing it we are to be helped by God and his most holy Spirit.</p>

            <p>Men at first think themselves wise, and are alwaies most confident when they have the least reason; and to morrow they begin to perceive yesterdayes folly, and yet they are not wise; But as the little Embryo in the naturall sheet and lap of its mother, first distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes into a little knot, and that in time will be the heart, and then into a bigger bundle, which after some dayes abode grows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two little spots, and they if cherished by nature will become eyes, and each part by order commences into weak principles, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served with natures greatest curiosity; that it may assist first to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then to order, next to usefulnesse, and from thence to strength, till it arrive at beauty, and a perfect creature: so are the necessities, and so are the discourses of men; we first learn the principles of reason, which breaks obscurely through a cloud, and brings a little light, and then we discern a folly, and by little and little leave it, till that enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the next corner of the soul; and then there is a new discovery; but the soul is still in infancy and childish follies; and every day does but the work of one day; but therefore art, and use, experience, and reason, although they do something, yet they cannot do enough; there must be something else: But this is to be wrought by a new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> principle, that is, by <hi>the Spirit of grace:</hi> Nature and reason alone cannot do it, and therefore the proper cure is to be wrought by those generall means of <hi>inviting</hi> and <hi>cherishing,</hi> of <hi>getting</hi> and <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> Gods Spirit, which when we have observed, we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our selves sufficiently instructed toward the repair of our brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the reformation of our evill nature.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

But then this is not a grace seated finally in the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but the principle that is designed to, and actually productive of a holy life; It is not only a beleeving the propositions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as we beleeve a proposition in the Metaphysicks, concerning which a man is never the honester whether it be true of false; but it is a beleef of things that concern us infinitely, things so great that if they be so true as great, no man that hath his reason and can discourse, that can think and choose, that can desire and work towards an end, can possibly neglect. The great object of our faith, to which all other articles do minister, is, <hi>resurrection of our bodies and souls to eternall life,</hi> and <hi>glories infinite.</hi> Now is it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> possible that a man that beleeves this, and that he may obtain it for himself, and that it was prepared for him, and that God desires to give it him, that he can neglect and despise it, and not work for it, and perform such easie conditions upon which it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? Are not most men of the world made miserable at a lesse price then a thousand pound a year? Do not all the usurers and merchants, all tradesmen and labourers under the Sun toil and care, labour and contrive, venture and plot for a little money, and no man gets, and scarce any man desires so much of it as he can lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three acres of ground; not so much as will fill a great house; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and is this sum, that is such a trifle, such a poor limited heap of dirt, the reward of all the labour, and the end of all the care, and the design of all the malice, and the recompence of all the wars of the world; and can it be imaginable, that life it self, and a long life, an eternall and a happy life, a kingdome, a perfect kingdome, and glorious, that shall never have ending, nor ever shall be abated with rebellion, or fears, or sorrow, or care, that such a kingdome should not be worth the praying for, and quitting of an idle company, and a foolish humour, or a little drink, or a vicious silly woman for it? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> surely men beleeve no such thing. They do not relye upon those fine stories that are read in books, and published by Preachers, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the lawes of all the world. If they did, why do they choose intemperance and a feaver, lust and shame, rebellion and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, pride and a fall, sacriledge and a curse, gain and passion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48497:75"/>
humility and safety, religion and a constant joy, devotion and peace of conscience, justice and a quiet dwelling, charity and a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> blessing, and at the end of all this, a Kingdome more glorious then all the beauties the Sun did ever see. <hi>Fides est velut quoddam aeternitatis exemplar, praeterita simul &amp; praesentia &amp; futura sinu quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam vastissimo comprehendit, ut nihil ei praetereat, nil pereat, praeeat nihil;</hi> Now, <hi>Faith is a certain image of eternity, all things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it, things past and things to come,</hi> are all so before the eyes of faith, that he in whose eye that candle is enkindled, beholds heaven as present, and sees how blessed thing it is to dye in Gods favour, and to be chim'd to our grave with the Musick of a good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> conscience. Faith converses with the Angels, and antedates the hymnes of glory; every man that hath this grace is as certain that there are glories for him, if he perseveres in duty, as if he had heard and sung the thanksgiving Song for the blessed sentence of Dooms-day. And therefore it is no matter if these things are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate and distant objects; none but children and fools are taken with the present trifle, and neglect a distant blessing, of which they have credible and beleeved notices. Did the merchant see the pearls and the wealth he designs to get in the trade of 20 years? And is it possible that a childe should, when he learns the first ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Grammar, know what excellent things there are in learning, whither he designs his labour, and his hopes? We labour for that which is uncertain, and distant, and beleeved, and hoped for with many allaies, and seen with diminution, and a troubled ray; and what excuse can there be that we do not labour for that which is told us by God, and preach'd by his holy Son, and confirmed by miracles, and which Christ himself dyed to purchase, and millions of Martyrs dyed to witnesse, and which we see good men, and wise beleeve with an assent stronger then their evidence, and which they do beleeve because they do love, and love because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they do beleeve? There is nothing to be said; but that faith which did enlighten the blind, and cleanse the Lepers, and wash'd the soul of the <hi>Aethiopian;</hi> that faith that cures the sick, and strengthens the Paralytick, and baptizes the Catechumens, and justifies the faithfull, and repairs the penitent, and confirms the just, and crowns the Martyrs; that faith if it be true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Christian and alive, active and effective in us, is sufficient to appease the storm of our passions, and to instruct all our ignorances, and to <hi>make us wise unto salvation;</hi> it will, if we let it do its first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, chastise our errors, and discover our follies, it will make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> us ashamed of trifling interests, and violent prosecutions, of false principles, and the evill disguises of the world; and then our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will return to the innocence and excellency in which God first estated it; that is, our flesh will be a servant of the soul, and the soul a servant to the spirit; and then, because faith makes <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

But <hi>Prayer is but one part of devotion;</hi> and though of admirable efficacy towards the obtaining this excellent promise, yet it is to be assisted by the other parts of <hi>devotion,</hi> to make it a perfect remedy to our great evill. He that would secure his evill Nature, must be a <hi>devout person,</hi> and he that is <hi>devout,</hi> besides, that he prayes frequently, he delights in it as it is a conversation with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he rejoyces in God, and esteems him the light of his eyes, and the support of his confidence, the object of his love, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> desires of his heart; the man is uneasie but when he does God ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and his soul is at peace and rest when he does what may be accepted: and this is that which the Apostle counsels, and gives in precept; <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwaies, and again I say rejoyce;</hi> that <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 4.</note> is, as the Levites were appointed to rejoyce, because God was their portion in tithes and offerings, so now that in the spirituall sense God is our portion, we should rejoyce in him, and make him our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and his service our imployment, and the peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to be our rest, and then it is impossible we should be any longer slaves to sin, and afflicted by the baser imployments of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> flesh, or carry burdens for the Devill; and therefore the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liast upon <hi>Juvenal</hi> observed well, <hi>Nullum malum gaudium est, Notrue joy can be evill;</hi> and therefore it was improperly said of <hi>Virgil, Mala gaudia mentis,</hi> calling lust and wilde desires, <hi>the evill joyes of the minde; Gaudium enim nisi sapienti non contingere,</hi> said
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48497:76"/>
               <hi>Seneca, none but a wise and a good man can truly rejoyce;</hi> The evill laugh loud, and sigh deeply, they drink drunk, and forget their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and all the joyes of an evill man is only arts of forgetfulnesse, devices to cover their sorrow, and make them not see their death, and its affrighting circumstances; but the heart never can rejoyce, and be secure, be pleased and be at rest, but when it dwels with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse: the joyes that come from thence are <hi>safe</hi> and <hi>great, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> and <hi>unabated, healthfull</hi> and <hi>holy;</hi> and this is true joy: and this is that which can cure all the little images of pleasure, and temptation which debauch our nature, and make it dwell with hospitals, in the region of diseases and evill sorrowes. St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> well observed the difference: <q>saying, that <hi>Corporall pleasures when we have them not, inkindle a flame and a burning desire in the heart, and make a man very miserable, before he tasts them; the appetite to them is like thirst and the desires of a feaver,</hi> the pleasure of drinking will not pay for the pain of the desire; and <hi>when they are enjoyed, they instantly breed satiety and a loathing. But spirituall rejoycings, and delights are loathed by them that have them not, and despised by them that never felt them;</hi> but when they are once tasted they increase the appetite and swell it to bigger capacities; and the more they are eaten, the more they are desired, and cannot become a wearinesse because they satisfie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all the way, and only increase the desire, because themselves grow bigger and more amiable.</q> And therefore when this new and stranger appetite, and consequent joy arises in the heart of man, it so fils all the faculties, that there is no gust, no desire left for toads and vipers, for hemlock and the deadly night-shade.</p>

to Christ the King of Virgins, and his holy Spirit, who is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Prince of purities and holy thoughts; it is a captivity of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and an inraging of the passions, it wakens every night, and rages every day, it desires passionately and prosecutes violently, it hinders businesse and distracts counsell, it brings jealousies and enkindles wars, it sins against the body, and weakens the soul, it defiles a Temple, and drives the holy Spirit forth, and it is so intire a prosecution of the follies and weaknesses of nature, such a snare and a bait to weak and easie fools, that it prevails in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, and rages horribly, and rules tyrannically; it is a very feaver in the reason, and a calenture in the passions; and therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> either it must be quenched, or it will be impossible to cure our evill natures: The curing of this is not the remedy of a single evill, but it is a doing violence to our whole nature; and therefore hath in it the greatest courage and an equall conduct, and supposes spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall strengths great enough to contest against every enemy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hither is to be reduced, that we avoid all flatterers and evill company; for it was impossible that <hi>Alexander</hi> should be wise and cure his pride and his drunkennesse, so long as he entertain'd <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> and <hi>Agnon, Bagoas</hi> and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and slew <hi>Parmenio</hi> and <hi>Philotas,</hi> and murder'd wise. <hi>Calisthenes;</hi> for he that loves to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> flattered, loves not to change his pleasure; but had rather to hear himself <hi>cal'd wise,</hi> then to be so.

            <p n="5">5. But I must put these advices into a heap; he therefore that will cure his evill nature, must set himself against his chiefest lust, which when he hath overcome, the lesser enemies will come in of themselves. He must endevour to reduce his affections to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for all violence is an enemy to reason and counsell, and is that state of disease for which he is to enquire remedies.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> when beforehand we know we must change from what we are or do worse, it is a better <hi>compendium</hi> not to enter in from whence we must uneasily retire.</p>

But <hi>Serapis</hi> told him, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>you for the wheel;</hi> from a short and a private death, to a painfull and disgracefull; and so it is very frequently in the event of humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: men are saved from one death, and reserved for another; or are preserved here to be destroyed hereafter; and they that would judge of actions by events, must stay till all events are pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; that is, till all their posterity be dead, and the sentence is given at Dooms-day; in the mean time, the evils of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are to be look'd upon without all accidentall appendages; as they are in themselves, as they have an irregularity and disorder, an unreasonablenesse and a sting; and be sure to relye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nothing, but the truth of lawes and promises; and take severe accounts by those lines which God gave us on purpose to reprove our evill habits and filthy inclinations. Men that are not willing to be cured are glad of any thing to cousen them; but the body of death cannot be taken off from us, unlesse we be honest in our purposes and severe in our counsels, and take just measures, and glorifie God, and set our selves against our selves, that we may be changed into the likenesse of the sons of God.</p>

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:48497:77"/>
4. I am now to consider, how farre the infirmities of the flesh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> can be innocent, and consist with the spirit of grace. For all these counsels are to be entertain'd into a willing spirit, and not only so, but into an active: and so long as the spirit is only willing, the weaknesse of the flesh will in many instances become stronger then the strengths of the spirit. For he that hath a good will, and does not do good actions which are required of him, <hi>is hindred,</hi> but not by God that requires them, and therefore by himself, or his worst enemy. But the measures of this question are these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the flesh hinders us of our duty, it is our enemy; and then our misery is not, that the flesh is weak, but that it is too strong; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> But 2. when it abates the degrees of duty and stops its growth, or its passing on to action and effect, then <hi>it is weak, but not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor alwaies criminall.</hi> But to speak particularly.</p>
            <p>If our flesh hinders us of any thing that is a direct duty, and prevails upon the spirit to make it do an evill action, or contract an evill habit, the man is in a state of bondage and sin: his flesh is the mother of corruption, and an enemy to God. It is not enough to say, I desire to serve God, and cannot as I would: I would fain love God above all the things in the world, but the flesh hath appetites of its own that must be served: <hi>I pray</hi> to be forgiven as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> I forgive others; but flesh and bloud cannot put up such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: for know that no infirmity, no unavoidable accident, no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, no poverty, no businesse can hinder us from the love of God, or forgiving injuries, or being of a religious and a devout spirit; Poverty and the intrigues of the world are things that can no more hinder the spirit in these duties, then a strong enemy can hinder the sun to shine, or the clouds to drop rain. These things which God requires of us, and exacts from us with mighty penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, these he hath made us able to perform; for he knows that we have no strength but what he gives us; and therefore as he binds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> burdens upon our shoulders, so he gives us strength to bear them; and therefore he that sayes he cannot forgive, sayes only that his lust is stronger then his religion; his flesh prevails upon his spirit. For what necessity can a man have to curse him whom he cals ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? or to sue him, or kill him, or do him any spite? A man may serve all his needs of nature, though he does nothing of all this; and if he be willing, what hinders him to love, to pardon to wish well, to desire? The willing is the doing in this case; and he that sayes he is willing to do his duty, but he cannot, does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what he sayes. For all the duty of the inner man consists <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in the actions of the will, and there they are seated, and to it all the inferiour faculties obey in those things which are direct emanations, and effects of will. He that desires to love God, does love him; indeed men are often cousened with pretences, and in some good mood are warm'd with a holy passion, but it signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48497:78"/>
because they will not quit the love of Gods enemies; and therefore they do not desire, what they say they doe: but if the will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and heart be right, and not false and dissembling, this duty is, or will be done infallibly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the spirit and the heart be willing, it will passe on to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions in all things where it ought, or can. He that hath a charitable soul will have a charitable hand; and will give his money to the poor, as he hath given his heart to God: For these things which are in our hand are under the power of our will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to be commanded by it. He that sayes to the naked, <hi>be warm and cloathed,</hi> and gives him not the garment that lies by him, or money to buy one, mocks <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>himself. Nequam</hi>

               <hi>is an evill saying, he wishes well, unlesse he do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Those things which are not in our power, that is, such things in which the flesh is inculpably weak, or naturally, or politically dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, the will does the work of the outward and of the inward man; we cannot cloath Christs body, he needs it not; and we cannot approach so sacred and separate a presence; but if we desire to do it, it is accounted as if we had. The ignorant man cannot discourse wisely and promote the interest of souls, but he can love souls, and desire their felicity; though I cannot build Hospitals and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Colledges, or pour great summes of money into the lap of the poor, yet if I incourage others and exhort them, if I commend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the work, I have done the work of a holy Religion. For in these and the like cases, the outward work is not alwaies set in our power; and therefore without our fault is omitted, and can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by that which is in our power.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For that is the last caution, concerning this question. <hi>No man is to be esteemed of a willing spirit, but he that endevours to doe the outward work, or to make all the supplies that he can;</hi> not only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by the forwardnesse of his spirit, but by the compensation of some other charities, or devotion, or religion. <hi>Silver and gold have I none,</hi> and therefore I can give you none: But I wish you well; How will that appear? why thus, <hi>Such as I have I will give you: Rise up and walk.</hi> I cannot give you gold, but I can give you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell; I cannot relieve your need, but I can relieve your sadnesse; I cannot cure you, but I can comfort you; I cannot take away your poverty, but I can ease your spirit; and <hi>God accepts us</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not.</hi> Only as our desires are great, and our spirits are willing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> so we shall finde wayes to make supply of our want of ability and expressed liberality.</p>

In this world we see it is quite contrary: we long for perishing meat, and fill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our stomachs with corruption; we look after white and red, and the weaker beauties of the night; we are passionate after rings and seals, and inraged at the breaking of a Crystall; we delight in the society of fools and weak persons; we laugh at sin, and contrive mischiefs; and the body rebels against the soul, and carries the cause against all its just pretences; and our soul it self is above half of it earth, and stone in its affections, and distempers; our hearts are hard, and inflexible to the softer whispers of mercy and compassion, having no loves for any thing but strange flesh, and heaps of money, and popular noises, for misery and folly; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and therefore we are a huge way off from the Kingdome of God, whose excellencies, whose designs, whose ends, whose constitution is spirituall and holy, and separate, and sublime, and perfect.

The other part of a spirituall worship is a <hi>fervour</hi> and a <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zeal</hi> of Gods glory, greatnesse of desire, and quicknesse of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of all this the Jewes were not carefull at all, excepting the zealots amongst them, and they were not only fervent but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed; and they had the earnestnesse of passion for the holy warmth of Religion; and in stead of an earnest charity they had a cruell discipline, and for fraternall correction they did destroy a sinning Israelite: and by both these evill states of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they did <hi>the work of the Lord deceitfully;</hi> they either gave him the action without the heart, or zeal without charity, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without zeal, or ceremony without religion, or indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy without desires; and then God is served by the outward man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and not the inward; or by part of the inward and not all; by the understanding and not by the will; or by the will when the affections are cold and the body unapt, and the lower faculties in rebellion, and the superior in disorder, and the work of God is left imperfect, and our persons ungracious, and our ends unacquired, and the state of a spirituall kingdome not at all set forward towards any hope or possibility of being obtained. All this Christ came to mend, and by his Lawes did make provision that God should be served intirely, according as God alwaies designed, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required by his Prophets, and particularly in my Text, that <hi>his work</hi> be done <hi>sincerely,</hi> and our duty <hi>with great affection;</hi> and by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> these two provisions, both the <hi>intension</hi> and the <hi>extension</hi> are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; our duty shall be intire, and it shall be perfect, we shall be neither lame nor cold, without a limb, nor without naturall heat, and then <hi>the work of the Lord will prosper in our hands:</hi> but if we

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Here then is the duty of us all: 1. God requires of us to serve him with an integrall, intire, or a whole worship and religion. 2. God requires of us to serve him with earnest and intense affections; The intire purpose of both which, I shall represent in its severall parts by so many propositions. 3. I shall consider concerning the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of zeal, and its inordinations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He that serves God with the body without the soul, serves God deceitfully. My son give me thy heart;</hi> and though I cannot think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that Nature was so sacramentall, as to point out the holy and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Trinity by the triangle of the heart, yet it is certain that the heart of man is Gods speciall portion, and every angle ought to point out towards him directly; that is, the soul of man ought to be presented to God, and given to him as an oblation to the interest of his service.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For, to worship God with our souls confesses one of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">1.</note> attributes; it declares him to be the searcher of hearts, and that he reads the secret purposes, and beholds the smallest arrests of fancy, and bends in all the flexures and intriques of crafty peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and searches out every plot and trifling conspiracy against him, and against our selves, and against our brethren.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It advances the powers and concernments of his providence, and <note place="margin">2.</note> confesses all the affairs of men, all their cabinets and their nightly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, their snares and two-edged mischiefs to be over-rul'd by him; for what he sees he judges, and what he judges he rules, and what he rules must turn to his glory; and of this glory he reflects rayes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences upon his servants, and it shall also turn to their good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This service distinguishes our duty towards God from all our <note place="margin">3.</note> conversation with man, and separates the divine commandements <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> from the imperfect decrees of Princes and Republiques; for these are satisfied by the outward work, and cannot take any other cognisance of the heart, and the will of man, but as himself is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to signifie.

            <p n="5">5. That I may summe up many reasons in one; God by requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">5.</note> the heart secures the <hi>perpetuity</hi> and <hi>perseverance</hi> of our duty, and its <hi>sincerity,</hi> and its <hi>integrity,</hi> and its <hi>perfection:</hi> for so also God takes account of little things; it being all one in the heart of man, whether maliciously it omits a duty in a small instance or in a great; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the expression hath variety and degrees in it in relation to those purposes of usefulnesse and charity whither God designs it, yet the obedience and disobedience is all one, and shall be equally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> accounted for; and therefore the Jew <hi>Tryphon</hi> disputed against <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> that the precepts of the Gospell were impossible to be kept, because it also requiring the heart of man did stop every egression of disorders: for making the root holy and healthfull, as the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same of <hi>Judaea,</hi> or the drops of Manna in the evening of the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; it also causes that nothing spring thence but gummes fit for incense, and oblations for the Altar of proposition, and a cloud of perfume fit to make atonement for our sins, and being united to the great sacrifice of the world to reconcile God and man together. Upon these reasons you see it is highly fit that God should require <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it, and that we should pay the <hi>sacrifice of our hearts;</hi> and not at all think that God is satisfied with the work of the hands, when the affections of the heart are absent. He that prayes because he would be quiet, and would fain be quit of it, and communicates for fear of the lawes, and comes to Church to avoid shame, and gives almes to be eased of an importunate begger, or relieves his old parents because they will not dye in their time, and provides for his children lest he be compled by Lawes and shame, but yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the charge of Gods blessings, this man is a servant of the eyes of men, and offers parchment or a white skin in sacrifice, but the flesh and the inwards he leaves to be consumed by a stranger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fire. And therefore this is a deceit that robs God of the best, and leaves that for religion which men pare off: It is sacriledge, and brings a double curse.</p>

But when God hath made the body an apt minister to the soul, and hath given money for almes, and power to protect the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and knees to serve in prayer and hands to serve our needs, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the soul alone is not to work; but as <hi>Rachel</hi> gave her maid to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and she bore children to her Lord upon her Ministresse knees, and the children were reckoned to them both, because the one had fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full desires and the other a fruitfull wombe: so must the body serve the needs of the spirit; that what the one desires the other may effect, and the conceptions of the soul may be the productions of the body; and the body must bow when the soul worships, and the hand must help when the soul pities, and both together do the work of a holy Religion; the body alone can never serve God without the conjunction and preceding act of the soul; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the soul without the body is imperfect and vain; for in some actions there is <hi>a body</hi> and <hi>a spirit, a materiall</hi> and <hi>a spirituall</hi> part; and when the action hath the same constitution that a man hath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the act of both it is as imperfect as a dead man; the soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce the body of some actions any more then the body can put life into it; and therefore an ineffective pity and a lazie counsell, an empty blessing, and gay words, are but deceitfull charity.</p>

This proposition is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly usefull in the doctrine of charity, and the vertue of religion, but in the professions of faith, and requires that it be publick, open, and ingenuous.

I do not say, what ever we think, we must tell it to all the world, much lesse at all times, and in all circumstances; but we must never deny that which we beleeve to be the cause of God in such circumstances in which we can and ought to glorifie him. But this extends also to other instances. He that swears a false oath with his lips, and unswears it with his heart, hath deceived one more then he thinks for; himself is the most abused person: and when my action is contrary to men they will reprove me, but when it is against my own perswasion, I cannot but reprove my self; and am witnesse, and accuser, and party, and guilty, and then God is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Judge, and his anger will be a fierce executioner, because <hi>we do the Lords work deceitfully.</hi>

               <hi>for sin, or one sin for themselves, or one action to please their appetite, and many for Religion. Rabbi Kimchi</hi> taught his Scholars, <hi>Cogitationem pravam Deus non habet vice facti, nisi concepta fuerit in Dei fidem &amp; Religionem;</hi> that God is never angry with an evill thought, unlesse it be a thought of Apostasie from the Jewes religion; and therefore, provided that men be severe and close in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their sect and party, they might roll in lustfull thoughts; and the torches they light up in the Temple might smoke with <hi>anger</hi> at one end, and <hi>lust</hi> at the other, so they did not flame out in egres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of violence and injustice, in adulteries and fouler complicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: nay they would give leave to some degrees of evill actions; for <hi>R. Moses</hi> and <hi>Selomoh</hi> taught, that if the most part of a mans actions were holy and just, though in one he sinned often, yet the greater ingredient should prevail, and the number of good works should out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the lesser account of evill things; and this <hi>Pharisaicall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi> is too frequent even amongst Christians. For who almost is there that does not count fairly concerning himself, if he reckons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> many vertues upon the stock of his Religion, and but one vice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stock of his infirmity; half a dozen to God, and one for his company, or his friend; his education, or his appetite? and if he hath parted from his folly, yet he will remember the fleshpots, and please himself with a phantastick sin, and call it home through the gates of his memory, and place it at the door of fancy, that there he may behold it and consider concerning what he hath parted withall, out of the fears and terrors of religion, and a necessary unavoidable conscience. Do not many men go from sin to sin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> even in their repentance? they go backward from sin to sin, and change their crime as a man changes his uneasie load, and shakes it off from one shoulder to support it with the other. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny severe persons, virgins and widows are so pleased with their chastity, and their abstinence even from lawfull mixtures, that by
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48497:83"/>
this means they fall into a worse pride? insomuch that I remember <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> St. <hi>Austin</hi> said, <hi>Audeo dicere superbis continentibus expedit cadere,</hi> they that are chaste and proud, it is sometimes a remedy for them to fall into sin, and by the shame of lust to cure the devill of pride, and by the sin of the body to cure the worser evils of the spirit; and therefore he addes, that he did beleeve, God in a severe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy did permit the barbarous nations, breaking in upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, to violate many virgins professed in Cloisters and religious Families to be as a mortification of their pride, lest the accidentall advantages of a continent life should bring them into the certain miseries of a spirituall death, by taking away their humility, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was more necessary then their virgin state; It is not a cure that men may use, but God permits it sometimes with greater safety through his wise conduct and over-ruling providence; St. <hi>Peter</hi> was safer by his fall (as it fell out in the event of things) then by his former confidence. Man must never cure a sin by a sin; but he that brings good out of our evill, he can when he please. But I speak it, to represent how deceitfully many times we do the work of the Lord. We reprove a sinning Brother, but do it with a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous spirit; we separate from scandall, and do it with glory, and a gaudy heart; we are charitable to the poor, but will not forgive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our unkinde enemies; or we powre relief into their bags, but we please our selves and drink drunk, and hope to commute with God, giving the fruit of our labours or effluxes of money for the sin of our souls: And upon this account it is that two of the noblest graces of a Christian are to very many persons made <hi>a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death,</hi> though they were intended for the beginning and the promotion of an eternal life; and those are <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>charity;</hi> some men think if they have <hi>faith,</hi> it is enough to answer all the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of sin which our consciences or the Devils make against us: If I be a wanton person, yet my faith shall hide it, and faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> shall cover the follies of drunkennesse, and I may all my life relye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>faith,</hi> at last to quit my scores. For he that is most carefull is not innocent, but must be saved by <hi>faith,</hi> and he that is least carefull may have <hi>faith,</hi> and that will save him. But because these men mistake concerning faith, and consider not that charity or a good life is a part of that faith that saves us, they hope to be saved by the <hi>Word,</hi> they fill their bellies with the story of <hi>Frimal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions</hi> banquet, and drink drunk with the newes of wine, they eat shadows, and when they are drowning, catch at the image of the trees which hang over the water, and are reflected from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>But thus many men do with charity, <hi>[Give almes and all things shall be clean unto you,</hi> said our <hi>Blessed Saviour:]</hi> and therefore, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny keep a sin alive, and make account to pay for it, and God shall be put to relieve his own poor at the price of the sin of another of

his servants; charity shall take lust or intemperance into protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and men will not be kinde to their brethren, unlesse they will be also at the same time unkinde to God. I have understood concerning divers vicious persons, that none have been so free in their donatives and offerings to Religion and the Priest as they: and the Hospitals that have been built, and the High-wayes mended at the price of souls, are too many for Christendome to boast of in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of charity. But as others mistake concerning faith, so these do concerning its twin sister. The first had <hi>faith without charity,</hi> and these have <hi>charity without hope;</hi> for <hi>every one that hath this hope,</hi> that is, the hope of receiving the glorious things of God promised in the Gospell, <hi>purifies himself even as God is pure</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>; faith and charity too, must both suppose repentance; and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the abolition of the whole body of sin, the purification of the whole man. But the summe of the Doctrine and case of conscience in this particular is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Charity is a certain cure of sins that are past, not that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi> He that repents and leaves his sin, and then relieves the poor and payes for his folly by a diminution of his own estate, and the supplies of the poor, and his ministring to Christs poor members, turns all his former crimes into holinesse; he purges the slains and makes amends for his folly, and commutes for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> baser pleasure with a more noble usage: so said <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar [Break off thy sins by righteousnesse, and thine iniquities</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27.</note> 
               <hi>by shewing mercy to the poor:]</hi> first be just, and then be charitable; for it is pity almes, which is one of the noblest services of God, and the greatest mercy to thy Brother, should be spent upon sin, and thrown away upon folly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith is</hi> the remedy of all our evils, but then it is never <hi>of force, but when we either have endevoured or undertaken to do all good; this</hi> in baptisme, <hi>that</hi> after: <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> at first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>; and <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> at last; and because we fail often by infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and sometimes by inadvertency, sometimes by a surprize, and often by omission; and all this even in the midst of a sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to live justly, and perfectly; therefore the passion of our Lord payes for <hi>thus,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> layes hold upon <hi>that.</hi> But without a hearty and sincere intent, and vigorous prosecution of all the parts of our duty, <hi>faith is but a word,</hi> not so much as a cover to a naked bosome, nor a pretence big enough to deceive persons that are not willing to be cousened.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The bigger ingredient of vertue and evill actions will prevail</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>, but it is only <hi>when vertue is habituall, and sins are single, interrupted, casuall and seldome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without choice</hi> and <hi>without affection;</hi> that is, when our repentance is so timely that it can work for God, more then we served under the tyranny of sin; so that if you will account the whole life of man, the rule is good, and the greater ingredient
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48497:84"/>
shal prevail, and he shall certainly be pardoned and accepted whose life is so reformed, whose repentance is so active, whose return is so early, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that he hath given bigger portions to God then to Gods enemy. But if we account so, as to divide the measures in present possession, the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger part cannot prevail; a small or a seldome sin spoils not the sea of piety; but when the affection is divided, a little ill destroyes the whole body of good; the cup in a mans right hand must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it must be pure although it be mingled; that is, the whole affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be for God, <hi>that</hi> must be pure and unmingled; if sin min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles in seldome and unapproved instances, the drops of water are swallowed up with a whole vintage of piety, and the bigger ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is the prevailing; in all other cases it is not so: for one sin that we choose and love and delight in, will not be excused by 20 vertues: and as one broken link dissolves the union of the whole chain, and one jarring and untuned string spoils the whole musick; so is every sin that seises upon a portion of our affections; if we love one, that one destroyes the acceptation of all the rest; And as it is in faith, so it is in charity. He that is a Heretick in one article, hath no saving faith in the whole; and so does every vicious habit, or unreformed sin destroy the excellency of the grace of charity; a wilfull error in one article is Heresie, and every vice in one instance is Malice, and they are perfectly contrary, and a direct darknesse to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the two eyes of the soul, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There is one deceit more yet, in the matter of the extension of our duty, destroying the integrity of its constitution: for they do the work of God deceitfully, who think God sufficiently served with <hi>abstinence from evill,</hi> and converse not in the acquisition and pursuit of holy charity and religion.

If it be in motion, a lukewarm Religion is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> pleasing to God; for God hates it not for its imperfection, and its naturall measures of proceeding; but if it stands still and rests there, it is a state against the designes, and against the perfection of God, and it hath in it these evills.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:48497:87"/>
1. It is a state of the greatest imprudence in the world; for it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> makes a man to spend his labour for that which profits not, and to deny his appetite for an unsatisfying interest; he puts his moneys in a napkin; and he that does so, puts them into a broken bag; he loses the principall for not encreasing the interest. He that dwells in a state of life that is unacceptable, loses the money of his almes, and the rewards of his charity, his hours of prayer, and his parts of justice; he confesses his sins and is not pardoned, he is patient, but hath no hope, and he that is gone so far towards his countrey, and stands in the middle way, hath gone so far out of his way; he had better have stay'd under a dry roof, in the house of banishment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> then to have left his <hi>Gyarus,</hi> the Island of his sorrow, and to dwell upon the <hi>Adriatick:</hi> So is he that begins a state of Religion, and does not finish it; he abides in the high-way, and though he be neerer the place, yet is as far from the rest of his countrey as ever; and therefore all that beginning of labour was in the prejudice of his rest, but nothing to the advantages of his hopes. He that hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver begun, hath lost no labour; <hi>Jactura praeteritorum,</hi> the losse of all that he hath done, is the first evill of the negligent and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm Christian; according to the saying of <hi>Solomon: He that is remisse or idle in his labour, is the brother of him that scattereth</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 18. 9.</note> 
               <hi>his goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The second appendant evill is, that <hi>lukewarmnesse is the occasion of greater evill;</hi> because the remisse easie Christian shuts the gate against the heavenly breathings of Gods holy Spirit; he thinks every breath that is fan'd by the wings of the holy Dove, is not intended to encourage his fires, which burn, and smoke, and peep through the cloud already; it tempts him to security; and if an evill life be a certain inlet to a second death, <hi>despaire</hi> on one side, and <hi>security</hi> on the other are the bars and locks to that dore, he can never passe forth again while that state remains; who ever slips in his spirituall walking does not presently fall; but if that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> slip does not awaken his diligence, and his caution, then his ruine begins, <hi>vel pravae institutionis deceptus exordio, aut per longam mentis incuriam, &amp; virtute animi decidente,</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes; either upon the pursuit of his first error, or by a carelesse spirit, or a decaying slackned resolution; all which are the direct effects of lukewarmnesse. But so have I seen a fair structure begun with art and care, and raised to halfe its stature, and then it stood still by the misfortune or negligence of the owner, and the rain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, and dwelt in its joynts, and supplanted the contexture of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> its pillars, and having stood a while like the antiquated Temple of a deceased Oracle, it fell into a hasty age, and sunk upon its owne knees, and so descended into ruine: So is the imperfect, unfinished spirit of a man; it layes the foundation of a holy resolution, and strengthens it with vows and arts of prosecution, it raises up the walls
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48497:87"/>
Sacraments, and Prayers, Reading, and holy Ordinances; and holy actions begin with a slow motion, and the building stays, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> spirit is weary, and the soul is naked, and exposed to temptation, and in the days of storm take in every thing that can doe it mischief; and it is faint and sick, listlesse and tired, and it stands till its owne weight wearies the foundation, and then declines to death and sad disorder, being so much the worse, because it hath not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to its first follies, but hath superadded <hi>unthankfulnesse</hi> and <hi>carelesnesse,</hi> a positive neglect, and a despite of holy things, a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a low price to the things of God, lazinesse and wretchlesnesse; all which are evills superadded to the first state of coldnesse, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he is with all these loads and circumstances of death easily revolv'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A state of lukewarmnesse is more incorrigible then a state of coldnesse; while men flatter themselves that their state is good, that they are rich and need nothing, that their lamps are dressed, and full of ornament. There are many that think they are in their countrey as soon as ever they are weary, and measure not the end of their hopes by the possession of them, but by their precedent labour, which they overvalue, because they have easie and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate souls. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> complains of some that say, <hi>Sufficit nobis,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>nolumus esse meliores quàm Patres nostri:</hi> It is enough for us to be as our forefathers, who were honest and usefull in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but <hi>be not over-righteous:</hi> These men are such as think they have knowledge enough to need no teacher, devotion enough to need no new fires, perfection enough to need no new progresse, justice enough to need no repentance; and then because the spirit of a man and all the things of this world are in perpetuall variety and change, these men decline when they have gone their period; they stand still, and then revert; like a stone returning from the bosome of a cloud, where it rested as long as the thought of a childe, and fell to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> its naturall bed of earth, and dwelt below for ever. He that says he will take care he be no worse, and that he desires to be no better, stops his journey into heaven, but cannot be secure against his descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into hell: and <hi>Cassian</hi> spake a hard saying, <hi>Frequentèr vidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus de frigidis &amp; carnalibus ad spiritualem venisse fervorem, de tepidis &amp; animalibus omninò non vidimus:</hi> Many persons from vicious, and dead, and cold, have passed into life and an excellent grace, and a spirituall warmth, and holy fires; but from <hi>lukewarm</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> never any body came to an excellent condition, and state of holynesse: <hi>rarissimè</hi> S. <hi>Bernard</hi> sayes, very extremely sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and our blessed Saviour said something of this, <hi>The Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and the Harlots goe before you into the Kingdome of heaven;</hi> they are moved by shame, and punished by disgrace, and remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by punishments, and frighted by the circumstances and notices of all the world, and separated from sober persons by laws and an
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48497:88"/>
intolerable character; and the sense of honour, and the care of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> persons, and their love of civill societie, and every thing in the world can invite them towards vertues. But the man that is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted honest, and does justice, and some things of Religion, unlesse he finds himselfe but upon his way and feels his wants, and groans under the sense of his infirmities, and sighs under his imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and accounts himself <hi>not to have comprehended,</hi> but <hi>still presses towards the mark of his calling,</hi> unlesse (I say) he still increases in his appetites of Religion as he does in his progression, he will think he needs no counsellor, and the spirit of God whispers to an ear that is already fill'd with noyses, and cannot atrend to the heavenly calling. The stomach that is already full, is next to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> loathing, and that's the prologue to sicknesse, and a rejecting the first wholesome nutriment which was entertained to relieve the first naturall necessities: <hi>Qui non proficit vult deficere,</hi> said S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard:</hi> He that goes not forward in the love of God, and of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, does not stand still, but goes for all that, but whither such a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will lead him, himself without a timely care shall feel by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable experiment.</p>
            <p>In this sense and for these reasons it is that although a lukewarm Christian hath gone forward some steps towards a state of holynesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and is advanced beyond him that is cold, and dead, and unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and therefore speaking <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>naturally,</hi> is neerer the Kingdome of God then he, that is not yet set out; yet <hi>accidentally,</hi> and by reason of these ill appendages, he is worse, in greater danger, in a state equally unacceptable, and therefore must either goe forward, and still doe the work of God carefully, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with a Fervent spirit, and an Active hand, with a willing heart, and a chearefull eye, or it had been better he had never begun.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It concerns us next to enquire concerning the duty in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per instances, that we may perceive to what parts and degrees of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> duty it amounts; we shall find it especially in the duties of <hi>faith,</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> and of <hi>charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Our faith must be strong, vigorous, active, confident, and patient, reasonable, and unalterable, without doubting, and feare, and partiality. For the faith of very many men, seems a duty so weak and indifferent, is so often untwisted by violence, or ravel'd and intangled in weak discourses, or so false and fallacious by its mixture of interest, that though men usually put most confidences in the pretences of faith, yet no pretences are more unreasonable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Our faith and perswasions in Religion is most commonly imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us by our country, and we are Christians at the same rate as we are <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or of such a family; our reason is first stained and spotted with the dye of our kindred, and country, and our educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on puts it in grain, and whatsoever is against this we are taught to call a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48497:88"/>
temptaiton: in the mean time we call these accidentall and artificiall perswasions by the name of <hi>faith,</hi> which is onely the are of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> countrey, or an heireloome of the family, or the daughter of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent interest. Whatever it was that brought us in, we are to take care that when we are in, our faith be noble, and stand upon its most proper and most reasonable foundation; it concerns us better to understand that Religion which we call Faith, and that faith whereby we hope to be saved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The faith and the whole Religion of many men is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of fear. Men are threatned into their perswasions, and the iron rod of a Tyrant converts whole nations to his principles, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when the wise discourses of the Religion seems dull as sleep, and unprevailing as the talk of childhood. That's but a deceitfull faith which our timorousnesse begot, and our weaknesse nurses, and brings up. The Religion of a Christian is immortall, and certaine, and perswasive, and infallible, and unalterable, and therefore needs not be received by humane and weake convoycs, like worldly and mortall Religions: that faith is lukewarm, and easie, and trifling, which is onely a beleef of that which a man wants courage to disbeleeve.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The faith of many men is such, that they dare not trust it: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they will talk of it, and serve vanity, or their lust, or their company, or their interest by it, but when the matter comes to a pinch, they dare not trust it. When <hi>Antisthenes</hi> was initiated into the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Orph<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> full of wine and flesh, of confidence and religion; but to dye, is a more material consideration, and to be chosen upon no grounds, but such a faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which really comes from God, and can secure our reason, and our choyce, and perfect our interest and designes. And it hath been long observed concerning those bold people that use their reason against God that gave it, they have one perswasion in their health, and another in their sicknesse, and fears; when they are well, they blaspheme, when they die, they are superstitious; It was <hi>Bias</hi> his case when he was poyson'd by the Atheismes of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> no man died more like a coward and a fool; <hi>as if the gods were to come and goe as</hi> Bias <hi>pleased to think and talk:</hi> so one said of his folly. If God be to be feared when we die, he is also to be feared in all our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> life, for he can for ever make us die; he that will doe it once, and that when he please, can alwayes. And therefore all those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions against God, and against Religion, are onely the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of vicious passions, of drink or fancy, of confidence and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, of boldnesse or vile appetites, of vanity or fiercenesse, of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48497:89"/>
pride or flatteries; and Atheisme is a proportion so unnaturall and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> monstrous, that it can never dwell in a mans heart <hi>as faith does,</hi> in health and sicknesse, in peace and warre, in company and alone, at the beginning and at the end of a designe; but comes from weake principles, and leaves shallow and superficiall impressions; but when men endevour to strengthen and confirme it, they onely strive to make themselves worse then they can. Naturally a man cannot be an Atheist: for he that is so, must have something within him that is worse either then man or devill.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some measure their faith by shews and apparencies, by cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and names, by professions and little institutions. <hi>Diogenes</hi> was angry at the silly Priest that thought he should be immortall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he was a Priest, and would not promise so concerning <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> two noble <hi>Greeks</hi> that had preserved their country, and lived vertuously. The faith of a Christian hath no signification at all but obedience and charity; if men be just, and charitable, and good, and live according to their faith, then onely they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; whatsoever else is pretended is but a shadow and the image of a grace; for since in all the sects and institutions of the world, the professors did in some reasonable sort conform to the rules of the profession (as appears in all the Schooles of Philosophers, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the world, and the practises of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the usages and the countrey customes of the <hi>Turks)</hi> it is a strange dishonour to Christianity, that in it alone men should pretend to the faith of it, and doe nothing of what it perswades, and commands upon the account of those promises, which it makes us to beleeve. * He that means to please God by his faith, must have his faith begotten in him by the Spirit of God, and proper arguments of Religion; he must professe it without feare, he must dare to die for it, and resolve to live according to its institution; he must grow more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and more holy, have fewer doubtings and more vertues, he must be resolute and constant, far from indifferency, and above <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> secular regards; he must by it regulate his life, and value it above his life; he must <hi>contend earnestly for the faith,</hi> by the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing arguments, by the arguments of holy living, and ready dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by zeale and patience, by conformity and humility, by reducing words to actions, fair discourses to perfect perswasions, by loving the article, and <hi>encreasing in the knowledge and love of God and his Son Jesus Christ;</hi> and then his faith is not <hi>negligent, deceitfull, artificiall</hi> and <hi>improper,</hi> but <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>reasonable,</hi> and <hi>usefull, zealous</hi> and <hi>sufficient,</hi> and therefore can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

but strong desires, and ballasted with resignation, and conformity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to the divine will; and then it is, as God likes it, and does the work to Gods glory and our interest effectively. He that asks with a doubting mind, and a lazy desire, begs for nothing but to be denyed; we must in our prayers be earnest, and fervent, or else we shall have but a cold answer; for God gives his grace according as we can receive it; and whatsoever evill returnes we meet in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when we ask for good things, is wholly by reason of our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring spirits, and cold desires; we have reason to complain that our minds wander in our prayers, and our diversions are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing then all our arts of application, and detention; and we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wander sometimes even when we pray against wandring: and it is in some degrees naturall, and unevitable: but although the evill is not wholly to be cured, yet the symptomes are to be eased; and if our desires were strong, and fervent, our minds would in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion be present; we see it by a certain and regular experience; what we love passionately, we perpetually think on, and it returnes upon us whether we will or no; and in a great fear the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion cannot be shaken off; and therefore if our desires of holy things were strong and earnest, we should most certainly attend our prayers: it is a more violent affection to other things that carries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> us off from this; and therefore if we lov'd passionately what we aske for daily, we should aske with hearty desires, and an earnest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and a present spirit; and however it be very easie to have our thoughts wander, yet it is our indifferency and lukewarmnesse that makes it so naturall: and you may observe it, that so long as the light shines bright, and the fires of devotion, and desires flame out, so long the mind of a man stands close to the altar, and waits upon the sacrifice; but as the fires die and desires decay, so the mind steals away and walks abroad to see the little images of beauty and pleasure, which it beholds in the falling stars and little glow-wormes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the world. The river that runs slow and creeps by the banks, and begs leave of every turfe to let it passe, is drawn into little hollownesses, and spends it selfe in smaller portions, and dies with diversion; but when it runs with vigorousnesse and a ful stream, and breaks down every obstacle, making it even as its own brow, it stays not to be tempted by little avocations, and to creep into holes, but runs into the sea through full and usefull channels: So is a mans prayer, if it moves upon the feet of an abated appetite, it wanders into the society of every trifling accident, and stays at the corners of the fancy, and talks with every object it meets, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cannot arrive at heaven; but when it is carryed upon the wings of passion and strong desires, a swift motion and a hungry appetite, it passes on through all the intermediall regions of clouds, and stays not till it dwells at the foot of the Throne, where mercy sits, and thence sends holy showers of refreshment. I deny not but some

little drops will turn aside, and fall from the full channell by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> weaknesse of the banks, and hollownesse of the passage; but the main course is still continued: and although the most earnest and devout persons feel and complain of some loosenesse of spirit, and unfixed attentions, yet their love and their desire secure the maine portions, and make the prayer to be strong, fervent, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Any thing can be done by him that earnestly desires what he ought; secure but your affections and passions, and then no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be too strong; <hi>A wise man, and a full resolution, and an earnest spirit can doe any thing of duty;</hi> but every temptation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes when we are willing to die; and we usually lend nothing to devotion but the offices that flatter our passions; we can desire and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> pray for any thing that may serve our lust, or promote those ends which we covet, but ought to tear and fly from: but the same ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse, if it were transplanted into Religion and our prayers, would serve all the needs of the spirit, but for want of it we do <hi>the Lords work deceitfully.</hi>

            <p>These are the great Scenes of duty in which we are to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and zealous; but because earnestnesse and zeal are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of a great latitude; and the zeale of the present age is starke cold, if compar'd to the fervors of the Apostles, and other holy primitives; and in every age a good mans care may turne into scruple, if he sees that he is not the best man, because he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> may reckon his owne estate to stand in the confines of darknesse, because his spark is not so great as his neighbors fires, therefore it is fit that we consider concerning the degrees of the intention and forward heats; for when we have found out the lowest degrees of zeale, and a holy fervour, we know that <hi>duty</hi> dwels there, and whatsoever is above it is a degree of excellence; but all that is lesse then it, is <hi>lukewarmnesse,</hi> and the state of an ungracious and an unaccepted person.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No man is fervent and zealous as he ought, but he that preferres Religion before businesse, charity before his own case, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the reliefe of his brother before money, heaven before secular regards, and God before his friend or interest. Which rule is not to be understood <hi>absolutely,</hi> and <hi>in particular instances,</hi> but alwayes <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally;</hi> and when it descends to particulars, it must be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to circumstances, and by their proper measures: for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In the whole course of life it is necessary that we prefer Religion <note place="margin">1.</note> before any state that is either contrary to it, or a lessening of its duties.</hi> He that hath a state of life in which he cannot at all in fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions tend to Religion, must quit great proportions of <hi>that,</hi> that he may enjoy more of <hi>this,</hi> this is that which our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> calls <hi>pulling out the right eye if it offend thee.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>In particular actions, when the necessity is equall, he that <note place="margin">2.</note> does not preferre Religion is not at all zealous;</hi> for although all naturall necessities are to be served before the circumstances and order of Religion, yet our belly and our back, our liberty and

our life, our health, and a friend are to be neglected rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then a Duty when it stands in its proper place, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Although <hi>the things of God are by a necessary zeale to be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>preferred before the things of the world;</hi> yet we must take heed that we doe not reckon Religion, and orders of worshipping, onely to be <hi>the things of God,</hi> and all other duties to be <hi>the things of the world;</hi> for it was a Pharisaicall device to cry <hi>Corban,</hi> and to refuse to relieve their aged Parents; it is good to give to a Church, but it is better to give to the Poor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though they must be both provided for, yet in cases of dispute Mercy carries the cause against Religion and the Temple. And although <hi>Mary</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was commended for choosing the better part, yet <hi>Mary</hi> had done worse if she had been at the foot of her Master when she should have relieved a perishing brother. <hi>Martha</hi> was troubled with much serving; that was <hi>more then need,</hi> and therefore she was to blame; and sometimes <hi>hearing</hi> in some circumstances may be <hi>more then needs;</hi> and some women are <hi>troubled with over-much hearing,</hi> and then they had better have been serving the necessities of their house.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This rule is <hi>not to be extended to the relatives of Religion;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4.</note> for although the things of the Spirit are better then the things of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the World, yet a spirituall man is not in humane regards to be preferred before Princes and noble personages. Because a man is called spirituall in severall regards, and for various measures and manners of partaking of the Spirit of grace, or co-operating toward the works of the Spirit. * A King and a Bishop both, have callings in order to godlinesse, and honesty, and spirituall effects, towards the advancement of Christs Kingdome, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives severally they are. * But whether of these two works more <hi>immediately,</hi> or more <hi>effectively,</hi> cannot at all times be known; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and therefore from hence no argument can be drawn concerning doing them civill regards; * and possibly, <hi>the partaking the Spirit</hi> is a neerer relation to him, then doing his ministeries, and serving his ends upon others; * and if relations to God and Gods Spirit could bring an obligation of giving proportionable civill honour, every holy man might put in some pretence for dignities above some Kings and some Bishops. * But as the things of the Spirit are in order to the affairs of another world, so they naturally can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre onely such a relative dignity, as can be expressed in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manners. But because such relations are subjected in men of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this life, and we now converse especially in materiall and secular significations, therefore we are to expresse our regards to men of such relations by proportionable expressions: but because <hi>civill excellencies</hi> are the proper ground of receiving and exacting <hi>civill honors,</hi> and spirituall excellencies doe onely claim them acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48497:91"/>
and indirectly, therefore in titles of honour and humane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> regards the <hi>civill praeeminence</hi> is the appendix of the greatest <hi>civill power</hi> and <hi>imployment,</hi> and is to descend in proper measures; and for a spirituall relation to challenge a temporall dignity, is as if the best Musick should challenge the best cloathes, or a Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string should contend with a Rose for the honour of the greatest sweetnesse. * Adde to this, that although temporall things are in order to spirituall, and therefore are lesse perfect, yet this is not so naturally; for temporall things are properly in order to the felicity of man in his proper and present constitution; and it is by a supernaturall grace that now they are thrust forward to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> higher end of grace and glory; and therefore temporall <hi>things,</hi> and <hi>persons,</hi> and <hi>callings</hi> have properly the chiefest temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; and Christ took nothing of this away from them, but put them higher, by sanctifying and ennobling them. * But then the higher calling can no more suppose the higher man, then the richest trade can suppose the richest man. From callings to men, the argument is fallacious; and a Smith is a more usefull man then he that teaches Logick; but not always to be more estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and called to stand at the chairs of Princes and Nobles. * Holy persons and holy things and all great relations are to be valued by generall proportions to their correlatives, but if wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> descend to make minute and exact proportions, and proportion an inch of temporall to a minute of spirituall, we must needs be hugely deceived, unlesse we could measure the motion of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell by a string, or the progressions of the Spirit by weight and measure of the staple. * And yet if these measures were taken, it would be unreasonable that the lower of the higher kind should be preferr'd before the most perfect and excellent in a lower order of things. A man generally is to be esteemed above a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but not the meanest of her subjects before the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Queen; not alwayes this man before this woman. Now Kings and Princes are the best in all temporall dignities, and therefore if they had in them no spirituall relations and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent excellencies (as they have very many) yet are not to be undervalu'd to spirituall relations, which in this world are very imperfect, weak, partiall; and must stay till the next world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are in a state of excellency, propriety and perfection; and then also all shall have them, according to the worth of their persons, not of their calling.</p>
            <p>* But lastly, what men may not challenge is not their just and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> proper due; but spirituall persons and the neerest relatives to God stand by him but so long as they dwell low and safe in humility, and rise high in nothing but in labours, and zeal of soules, and devotion. * In proportion to this rule, a Church may be pull'd down to save a Town, and the Vessels of the Church may be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48497:92"/>
sold to redeem Captives when there is a great calamity immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and prepared for reliefe and no other way to succour it.</p>
            <p>But in the whole, the duty of zeale requires that we neglect an ordinary visit rather then an ordinary prayer, and a great profit rather then omit a required duty. No excuse can legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate a sin; and he that goes about to distinguish between his duty and his profit, and if he cannot reconcile them, will yet tie them together like a Hyaena and a Dog, this man pretends to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but secures the world, and is indifferent and lukewarme towards that, so he may be warme and safe in the possession of this. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To that fervour and zeal that is necessary and a duty, <hi>it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that we be constant and persevering. Eslo sidelis ad mortem,</hi> said the Spirit of God to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Smyrna, Be faithfull unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life:</hi> For he that is warm to day, and cold to morrow, zealous in his resolution and weary in his practises, fierce in the beginning, and slack and easie in his progresse, hath not yet well chosen what side he will be of; he sees not reason enough for Religion, and he hath not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough for its contrary; and therefore he is <hi>duplicis animi,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> calls him, <hi>of a doubtfull mind.</hi> For Religion is worth as much to day as it was yesterday, and that cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> change though we doe; and if we doe, we have left God, and whither he can goe that goes from God, his owne sorrowes will soon enough instruct him. This fire must never goe out, but it must be like the fire of heaven, it must shine like the starres, though sometimes cover'd with a cloud, or obscur'd by a greater light; yet they dwell for ever in their orbs, and walk in their circles, and observe their circumstances, but goe not out by day nor night, and set not when Kings die, nor are extinguish'd when Nations change their Government: So must the zeal of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Christian be, a constant incentive of his duty, and though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his hand is drawne back by violence or need, and his prayers shortned by the importunity of businesse, and some parts omitted by necessities, and just complyances, yet still the fire is kept alive, it burns within when the light breaks not forth, and is eternall as the orb of fire, or the embers of the Altar of Incense.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No man is zealous as he ought, but <hi>he that delights in the service of God:</hi> without this no man can persevere, but must faint under the continuall pressure of an uneasie load. If a man goes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to his prayers as children goe to schoole, or give alms as those that pay contribution, and meditate with the same willingnesse with which young men die, this man does <hi>personam sustinere,</hi> he acts a part which he cannot long personate, but will find so many excuses and silly devices to omit his duty, such tricks to run
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48497:92"/>
from that which will make him happy, he will so watch the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> eyes of men, and be so sure to doe nothing in private; he will so often distinguish and mince the duty into minutes and little particles, he will so tie himself to the letter of the Law, and be so carelesse of the intention and spirituall designe, he will be punctuall in the ceremony, and trifling in the secret, and he will be so well pleased when he is hindred by an accident not of his own procuring, and will have so many devices to defeat his duty; and to cosuen himselfe, that he will certainly manifest that he is afraid of Religion, and secretly hates it; he counts it a burthen, and an objection, and then the man is sure to leave it, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his circumstances are so fitted. But if we delight in it, we enter into a portion of the reward as soon as we begin the worke, and the very grace shall be stronger then the temptation in its very pretence of pleasure; and therefore it must needs be pleasing to God, because it confesses God to be the best Master, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the best work, and it serves God with choice, and will, and reconciles our nature to it, and entertaines our appetite, and then there is no <hi>ansa</hi> or handle left whereby we can easily be drawne from duty, when all parties are pleased with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. But this delight is not to be understood as if it were alwayes required that we should feele an actuall cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and sensible joy; such as was that of <hi>Jonathan</hi> when he had newly tasted honey, and the light came into his eyes, and he was refreshed and pleasant. This happens sometimes when God please to intice, or reward a mans spirit, with little An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepasts of heaven; but such a delight onely is necessary, and a duty, that we alwayes choose our duty regularly, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the pleasures of temptation, and proceed in the work of grace with a firme choice and unabated election; our joy must be a joy of hope, a joy at least of confident sufferers, the joys <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of faith and expectation; <hi>rejoycing in hope,</hi> so the Apostle calls it; that is, a going forward upon such a perswasion as sees the joyes of God laid up for the Children of men: and so the sun may shine under a cloud; and a man may <hi>rejoyce in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> and <hi>delight in losses;</hi> that is, though his outward man groanes, and faints, and dies, yet his spirit, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>the inner man</hi> is confident and industrious, and hath a hope by which it lives and works unto the end: It was the case of our blessed Saviour in his agony; his <hi>soule was exceeding sorrowfull unto death,</hi> and the load of his Fathers anger crushed his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and bowed his knees to the ground; and yet he chose it, and still went forward, and resolved to die, and did so; and what wee choose wee delight in; and wee thinke it to be <hi>eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,</hi> and therefore <hi>amiable,</hi> and fit by its proper excellencies and appendages to be delighted in; it is not pleasant to the flesh
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48497:93"/>
at all times, for its dignity is spirituall and heavenly; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it is proportioned to the spirit, which is as heavenly as the reward, and therefore can feel the joys of it, when the body hangs the head, and is uneasie and troubled.</p>
            <p>These are the necessary parts of zeale; of which if any man failes, he is in a state of lukewarmnesse, and that is a spirituall death. As a banished man or a condemned person is <hi>dead civilly;</hi> he is <hi>diminutus capite,</hi> he is not reckoned in the <hi>census,</hi> nor partakes of the priviledges, nor goes for a person, but is reckoned among things in the possession of others: so is a lukewarm person; he is <hi>corde diminutus,</hi> he is spiritually dead, his heart is estranged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from God, his affections are lessened, his hope diminished, and his title cancell'd, and he remains so, unlesse, 1. he prefers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion before the world, and 2. spiritually rejoyces in doing his duty, and 3. doe it constantly, and with perseverance. These are the heats and warmth of life; whatsoever is lesse then this, is a disease, and leads to the coldnesse and dishonors of the grave.</p>

            <p n="3">3. SO long as our zeal and forwardnesse in Religion hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these constituent parts, it hath no more then can keep the duty alive: but beyond this, there are many degrees of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse and vehemence which are progressions towards the state of perfection, which every man ought to design and desire to be added to his portion: of this sort I reckon <hi>frequency in prayer,</hi> and <hi>almes above our estate.</hi> Concerning which two instances I have these two cautions to insert. 1. Concerning <hi>frequency in prayer,</hi> it is an act of zeal so ready and prepared for the spirit of a man, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> easie and usefull, so without objection, and so fitted for every mans affairs, his necessities and possibilities, that he that prayes but seldome, cannot in any sense pretend to be <hi>a religious person.</hi> For in Scripture there is no other rule for the frequency of prayer given us, but by such words which signifie we should do it <hi>alwaies, Pray continually:</hi> and, <hi>Men ought alwayes to pray and not to faint.</hi> And then, men have so many necessities, that if we should esteem our needs to be the circumstances and positive determination of our times of prayer, we should be very far from admitting limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the former words, but they must mean that we ought to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> pray frequently every day. For in danger and trouble, naturall Religion teaches us to pray: In a festivall fortune our prudence, and our needs inforce us equally. For though we feel not a present smart, yet we are certain then is our biggest danger: and if we observe how the world treats her darlings, men of riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of prosperity and great successe, we cannot but confesse them to be the most miserable of all men, as being in the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of losing their biggest interest. For they are bigger then the iron hand of Law, and <hi>they cannot be restrain'd with fear:</hi> the hand grasps a power of doing all that which their evill heart can desire, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and <hi>they cannot be restrained with disability to sin;</hi> they are flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by all mean, and base, and indiligent persons, which are the greatest part of mankinde; but few men dare reprove a potent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>he shall every day be flattered and seldome counselled:</hi> and his great reflexions and opinions of his condition makes him impatient
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48497:94"/>
of reproof, and so <hi>he cannot be restrain'd with modesty:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as the needs of the poor man, his rent day, and the cryes of his children, and the oppression he groans under, and his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his uneasie, ill sleeping care will make him run to his prayers, that in heaven a new decree may be passed every day for the provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his daily bread: so the greater needs of the rich, their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and their dangers, the flattery and the vanity, the power and the pride, their businesse and evill estate of the whole world upon them, cals upon them to be zealous in this instance that they <hi>pray often,</hi> that they <hi>pray without ceasing;</hi> For there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they should do so, and great security and advantage, if they do; For, <hi>he that prayes well and prayes often, must needs be a good and a</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>blessed man;</hi> and truly he that does not, deserves no pity for his misery. For when all the troubles and dangers of his condition may turn into his good, if he will but desire they should; when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such easie terms he may be happy, for there is no more trouble in it then this, <hi>Aske and ye shall receive;</hi> that's all that is required; no more turnings and variety in their road; when (I say) at so cheap a rate, a poor man may be provided for, and a rich man may escape damnation, they that refuse to apply themselves to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, <hi>quickly, earnestly, zealously, and constantly,</hi> deserves the smart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of his poverty and the care of it, and the scorne <hi>if he be poor,</hi> and <hi>if he be rich</hi> it is fit he should (because he desires it) dye by the evils of his proper danger. * It was observed by <hi>Cassian; orationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus maximè insidiantur Daemones,</hi> the Devill is more busie to disturb our prayers, then to hinder any thing else. For else it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined why we should be brought to pray so seldome, and to be so listlesse to them, and so trifling to them. No, <hi>The Devill knowes upon what hard terms he stands with the praying man;</hi> he also knows that it is a mighty emanation of Gods infinite goodnesse and a strange desire of saving mankinde, that he hath to so easie a duty promised such mighty blessings. For God knowing that upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hard terms we would not accept of heaven it self, and yet hell was so intolerable a state, that God who loved us would affixe heaven to a state of prayer and devotion; this, because the Devill knowes to be one of the greatest arts of the Divine mercy, he labours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to supplant; and if he can but make men unwilling to pray, or <hi>to pray coldly,</hi> or <hi>to pray seldome,</hi> he secures his interest, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys the mans; and it is infinitely strange, that he can and doth prevail so much in this so unreasonable temptation. <hi>Opposuisti nubem ne transiret oratio,</hi> the mourning Prophet complained there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 44.</note> was a cloud passed between heaven and the prayer of <hi>Judah;</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thing God knowes; it was a wall which might have been blown down with a few hearty sighs, and a few penitentiall tears; or if the prayers had ascended in a full and numerous body, themselves would have broken through that little partition; but so the Devill
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48497:94"/>
prevails often; <hi>opponit nubem:</hi> he claps a cloud between; some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> little objection; <hi>a stranger is come; or my head akes; or the Church is too cold; or I have letters to write; or I am not disposed; or it is not yet time, or the time is past:</hi> these, and such as these are the <hi>clouds,</hi> the Devill claps between heaven and us; but these are such impotent objections, that they were as soon confuted as pretended, by all men that are not fools, or professed enemies of Religion, but that they are clouds: which sometimes look like Lions and Bears, Castles, and wals of fire, armies and horses; and indeed are any thing that a man will fancy; and the smallest article of objection managed and conducted by the Devils arts, and meeting with a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wretchlesse, carelesse, indevout spirit, is a Lion in the way, and a deep river; it is impassable, and it is impregnable. <gap reason="foreign">

For in frequent prayer there is so much rest and pleasure, that as soon as ever it is perceived, the contrary temptation appears unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; none are so unwilling to pray as they that pray seldome; for they that do pray often, and with zeal, and passion and desire, feel no trouble so great as when they are forced to omit their holy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and hours of prayer. It concerns the Devils interest to keep us from all the experience of the rewards of a frequent and holy prayer; and so long as you will not try and <hi>taste how good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the Lord is</hi> to the praying man, so long you cannot see the evill of your coldnesse and lukewarm state; but if you would but try, though it be but for curiosity sake, and informe your selves in the vanity of things, and the truth of pretences, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Theologicall propositions, you should finde your selves taken in a golden snare, which will tye you to nothing but <hi>felicity,</hi> and <hi>safety,</hi> and <hi>holinesse,</hi> and <hi>pleasures.</hi> But then the caution which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> I intended to insert is this; that <hi>frequency in prayers,</hi> and that part of zeal which relates to it, is to be upon no account but of an <hi>holy spirit, a wise heart,</hi> and <hi>reasonable perswasion;</hi> for if it begins upon passion or fear, in imitation of others, or desires of reputation, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or phantastick principles, it will be unblessed and weary,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48497:95"/>
unprosperous and without return or satisfaction: therefore if it happen to begin upon a weak principle, be very curious to change <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the motive, and with all speed let it be turned into religion and the love of holy things, then let it be as frequent as it can prudently, it cannot be amisse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When you are entred into a state of zealous prayer, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular devotion, what ever interruption you can meet with, observe their causes and be sure to make them irregular, seldome, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, that your omissions may be seldome and casuall, as a bare accident; for which no provisions can be made; for if ever it come, that you take any thing <hi>habitually</hi> and <hi>constantly</hi> from your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> prayers, or that you distract from them <hi>very frequently,</hi> it cannot be but you will become troublesome to your self; your prayers will be uneasie, they will seem hinderances to your more necessary affairs of passion and interest, and the things of the world: and it will not stand still, till it comes to <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and a direct despite and contempt of holy things. For it was an old rule, and of a sad experience, <hi>Tepiditas si callum obduxerit fiet apostasia,</hi> if your luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse be habituall and <hi>a state</hi> of life, if it once be hardned by the usages of many daies, it changes the whole state of the man, it makes him an apostate to devotion. Therefore be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> carefull in this particular; alwayes remembring the saying of St. <hi>Chrysostome, Docendi, praedicandi officia &amp; alia cessant suo tempore, precandi autem nunquam;</hi> there are seasons for teaching, and preaching, and other outward offices; but prayer is the duty of all times, and of all persons, and in all contingences: From other things in many cases we can be excused, but from prayer never. In this therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is good to be zealous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the second instance I named, <hi>viz.</hi> To give almes above our estate, it is an excellent act of zeal, and needs no other caution to make it secure from illusion and danger, but that <hi>our</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>egressions of charity do not prejudice justice.</hi> See that your almes do not other men wrong, and let them do what they can to thy self, they will never prejudice thee by their abundance; but then be also carefull that the pretences of justice do not cousen thy self of thy charity, and the poor of thine almes, and thy soul of the reward. He that is in debt is not excused from giving almes till his debts are paid; but only from giving away such portions which should and would pay them, and such which he intended should do it: There are <hi>lacernae divitiarum,</hi> and crums from the table, and the gleanings of the harvest, and the scatterings of the vintage, which in all estates are the portions of the poor, which being collected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by the hand of providence, and united wisely may become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable to the poor, and are the necessary duties of charity; but beyond this also, every considerable relief to the poor is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable diminution to the estate, and yet if it be, it is not alwaies
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48497:95"/>
considerable in the accounts of Justice; for nothing ought to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> pretended against the zeal of almes, but the certain omissions or the very probable retarding the doing that, to which we are otherwise obliged. He that is going to pay a debt and in the way meets an indigent person that needs it all, may not give it to him unlesse he knowes by other means to pay the debt; but if he can do both, he hath his liberty to lay out his money for a Crown. But then in the case of provision for children our restraint is not so easie, or discernible; 1. Because we are not bound to provide for them in a certain portion, but may do it by the analogies and measures of prudence, in which there is a great latitude. 2. Because our zeal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of charity is a good portion for them, and layes up a blessing for inheritance. 3. Because the fairest portions of charity are usually short of such sums which can be considerable in the duty of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for our children. 4. If we for them could be content to take any measure lesse then all, any thing under every thing that we can, we should finde the portions of the poor made ready to our hands sufficiently to minister to zeal, and yet not to intrench upon this case of conscience; But the truth is; we are so carelesse, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skil'd, so unstudied in religion, that we are only glad to make an an excuse, and to defeat our souls of the reward of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest grace: we are contented if we can but make a pretence; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for we are highly pleased if our conscience be quiet, and care not so much that our duty be performed; much lesse that our eternall interest be advanced in bigger portions. We care not, we strive not, we think not of getting the greater rewards of Heaven; and he whose desires are so indifferent for the greater, will not take pains to secure the smallest portion; and it is observable, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the least in the Kingdome of heaven, is as much as <gap reason="foreign">

He that does his almes, and resolves that in no case he will suffer inconvenience for his brother whose case it may be is intolerable, should do well to remember that God in some cases requires a greater charity; and it may be we shall be called to dye for the good of our brother: and that although it alwaies supposes a zeal, and a holy fervour, yet sometimes it is also a duty, and we lose our lives if we go to save them; and so we do with our estates; when we are such good husbands in our Religion, that we will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> serve all our own conveniences before the great needs of a hungry and afflicted brother, God oftentimes takes from us that which with so much curiosity we would preserve, and then we lose our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and our reward too.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The first measure, by which our zeal may comply with our duty, and its actions become laudable, is <hi>charity to our neighbour.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3.</note> For since God receives all that glorification of himself whereby we can serve and minister to his glory, reflected upon the foundation of his own <hi>goodnesse,</hi> and <hi>bounty,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and all the <hi>Allellujahs</hi> that are or ever shall be sung in heaven are praises and thank givings, and that God himself does not receive glory from the acts of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Justice, but then when his creatures will not rejoyce in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and mercy, it followes that we imitate this originall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and pursue Gods own method, that is, glorifie him <hi>in via misericordiae,</hi> in the way of <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>bounty, charity,</hi> and <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, love,</hi> and <hi>fair compliances;</hi> There is no greater charity in the world then to save a soul, nothing that pleases God better, nothing that can be in our hands greater or more noble, nothing that can be a more lasting and delightfull honour, then that a perishing soul, snatched from the flames of an intolerable Hell, and born to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the wings of piety and mercy, by the Ministery of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the graces of the holy Spirit, shall to eternall ages blesse God and blesse thee, <hi>Him,</hi> for the <hi>Author and finisher</hi> of salvation, and thee for the Minister and charitable instrument; that bright starre must needs look pleasantly upon thy face for ever, which was by thy hand plac'd there, and had it not been by thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery might have been a footy coal, in the regions of sorrow.

This is a charity that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared more or lesse for every one; and <hi>by the way</hi> we should do well to consider what we have done towards it.

               </gap>, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in these it is good to be zealous, for you can never goe farre enough.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next measure of zeal is <hi>prudence.</hi> For, as <hi>charity</hi> is <hi>the matter of zeal,</hi> so is <hi>discretion the manner.</hi> It must alwaies be for good to our neighbour, and there needs no rules for the conducting
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48497:97"/>
of that, provided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the end be consonant to the design, that is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that charity be intended, and charity done. But there is a <hi>zeal</hi> also <hi>of Religion</hi> or worshipping, and this hath more need of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and proper cautions. For Religion can turn into a snare, it may be abused into <hi>superstition,</hi> it may become wearinesse in the spirit, and tempt to tediousnesse, to hatred, and despair: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny persons through their indiscreet conduct and furious marches, and great loads taken upon tender shoulders and unexperienced, have come to be perfect haters of their joy, and despisers of all their <hi>hopes,</hi> being like dark Lanthorns, in which a candle burnes bright, but the body is incompassed with a crust and a dark cloud of iron; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and these men keep the fires and light of holy propositions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, but the darknesse of hell, the hardnesse of a vexed heart hath shaded all the light, and makes it neither apt to warm nor to enlighten others, but it turnes to fire within, a feaver and a distemper dwels there, and Religion is become their torment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore <hi>our zeal must never carry us beyond that which is profitable.</hi> There are many institutions, customes, and usages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into Religion upon very fair motives, and apted to great necessities; but to imitate those things when they are disrobed of their proper ends is an importune zeal, and signifies nothing but a forward minde, and an easie heart, and an imprudent head; unlesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> these actions can be invested with other ends and usefull purposes. The primitive Church were strangely inspired with a zeal of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, in order to the necessities of preaching and travelling, and easing the troubles and temptations of persecution; but when the necessity went on, and drove the holy men into deserts, that made Colleges of Religious, and their manner of life was such; so united, so poor, so dressed, that they must live <hi>more non saeculari,</hi> after the manner of men divore'd from the usuall entercourses of the world, still their desire of single life increased; because the old necessity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> lasted, and a new one did supervene. Afterwards the case was altered, and then the single life was not to be chosen for it self, nor yet in imitation of the first precedents; for it could not be taken out from their circumstances and <hi>be used alone.</hi> He therefore that thinks he is a more holy person for being a virgin or a widower, or that he is bound to be so because they were so, or that he cannot be a religious person because he is not so, hath zeal indeed, but not according to knowledge. But now if the single state can be taken out and put to new appendages, and fitted to the end of another grace or essentiall duty of Religion, it will well become a Christian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> zeal to choose it so long as it can serve the end with advantage and security. Thus also a zealous person is to chuse his fastings; while they are necessary to him, and are acts of proper mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while he is tempted, or while he is under discipline, while he repents, or while he obeys; but some persons fast in zeal, but for
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48497:98"/>
nothing else; fast when they have no need, when there is need they should not; but call it religion to be miserable or sick; here their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> zeal is folly, for it is neither an act of Religion nor of prudence, to fast when fasting probably serves no end of the spirit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fasting dayes of the Church, although it is warrant enough to us to fast if we had no end to serve in it but the meer obedience, yet it is necessary that the <hi>superiors</hi> should not think the Law obeyed, unlesse the end of the first institution be observed; a fasting day is a day of humiliation, and prayer; and fasting being nothing it self, but wholly the handmaid of a further grace, ought not to be devested of its holinesse and sanctification, and left like the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wals of a ruinous Church, where there is no duty performed to God, but there remains something of that which us'd to minister to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The want of this consideration hath caus'd so much scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and dispute, so many snares and schismes concerning Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall fasts. For when it was undressed and stripp'd of all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and usefull appendages, when from a solemn day it grew to be common; from thence to be lesse devout by being lesse sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and lesse usefull; and then it passed from a day of Religion to be a day of order, and from fasting till night, to fasting till evening-song, and evening-song to be sung about twelve a clock; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and from fasting it was changed to a choice of food, from eating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eating fish, and that the letter began to be stood upon, and no usefulnesse remain'd but what every of his own piety should put into it, but nothing was enjoyn'd by the Law, nothing of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the superiours, then the Law fell into disgrace, and the design became suspected, and men were first insnared, and then scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, and then began to complain without remedy, and at last took remedy themselves without authority; the whole affair fell into a disorder and a mischief; and zeal was busie on both sides, and on both sides was mistaken, because they fell not upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> proper remedy, which was to reduce the Law to the usefulnesse and advantages of its first intention. But this I intended not to have spoken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Our zeal must never carry us beyond that which is safe.</hi> Some there are who in their first attempts and entries upon Religion while the passion that brought them in remains, undertake things as great as their highest thoughts; no repentance is sharp enough, no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities expensive enough, no fastings afflictive enough, then <hi>totis Quinquatribus orant;</hi> and finding some deliciousnesse at the first contest, and in that activity of their passion, they make vowes to binde themselves for ever to this state of delicacies. The onset is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fair: but the event is this. The age of a passion, is not long, and the flatulent spirit being breathed out, the man begins to abate of his first heats, and is ashamed: but then he considers that all that was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and therefore he will abate something more and <hi>from</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:48497:98"/>
               <hi>something to something, at last it will come to just nothing,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the proper effect of this is, <hi>indignation</hi> and <hi>hatred of holy things, an impudent spirit, carelessenesse</hi> or <hi>despair.</hi> Zeal sometimes carries a man into temptation: and he that never thinks he loves God duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or acceptably, because he is not imprison'd for him, or undone, or design'd to Martyrdome, may desire a triall that will undoe him. It is like fighting of a Duell to shew our valour. Stay till the King commands you to fight and die, and then let zeal do its noblest offices. This irregularity and mistake was too frequent in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, when men and women would strive for death, and be ambitious to feel the hangmans sword; some miscarryed in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> attempt, and became sad examples of the unequall yoking a frail spirit with a zealous driver.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let <hi>Zeal never transport us to attempt any thing but what is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. M. Teresa</hi> made a vow that she would do alwaies that which was absolutely the best. But neither could <hi>her understanding</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tell her which was so, nor <hi>her will</hi> alwayes have the same fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: and it must often breed scruples, and sometimes tediousnesse, and wishes that the vow were unmade. He that vowes never to have an ill thought, never to commit an error, hath taken a course that his little infirmities shall become crimes, and certainly be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by changing his unavoidable infirmity into vow-breach. Zeal is a violence to a mans spirit, and unlesse the spirit be secur'd by the proper nature of the duty, and the circumstances of the action, and the possibilities of the man; it is like a great fortune in the meanest person, it bears him beyond his limit, and breaks him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dangers and passions, transportations and all the furies of disorder that can happen to an abused person.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Zeal is not safe unlesse it be <hi>in re probabili</hi> too, it must be in a likely matter. For we that finde so many excuses to untie all our just obligations, and distinguish our duty into so much finenesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that it becomes like leaf-gold apt to be gone at every breath; it can not be prudent that we zealously undertake what is not probable to be effected. If we do, the event can be nothing but portions of the former evill, <hi>scruple</hi> and <hi>snares, shamefull retreats</hi> and <hi>new fantastick principles;</hi> In all our undertakings we must consider what is our state of life, what our naturall inclinations, what is our society, and what are our dependencies; by what necessities we are born down, by what hopes we are biassed; and by these let us measure our heats and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per businesse. A zealous man runs up a sandy hill; the violence of motion is his greatest hinderance, and a passion in Religion destroys <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as much of our evennesse of spirit, as it sets forward any outward work; and therefore although it be a good circumstance and degree of a spirituall duty, so long as it is within, and relative to God and our selves; so long it is a holy flame; but if it be in an outward duty, or relative to our neighbours, or in an instance not necessary,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48497:99"/>
it sometimes spoils the action, and alwaies endangers it. But I must remember we live in an age in which men have more need of new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> fires to be kindled within them and round about them, then of any thing to allay their forwardnesse: there is little or no zeal now but the zeal of envie, and killing as many as they can, and damning more then they can; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>smoke and lurking fires</hi> do corrode and secretly consume: therefore this discourse is lesse necessary. A Physitian would have but small imployment near the <hi>Riphaean Mountains,</hi> if he could cure nothing but Calentures; Catarrhes, and dead palfies, Colds and Consumptions are their evils, and so is luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse and deadnesse of spirit, the proper maladies of our age: for though some are hot when they are mistaken, yet men are cold in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> righteous cause; and the nature of this evill is to be insensible, and the men are farther from a cure because they neither feel their evill, nor perceive their danger. But of this I have already given account: and to it, I shall only adde what an old spirituall person told a novice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, asking him the cause why he so frequently suffered tediousnesse in his religious offices; <hi>Nondum vidisti requiem quam speramus, nec tormenta quae timemus;</hi> young man, thou hast not seen the glories which are laid up for the zealous and devout, nor yet beheld the flames which are prepared for the lukewarm, and the haters of strict devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the Jewes tell that <hi>Adam</hi> having seen the beauties, and tasted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the delicacies of Paradise, repented and mourned upon the <hi>Indian Mountains</hi> for three hundred years together: and we who have a great share in the cause of his sorrowes, can by nothing be invited to a persevering, a great, a passionate religion, more then by remembring what he lost, and what is laid up for them whose hearts are burning lamps, and are all on fire with Divine love, whose flames are fann'd with the wings of the holy Dove, and whose spirits shine and burn with that fire which the holy Jesus came to enkindle upon the earth.</p>

When <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> describes the spare diet of <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> he uses this expression; <hi>Liberaliora sunt alimenta carceris: sepositos ad capitale supplicium, non tam angustè, qui occisurus est, pascit.</hi> The prison keeps a better table, and he that is to kill the criminall to morrow morning, gives him a better supper over night. By this he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to represent his meal to be very short: for as dying persons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> have but little stomach to feast high; so they that mean to cut the throat will think it a vain expence to please it with delicacies, which after the first alteration must be poured upon the ground, and looked upon as the worst part of the accursed thing. And there is also the same proportion of unreasonablenesse, that because men shall <hi>die</hi>

               <hi>to morrow,</hi> and by the sentence and unalterable decree of God, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are now descending to their graves, that therefore they should first destroy their reason, and then force dull time to run faster, that they may dye sottish as beasts, and speedily as a flie: But they thought there was no life after this; or if there were, it was without plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and every soul thrust into a hole, and a dorter of a spans length allowed for his rest, and for his walk; and in the shades below no numbring of healths by the numerall letters of <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi>'s name, no fat Mullets, no Oysters of <hi>Luerinus,</hi> no <hi>Lesbian</hi> or <hi>Chian</hi> Wines, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Thus they thought they discoursed wisely, and their wisdome was turned into folly; for all their arts of providence, and witty securities of pleasure were nothing but unmanly prologues to death, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>folly, sensuality</hi> and <hi>beastly pleasures.</hi> But they are to be excused rather then we.

            <p n="1">1. That plenty and the pleasures of the world are no proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of felicity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That intemperance is a certain enemy to it; making life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant, and death troublesome and intolerable.</p>

3. I shall adde the rules and measures of temperance in eating and drinking, that nature and grace may joyne to the constitution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of mans felicity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Plenty and the pleasures of the world are no proper instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of felicity. It is necessary that a man have some violence done to himself before he can receive them: for natures bounds are, <hi>non esurire, non sitire, non algere,</hi> to be quit from hunger, and thirst, and cold, that is, to have nothing upon us that puts us to pain; against which she hath made provisions by the fleece of the sheep, and the skins of beasts, by the waters of the fountain, and the hearbs of the field, and of these no good man is destitute, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that share that he can need to fill those appetites and necessities he cannot otherwise avoid: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For it is unimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that Nature should be a mother naturall and indulgent to the beasts of the forrest, and the spawn of fishes, to every plant and <hi>fungus,</hi> to cats and owles, to moles and bats, making her store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses alwaies to stand open to them, and that for the Lord of all these, even to the noblest of her productions she should have made no provisions, and only produc'd in us appetites sharp as the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of Wolves, troublesome as the Tigres hunger, and then run away, leaving <hi>art</hi> and <hi>chance, violence</hi> and <hi>study,</hi> to feed us and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> cloath us. This is so far from truth, that we are certainly more provided for by nature then all the world besides; for everything can minister to us; and we can passe into none of Natures cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, but we can finde our table spread: so that what <hi>David</hi> said to God, <hi>Whither shall I go from thy presence?

are ministred singly; by that labour that can procure what we need, by that wisdome that can consider concerning future necessities, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that power that can force it from inferiour creatures, and by that temperance which can fit our meat to our necessities. For if we go beyond what is needfull, as we finde sometimes more then was promised, and very often more then we need, so we disorder the certainty of our felicity, by putting that to a hazard which nature hath secur'd. For it is not certain that if we desire to have the wealth of <hi>Susa,</hi> or garments stain'd with the bloud of the <hi>Tyrian</hi> fish, that if we desire to feed like <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> or to have tables loaden like the boards of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> that we shall never want.

            <p>And now that I have told you the foulnesse of the Epicures feasts <note place="margin">3.</note> and principles, it will be fit that I describe the measures of our eating and drinking, that the needs of nature may neither become the cover to an intemperate dish, nor the freer refreshment of our persons be changed into scruples, that neither our vertue nor our conscience fall into an evill snare.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first measure of our eating and drinking is our <hi>natural needs,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; these are the measures of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nature, that the body be free from pain, and the soul from violence. <hi>Hunger,</hi> and <hi>thirst,</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> are the naturall diseases of the body; and food, and rayment, are their remedies, and therefore are the measures.</p>
            <q>
               <l>In quantum sitis atque fames, &amp; frigora poscunt,</l>
               <l>Quantum Epicure tibi parvis suffecit in hortis.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But in this there are two cautions. 1. Hunger and thirst are onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to be extinguished while they are violent and troublesome, and are not to be provided for to the utmost extent and possibilities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; a man is not hungry so long, till he can eat no more, but till its sharpnesse and trouble is over, and he that does not leave some reserves for temperance, gives all that he can to <hi>nature,</hi> and nothing at all to <hi>grace;</hi> For God hath given a latitude in desires and degrees of appetite; and when he hath done, he laid restraint upon it in some whole instances, and of some parts in every instance; that man might have something to serve God of his own, and something to distinguish him from a beast in the use of their common faculties. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Beasts cannot refrain but fill all the capacity, when they can; and if a man does so, he does what becomes a beast, and not a man. And therefore there are some little symptomes of this inordination, by which a man may perceive himself to have transgressed his measures; <hi>Ructation, uneasie loads, singing, looser pratings, importune drowsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:48497:109"/>
               <hi>provocation of others to equall and full chalices;</hi> and though in every accident of this signification, it is hard for another to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that the man hath sinned, yet by these he may suspect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and learn the next time to hold the bridle harder.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This hunger must be naturall,</hi> not artificiall and provoked: For many men make necessities to themselves, and then think they are bound to provide for them. It is necessary to some men to have garments made of the <hi>Calabrian</hi> fleece stain'd with the blood of the <hi>murex,</hi> and to get money to buy pearls round and orient; <hi>scelerata hoc fecit pulpa;</hi> but it is the mans luxury that made it so; and by the same principle it is, that in-meats, what is abundant to nature is defective and beggerly to art; and when nature willingly rises from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Table, when the first course of flesh, plain, and naturall is done, then art, and sophistry, and adulterate dishes invite him to taste and die, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> well may a sober man <note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> wonder that men should be so much in love with earth and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the parent of rottennesse, and a disease, that even then when by all laws <hi>witches</hi> and <hi>inchanters, murderers</hi> and <hi>manstealers</hi> are chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and restrain'd with the iron hands of death, yet that men should at great charges give pensions to an order of men, whose trade it is to rob them of their temperance, and wittily to destroy their health; <gap reason="foreign">

He that drinks a draught or two of water, and cooles his thirst, drinks no more till his thirst returnes; but he that drinks wine, drinks it again, longer then it is needfull, even so long as it is pleasant. Nature best provides for her self when she spreads her own Table; but when men have gotten su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> habits, and new necessities; art that brought them in must maintain them, but <hi>wantonnesse and folly wait at the table, and sickness and death take away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reason</hi> is the second measure, or rather <hi>the rule</hi> whereby we judge of intemperance; For whatsoever loads of meat or drink make
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48497:109"/>
the reason uselesse, or troubled, are effects of this deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not that reason is the adequate measure, for a man may be intemperate upon other causes, though he doe not force his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and trouble his head. Some are strong to drink, and can eat like a wolfe, and love to doe so, as fire to destroy the stubble; such were those Harlots in the Comedy, <hi>Quae cum amatore suo cum coenant liguriunt:</hi> These persons are to take their accounts from the measures of Religion, and the Spirit; though they can talk still or transact the affaires of the world, yet if they be not fitted for the things of the Spirit, they are too full of flesh or wine, and cannot or care not to attend to the things of God. But reason is the limit beyond which temperance never wanders; and in every degree in which our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is troubled, and our soul is lifted from its wheels, in the same degree the sin prevails. <hi>Dum sumus in quâdam delinquendi libidine, nebulis quibusdam insipientiae mens obducitur,</hi> saith St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> when the flesh-pots reek, and the uncovered dishes send forth a <hi>nidor</hi> and <hi>hungry smels,</hi> that cloud hides the face, and puts out the eye of reason; and then tell them <hi>mors in ollâ,</hi> that <hi>death is in the pot,</hi> and <hi>folly in the chalice,</hi> that those smels are fumes of brimstone, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of <hi>Egypt;</hi> that they will make their heart easie, and their head sottish, and their colour pale, and their hands trembling, and their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> feet tormented:</p>

For besides hunger and thirst, there are some labours of the body, and others of the mind, and there are sorrows and loads upon the spirit by its communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the indispositions of the body; and as the labouring man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> may be supplyed with bigger quantities, so the <hi>student</hi> and <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative</hi> man with more delicious and spritefull nutriment: for as the tender and more delicate easily-digested meats will not help to carry burthens upon the neck, and hold the plough in society and yokes of the laborious oxen; so neither will the pulse and the leeks, <hi>Lavinian</hi>

            <p>But in these cases <hi>necessity,</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> are to make the measures and the rule; and so long as the just end is fairly designed, and aptly ministred to, there ought to be no scruple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the quantity or quality of the provision: and he that would stint a Swain by the commons of a Student, and give <hi>Philotas</hi> the Candian, the leavings of <hi>Plato,</hi> does but ill serve the ends of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but worse of prudence and necessity.</p>

For great sorrow and importune melancholy may be as great a sin as a great anger; and if it be a sin in its nature, it is more malignant and dangerous in its quality; as naturally tending to murmur and despair, wearinesse of Religion, and hatred of God, timorousnesse and jealousies, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick images of things and superstition; and therefore as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to restrain the feavers of anger, so also to warm the freezings and dulnesse of melancholy by prudent and temperate, but proper <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and apportion'd diets; and if some meats and drinks make men lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or sleepy, or dull, or lazy, or spritely, or merry, so far as meats and drinks can minister to the passion, and the passion minister to vertue, so far by this means they may be provided for. <hi>Give</hi>

But this is not intended to be an habituall cure, but single and occasionall; for he that hath a pertinacious sorrow is beyond the cure of meat and drink, and if this become every days physick, it will quickly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> become every days sin. 2.

5. Even when a man hath no necessity upon him, no pungent sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or naturall or artificiall necessity, it is lawfull in some cases of eating and drinking to receive pleasure and intend it. For whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is <hi>naturall and necessary,</hi> is therefore <hi>not criminall,</hi> because it is of Gods procuring; and since we eate for need, and the satisfaction of our need is a removing of a pain, and that in nature is the greatest pleasure, it is impossible that in its own nature it should be a sin. But in this case of Conscience, these cautions are to be observed: 1. So long as nature ministers the pleasure and not art, it is materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally innocent. <hi>Si tuo veniat jure, luxuria est:</hi> But it is safe while <note place="margin">Senec<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> it enters upon natures stock; for it is impossible that the proper effect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of health, and temperance, and prudent abstinence should be vicious; and yet these are the parents of the greatest pleasure, in eating and drinking. <hi>Malum panem expecta, bonus fiet; etiam illum tenerum tibi &amp; siligineum fames reddet:</hi> If you abstaine and be hungry, you shall turne the meanest provision into delicate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let all the pleasure of meat and drink be such as can minister to health, and be within the former bounds. For since pleasure in eating and drinking is its naturall appendage, and like a shadow follows the substance, as the meat is to be accounted, so is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and if these be observed, there is no difference whether nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or art be the Cook. For some constitutions, and some mens customes, and some mens educations, and necessities, and weaknesses are such, that their appetite is to be invited, and their digestion helped, but all this while we are within the bounds of nature and need.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is lawfull when a man needs meat to choose the pleasan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even meerly for their pleasures; that is, because they are pleasant, besides that they are usefull; this is as lawfull as to smell of a rose, or to lye in feathers, or change the posture of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> our body in bed for ease, or to hear musick, or to walk in gardens rather then the high-wayes; and God hath given us leave to be delighted in those things which he made to that purpose, that we may also be delighted in him that gives them. For so as the more pleasant may <hi>better</hi> serve for <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> to <hi>refreshment,</hi> so <hi>collaterally</hi> to <hi>Religion:</hi> Alwayes provided, that it be in its degree mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and we temperate in our desires, without transportation and violence, without unhandsome usages of our selves, or taking from God and from Religion any minutes and portions of our affections. When <hi>Eicadastes</hi> the <hi>Epicure</hi> saw a goodly dish of hot meat serv'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> up, he sung the verse of <hi>Homer,</hi>

            <p>and swallowed some of it greedily, till by its hands of fire it curled
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48497:111"/>
his stomach, like parchment in the flame, and he was carryed from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his banquet to his grave.</p>
            <q>Non poterat letho nobiliore mori:</q>
            <p>It was fit <hi>he</hi> should dye such a death; but <hi>that death</hi> bids us beware of <hi>that folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let the pleasure as it came with the meat, so also passe away with it. <hi>Philoxenus</hi> was a beast, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he wisht his throat as long as a Cranes, that he might be long in swallowing his pleasant morsels: <hi>Moeret quòd magna pars felicitatis</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>exclusa esset corporis angustiis;</hi> he mourned because the pleasure of eating was not spread over all his body, that he might have been an Epicure in his hands: and indeed, if we consider it rightly, great eating and drinking is not the greatest pleasure of the <hi>taste,</hi> but of the <hi>touch;</hi> and <hi>Philoxenus</hi> might feel the unctious juyce slide softly down his throat, but he could not taste it in the middle of the long neck; and we see that they who mean to feast exactly, or delight the palate, do <hi>libare</hi> or <hi>pitissare,</hi> take up little proportions and spread them upon the tongue or palate; but <hi>full morsells</hi> and <hi>great draughts</hi> are easie and soft to the <hi>touch;</hi> but so is the feeling of silke, or handling of a melon, or a moles skin, and as delicious too as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> eating when it goes beyond the appetites of nature, and the proper pleasures of taste, which cannot be perceived but by a temperate man. And therefore let not the pleasure be intended beyond the taste; that is, beyond those little naturall measures in which God intended that pleasure should accompany your tables. Doe not run to it beforehand, nor chew the chud when the meal is done; delight not in the fancies, and expectations, and remembrances of a pleasant meal; but let it descend <hi>in latrinam,</hi> together with the meals whose attendant pleasure is.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let pleasure be the lesse principall, and used as a servant; it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> may be modest and prudent to strew the dish with Sugar, or to dip thy bread in vinegar, but to make thy meal of sauces, and to make the accessory become the principall, and pleasure to rule the table, and all the regions of thy soule, is to make a man lesse and lower then an Oglio, of a cheaper value then a Turbat; a servant and a worshipper of <hi>sauces,</hi> and <hi>cookes,</hi> and <hi>pleasure,</hi> and <hi>folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Let pleasure as it is used in the regions and limits of nature and prudence, so also be changed into religion and thankfulnesse. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>Turtures cum bibunt non resupinant colla,</hi> say Naturalists, Turtles when they drink lift not up their bills; and if we swallow our pleasures without returning the honour and the acknowledegment to God that gave them, we may <hi>largè bibere jumentorum modo,</hi> drink draughts as large as an Oxe, but we shall die like an Oxe,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48497:111"/>
and change our meats and drinks into eternall rottennesse. In all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Religions it hath been permitted to enlarge our Tables in the days of sacrifices and religious festivity.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Qui Veientarum festis potare diebus,</l>
               <l>Campanâ solitus trullâ, vappámque profestis.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For then the body may rejoyce in fellowship with the soule, and then a pleasant meal is religious, if it be not inordinate. But if our festivall dayes like the <hi>Gentile</hi> sacrifices end in drunkennesse [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] and our joyes in Religion passe into sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and beastly crimes, we change the Holy-day into a day of Death, and our selves become a Sacrifice as in the day of Slaughter.</p>
            <p>To summe up this particular, there are, as you perceive, many cautions to make our pleasure safe, but any thing can make it inordinate, and then scarce any thing can keep it from becoming dangerous.</p>

            <p>And now after all this, I pray consider, what a strange madness and prodigious folly possesses many men, that they love to swallow death, and diseases, and dishonor, with an appetite which no reason can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> restrain. We expect our servants should not dare to touch what we have forbidden to them; we are watchfull that our children should not swallow poysons, and filthinesse, and unwholesome nourishment; we take care that they should be well manner'd and civil and of fair demeanour; and we our selves desire to be, or
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48497:112"/>
at least to be accounted wise; and would infinitely scorne to be call'd fooles; and we are so great lovers of health, that we will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> buy it at any rate of money or observance; and then for honour, it is that which the children of men pursue with passion, it is one of the noblest rewards of vertue, and the proper ornament of the wise and valiant, and yet all these things are not valued or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, when a merry meeting, or a looser feast calls upon the man to act a scene of <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>madnesse,</hi> and <hi>healthlesnesse</hi> and <hi>dishonour.</hi> We doe to God what we severely punish in our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; we correct our children for their medling with dangers, which themselves preferre before immortality; and though no man think himselfe fit to be despised, yet he is willing to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> himselfe a beast, a sot, and a ridiculous monkey, with the follies and vapors of wine; and when he is high in drinke or fancy, proud as a <hi>Grecian</hi> Orator in the midst of his popular noyses, at the same time he shall talk such dirty language, such mean low things, as may well become a changeling and a foole, for whom the stocks are prepared by the laws, and the just scorne of men. Every drunkard clothes his head with a mighty scorne, and makes himselfe lower at that time then the meanest of his servants; the boyes can laugh at him when he is led like a cripple, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected like a blinde man, and speakes like an infant, imperfect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> noyses, lisping with a full and spungy tongue, and an empty head, and a vaine and foolish heart: so cheaply does he part with his honour for drink or loads of meat; for which honour he is ready to die, rather then hear it to be disparaged by another; when himselfe destroyes it, as bubbles perish with the breath of children. Doe not the laws of all wise Nations marke the drunkard for a foole, with the meanest and most scornfull pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment? and is there any thing in the world so foolish as a man that is drunk? But good God! what an intolerable sorrow hath seised upon great portions of Mankind, that this folly and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> madnesse should possesse the greatest spirits, and the wittyest men, the best company, the most sensible of the word <hi>honour,</hi> and the most jealous of loosing the <hi>shadow,</hi> and the most carelesse of the <hi>thing?</hi> Is it not a horrid thing, that a wise, or a crafty, a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or a noble person should dishonour himselfe as a foole, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy his body as a murtherer, lessen his estate as a prodigall, disgrace every good cause that he can pretend to by his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and become an appellative of scorne, a scene of laughter or derision, <hi>and all,</hi> for the reward of forgetfulnesse and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for there are in immoderate drinking no other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
            <p>Why doe valiant men and brave personages fight and die ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then break the laws of men, or start from their duty to their Prince, and will suffer themselves to be cut in pieces rather
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48497:112"/>
then deserve the name of a Traitor or perjur'd? and yet these very men to avoyd the hated name of <hi>Glutton</hi> or <hi>Drunkard,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to preserve their Temperance, shall not deny themselves one luscious morsell, or poure a cup of wine on the ground, when they are invited to drink by the laws of the circle or wilder company.</p>
            <p>Me thinks it were but reason, that if to give life to uphold a cause be not too much, they should not think too much to be hungry and suffer thirst for the reputation of that cause; and therefore much rather that they would thinke it but duty to be temperate for its honour, and eat and drink in civill and faire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> measures, that themselves might not lose the reward of so much suffering, and of so good a relation, nor that which they value most be destroyed by drink.</p>
            <p>There are in the world a generation of men that are ingag'd in a cause, which they glory in, and pride themselves in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and appellative: but yet for that cause they will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but talk and drink; they are valiant in wine, and witty in healths, and full of stratagem to promote debauchery; but such persons are not considerable in wise accounts; that which I deplore is, that some men preferre a cause before their life, and yet preferre wine before that cause, and by one drunken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> meeting set it more backward in its hopes and blessings, then it can be set forward by the counsels and armes of a whole yeer. God hath ways enough to reward a truth without crowning it with successe in the hands of such men. In the mean time they dishonour Religion, and make truth be evill spoken of, and innocent persons to suffer by their very relation, and the cause of God to be reproached in the sentences of erring and abused people; and themselves lose their health and their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, their honour and their peace, the rewards of sober counsels, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the wholesome effects of wisdome.</p>

            <p>But in this first intervall, the publick necessity and the private zeal mingling together did sometimes over-act their love of single life, even to the disparagement of marriage, and to the scandall of Religion; which was increased by the occasion of some pious persons renouncing their contract of marriage, not consummate, with unbeleevers. For when <hi>Flavia Domitilla</hi> being converted by <hi>Nereus</hi> and <hi>Achilleus</hi> the Eunuchs, refused to marry <hi>Aurelianus</hi> to whom she was contracted; if there were not some little envie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and too sharp hostility in the Eunuchs, to a marryed state, yet <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relianus</hi> thought himself an injur'd person, and caus'd St. <hi>Clemens</hi> who vail'd her, and his spouse both, to dye in the quarrell.

Celibare or single life is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> never commanded; but in some cases marriage is; and he that burns, sins often if he marries not, he that cannot contain must marry, and he that can contain is not tyed to a single life, but may marry and not sin. Marriage was ordained by God, instituted in Paradise, was the relief of a naturall necessity, and the first blessing from the Lord; he gave to Man not a friend, but a wife, that is, a friend and a wife too: (for a good woman is in her soul the same that a man is, and she is a woman only in her body; that she may have the excellency of the one, and the usefulnesse of the other, and become amiable in both:) it is the seminary of the Church, and daily brings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> forth sons and daughters unto God; it was ministred to by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and <hi>Raphael</hi> waited upon a young man that he might have a blessed marriage, and that that marriage might repair two sad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and blesse all their relatives. Our blessed Lord, though he was born of a malden, yet she was vail'd under the cover of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and she was marryed to a widower; for <hi>Joseph</hi> the supposed Father of our Lord had children by a former wife. The first Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that ever <hi>Jesus</hi> did, was to doe honour to a wedding; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was in the world before sin, and is in all ages of the world the greatest and most effective antidote against sin, in which all the world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had perished if God had not made a remedy; and although sin hath sour'd marriage, and stuck the mans head with cares, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans bed with sorrowes in the production of children, yet these are but throws of life and glory; and <hi>she shall be saved in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, if she be found in faith and righteousnesse.</hi> Marriage is a

But in those things where they ought to be common, if the spleen or the belly swels and drawes into its capacity much of that which should be spent upon those parts which have an equall right to be maintain'd, it is a dropsie or a consumption of the whole, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is evill because it is unnaturall and monstrous. <hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

            <p>These are the duties of them both, which have common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards and equall necessities, and obligations; and indeed there is scarce any matter of duty, but it concerns them both alike, and is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> only distinguished by names, and hath its variety by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and little accidents: and what in one is call'd <hi>love,</hi> in the other is called <hi>reverence;</hi> and what in the wife is <hi>obedience,</hi> the same in the man is <hi>duty.</hi> He provides, and she dispenses; he gives

               </gap> when <hi>Adam</hi> made that fond excuse for his folly in eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, he said [The woman thou gavest to be with me she gave me] He saies not [the woman which thou gavest to me] no such thing; she is none of his goods, none of his possessions, not to be reckoned among his servants; God did not give her to him so; but [the woman thou gavest <hi>to be with me]</hi> that is, to be my partner, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the companion of my joyes and sorrowes, thou gavest her for use, not for dominion. The dominion of a man over his wife is no other then as the soul rules the body; for which it takes a mighty care, and uses it with a delicate tendernesse, and cares for it in all contingencies, and watches to keep it from all evils, and studies to make for it fair provisions, and very often is led by its inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and desires, and does never contradict its appetites, but when they are evill, and then also not without some trouble and sorrow; and its government comes only to this, it furnishes the body with light and understanding, and the body furnishes the soul with hands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and feet; the soul governs, because the body cannot else be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but the <hi>government</hi> is no other then <hi>provision;</hi> as a nurse go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns a childe when she causes him to eat and to be warm, and dry and quiet; and yet even the very government it self is divided; for man and wife in the family are as the Sun and Moon in the firmament of heaven; He rules by day, and she by night, that is, in the lesser and more proper circles of her affairs; in the conduct of domestick provisions and necessary offices, and shines only by his light and rules by his authority: and as the Moon in opposition to the Sun shines brightest, that is, then, when she is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> her own circles and separate regions; so is the authority of the wife then most conspicuous when she is separate and in her proper sphere, in <hi>Gynaeceo</hi> in the nursery and offices of domestick employment; but when she is in conjunction with the Sun her Brother, that is, in that place and employment in which his care and proper offices are imployed, her light is not seen, her authority hath no proper businesse; but else there is no difference: for they were barbarous people, among whom wives were in stead of servants, said <hi>Spartianus</hi> in <hi>Caracalla;</hi> and it is a sign of impotency and weaknesse to force the camels to kneel for their load, beccuse thou hast not spirit and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> strength enough to climbe: to make the affections and evennesse of a wife bend by the flexures of a servant, is a sign the man is not wise enough to govern, when another stands by.

the same difference there is in the authority of man and woman, and no more; <hi>Si tu Caius ego Caia,</hi> was publickly proclaimed upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> threshold of the young mans house, when the bride enter'd into his hands and power; and the title of <hi>Domina</hi> in the sense of the civill Law was among the <hi>Romans</hi> given to wives.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Let him love his wife even as himself:]</hi> that's his duty, and the measure of it too; which is so plain, that if he understands how he treats himself, there needs nothing be added concerning his demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour towards her, save only that we adde the particulars, in which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> holy Scripture instances this generall commandement.</p>

            <p>In answer to which question we are to consider, 1. What is the summe totall of the pleasure of sin? 2. What fruits and relishes it leaves behinde by its naturall efficiency? 3. What are its conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents by its demerit, and the infliction of the superadded wrath of God, which it hath deserved?

            <p n="1">1. Let us consider what pleasures there are in sin; <hi>most of them are very punishments.</hi> I will not reckon nor consider concerning <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,</hi> which one in <hi>Stobaeus</hi> cals <gap reason="foreign">

The fruit of this tree are mingled and sowre, and not to be indured in the very eating. Neither will I reck on the horrid afrightments and amazements of murder, nor the uneasinesse of impatience, which doubles every evill that it feels, and makes it a sin, and makes it intolerable; nor the secret grievings, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and continuall troubles of peevishnesse, which makes a man unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving good, or delighting in beauties and fair intreaties, in the mercies of God and charities of men.</p>
            <p>It were easie to make a catalogue of sins, every one of which is a disease, a trouble in it's very constitution and its nature: such

Is it not a fearfull consideration that a man should rather choose eternally to perish, then to say his prayers heartily, and affectionately? But so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it is with very many men; they are driven to their devotions by custome, and shame, and reputation, and civill compliances; they sigh and look sowre when they are called to it, and abide there as a man under the Chirurgeons hands, smarting aud fretting all the while; or else he passes the time with <hi>incogitancy,</hi> and hates the imployment, and suffers the torments of prayers which he loves not; and all this, although for so doing it is certain he may perish: what fruit, what deliciousnesse can he fancy in being weary of his prayers? There is no pretence or colour for these things. Can any man imagine a greater evill to the body and soul of a man, then madnesse, and furious eyes, and a distracted look, palenesse with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> passion, and trembling hands and knees, and furiousnesse, and folly in the heart and head? and yet this is the pleasure of anger, and for this pleasure men choose damnation. But it is a great truth, that <hi>there are but very few sins that pretend to pleasure:</hi> although a man be weak and soon deceived, and the Devill is crafty, and sin is false and impudent, and pretences are too many, yet most kinds of sins are <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>prime troubles</hi> to the very body, without all manner of deliciousnesse, even to the sensuall, naturall, and carnall part; and a man must put on something of a <hi>Devill</hi> before he can choose such sins, and he must love mischief because it is a sin; for in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> most instances there is no other reason in the world. Nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to pleasure but <hi>the lusts of the lower belly, ambition,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;</hi> and although the catalogue of sins is numerous as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of fishes, yet these three only can be apt to consen us with a fair outside; and yet upon the survey of what fruits they bring, and what taste they have, in the <hi>manducation,</hi> besides the filthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish they leave behind, we shall see how miserably they are abused and fool'd, that expend any thing upon such purchases.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For a man cannot take pleasure <hi>in lusts of the flesh,</hi> in <hi>glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> or <hi>drunkennesse,</hi> unlesse he be helped forward with <hi>inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>

For the pleasures of intemperance, they are nothing but the reliques and images of pleasure, after that nature hath been feasted; For so long as she needs, that is, so long as temperance waits, so long pleasure also stands there. But as temperance begins to go away, having done the ministeries of Nature, every morsell; and every new goblet is still lesse delicious, and cannot be endured but as men force nature by violence to stay longer then she would: How have some men rejoyced when they have escaped a cup! and when they cannot escape, they pour it in, and receive it with as much pleasure as the old women have in the Lapland dances; they dance the round, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but there is a horror and a harshnesse in the Musick; and they call it pleasure, because men bid them do so: but there is a <hi>Devill</hi> in the company, and such as is his pleasure, such is theirs: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces in the thriving sin, and the swelling fortune of his darling drunkenesse, but his joyes are the joyes of him that knowes and

It is to be confessed, it is a wonder they should; but then we may remember that men sinne again, though their sinne did afflict them; they will be drunk again, though they were sick; they will again commit folly, though they be surprised in their shame, though they have needed an hospitall; and therefore there is something else that moves them, and not the pleasure; for they doe it <hi>without</hi> and <hi>against</hi> its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; but either they still proceed, hoping to supply by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers what they finde not in proper measures; or God permits them to proceed as an instrument of punishment; or their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and reasonings grow cheaper; or they grow in love with it, and take it upon any terms; or contract new appetites, and are pleased with the baser and the lower reward of sinne: but whatsoever can be the cause of it, it is certain, by the experience of all the world, that the fancy is higher, the desires more sharp, and the reflexion more brisk, at the door and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the entertainment, then in all the little and shorter pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of its possession: for then it is but limited by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall measures, and abated by distemper, and loathed by enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and disturbed by partners, and dishonoured by shame and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> evill accidents; so that as men coming to the river <hi>Lucius,</hi>

and the very remembrances must at all times abate its <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> pleasures, and sowre its delicacies. In the most parts of a mans life he wonders at his own folly, and prodigious madnesse, that it should be ever possible for him to be deluded by such trifles; and he sighes next morning, and knowes it over night; and is it not therefore certain that he leans upon a thorne, which he knowes will smart, and he dreads the event of to morrow? But so have I known a bold trooper fight in the confusion of a battell, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warm with heat and rage received from the swords of his enemy, wounds open like a grave; but he felt them not, and when by the streams of bloud he found himself mark'd for pain, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to consider then, what he was to feel to morrow: but when his rage had cool'd into the temper of a man, and a clammy moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture had checked the fiery emission of spirits, he wonders at his own boldnesse, and blames his fate, and needs a mighty patience to bear his great calamity. So is the bold and merry sinner, when he is warm with wine and lust, wounded and bleeding with the strokes of hell, he twists with the fatall arm that strikes him, and cares not; but yet it must abate his gayety, because he remembers that when his wounds are cold and considered, he must roar or perish, repent or do worse; that is, be miserable or undone.

Thus it happens to sinners according to the saying of the Prophet, <hi>Qui sacrificant hominem osculabuntur Vitulum, He that</hi>

            <p>After all this I doe not doubt but these considerations will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> meet with some persons that think them to be <hi>protestatio contra factum,</hi> and fine pretences against all experience; and that for all these severe sayings, sin is still so pleasant as to tempt the wisest resolution.

            <p n="1">1. The first <hi>naturall fruit</hi> of sin is <hi>ignorance.</hi> Man was first tempted by the promise of knowledge; he fell into darknesse by beleeving the Devill holding forth to him a new light. It was not likely good should come of so foul a beginning; that the woman should beleeve the Devill putting on no brighter shape then a snakes skin, she nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being afraid of sin nor afrighted to hear a beast speak, and he pretending so weakly in the temptation, that he promised only that they should <hi>know evill;</hi> for they knew good before; and all that was offered to them was <hi>the experience of evill:</hi> and it was no wonder that the Devill promised no more; for sin never could perform any thing but <hi>an experience of evill,</hi> no other knowledge can come upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that account; but the wonder was, why the woman should sin for no other reward, but for that which she ought to have fear'd infinitely; for nothing could have continued her happinesse, but <hi>not to have known evill.</hi> Now this knowledge was the introduction of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For when the <hi>understanding</hi> suffered it self to be so baffled as to study evill, <hi>the will</hi> was as foolish to fall in love with it, and they conspir'd to undoe each other. For when <hi>the will</hi> began to love it, then <hi>the understanding</hi> was set on work to commend, to advance, to conduct and to approve, to beleeve it, and to be factious in behalf of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the new purchase. I do not beleeve the understanding part of man received any naturall decrement or diminution. For if to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils their naturals remain intire, it is not likely that the lesser sin of man should suffer a more violent and effective mischief. Neither can it be understood how the reasonable soul being immortall both in it self and its essentiall faculties, can lose or be lessened in them, any more then it can die. But it received impediment, by new proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It lost and willingly forgot what God had taught, and went away from the fountain of truth, and gave trust to the father of lies, and it must without remedy grow foolish; and so a man came to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>know evill,</hi> just as a man is said to <hi>taste of death:</hi> for in proper spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as death is not to <hi>be felt,</hi> because it takes away all sense; so nether can evill <hi>be known,</hi> because whatsoever is truly <hi>cognoscible,</hi> is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>true;</hi> and therefore all the knowledge a man gets by sin is to feel evill: he knowes it <hi>not by discourse, but by sense;</hi> not by

               </gap>: the Devill himself grew more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted to abuse us, but we became more blinde by that opening of our eyes. I shall not need to discourse of the Philosophy of this mischief, and by the connexion of what causes ignorance doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low sin: but it is certain, whether a man would fain be pleased with sin, or be quiet, or fearlesse when he hath sinned, or continue in it, or perswade others to it, he must do it by false propositions, by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and such weak discourses as none can beleeve but such as are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> born fools, or such as have made themselves so, or are made so by others. Who in the world is a verier fool, a more ignorant wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched person then he that is an Atheist? A man may better beleeve there is no such man as himself, and that he is not in being, then that there is no God: for himself can cease to be, and once was not, and shall be changed from what he is, and in very many periods of his life knowes not that he is; and so it is every night with him when he sleeps: but none of these can happen to God; and if he knowes it not, he is a fool. Can any thing in this world be more foolish then to think that all this rare fabrick of heaven and earth can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> come by chance, when all the skill of art is not able to make an Oyster? To see rare effects and no cause; an excellent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and no Prince; a motion without an immovable; a circle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a centre; a time without eternity; a second without a first; a thing that begins not from it self, and therefore not to perceive there is something from whence it does begin, which must be without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; these things are so against Philosophy, and naturall reason, that he must needs be a beast in his understanding that does not assent to them. This is the Atheist: <hi>the fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.</hi> That's his character: the thing framed saies that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> framed it; the tongue never made it self to speak, and yet talks against him that did; saying, that which is made, <hi>is,</hi> and that which made it, <hi>is not.</hi> But this folly is as infinite as hell, as much without light or bound, as the <hi>Chaos</hi> or the <hi>primitive nothing.</hi> But in this, the Devill never prevailed very farre; his Schooles were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thin at these Lectures: some few people have been witty against God, that taught them to speak before they knew to spell a syllable; but either they are monsters in their manners, or mad in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, or ever finde themselves confuted by a thunder or a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> plague, by danger or death.</p>
            <p>But the Devill hath infinitely prevail'd in a thing that is almost as senselesse and ignorant as Atheisme, and that is <hi>idolatry;</hi> not only making <hi>God after mans image,</hi> but in the likenesse of a calf, of a cat, of a serpent; making men such fools as to worship a quartan ague,

And this is the state of a sinner, of every one that delights in iniquity; he cannot be pleased with it if he thinks it evill; he cannot endure it, without beleeving this proposition, that <hi>there is in drunkennesse, or lust, pleasure enough, good enough to make him amends for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pains of damnation.</hi> But then if we consider upon what <hi>nonsense principles</hi> the state of an evill life relies, we must in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be impatient, and with scorn and indignation drive away the fool; such as are: <hi>sense is to be preferred before reason, interest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore religion, a lust before heaven, moments before eternity, money above God himself;</hi> that, <hi>a mans felicity consists in that which a beast enjoyes;</hi> that, <hi>a little in present</hi> uncertain, fallible possession, <hi>is better then the certain state of infinite glories hereafter;</hi> what childe, what fool can think things more weak, and more unreasonable? And yet if men do not go upon these grounds, upon what account do they sin? sin hath no wiser reasons for it self then these: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the same argument that a flye hath to enter into a candle, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> same argument a fool hath, that enters into sin; it looks prettily, but rewards the eye, as burning basons do, with intolerable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of reflected fire. Such are the principles of a sinners Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. And <hi>no wiser are his hopes;</hi> all his hopes that he hath is, that <hi>he shall have time to repent</hi> of that which he chooses greedily; that he whom he every day provokes will save him, whether he will or no; that he can in an instant, or in a day make amends for all the evils of 40 years; or else that he shall be saved whether he does or no; that heaven is to be had for a sigh, or a short prayer, and yet hell shall not be consequent to the affections, and labours, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> services of a whole life; he goes on and cares not, he hopes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a promise, and refuses to beleeve all the threatnings of God; but beleeves he shall have a mercy for which he never had a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If this be knowledge or wisdome, then there is no such thing as folly, no such disease as madnesse.</p>
            <p>But then consider, that there are some sins whose very formality is a lye. Superstition could not be in the world, if men did beleeve God to be good and wise, free and mercifull, not a tyrant, not an unreasonable exactor: no man would dare do in private, what he fears to do in publick, if he did know that God sees him there, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and will bring that work of darknesse into light. But he is so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish as to think, that if he sees nothing, nothing sees him; for if men did perceive God to be present, and yet do wickedly, it is worse with them then I have yet spoke of; and they beleeve another lie; that to be seen by man will bring more shame, then to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned

by God; or that the shame of a few mens talk is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable then to be confounded before Christ, and his army of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and Saints, and all the world. * He that excuses a fault by telling a lie, beleeves it better to be guilty of two faults, then to be thought guilty of one; and every hypocrite thinks it not good to be holy, but to be accounted so, is a fine thing; that is, that <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is better then reality,</hi> and that there is in vertue nothing good, but the fame of it. * And the man that takes revenge, relies upon this foolish proposition; that <hi>his evill that he hath already suffer'd growes lesse if another suffers the like;</hi> that his wound cannot smart, if by my hand he dies that gave it. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I shall not need to thrust into this account the other evils of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde that are the events of ignorance, but introduc'd by sin; such as are our being moved by what we see strongly, and weakly by what we understand; that men are moved rather by a fable then by a syllogisme, by parables then by demonstrations, by examples then by precepts, by seeming things then by reall, by shadowes then by substances; that men judge of things by their first events, and measure the events by their own short lives, or shorter obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that they are credulous to beleeve what they wish, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous of what makes against them, measuring truth or falshood by measures that cannot fit them, as foolishly as if they should judge of a colour by the dimensions of a body, or feel musick with the hand; they make generall conclusions from particular instances, and take account of Gods actions by the measures of a man. Men call that justice that is on their side, and all their own causes are right, and they are so alwayes; they are so when they affirm them in their youth, and they are so when they deny them in their old age; and they are confident in all their changes; and their first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> error which they now see, does not make them modest in the proposition which they now maintain; for they do not understand that what was, may be so again: <hi>So foolish and ignorant was I</hi> (said <hi>David) and as it were a beast before thee.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48497:137"/>
every act of grace does more please the minde, then an act of sin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> does delight the sense; and every crime does greater violence to the better part of man, then mortification does to the lower; and often times a duty consists in a negative, as <hi>not to be drunk, not to swear,</hi> and it is not to be understood that a man hath naturally no power <hi>not to do;</hi> if there be a <hi>naturall disability,</hi> it is to action, not to <hi>rest</hi> or <hi>ceasing;</hi> and therefore in this case, we cannot reasonably nor justly accuse our <hi>Nature,</hi> but we have reason to blame our <hi>manners</hi> which have introduced upon us a <hi>morall disability;</hi> that is, not that <hi>the faculty is impotent</hi> and disabled, but that <hi>the whole man is;</hi> for <hi>the will</hi> in many cases desires to do good, and <hi>the understanding</hi> is convinced and consents, and <hi>the hand</hi> can obey, and <hi>the passions</hi>

To a vicious man some sins become necessary; Temperance makes him sick; severity is death to him; it destroys his chearfulnesse and activity; it is as his nature, and the desire dwels for ever with him, and his reasonings are framed for it and his fancy, and in all he is helped by example, by company, by folly, and inconsideration; and all these are a faction and a confederacy against the honour and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> service of God. And in this, <hi>Philosophy is at a stand,</hi> nothing can give an account of it but experience, and sorrowfull instances; for it is infinitely unreasonable, that when you have discoursed wisely against <hi>unchastity,</hi> and told, that we are separated from it by a circumvallation of Lawes of God and man, that it dishonours the

            <p>The first is, that <hi>men sin against their interest.</hi> They know they shall be ruin'd by it; it will undoe their estates, lose their friends, ruine their fortunes, destroy their body, impoverish the spirit, load the conscience, discompose his rest, confound his reason, amaze him in all his faculties, destroy his hopes, and mischief enough besides; and when he considers this, he declares against it; but, <hi>Cum bona verba erumpant, affectus tamen ad consuetudinem relabuntur,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> man gives good words, but the evill custome prevails; and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens as in the case of the <hi>Tyrinthians,</hi> who to free their nation from a great plague, were bidden only to abstain from laughter, while they offered their sacrifice: but they had been so us'd to a ridiculous effeminacy, and vain course of conversation, that they could not, though the honour and splendor of the Nation did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it. <hi>God of his mercy keep all Christian people from a custome in sinning;</hi> for if they be once fallen thither, nothing can recover them but a miraculous grace. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The second aggravation of it is, that <hi>custome prevails against experience.</hi> Though the man hath already smarted, though he hath been disgraced, and undone, though he lost his relation and his friends, he is turn'd out of service, and disimployed, he begs with a load of his old sins upon his shoulders, yet this will not cure an evill custome: Do not we daily see how miserable some men make themselves with drunkennesse, and folly? Have not we seen them that have been sick with intemperance, deadly sick, enduring for one drunken meeting, more pain then are in all the fasting dayes of the whole year? and yet do they not the very next day go to it again? Indeed some few are smitten into the beginning of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and they stay a fortnight, or a moneth, and it may be resist two or three invitations; but yet the custome is not gone,</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now this is such a state of slavery, that persons that are sensible ought to complain, <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Devils</hi> sin was the worst, because it came from the greatest malice: <hi>Adams</hi> was the worst, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> because it was of most universall efficacy and dissemination: <hi>Judas</hi> sin the worst of men, because against the most excellent person; and <hi>the relapses of the godly</hi> are the worst, by reason they were the most obliged persons.

Some sins are therefore most hainous, because to resist them is most easie, and to act them there is the least temptation: such as are severally, <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>swearing.</hi> There is a strange poison in the nature of sins, that of so many sorts, every one of them should be <hi>the worst.</hi> Every sin hath an evill spirit, a Devill of its own to manage, to conduct, and to imbitter it: and although all these are Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and have an appendant <hi>shame</hi> in their retinue, yet to some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sins <hi>shame</hi> is more appropriate, and a proper ingredient in their constitutions: such as are <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>lust,</hi> and <hi>vow-breach,</hi> and <hi>inconstancy.</hi> God sometimes cures the pride of a mans spirit by suffering his evill manners, and filthy inclination to be determin'd upon lust; <hi>lust</hi> makes a man afraid of publick eyes, and common

            <p>We see the event of this by too sad an experience.

And there are but few men that will endure it, but rather choose to involve it in excuses and deniall, in the clouds of lying, and the white linnen of hypocrisie: and yet when they make a vail for their shame, such is the fate of sin, the shame growes the bigger and the thicker; we lye to men, and we excuse it to God; either some parts of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or many parts of impudence, darknesse, or forgetfulnesse, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, or running further in, these are the covers of our shame, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> like menstruous rags upon a skin of leprosie: But so sometimes we see a decayed beauty besmear'd with a lying <hi>fucus,</hi> and the chinks fill'd with <hi>ceruse;</hi> besides that it makes no reall beauty, it spoils the face, and betrayes evill manners; it does not hide old age, or the change of years, but it discovers pride or lust; it was not shame to be old, or wearied and worn out with age, but it is a shame to dissemble nature by a wanton vizor. So sin retires from blushing into shame; if it be discover'd, it is not to be endured, and if we go to hide it, we make it worse. But then if we remember <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> how ambitious we are for <hi>fame</hi> and <hi>reputation,</hi> for honour and a fair opinion, for a good name all our dayes, and when our dayes are done, and that no ingenuous man can enjoy any thing he hath, if he lives in disgrace, and that nothing so breaks a mans spirit as dishonour, and the meanest person alive does not think himself fit
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48497:141"/>
to be despised; we are to consider into what an evill condition sin puts us, for which we are not only disgraced and disparaged here, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> marked with disgracefull punishments, despised by good men, our follies derided, our company avoided, and hooted at by boyes, talk'd of in fairs and markets, pointed at, and described by appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives of scorn, and <hi>everybody can chide us,</hi> and we dye unpitied, and lye in our graves eaten up by wormes, and a foul dishonour; but after all this, at the day of Judgement we shall be called from our charnell houses, where our disgrace could not sleep, and shall in the face of God, in the presence of Angels and Devils, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all good men and all the evill, see, and feel the shame of all our sins written upon our foreheads: Here in this state of misery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and folly we make nothing of it; and though we dread to be discovered to men, yet to God we confesse our sins without a trouble or a blush; but tell an even story, because we finde some formes of confession prescrib'd in our prayer books; and that it may appear how indifferent and unconcerned we seem to be, we read and say all, and confesse the sins we never did, with as much sorrow and regret as those that we have acted a thousand times. But in that strange day of recompences, we shall finde the Devill to upbraid the criminall, Christ to disown them, the Angels to drive them from the seat of mercy, and shame to be their smart, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the consigning them to damnation; they shall then finde, that they cannot dwell where vertue is rewarded, and where honour and glory hath a throne; there is no vail but what is rent, no excuse to any but to them, that are declared as innocent; no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances concerning the wicked to be considered, but them that ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate; then the disgrace is not confin'd to the talk of a village, or a province, but is scattered to all the world, not only in one age shall the shame abide, but the men of all generations shall see, and wonder at the vastnesse of that evill that is spread upon the souls <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of sinners for ever and ever; <gap reason="foreign">

But then let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how many and how great crimes we have done; and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think that God hath exacted so fearfull pains, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty punishments for one such sin which we, it may be, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted frequently. Our sin deserves as bad as theirs; and God is <hi>impartial,</hi> and we have no priviledge, no promise of exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no reason to hope it; what then do we think shall become of this affair? where must we suffer this vengeance? For that it is due, that it is just we suffer it, these sad examples are a perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> We have done that for which God thought <hi>flay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive</hi> not to be too big a punishment: that for which God hath smitten Kings with formidable plagues; that for which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments have been changed, and nations enslaved, and Churches destroyed, and the Candlestick removed, and famines and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences have been sent upon a whole Kingdome; and what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us? why do we vainly hope it shall not be so with us? If it was just for these men to suffer what they did, then we are at least to expect so much; and then let us consider into what a fearfull condition sin hath put us, upon whom a sentence is read, that we shall be plagued like <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> or <hi>Corah,</hi> or <hi>Dathan,</hi> or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other King who, were, for ought we know, infinitely more innocent and more excellent persons then any of us. What will become of us? For God is as just to us as to them; and Christ dyed for them as well as for us; and they have repented more then we have done; and what mercy can we expect that they might not hope for, upon at least as good ground as we? Gods wayes are secret, and his mercies and justice dwell in a great abysse; but we are to measure our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations by revelation and experience. But then what would become of us, if God should be as angry at our sin as at <hi>Zedekiahs,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or King <hi>Davids?</hi> where have we in our body room enough for so many stripes, as our sin ought justly to be punished withall? or what security or probability have we that he will not so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us?</p>
            <p>For I did not represent this sad story, as a matter of possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity only, that we may fear such fearfull strokes as we see God lay upon sinners; but we ought to look upon it as a thing that will come some way or other, and for ought we know we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not escape it. So much, and more is due for the sin, and though Christ hath redeemed our souls, and if we repent we shall not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> die eternally, yet he hath no where promised we shall not be smitten. It was an odde saying of the Devill to a sinner whom he would fain have had to despair; <hi>Me è Coelo ad Barathrum demisit peccatum, &amp; vos ullum in terra locum tutum existimabitis?</hi> Sin

            <p n="1">1. But this hath two appendages which are very considerable; and the first is, that there are some mischiefs which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and appointed scourges of certain sins, and a man need not aske; <hi>Cujus vulturis hoc erit cadaver?</hi> what vultur, what death, what affliction shall destroy this sinner? The sin hath a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of its own which usually attends it, as giddinesse does a drunkard. He that commits sacriledge, is marked for a vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnesse and changeable fortune; <hi>Make them, O my God, like unto</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 83.</note> 
               <hi>a wheel,</hi> of an unconstant state: and <hi>we and our fathers have seen it,</hi> in the change of so many families, which have been undone by being made rich: they took the lands from the Church, and the curse went along with it, and the misery and the affliction lasted longer then the sin. Telling lies frequently hath for its punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be <hi>given over to believe a lye,</hi> and at last, that no body shall beleeve it but himself; and then the mischief is full, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> becomes a dishonoured and a baffled person. The consequent of <hi>lust</hi> is properly <hi>shame;</hi> and witchcraft is still punished with basenesse, and beggery; and oppression of widowes hath a sting, for the tears of the oppressed are to the <hi>oppressour,</hi> like the waters of jealousie, making the belly to swell, and the thigh to rot; the <hi>oppressor</hi> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48497:145"/>
dies in a tolerable condition: but is remark'd towards his end with some horrible affliction. The sting of oppression is darted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as a man goes to his grave. In these and the like, God keeps a rule of striking, <hi>In quo quis peccat, in eo punitur.</hi> The Divine Judgement did point at the sin, lest that be concealed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, and protected by affection, and increased by passion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the man by its abode. For some sins are so agreeable to the spirit of a fool and an abused person, because he hath fram'd his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to them, and they comply with his unworthy interest, that when God out of an angry kindnesse, smites the man, and punishes the sin, the man does fearfully defend his beloved sin, as the serpent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> does his head which he would most tenderly preserve. But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God that knowes all our tricks and devices, our stratagems to be undone, hath therefore apportioned out his punishments, by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, by proportions, and entaile: so that when every sin enters into its proper portion, we may discern why God is angry, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to appease him speedily.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second appendage to this consideration is this, that there are some states of sin which expose a man to all mischief, as it can happen by taking off from him all his guards, and defences; by driving the good Spirit from him, by stripping him of the guards of Angels. But this is the effect of an habituall sin, a course of an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> evill life, and it is called in Scripture, <hi>a grieving the good Spirit of God.</hi> But the guard of Angels is in Scripture only promised to them that live godly; <hi>The Angels of the Lord pitch their</hi>

            <p>It is Gods appellative to be a giver of excellent rewards to just and innocent persons: but to assign to evill men fury, wrath, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sorrow for their portion. If I should lanch further into this Dead sea, I should finde nothing but horrid shriekings, and the skuls of dead men utterly undone. Fearfull it is to consider, that sin does not only drive us into calamity, but it makes us also impatient, and imbitters our spirit in the sufferance: * It cryes loud for vengeance, and so torments men before the time, even with such fearfull out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, and horrid alarms, that their hell begins before the fire is kindled. * It hinders our prayers, and consequently makes us hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and helplesse. * It perpetually affrights the conscience, unlesse by its frequent stripes it brings a callousnesse and an insensible dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> upon it. * It makes us to lose all that which Christ purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for us, all the blessings of his providence, the comforts of his spirit, the aids of his grace, the light of his countenance, the hopes of his glory; it makes us enemies to God, and to be hated by him more then he hates a dog; and with a dog shall be his portion

to eternall ages; with this only difference, that they shall both be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> equally excluded from heaven; but the dog shall not, and the sinner shall descend into hell; and which is the confirmation of all evill; for a transient sin God shall inflict an eternall Death. Well might it be said in the words of God by the Prophet, <hi>ponam Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonem in possessionem Erinacei, Babylon</hi> shall be the possession of an Hedgehog: that's a sinners dwelling; incompassed round with thornes and sharp prickles, afflictions and uneasinesse all over.

For by this means he was hugely secured against malice, and ambition; for his anger went off with the short notice and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the injury; and he saw himself unfit for the businesses of other men, or to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in his head, &amp; undertake to conduct the intrigues of affairs of a multitude, who was apt to forget the little accounts of his own seldom reading. He also remembred this, that his pleasures in reading books were more frequent, while he remembred but little of yesterdays study, and tomorrow the book is newes, and with its novelties gives him fresh entertainment, while the retaining brain layes the book aside, and is full already. Every book is new to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> an ill memory, and one long book is a Library, and its parts return fresh as the morning, which becomes a new day, though by the revolution of the same sun. Besides these, it brought him to tell truth for fear of shame, and in meer necessity made his speech little and his discourses short; because the web drawn from his brain was
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48497:147"/>
soon spun out, and his fountain grew quickly dry, and left running <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> through forgetfulnesse. * He that is not eloquent and faire spoken, hath some of these comforts to plead in excuse of his ill fortune, or defective nature. For if he can but hold his peace, he shall be sure not to be troublesome to his company, not mark'd for lying, or become tedious with multiplicity of idle talk. He shall be presumed wise, and oftentimes is so; he shall not feel the wounds of contention, nor be put to excuse an ill taken saying, nor sigh for the folly of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable word; If his fault be that he hath not spoken, that can at any time be mended, but if he sinn'd in speaking, it cannot be unspo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken again. Thus he escapes the dishonor of not being believed, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the trouble of being suspected; he shall never fear the Sentence of Judges, nor the Decrees of Courts, high reproaches, or the angry words of the proud, the contradiction of the disputing man, or the thirst of talkers. By these and many other advantages, he that holds his peace, and he that cannot speak, may please themselves; and he may at least have the rewards and effects of solitarinesse, if he misses some of the pleasures of society. But by the use of the tongue, God hath distinguished us from beasts, and by the well or ill using it we are distinguished from one another; and therefore though silence be innocent as death, harmlesse as a roses breath to a distant passenger, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> yet it is rather the state of death then life; and therefore when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> sacrificed to <hi>Harpocrates</hi> their god of Silence, in the midst of their rites they cryed out <gap reason="foreign">

Much speaking is sometimes necessary, sometimes usefull, sometimes pleasant; and when it is none of all this, though it be tedious and imprudent, yet it is not alwayes criminall. Such was the humour of the Gentleman <hi>Martial</hi> speaks of, he was a good man, and full of sweetnesse and justice and noblenesse, but he would read his nonsense verses to all companies at the publick games and in private feasts, in the baths, and on the beds, in publick and in private, to sleeping and waking people.</p>

            <p>Every one was afraid of him, and though he was good, yet he was not to be endured: The evill of this is very considerable in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of prudence, and the effects and plaisance of conversation: and the Ancients described its evill well by a proverbiall expression; for when a sudden silence arose, they said that <hi>Mercury was entred,</hi> meaning, that he being their <hi>loquax numen,</hi> their <hi>prating god,</hi> yet that quitted him not, but all men stood upon their guard, and called for aid and rescue, when they were seised upon so tedious an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And indeed there are some persons so full of nothings, that like the strait sea of <hi>Pontus</hi> they perpetually empty themselves by their mouth, making every company or single person they fasten on, to be their <hi>Propontis;</hi> such a one as was <hi>Anaximenes,</hi>

               </gap>, said one: <hi>a young man is a talker</hi> for want of wit, and an old man for want of memory; for while he remembers the things of his youth, and not how often he hath told them in his old age, he grows in love with the trifles of his youthfull dayes, and thinks the company must doe so too; but he canonizes his folly, and by striving to bring reputation to his first dayes, he loses the honor of his last. But this thing is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to further issues; for though no man can say, that much speaking is a sin, yet the Scripture sayes, <hi>In multiloquio peccatum non deerit,</hi> Sin goes along with it, and is an ingredient in the whole composition. For it is impossible but a long and frequent discourse must be served with many passions, and they are not alwayes inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; for he that loves to talke much, must <hi>rem corradere,</hi> scrape materials together to furnish out the scenes and long orations; and some talke themselves into anger, and some furnish out their dialogues with the lives of others; either they detract, or censure; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or they flatter themselves, and tell their owne stories with friendly circumstances, and pride creeps up the sides of the discourse; and the man entertains his friend with his owne Panegyrick; or the discourse lookes one way and rowes another, and more mindes the designe then its own truth; and most commonly will be so ordered that it shall please the company, (and <hi>that,</hi> truth or honest plainnesse seldome does) or there is a byasse in it, which the more of weight and transportation it hath, the lesse it hath of ingenuity. <hi>Non credo Auguribus qui aureis rebus divinant,</hi> like Sooth-sayers, men speak fine words to serve ends, and then they are not beleeved, or at last are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> found lyars, and such discourses are built up to serve the ministeries or pleasures of the company, but nothing else. <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>flattery, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> and <hi>spite, self-love</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> these usually wait upon much speaking; and the reward of it is, that the persons grow contemptible and troublesome, they engage in quarrels, and are troubled to answer exceptions, some will mistake them, and some will not beleeve them, and it will be impossible that the minde should be <hi>perpetually present</hi> to a <hi>perpetuall talker,</hi> but they will forget truth and themselves, and their own relations. And upon this account it is, that the Doctors of the Primitive Church doe literally expound those minatory words of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our blessed Saviour; <hi>Verily I say unto you, of every idle word that</hi>

time; for however we are pleased to throw away our time, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are weary of many parts of it, yet are impatiently troubled when all is gone, yet we are as sure to account for every considerable portion of our time, as for every summe of money we receive; and in this it was, that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> gave caution, <hi>Nemo parvi aestimet tempus quod in verbis consumitur otiosis,</hi> Let no man think <note place="margin">Serm. de triplici custodia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> it a light matter that he spend his pretious time in idle words; let no man be so weary of what flies away too fast, and cannot be recalled, as to use arts and devices to passe the time away in vanity, which might be rarely spent in the interests of eternity. Time is given us to repent in, to appease the divine anger, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for and hasten to the society of Angels, to stir up our slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wills, and enkindle our cold devotions, to weep for our daily iniquities, and to sigh after, and work for the restitution of our lost inheritance; and the reward is very inconsiderable that exchanges all this for the pleasure of a voluble tongue: and indeed this is an evill that cannot be avoyded by any excuse that can be made for words that are in any sense idle, though in all senses of their owne nature and proper relations they be innocent. They are a throwing away something of that which is to be expended for eternity, and put on degrees of folly, according as they are tedious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and expensive of time to no good purposes. * I shall not after all this need to reckon more of the evill consequent to the vain and great talker; but if these already reckoned were not a heap big enough, I could easily adde this great evill; that the talking man makes himselfe artificially deafe, being like a man in the steeple when the bells ring, you talke to a deafe man, though you speake wisely;</p>

            <p>These and many more evils, and the perpetuall unavoydable necessity of sinning by much talking, hath given great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to silence, and made it to be esteemed an act of Discipline and great Religion.

But this morosity and sullennesse is so far
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48497:151"/>
from being imitable and laudable, that if there were no direct <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> prevarication of any commands expressed or intimated in Scripture, yet it must certainly either draw with it, or be it self an infinite omission of duty, especially in the externall glorifications of God, in the institution or advantages of others, in thanksgiving and publick offices, and in all the effects and emanations of spirituall mercy. This was to make amends for committing many sins by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many duties, and in stead of digging out the offending eye, to pluck out both, that they might neither see the scandall nor the duty; for fear of seeing what they should not, to shut their eyes against all light. It was more prudent which was reported of St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> who made Silence an act of Discipline, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and kept it a whole Lent in his religious retirements, <hi>cujus facti mei si causam quaeris</hi> (said he in his account he gives of it) <hi>idcircò à sermone prorsus abstinui, ut sermonibus meis moderari discam;</hi> I then abstained wholly, that all the yeer after I might be more temperate in my talke. This was in him an act of caution, but how apt it was to minister to his purpose of a moderated speech for the future, is not certaine; nor the philosophy of it, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall efficacy easie to be apprehended. It was also practised by way of penance, with indignation against the follies of the Tongue, and the itch of prating, so to chastise that petulant member, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> if there were a great pleasure in prating, which when it grew inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, it was to be restrained and punished like other lusts. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it was reported of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit, Scholar of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> that having once asked whether Christ or the old Prophets were first, he grew so ashamed of his foolish Question, that he spake not a word for 3 years following: And <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> as St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> reports of him, being deceived by the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> spoke some fond things, and repenting of it, held his tongue till his dying day, <hi>ut peccatum quod loquendo contraxerat tacendo penitùs emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daret.</hi>

drunkennesse, yet even in Religion there are seasons to speak; and it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was sometimes <hi>pain and grief</hi> to <hi>David</hi> to be silent; But yet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though tedious and dead silence hath not a just measure of praise and wisdome; yet the worst silence of a religious person is more tolerable and innocent, then the usuall pratings of the looser and foolish men. <hi>Pone Domine custodiam ori meo &amp; ostium circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiae labiis meis,</hi> said <hi>David, Put a guard O Lord unto my mouth, and a dore unto my lips;</hi> upon which St. <hi>Gregory</hi> said well, <hi>Non parietem, sed ostium petit, quod viz. aperitur &amp; clauditur; he did not ask for a wall, but for a dore; a dore that might open and shut:</hi> and it were well it were so indeed. <hi>Labia tua sicut vitta coccinea,</hi> so Christ commends his Spouse in the <hi>Canticles; Thy</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>lips are like a scarlet hair-lace,</hi> that is tyed up with modesty from folly and dissolution. For however that few people offend in silence and keeping the dore shut too much, yet in opening it too hastily, and speaking too much and too foolishly, no man is without a load of guiltynesse, and some mouths like the gates of death</p>
            <q>Noctes atque dies patent—</q>
            <p>are open night and day, and he who is so cannot be innocent: It is said of <hi>Cicero,</hi> he never spake a word which himself would fain have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> recalled, he spake nothing that repented him. St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his 7. Ep. to <hi>Marcellinus</hi> sayes, it was the saying of a fool and a sot, not of a wise man, and yet I have read the same thing to have been spoken by the famous <hi>Abbat Pambo</hi> in the Primitive Church; and if it could be well said of this man who was sparing and severe in talke, it is certain it could not be said of the other, who was a talking bragging person. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

            <p>THe consideration hitherto hath been of the immoderation and generall excesse in speaking without descending to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cases: but because it is a principle and parent of much evill, it is with great caution to be cured, and the evill consequents will quickly disband. But when we draw neer to give counsell, we shall finde that upon a talking person scarce any medicine will stick.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Plutarch</hi> advises that <hi>such men should give themselves to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> that making an issue in the arme, it should drain the flouds of the head; supposing that if the humour were any way vented, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the tongue might be brought to reason. But the experience of the world hath confuted this; and when <hi>Ligurinus</hi> had writ a Poem, he talked of it to all companies he came in; But however, it can be no hurt to try, for some have been cured of bleeding at the nose, by opening a vein in the arm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some advise, that such persons should keep company with their betters, with grave, and wise, and great persons, before whom men doe not usually bring forth all, but the better parts of their discourse, and this is apt to give assistance by the help of <hi>modesty;</hi> and might doe well if men were not apt to learn to talk <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> more in the society of the aged, and out of a desire to seem <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>knowing,</hi> be apt to speak before their opportunity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Consideration of the dangers and consequent evills hath some efficacy in nature to restrain our looser talkings, by the help of fear and prudent apprehensions. <hi>Aelian</hi> tels of the geese flying over the mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that for fear of Eagles nature hath taught them to carry stones in their mouths, till they be past their danger; care of our selves, desire of reputation, appetites of being believed, love of societies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and faire complyances, fear of quarrels and misinterpretation, of lawsuits and affronts, of scorne and contempt, of infinite sins, and consequently the intolerable wrath of God, these are the great endearments of prudent and temperate speech.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some advise that such persons should change their speech
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48497:153"/>
into businesse and action: and it were well if they chang'd it into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> any good thing, for then the evill were cured; but <hi>action</hi> and <hi>businesse</hi> is not the cure alone, unlesse we adde <hi>solitarinesse;</hi> for the experience of this last age hath made us to feel, that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of working people have nurs'd up a strange Religion; the first, second, and third part of which is <hi>talking</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> save onely that <hi>mischief,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>fighting</hi> came in the retinue. But he that works and works alone, he hath imployment, and no opportunity. But this is but a cure of the symptome and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary effect; but the disease may remain yet. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some advise that the businesse and imployment of the Tongue be changed into Religion, and if there be a <hi>pruritus</hi> or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> itch of talking, let it be in matters of Religion, in prayers and pious discourses, in glorifications of God, and the wise sayings of Scripture and Holy men; this indeed will secure the material part, and make that the discourses in their nature shall be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But I fear this cure will either be improper, or unsuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For in prayers, multitude of words is sometime foolish, very often dangerous, and of all things in the world we must be carefull we bring not to God <hi>the sacrifice of fooles;</hi> and the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king much of the things of Scripture hath ministred often to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and divisions. But therefore whoever will use this remedy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> must never dwell long upon any one instance, but by variety of holy duties entertaine himselfe; for he may easily exceed his rule in any thing, but in speaking honorably of God, and in that let him enlarge himselfe as he can; he shall never come to equall, much lesse to exceed that which is infinite.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But some men will never be cured without a <hi>Canker</hi> or a <hi>Squinsie;</hi> and such persons are taught by all men what to doe, for if they would avoyd all company, as willingly as company avoyds them, they might quickly have a silence great as midnight, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and prudent as the <hi>Spartan</hi> brevity. But Gods grace is sufficient to all that will make use of it; and there is no way for the cure of this evill, but the direct obeying of a counsel, and submitting to the precept, and fearing the divine threatning; alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, that <hi>of every word a man speaks, he shall give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at the day of Judgement:</hi> I pray God shew us all a mercy in that day, and forgive us the sins of the Tongue. <hi>Amen.</hi>

1. Concerning <hi>Stultiloquy,</hi> it is to be observed that the Masters of spirituall life meane nor, the <hi>talke</hi> and <hi>uselesse babble</hi> of weak <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and ignorant persons; because in their proportion they may serve their little mistaken ends of <hi>civility</hi> and <hi>humanity,</hi> as seemingly to them, as the strictest and most observed words of the wiser; if it be their best, their folly may be pityed, but not <hi>reproved,</hi> and to them there is no caution to be added, but that it were well if they would put the bridle into the hands of another, who may give them check when themselves cannot; and no wisdome can be required or usefull to them, but to suspect themselves and choose to be conducted by another. For so the little birds and laborious bees, who having no art and power of contrivance, no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> distinction of time, or foresight of new necessities, yet being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the hand, and counsel'd by the wisdome of the <hi>supreme power, their Lord,</hi> and <hi>ours,</hi> doe things with greater nicenesse and exactnesse of art, and regularity of time, and certainty of effect, then the wise Counsellour, who standing at the back of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces chaire, guesses imperfectly, and counsels timorously, and thinks by interest, and determines <hi>extrinsecall</hi> events by inward and unconcerning principles; because these have understanding, but it is lesse then the infinity of accidents and contingences without; but the other having none, are wholly guided by him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that knows and determines all things: So it is in the imperfect designes and actions and discourses of weaker people; if they can be rul'd by an understanding without, when they have none within, they shall receive this advantage, that their owne passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall not transport their mindes, and the divisions and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their owne sense and notices shall not make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and indeterminate; and the measures they shall walke by, shall be disinterest and even, and dispassionate, and full of observation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>But that which is here meant by <hi>Stultiloquy,</hi> or foolish spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, is the <hi>Lubricum verbi,</hi> as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> calls it, <hi>the slipping with the tongue,</hi> which prating people often suffer, whose discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses betray the vanity of their spirit, and discover <hi>the hidden man of the heart.</hi> For no prudence is a sufficient guard, or can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes stand <hi>in excubiis</hi> still watching, when a man is in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall flouds of talke; for prudence attends after the manner of an Angels ministery; it is dispatched on messages from God, and drives away enemies, and places guards, and calls upon the man to awake, and bids him send out spies and observers, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then goes about his own ministeries above: but an Angell does not sit by a man, as a nurse by the babies cradle, watching every motion and the lighting of a flie upon the childes lip: and so is prudence; it gives us rules and proportions cut our measures, and prescribes us cautions, and by generall influences orders our
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48497:154"/>
particulars; but hee that is given to talke cannot be secured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by all this; the emissions of his tongue are beyond the generall figures and lines of rule; and he can no more be wise in every period of a long and running talke, then a Lutenist can delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and make every motion of his hand by the division of his notes, to be chosen and distinctly voluntary. And hence it comes that at every corner of the mouth a folly peeps out, or a mischiefe creeps in. A little pride and a great deale of vanity will soon escape, while the man mindes the sequel of his talke, and not that uglinesse of humour which the severe man that stood by, did observe, and was ashamed of. Doe not many men talke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> into anger, skrewing up themselves with dialogues and fancy, till they forget the company and themselves? and some men hate to be contradicted, or interrupted, or to be discovered in their folly; and some men being a little conscious, and not striving to amend it by silence, they make it worse by discourse; a long story of themselves, a tedious praise of another collaterally to do themselves advantage, a declamation against a sin to undoe the person, or oppresse the reputation of their neighbour, unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble repetition of that which neither profits nor delights, trifling contentions about a goats beard, or the blood of an oyster, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and animosity, spite and rage, scorn and reproach begun upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Questions, which concern neither of the litigants, fierce disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, strivings for what is past, and for what shall never be, these are the events of the loose and unwary tongue; which are like flies and gnats upon the margent of a poole, they doe not sting like an Aspic, or bite deep as a Bear, yet they can vex a man into a feaver and impatience, and make him uncapable of rest and counsel.</p>

               <hi>the Church allowes them not, though they be otherwise honest and pleasant; for how can we use those things we finde not in holy Scriptures?</hi> St. <hi>Basil</hi> gives reason for this severity; <hi>jocus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit animam remissam &amp; erga praecepta Dei negligentem;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that cannot be denyed; those persons whose soules are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed and ungathered by reason of a wanton humour of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate jesting, are apt to be trifling in their Religion. St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> is of the same opinion, and adds a commandement of a full <note place="margin">In ep. ad Ephes.</note> authority, if at least the record was right; for he quotes a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of our <hi>blessed Saviour</hi> out of the Gospel of the <hi>Nazarens, Nunquam laeti sitis nisi cum fratrem vestrum in charitate videritis, Never be merry but when you see your brother in charity:</hi> and when you are merry, St. <hi>James</hi> hath appointed a proper expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it; and a fair entertainment to the passion; <hi>If any man be merry, let him sing Psalmes.</hi> But St. <hi>Bernard</hi> who is also strict in this particular, yet he addes the temper.

            </p>
            <p>But concerning this case of conscience, we are to remember, these holy persons found jesting to be a trade; such were the <note place="margin">

and this trade besides its own unworthinesse, was mingled with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> infinite impieties; and in the institution, and in all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of its practise, was not onely against all prudent severity, but against modesty and chastity, and was a licence in disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vertue; and the most excellent things and persons were by it undervalued; that in this throng of evill circumstances fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a humour placed, which without infinite warinesse could never pretend to innocence, it is no wonder they forbad all; and so also did St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon the same account.

And let it be considered, how miserable every sinner is, if he does not deeply and truely repent; and when the man is wet with teares and covered with sorrow, crying out mightily against his sins, how ugly will it look when this is remembred the next day that he playes the foole, and raises his laughter louder then his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and yesterdayes groans, for no interest but that he may eat? A <hi>Penitent</hi> and a <hi>Jester</hi> is like a <hi>Grecian</hi> piece of money, on which were stamped a <hi>Helena</hi> on one side and a <hi>Hecuba</hi> on the other, a Rose and a deadly Aconite, a <hi>Paris</hi> and an <hi>Aesop,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nothing was more contrary; and upon this account this folly was reproved by St. <hi>Hierom, Verum &amp; haec à sanctis viris peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùs</hi>

            <p n="1">1. If <hi>jesting</hi> be <hi>unseasonable,</hi> it is also <hi>intolerable;</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If the matter be not of an indifferent nature, it becomes sinfull by giving countenance to a vice, or making vertue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ridiculous.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If it be not watcht that it complies with all that heare, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> becomes offensive and injurious.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If it be not intended to fair and lawfull purposes, it is sowre in the using.</p>

8. If it mingles with any sin, it puts on the nature of that new unworthinesse, beside the proper uglynesse of the thing it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> selfe; and after all these, when can it be lawfull or apt for Christian entertainment?</p>
            <p>The Ecclesiasticall History reports that many jests passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween St. <hi>Anthony</hi> the Father of the <hi>Hermits,</hi> and his Scholar St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and St. <hi>Hilarion</hi> is reported to have been very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and of a facete, sweet, and more lively conversation; and indeed <hi>plaisance,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and a <hi>lively spirit,</hi> and a <hi>pleasant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi> and the <hi>innocent caresses</hi> of a charitable humanity, is not forbidden; <hi>plenum tamen suavitatis &amp; gratiae sermonem non esse indecorum,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> affirmed; and here in my text our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is commanded to be such, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that it may mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster grace,</hi> that is, <hi>favour, complacence, cheerfulnesse;</hi> and be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> and <hi>pleasant to the hearer:</hi> and so must be our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; it must be as far from sullennesse, as it ought to be from lightnesse; and a cheerfull spirit is the best convoy for Religion; and though sadnesse does in some cases <hi>become a Christian,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Index</hi> of a pious minde, of compassion, and a wise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per resentment of things, yet it serves but one end, being useful in the onely instance of repentance; and hath done its greatest works, not when it weeps and sighs, but when it hates and grows <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> carefull against sin. But <hi>cheerfulnesse</hi> and a <hi>festivall spirit</hi> fills the soule full of harmony, it composes musick for Churches and hearts, it makes and publishes glorifications of God, it produces thankfulnesse and serves the ends of charity, and when the oyle of gladnesse runs over, it makes bright and tall emissions of light and holy fires, reaching up to a cloud, and making joy round about: And therefore since it is so innocent, and may be so pious and full of holy advantage, whatsoever can innocently minister to this holy joy does set forward the work of Religion and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And indeed <hi>charity</hi> it selfe, which is the verticall top of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Religion, <hi>is nothing else but an union of joyes, concentred in the heart, and reflected from all the angles of our life and entercourse.</hi> It is a rejoycing in God, a gladnesse in our neighbours good, a pleasure in doing good, a rejoycing with him; and without love we cannot have any joy at all. It is this that makes children to be a pleasure, and friendship to be so noble and divine a thing; and upon this account it is certaine that all that which can inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently make a man cheerfull, does also make him charitable; for <hi>grief,</hi> and <hi>age,</hi> and <hi>sicknesse,</hi> and <hi>wearinesse,</hi> these are peevish and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> troublesome; but <hi>mirth</hi> and cheerfulnesse is <hi>content,</hi> and <hi>civil,</hi> and <hi>compliant,</hi> and <hi>communicative,</hi> and loves to doe good, and swels up to felicity onely upon the wings of charity. In this account here is pleasure enough for a Christian in present, and if a facete discourse and an amicable friendly mirth can refresh the spirit, and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48497:156"/>
take it off from the vile temptations of peevish, despairing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> melancholy, it must needs be innocent and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. And we may as well be refreshed by a clean and a brisk discourse, as by the aire of <hi>Campanian</hi> wines; and our faces and our heads may as well be anointed and look pleasant with wit and friendly entercourse, as with the fat of the Balsam tree; and such a conversation no wise man ever did, or ought to reprove. But when the jest hath teeth and nails, biting or scratching our Brother *, when it is loose and wanton *, when it is unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable *, and much, or many *, when it serves ill purposes *, or spends better time *, then it is <hi>the drunkennesse of the soul,</hi> and makes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the spirit fly away, seeking for a Temple where the mirth and the musick is solemne and religious.</p>
            <p>But above all the abuses which ever dishonoured the tongues of men, nothing more deserves the whip of an exterminating Angel, or the stings of scorpions, then <hi>profane jesting:</hi> which is a bringing of the Spirit of God to partake of the follies of a man; as if it were not enough for a man to be a foole, but the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God must be brought into those horrible scenes: He that makes a jest of the words of Scripture, or of holy things, playes with thunder, and kisses the mouth of a Canon, just as it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> belches fire and death; he stakes heaven at spurnpoint, and trips crosse and pile whether ever he shall see the face of God or no; he laughs at damnation, while he had rather lose God then lose his jest; nay (which is the horror of all) he makes a jest of God himselfe, and the Spirit of the Father and the Son to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ridiculous. Some men use to read Scripture on their knees, and many with their heads uncovered, and all good men with fear and trembling, with reverence and grave attention. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for therein you hope to have life eternall;</hi> and, <hi>All Scripture is written by inspiration of God, and is fit for instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>for reproofe, for exhortation, for doctrine,</hi> not <hi>for jesting;</hi> but he that makes that use of it, had better part with his eyes in jest, and give his heart to make a tennisball; and that I may speak the worst thing in the world of it, it is as like the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall part of the sin against the holy Ghost, as jeering of a man is to abusing him; and no man can use it but he that wants wit and manners as well as he wants Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third instance of the <hi>vain trifling conversation,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate talking is, <hi>revealing secrets;</hi> which is a dismantling and renting off the robe from the privacies of humane entercourse; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and it is worse then denying to restore that which was intrusted to our charge; for this not onely injures his neighbors right, but throws it away, and exposes it to his enemy; it is a denying to give a man his own arms, and delivering them to another, by whom he shall suffer mischief. He that intrusts a secret to his friend,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48497:157"/>
goes thither as to sanctuary, and to violate the rites of that is <hi>sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and <hi>profanation of friendship,</hi> which is <hi>the sister of Religion,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and <hi>the mother of secular blessing;</hi> a thing so sacred, that it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a Kingdome into a Church, and makes Interest to be Piety, and Justice to become Religion. But this mischief growes according to the subject matter and its effect; and the tongue of a babbler may crush a mans bones, or break his fortune upon her owne wheel; and whatever the effect be, yet of it self it is the betraying of a trust, and by <hi>reproach,</hi> oftentimes passes on to intolerable calamities, like a criminal to his scaffold through the execrable gates of Cities; And though it is infinitely worse when the secret is laid open out of spite or treachery, yet it is more foolish when it is discovered for no other end but to serve the itch of talking, or to seem to know, or to be accounted worthy of a trust; for so some men open their cabinets to shew onely that a treasure is laid up, and that themselves were valued by their friend, when they were thought capable of a secret; <hi>but they shall be so no more;</hi> for he that by that means goes in pursuit of reputation, loses the substance by snatching at the shadow, and by desiring to be thought worthy of a secret, proves himselfe unworthy of friendship or society. <hi>D' Avila</hi> tels of a <hi>French</hi> Marquesse, young and fond, to whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had conveyed notice of the intended massacre, which when he had whispered into the Kings ear, where there was no danger of publication, but onely would seem a person worthy of such a trust, he was instantly murder'd, lest a vanity like that might unlock so horrid a mysterie.</p>
            <p>I have nothing more to adde concerning this, but that if this vanity happens in the matters of Religion, it puts on some new circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of deformity: And if he that ministers to the souls of men, and is appointed to <hi>restore him that is overtaken in a fault,</hi> shall pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the secrets of a conscience, he prevaricates the bands of Nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and Religion, in stead of a Father he turns an Accuser, a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he weakens the hearts of the penitent, and drives the repenting man from his remedy by making it to be intolerable; and so Religion becomes a scandall, and his duty is made his disgrace, and Christs yoke does bow his head unto the ground, and the secrets of the Spirit passe into the shames of the world, and all the sweetnesses by which the severity of the duty are alleviated and made easie, are imbittered and become venemous by the tongue of a talking fool. <hi>Valerius So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus</hi> was put to death by the old and braver <hi>Romanes, ob meritum profanae vocis, quòd contra interdictum Romae nomen eloqui fuit</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>ausus;</hi> because by prating he profan'd the secret of their Religion, and told abroad that name of the City which the <hi>Tuscan rites</hi> had commanded to be concealed, lest the enemies of the people should call from them their tutclar gods, which they could not doe but by telling the proper relation. And in Christianity all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48497:157"/>
have consented to disgrace that Priest, who loves the pleasure of a fools tongue before the charity of souls, and the arts of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Spirit, and the noblenesse of the Religion; and they have inflicted upon him all the censures of the Church, which in the capacity of an Ecclesiasticall person he can suffer.</p>
            <p>These I reckon as the proper evils of the vain and trifling tongue; for though the effect passes into further mischief, yet the originall is weaknesse and folly, and all that unworthynesse which is not yet arrived at malice. But hither also upon the same account some other irregularities of speech are reducible, which although they are of a mixt nature, yet are properly acted by a vain and a loose tongue; and therefore here may be considered not improperly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

               <note place="margin">1.</note> spends twenty homilies: and by the number and weight of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath left this testimony, that it is a foolish vice, but hard to be cured; infinitely unreasonable, but strangely prevailing; almost as much without remedy as it is without pleasure; for it enters first by folly, and grows by custome, and dwels with carelesnesse, and is nurs'd by irreligion, and want of the fear of God; it profanes the <hi>most holy things,</hi> and mingles dirt with the beames of the Sun, follies and trifling talke interweav'd and knit together with the sacred name of God; it placeth the most excellent of things in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the meanest and basest circumstances, it brings the secrets of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the streets, dead mens bones into a Temple; Nothing is a greater sacriledge then to prostitute the great name of God to the petulancy of an idle tongue, and blend it as an expletive to fill up the emptinesse of a weak discourse. The name of <hi>God</hi> is so sacred, so mighty, that it rends mountains, it opens the bowels of the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest rocks, it casts out Devils and makes Hell to tremble, and fills all the regions of Heaven with joy; the name of God is our strength and confidence, the object of our worshippings, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> security of all our hopes; and when God had given himselfe a Name, and immur'd it with dread and reverence; like the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> with the swords of Cherubims, and none durst speak it but he whose lips were hallowed, and that at holy and solemn times, in a most holy and solemne place; I mean the High Priest of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the solemnities when he entred into the sanctuary, then he taught all the world the majesty and veneration of his Name; and therefore it was, that God made restraints upon our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and expressions of him: and as he was infinitely curious, that from all the appearances he made to them, they should not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> depict or ingrave an image of him; so he tooke care that even the tongue should be restrained, and not be too free in forming images and representments of his Name; and therefore as God drew their eyes from vanity, by <hi>putting his name amongst them,</hi> and <hi>representing no shape;</hi> so even when he had <hi>put his name amongst</hi>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:48497:158"/>
               <hi>them,</hi> he took it off from the tongue and placed it before the eye; for <hi>Jehovah</hi> was so written on the Priests Mitre, that all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> might see and read, but none speak it but the Priest. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all this, there is one great thing concerning the Name of God, beyond all that can be spoken or imagined else; and that is, that when God the Father was pleased to pour forth all his glories, and imprint them upon his holy Son in his exaltation, it was by giving him his <hi>holy Name,</hi> the <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> or <hi>Jehovah</hi> made articulate; to signifie <hi>God manifested in the flesh;</hi> and so he wore the character of God, and became the bright image of his person. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>Now all these great things concerning the Name of God are infinite reproofes of common and vain swearing by it, Gods name is left us here to pray by, to hope in, to be the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conveyance of our worshippings, to be the witnesse of truth and the Judge of secrets, the end of strife and the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of perjury, the discerner of right and the severe exacter of all wrongs; and shall all this be unhallowed by impudent tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God without sense, or feare, or notices, or reverence, or observation?</p>
            <p>One thing more I have to adde against this vice of a foolish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> tongue, and that is, that as much prating fils the discourse with lying, so this trifling swearing changes every trifling lye into a horrid perjury; and this was noted by St. <hi>James, But above all things swear not at all,</hi>

            <p>no evill is worse or of more open violence to the rest and reputation of men, then a reproachfull tongue. And it were well if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this evill, to avoyd it in those instances, by which our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation is daily stain'd.

Doe not we chastise a servants folly or mistake, his error or his chance, with language fit to be used by none but vile persons, and towards none but dogs?

in all the dimensions of the sin, till it grows intolerable, and perhaps <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> unpardonable. And let it be considered, what a fearfull destruction and contradiction of friendship or service it is, so to love my self and my little interest, as to preferre it before the soul of him whom I ought to love.

Can any hatred be more, or love be lesse, can any expression of spite be greater, then that it be said, you will not part with 20 <hi>l.</hi> to save your Friends, or your Patrons, or your Brothers soul? and so it is with him that invites him to, or confirms him in his folly, in hopes of getting something from him; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he will see him die, and die eternally, and help forward that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, so he may get that little by it. Every state is set in the midst of danger, as all trees are set in the wind, but the tallest endure the greatest violence of tempest: No man flatters a begger, if he does a slovenly and a rude crime it is entertained with ruder language, and the mean man may possibly be affrighted from his fault, while it is made so uneasie to him by the scorn and harsh reproaches of the mighty. But Princes and Nobles often die with this disease: And when the <hi>Courtiers</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> counterfeited his wry neck, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Servants of the <hi>Sicilian Tyrant</hi> pretended themselves dim sighted, and on purpose rushed one against another, and overthrew the meat as it was served to his table, onely because the Prince was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted, they gave them sufficient instances in what state of affaires they stood with them that waited; it was certain they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend every foolish answer, and pretend subtilty in every absurd question, and make a petition that their base actions might passe into a law, and be made to be the honor and sanctity of all the people: and what proportions or wayes can such great personages have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards felicity, when their vice shall be allowed and praised, every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> action that is but tolerable shall be accounted heroicall, and if it be intolerable among the wise, it shall be called vertuous among the flatterers? <hi>Carneades</hi> said bitterly, but it had in it too many degrees of truth; that Princes and great personages never learn to doe any thing perfectly well, but to ride the great horse, <hi>quia scil. ferociens bestia adulari non didicit,</hi> because the proud beast knows not how to flatter, but will as soon throw him off from his back as he will shake off the son of a Potter. But a Flatterer is like a neighing Horse, that neigheth under every rider, and is pleased with every thing, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends all that he sees, and tempts to mischief, and cares not, so his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> friend may but <hi>perish pleasantly.</hi> And indeed that is a calamity that undoes many a soul; we so love our peace, and sit so easily upon our own good opinions, and are so apt to flatter our selves, and leane upon our own false supports, that we cannot endure to be disturb'd or awakened from our pleasing lethargy. For we care not to be

               <hi>safe,</hi> but to be <hi>secure,</hi> not to escape hell, but to live pleasantly; we are not solicitous of the event, but of the way thither, and it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> if we be perswaded all his well; in the mean time we are carelesse whether indeed it be so or no, and therefore we give pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to fools and vile persons to abuse us, and cousen us of felicity. But this evill puts on severall shapes, which we must discover, that they may not cousen us without our observation. For all men are not capable of an open flattery. And therefore some will dresse their hypocrisie and illusion so, that you may feel the pleasure, and but secretly perceive the complyance and tendernesse to serve the ends of your folly? <hi>perit procari, si latet,</hi> said <hi>Plancus,</hi> If you be not perceived, you lose your reward; if you be too open, you lose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it worse.</p>

            <q>
               <l>Quidam notus homo cum exiret fornice; macte <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

            <p>And it would passe the goblets in a freer circle, if a flattering man shall but say, <hi>Narratur &amp; prisci Catonis saepè mero caluisse virtus,</hi> that old <hi>Cato</hi> would drink hard at sun-set. When <hi>Varro</hi> had noted, that wise and severe <hi>Salust,</hi> who by excellent sententious words had reproved the follies of lust, was himselfe taken in adultery, The <hi>Romane</hi> youth did hug their vice, and thought it grew upon their nature like a mans beard, and that the wisest men would lay their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> heads upon that threshold; and <hi>Seneca</hi> tels that the women of that age despised the adultery of one man onely; and hated it like marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and despis'd that as want of breeding, and grandeur of spirit, because the braver <hi>Spartans</hi> did use to breed their children pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously, as the Heards-men doe cattle from the fairest Buls. And
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48497:164"/>
               <hi>Arrianus</hi> tels that the women would defend their basenesse by the doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> who maintain'd the community of women. This <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sort of flattery is therefore more dangerous, because it makes the temptation ready for mischief, apted and dressed with proper, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, and imitable circumstances. The way of discourse is far about, but evill examples kill quickly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others flatter by imitation: for when a crime is rare and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, singular and out of fashion, it must be a great strength of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and impudence that must entertain it; but the flattering man do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vice of his Lord takes off the wonder, and the fear of being stared at; and so incourages it by making it <hi>popular</hi> and <hi>common.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> tels of one that divorced himself from his wife because his friend did so; that the other might be hardened in the mischief; and when <hi>Plato</hi> saw his scholars stoop in the shoulders, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served his to stammer, they began to be lesse troubled with those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections which they thought common to themselves and others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some pretend a <hi>rusticity</hi> and downright plainnesse, and upon the confidence of that humour their friends vice, and flatter his ruine. <hi>Seneca</hi> observed it of some of his time; <hi>alius quidam adulatione clam utebatur parcè, alius ex aperto palàm, rusticitate simulatâ, quasi simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citas illa ars non sit.</hi> They pretend they love not to dissemble, and therefore they cannot hide their thoughts; let their friend take it how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he will, they must commend that which is commendable; and so man that is willing to dye quietly, is content with the honest hearty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and downright simplicity of him that with an artificial rudenesse dress'd the flattery.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some will dispraise themselves that their friend may think bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of himselfe, or lesse severely of his fault.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Others will reprove their friend for a trifle, but with a purpose to let him understand, that this is all; for the honest man would have told his friend if it had been worse. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Some will laugh and make a sport of a vice, and can hear their friend tell the cursed narrative of his adultery, of his drunkennesse, of his craft and unjust purchases; and all this shall prove but a merry scene; as if damnation were a thing to be laughed at, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting ruine of his friend were a very good jest. But thus the poor sinner shall not be affrighted from his danger, nor chastised by severe language, but the villain that eats his meat shall take him by the hand, and dance about the pit till he fals in, and dies with shame and folly. Thus the evill Spirit puts on shapes enough; none to affright the man, but all to destroy him; and yet it is filthy enough when it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> invested with its own character:

The Parasite or Flatterer is a beast that is all belly, looking round with his eye, watchfull, ugly, and deceitfull, and creeping on his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

            <p>I have this one thing onely to insert, and then the caution will be sufficient, <hi>viz.</hi> that we doe not think all praise given to our friend to be flattery, though it be in his presence. For sometimes praise is the best conveyance for a precept, and it may nourish up an infant ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and make it grow up towards perfection, and its proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and rewards. <hi>Friendship</hi> does better please our friend then <hi>flattery,</hi> and though it was made also for vertue, yet it mingles plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in the chalice, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>behold the face of a friendly and a sweet person;</hi> and it is not the office of a friend alwayes to be sowre, or at any time morose; but free, open, and ingenuous, candid and humane, not denying to please, but ever refusing to abuse or corrupt. For as adulterine metals retain the lustre and colour of gold, but not the value; so <hi>flattery</hi> in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>friendship</hi> takes the face and outside of it, the delicious part; but the flatterer uses it to the interests of vice, and a friend by it serves vertue; and therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> well compared <hi>friendship</hi> to medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall oyntments, which however delicious they be, yet they are also usefull, and minister to healing. But flattery is sweet and adulterate, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> pleasant but without health. He therefore that justly commends his friend to promote and incourage his vertue, reconciles vertue with his friends affection, and makes it <hi>pleasant to be good;</hi> and he that does so, shall also better be suffered when he reproves, because the needing person shall finde that then is the opportunity and season of it, since he denyed not to please so long as he could also profit. I onely adde this advice, that since <hi>selfe-love is the serpents milk</hi> that feeds this viper <hi>flattery,</hi> we should doe well to choke it with its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers milk; I mean, learn to love our selves more, for then we should never endure to be flattered. For he that because he loves himselfe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> loves to be flattered, does, because he loves himself, love to entertain a man to abuse him, to mock him, and to destroy him finally. But he that loves himselfe truly, will suffer fire, will endure to be burnt, so he may be purified; put to pain, so he may be restored to health; for <hi>of all sauces</hi> (said <hi>Euenus)</hi> sharpnesse, severity, and <hi>fire is the best.</hi>

The first we are taught by the lectures of our Schools; the latter, by the mysteries of the Temple. But now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the new institution, we have also a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of speaking; and though silence is one of the great paths of Innocence, yet Holy speaking is the instrument of Spirituall Charity, and is a glorification of God: and therefore this kinde of speaking is a degree of perfection beyond the wisdome and severity of silence. For although <hi>garrulity</hi> and foolish inordinate talking is a conjunction of folly and sin, and the prating man while he desires to get the love of them he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with, incurres their hatred; while he would be admir'd, is laughed at; he spends much and gets nothing, he wrongs his friends <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and makes sport to his enemies, and injures himselfe; he is derided when he tels what others know, he is indanger'd if he tels a secret and what they know not; he is not beleeved when he tels good news, and when he tels ill news he is odious: and therefore that si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which is a cure of all this evill is an excellent portion of safety

And therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> said well, <hi>Qui generosè &amp; regio more instituuntur, primum tacere, deinde loqui discunt.</hi> To be taught first to be silent, then to speak well and handsomely, is educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fit for a Prince; and that is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s method here: first we were taught how to restraine our tongues in the foregoing instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and now we are called to imploy them in Religion.</p>

               </gap>, any thing that may serve the ends of our God and of our Neighbour, in the measures of Religion and usefulnesse. But it is here as in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all other propositions of Religion. God to us, who are in the body, and conducted by materiall phantasmes, and understanding nothing but what we feel, or is conveyed to us by the proportions of what we doe or have, hath given us a Religion that is fitted to our condition and constitution. And therefore when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>love God,</hi> by this <hi>love</hi> Christ understands <hi>obedience;</hi> when we are commanded to <hi>honour God,</hi> it is by singing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing his praises, and doing things which cause reputation and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and even here when we are commanded to speak that which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is good, it is instanced in such good things which are really profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, practically usefull; and here the measures of God are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the proportions of our neighbour. And therefore, though speaking honorable things of God be an imployment that does honour to our tongues and voices, yet we must tune and compose even these notes so, as may best profit our neighbour; for so it must be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, apt to teach. For since all our hopes on our part depend upon our obedience to God, and conformity to our Lord Jesus, by whom our endevours are sanctified and accepted, and our weaknesses are pardoned, and all our obedience relies upon, and is incouraged and grounded in faith, and faith is founded naturally and primarily in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, we may observe that it is not onely reasonably to be expected, but experimentally felt, that in weak and and ignorant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> understandings there are no sufficient supports for the vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a holy life; there being nothing, or not enough to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and strengthen great resolutions, to reconcile our affections to difficulties, to make us patient of affronts, to receive deeper mortifications, and ruder usages, unlesse where an extraordinary grace supplies the want of ordinary notices, as the Apostles were enabled to their preachings: But he therefore that carries and imports into the understanding of his Brother, notices of faith, and incomes of spirituall propositions, and arguments of the Spirit, enables his brother towards the work and practises of a holy life: and though every argument which the Spirit of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hath made and recorded in holy Scripture, is of it selfe induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment great enough to endear obedience; yet it is not so in the event of things to every mans infirmity, and need; but in the treasures of the Spirit, in the heaps and variety of institution, and wise discourses, there will not onely be enough to make a man without excuse, but sufficient to doe his work and to cure his evill, and to fortifie his weaker parts, and to comply with his necessities; for although Gods sufficient grace is present to all that can use it, yet if there be no more then that, it is a sad <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> consideration to remember, that there are but few that will be saved, if they be helped but with just so much as can possibly doe the work: and this we may well be assured of, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God is never wanting to any man in what is simply necessary; but then if we adde this also, that of the vast numbers of men who might possibly be saved, so few really are so, we shall perceive that that grace which onely is sufficient, is not sufficient; <hi>sufficient to the thing, is not sufficient for the person;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God does usually give us more, and we need more yet; and unlesse God <hi>works in us to will and to doe,</hi> we shall neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>will</hi> nor <hi>doe;</hi> though to will be in the power of our hand, yet we will not will; it follows from hence that all they who will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Gods method of graciousnesse, and the necessities of their Brethren, must endevour by all meanes, and in all their owne measures, and capacities to lay up treasures of notices and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48497:167"/>
in their brothers soul, that by some argument or other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they may be met withall and taken in every corner of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. Adde to this, that the duty of a man hath great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and the souls of men are infinitely abused, and the persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of men are strangely divided, and the interests of men are a violent and preternaturall declination from the strictnesses of vertue, and the resolutions of men are quickly altered, and very hardly to be secured, and the cases of conscience are numerous and intricate, and every state of life that hath its proper prejudice, and our notices are abused by our affections, and we shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that men generally need knowledge enough to over-power all their passions, to root out their vitious inclinations, to master <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their prejudice, to answer objections, to resist temptations, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh their wearynesse, to fixe their resolutions, and to determine their doubts; and therefore to see your brother in a state of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, is to see him unfurnished and unprepared to all good works, a person safe no longer then till a temptation comes, and one that cannot be saved but by an absolute unlimited <hi>predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> a favour of which he hath no promise, no security, no revelation; and although to doe this God, hath appointed a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Order of men, the whole <hi>Ecclesiasticall Order,</hi> whom he feeds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> at his owne charges, and whom men rob at their owne perill, yet this doth not disoblige others: for every Master of a family is to instruct, or cause his family to be instructed, and catechised; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Governour is to instruct his charge, every Man his Brother, not alwayes in person, but ever by all possible and just provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For if the people dye for want of knowledge, <hi>they who are set over them</hi> shall also die for want of charity. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must remember, that it is the duty of us all, in our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall measures and proportions, to instruct those that need it, and whose necessity is made ready for our ministration; and let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> us tremble to think what will be the sad account which we shall make when even our families are not taught in the fundamentals of Religion; for how can it be possible for those who could not account concerning the stories of Christs life and death, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries of their redemption, the foundation of all their hopes, the great argument of all their obediences; how can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they should ride in triumph over all the evills which the Devill, and the World, and their owne follies daily present to them in the course of every dayes conversation? And it will be an ill return to say, that God will require no more of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then he hath given them; for suppose that be true in your own sense, yet he will require it of thee, because thou gavest them no more; and however, it is a formidable danger, and a trifling hope for any man to put all the hopes of his being saved upon the onely stock of ignorance; for if his ignorance should never be
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48497:167"/>
accounted for, yet it may leave him in that state in which his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> evills shall grow great, and his sins may be irremediable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Conversation must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, apt to comfort the disconsolate; and <hi>then this,</hi> men in present can feel no greater charity. For since halfe the duty of a Christian in this life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the exercise of passive graces, and the infinite variety of providence, and the perpetuall adversity of chances, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction and emptynesse that is in things themselves, and the wearynesse and anguish of our spirit does call us to the trial and exercise of patience even in the dayes of sunshine, and much more in the violent storms that shake our dwellings, and make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our hearts tremble; God hath sent some Angels into the world, whose office it is to refresh the sorrowes of the poore, and to lighten the eyes of the disconsolate; he hath made some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whose powers are chiefly ordain'd to comfort; <hi>wine,</hi> and <hi>oyle,</hi> and <hi>society, cordials</hi> and <hi>variety;</hi> and <hi>time</hi> it selfe is chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker'd with black and white; stay but till to morrow, and your present sorrow will be weary, and will lie downe to rest. But this is not all. The third person of the holy Trinity is known to us by the name and dignity of the <hi>Holy Ghost the Comforter,</hi> and God glories in the appellative, that he is <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> and <hi>the God of all comfort,</hi> and therefore to minister in the office <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is to become like God, and to imitate the charities of heaven; and God hath fitted mankinde for it; he most needs it, and he feels his brothers wants by his owne experience, and God hath given us speech, and the endearments of society, and pleasantness of conversation, and powers of seasonable discourse, arguments to allay the sorrow, by abating our apprehensions and taking out the sting, or telling the periods of comfort, or exciting hope, or urging a precept, and reconciling our affections, and reciting promises, or telling stories of the Divine mercy, or changing it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> into duty, or making the burden lesse by comparing it with greater, or by proving it to be lesse then we deserve, and that it is so intended, and may become the instrument of vertue. And certain it is, that as nothing can better doe it, so there is nothing greater, for which God made our tongues, next to reciting his prayses, then to minister comfort to a weary soul. And what greater measure can we have, then that we should bring joy to our brother, who with his dreary eyes looks to heaven and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and cannot finde so much rest as to lay his eye-lids close together, then that thy tongue should be tun'd with heavenly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and make the weary soul <hi>to listen</hi> for light and ease, and when he perceives that there is such a thing in the world, and in the order of things, as comfort and joy, <hi>to begin</hi> to break out from the prison of his sorrows at the dore of sighs and tears, and by little and little melt into showres and refreshment? This is glory
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48497:168"/>
to thy voyce, and imployment fit for the brightest Angel. But so have I seen the sun kisse the frozen earth which was bound up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with the images of death, and the colder breath of the North, and then the waters break from their inclosures, and melt with joy, and run in usefull channels, and the flies doe rise againe from their little graves in walls, and dance a while in the aire, to tell that there is joy within, and that the great mother of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will open the stock of her new refreshment, become usefull to mankinde, and sing prayses to her Redeemer: So is the heart of a sorrowfull man under the discourses of a wise Comforter, he breaks from the despairs of the grave, and the fetters and chains of sorrow, he blesses God, and he blesses thee, and he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> feels his life returning; for to be miserable is death, but nothing is life but to be comforted; and God is pleased with no musick from below so much as in the thanksgiving songs of relieved Widows, of supported Orphans, of rejoycing, and comforted, and thankfull persons. This part of communication does the work of God and of our Neighbors, and bears us to heaven in streams of joy made by the overflowings of our brothers comfort. It is a fearfull thing to see a man despairing. None knows the sorrow and the intolerable anguish but themselves, and they that are damned; and so are all the loads of a wounded spirit, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the staffe of a mans broken fortune bowes its head to the ground, and sinks like an Osier under the violence of a mighty tempest. But therefore in proportion to this I may tell the excellency of the imployment, and the duty of that charity which bears the dying and languishing soul from the fringes of hell to the seat of the brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test stars, where Gods face shines and reflects comforts for ever and ever. And though God hath for this especially intrusted his Ministers and Servants of the Church, and hath put into their hearts and notices great magazines of promises, and arguments of hope and arts of the Spirit, yet God does not alwayes send <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Angels on these embassies, but sends a man <hi>ut sit homo homini Deus,</hi> that every good man in his season may be to his brother in the place of God, to comfort and restore him; and that it may appear how much it is the duty of us all to minister com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to our brother, we may remember that the same words and the same arguments doe oftentimes more prevaile upon our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits when they are applyed by the hand of another, then when they dwell in us, and come from our owne discoursings. This is indeed <gap reason="foreign">

He is a miserable man whom none dares tell of his faults so plainly, that he may understand his danger; and he that is uncapable and impatient of reproof, can never become a good friend to any man. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> For besides that himself would never admonish his friend when he sins, (and if he would, why should not himself be glad of the same chairty?) he is also <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>Scorner is his name;</hi> he thinks himself exempt from the condition and failings of men, or if he does not, he had rather goe to hell then be call'd to his way by an angry Sermon, or driven back by the sword of an Angell, or endure one blushing, for all his hopes and interests of heaven. It is no shame to be reproved, but to deserve it; but he that deserves it, and will doe so still, shall increase his shame into confusion, and bring upon himselfe a sorrow bigger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then the calamities of war, and plagues and hospitals, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.

            </q>
            <p>The severe word of the reproving man is wise and healthfull: But because all times and all circumstances, and all persons are not fit for this imployment:</p>

            <p>Some will not endure that a pore man, or an obliged person should reprove them, and themselves are often so unprofitable servants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that they will rather venture their friends damnation then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their owne interest, therefore in the performance of this duty of the usefull communication, the following measures are fit to be observed.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:48497:169"/>
1. <hi>Let not your reproofe be publick and personall:</hi> if it be <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> it must be in <hi>generall;</hi> if it be <hi>personall,</hi> it must be in <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and this is expressely commanded by our blessed Saviour: <hi>If thy Brother offends, tell it him between him and thee;</hi> for when it comes afterwards in case of contumacy to be declared in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it passes from <hi>fraternall correption</hi> to <hi>Ecclesiasticall discipline.</hi> When <hi>Socrates</hi> reproved <hi>Plato</hi> at a feast, <hi>Plato</hi> told him, it had been better he had told him his fault in private; for to speak it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly is indecency: <hi>Socrates</hi> replyed; and so it is for you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to condemne that indecency. For it is the nature of man to be spitefull when he is shamed, and to esteem that the worst of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> evils, and therefore to take <hi>impudence</hi> and <hi>perseverance</hi> for its cover, when his shame is naked: And for this indiscretion <hi>Aristomenes</hi> the Tutor of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> who before the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Embassadors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the King for sleeping at the solemne audience, profited nothing, but enraged the Prince, and was himself forc'd to drink poyson. But this warinesse is not alwayes necessary. For 1. a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and an authoriz'd person, may doe it publickly, and may name the person as himself shall judge expedient.</p>

               <l>—secuit Lucilius urbem: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               </l>
               <l>Te Lupe, te Muti; &amp; genuinum fregit in illis:</l>
               <l>Omne vafer vitium—</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucilius</hi> was a censor of manners, and by his office he had warrant and authority. 2. There are also some cases in which a publick reproofe is prudent, and that is when the crime is great, but not understood to be any at all; for then it is <hi>Instruction</hi> and <hi>Catechism,</hi> and layes aside the affront and trouble of reproofe. Thus <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Martyr did reprove <hi>Trajan</hi> sacrificing at the Altar in the sight of all the Officers of the Army; and the <hi>Iews</hi> were commanded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 10. 11.</note> to reprove the <hi>Babylonians</hi> for Idolatry in the land of their Captivity: and if we see a Prince in the confidence of his pride, and carelesnesse of spirit, and heat of war spoyle a Church or rob God, it is then fit to tell him the danger of Sacriledge, if otherwise he cannot well be taught his danger, and his duty. 3. There are some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of person in which by interpretation, duty or custome a leave is indulged or presum'd, that liberty may be prudently used, publickly to reprove the publick vices: so it was in the old days of the <hi>Romans;</hi> vice had then so little footing and authority, so few friends and advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, that the Prophets and Poets used a bolder liberty to disgrace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whatsoever was amisse;</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:48497:169"/>
and much of the same liberty is still reserved to Pulpits, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Bishops office, save onely, that although they may reprove pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, yet they may not often doe it personally.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Use not to reprove thy brother for every thing, but for great things onely:</hi> for this is the office of a Tutor, not of a Friend; and few men will suffer themselves to abide alwayes under Pupillage. When the friend of <hi>Philotimus</hi> the Physician came to him to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a sore finger, he told him, <hi>Heus tu, non tibi cum reduvia est negotium,</hi> he let his finger alone, and told him that his liver was impostumate: and he that tells his friend that his countenance is not grave enough in the Church, when it may be the man is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> an Atheist, offers him a cure that will doe him no good, and to chastise a trifle is not a worthy price of that noblest liberty and ingenuity which becomes him that is to heale his brothers soule. But when a vice stains his soule, when he is a foole in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when he is proud, and impatient of contradiction, when he disgraces himselfe by talking weakly, and yet beleeves himselfe wise, and above the confidence of a sober person, then it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns a friend to rescue him from folly. So <hi>Solon</hi> reproved <hi>Croesus,</hi> and <hi>Socrates Alcibiades,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> chid <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> told to <hi>Dion</hi> that of all things in the world he should beware of that folly, <hi>by which men please themselves, and despise a better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>quia ei vitio adsidet solitudo,</hi> Because that folly hath in it singularity, and is directly contrary to all capacities of a friendship, or the entertainments of necessary reproofe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Vse not liberty of reproofe in the dayes of sorrow and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;</hi> for the calamity it self is enough to chastise the gayeties of sinning persons, and to bring him to repentance; it may be sometimes fit to insinuate the mention of the cause of that sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, in order to repentance, and a cure: But severe and biting language is then out of season, and it is like putting vineger to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> an enflamed and smarting eye, it increases the anguish, and tempts unto impatience. In the accidents of a sad person, we must doe as nurses to their falling children, snatch them up and still their cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and entertain their passion with some delightfull avocation; but chide not then when the sorrowfull man needs to be refreshed. When <hi>Crater</hi> the <hi>Cynic</hi> met <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> in his banishment and trouble, he went to him and spoke to him friendly, and used his Philosophy in the ministeries of comfort, and taught him to bear his trouble nobly, and so wrought upon the <hi>criminal,</hi> and <hi>wilde Demetrius;</hi> and he moved him to repentance, who if he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had been chidden (as he expected) would have scorn'd the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Cynic,</hi> and hated his presence and institution; and <hi>Perseus</hi> kil'd <hi>Euchus</hi> and <hi>Eulaeus,</hi> for reproving his rashnesse, when he was newly defeated by the <hi>Romanes.</hi>

               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:48497:170"/>
4. <hi>Avoid all the evill appendages of this liberty:</hi> for since to reprove a sinning brother is at the best but an unwelcome and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> employment, though it may also be understood to be full of charity; yet therefore we must not make it to be hatefull by adding reproach, scorn, violent expressions, scurrility, derision, or bitter invectives. <hi>Hieron</hi> invited <hi>Epicharmus</hi> to supper, and he knowing that <hi>Hieron</hi> had unfortunately kil'd his friend, replyed to his invitation, <hi>At<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> nuper cum amicos immolares non vorasti,</hi> I think I may come, for when thou didst sacrifice thy friends thou didst not devour them. This was a bitter <hi>sarcasme,</hi> and might with more prudence and charity have been avoyded. They that intend charitably and conduct wisely, take occasions and proper <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> seasons of reproof, they doe it by way of question and similitude, by narrative and apologues, by commending something in him that is good, and discommending the same fault in other persons by way that may disgrace that vice, and preserve the reputation of the man. <hi>Ammonius</hi> observing that his Scholars were nice and curious in their diet, and too effeminate for a Philosophicall life, caused his freed man to chastise his boy for not dining without vinegar, and all the while look'd upon the young Gentlemen, and read to them a lecture of Severity. Thus our dearest Lord reproved St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he look'd upon him when the signe was given with the crowing of the Cock, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and so chid him into a showre of penitentiall tears. Some use to mingle prayses with their reprehensions, and to invite their friends patience to endure remedy, by ministring some pleasure with their medicine; for as no wise man can well indure to be praised by him that knows not how to disprayse, and to reprove; so neither will they endure to be reproved by him that knows not how to praise; for reproof from such a man betrayes too great a love of himselfe, and an illiberall spirit: He that will reprove wisely, must efform himselfe into all images of things which innocently and wisely he can put on; not by changing his manners, his principles, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> consequences of his discourse, (as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was supposed to doe) for it is best to keep the severity of our owne principles, and the manner of our owne living: for so <hi>Plato</hi> lived at <hi>Syracuso,</hi> just as he lived in the <hi>Academy;</hi> he was the same to <hi>Dionysius</hi> that he was to <hi>Dion:</hi> But this I mean, that he who meanes to win soules, and prevail to his brothers institution, must as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, effigiate and conform himself to those circumstances of living, and discourse, by which he may prevaile upon the persuasions, by complying with the affections and usages of men. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>These are the measures by which we are to communicate our counsels and advices to our erring Brethren: to which I adde this last advice, That no man should at that time in which he is reproved give counsell and reproofe to his Reprover, for that betrayes an angry spirit, and makes discord out of piety, and changes charity into
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48497:170"/>
wrangling, and it looking like a revenge, makes it appear that himself <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> took the first reproofe for an injury.</p>
            <p>That which remaines now is, that I persuade men to doe it, and that I persuade men to suffer it; 'tis sometimes hard <hi>to doe it,</hi> but the cause is onely, because it is hard <hi>to bear it;</hi> for if men were but apprehensive of their danger, and were not desirous to die, there were no more to be said in this affair; they would be as glad to entertain a severe Reprover as a carefull Physitian; of whom because most men are so willing to make use, so thankfull for their care, so great valuers of their skill, such lovers of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> persons; no man is put to it to persuade men to be Physitians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no need to persuade men to live, or to be in health: if therefore men would as willingly be vertuous as be healthfull, as willingly doe no evill as suffer none, be as desirous of heaven as of a long life on earth, all the difficulties and temptations against this duty of reproving our sinning brother would soon be conceal'd; but let it be as it will, we must doe it in duty and piety to him that needs, and if he be impatient of it, he needs it more: <hi>Et per hujusmodi offensas emetiendum est confragosum hoc iter:</hi> it is a troublesome imployment, but it is duty and charity; and therefore when it can with hope of successe, with prudence and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> piety be done, no other consideration ought to interpose. And for the other part, those I mean who ought to be reproved, they are to remember, that themselves give pensions to Preacher on purpose to be reproved if they shall need it*, that God hath instituted a holy Order of men to that very purpose*, that they should be severally told of all that is amisse*, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves chide their children and their servants for their good, and that they may amend*, and that they endure thirst to cure their dropsies*, that they suffer burnings to prevent the gangrenes*, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and endure the cutting off a limbe to preserve their lives *, and therefore that it is a strange witchcraft and a prodigious folly, that at so easie a mortification as the suffering of a plain friendly reproofe, they will not set forward their interest of heaven, and suffer themselves to be set forward in their hopes of heaven:</p>
            <q>
               <l>—dura fatemur</l>
               <l>Esse, sed ut valeas multa dolenda feras.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And when all remember that flattery and importune silence suffer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the mighty to perish like fooles and inconsiderate persons, it ought to awake our spirits, and make us to attend to the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of a friend, with a silence great as midnight, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as a widows eyes. It was a strange thing that <hi>Valentinian</hi> should in the midst of so many Christian Prelates make a law to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48497:171"/>
establish <hi>Polygamy,</hi> and that no Bishop should dare to reprehend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him. The effect of it was this, that he had a son by a second wife, the first being alive and not divorc'd, and he left him heir of a great part of the Empire; and what the effect of that was to this soul, God who is his Judge best knows.</p>
            <p>If now at last it be inquir'd whether every man is bound to reprove every man, if he sins, and if he converse with him? I answer, that if it should be so, it were to no purpose, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for it there is no commandement; every man that can may instruct him that wants it; but every man may not reprove him that is already instructed; that is an act of charity, for which there are no measures, but the others necessity, and his own op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but this is also an act of discipline, and must in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cases suppose an authority; and in all cases such a liberty as is not fit to be permitted to mean, and ignorant, and inferiour persons; I end this with the saying of a wise person, advising to every one concerning the use of the tongue, <hi>aut lucrentur vitam loquendo, aut tacendo abscondant scientiam;</hi> if they speak, let them minister to the good of souls; if they speak not, let them mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to sobriety; in the first they serve the end of charity, in the other of humility.</p>
