            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT I presume to lay these Papers at your Lordships feet, is not because I imagin they <hi>deserve,</hi> but because I am Conscious they <hi>need</hi> so great a Patronage. Not but that were the Discourses they contain as great and meritorious as their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they might safely shelter themselves under their own Deserts, and challenge <hi>Homage</hi> instead of begging <hi>Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> but though I have done my best En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb facs="tcp:106959:4"/>
to treat this great Theme suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to its own native Majesty, yet I am very sensible it hath not escap'd the too common Fate of all such sublime and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Subjects, which is, to be foul'd and sullyed by coarse handling. But my lot falling in this unhappy Age, wherein the best <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> in the World are in such apparent Danger of being Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, like their blessed Author, between those two Thieves (and both, alas, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ones) <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asm,</hi> I thought my self obliged not to sit still as an unconcerned Spectator of the <hi>Tragedy,</hi> but in my little Sphere, and according to my poor Ability, to indeavour its Prevention: And considering that the most effectual Means the <hi>Romanists</hi> have used to subvert <hi>this</hi> Church, which they so much <hi>envy,</hi> and all the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations do so much <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>depend</hi> on, hath been to <hi>divide</hi> her own Children from her, and <hi>arm</hi> them against her, by starting new Opinions among them, and
<pb facs="tcp:106959:4"/>
ingaging their Zeal (which was wont to be imploy'd to better Purposes) in hot Disputes about the <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of her Worship; I thought a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> which is the proper Sphere of Christian <hi>Zeal,</hi> might be a good Expedient to take men off from those dangerous <hi>Contentions</hi> which were <hi>kindled</hi> and are <hi>fed</hi> and <hi>blown</hi> by such as design our common Ruin. For sure did our People throughly understand what 'tis to be Christians <hi>indeed,</hi> and how much Duty that implies, they could never find so much Leisure as they do to quarrel and wrangle about <hi>Trifles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, my Lord, is the <hi>sincere</hi> Design of what I here present to your Lordship; and however it may <hi>succeed,</hi> I have this Satisfaction that I <hi>meant well,</hi> and have exprest my Good Will to this poor <hi>envied</hi> Church, whose truly Primitive Constitution, pure and undefiled Religion, I shall always admire and reverence; and whatsoever her Fate may be, I am chain'd
<pb facs="tcp:106959:5"/>
to her Fortunes by my <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> and shall ever esteem it more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to be crusht in pieces by her Fall, which God avert, than to flourish and Triumph on her Ruines.</p>
            <p>But among the <hi>many</hi> ill Omens that threaten our Church, there is <hi>one</hi> which seems to presage its Prosperity; and that is, that such Eminent Stations in it as your Lordships, are so excellently suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For although whether the Part you are design'd for, be to Grace her <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs</hi> or her <hi>Funeral,</hi> is known only to the soveraign Disposer of Events, yet this, <hi>my Lord,</hi> all that wish well to our Church conclude, that God bestow'd <hi>You</hi> upon her as a Token of Love. For which they have sufficient Warrant even from the daily Experience they have of the Prudence and Vigilance of your Government, the Piety, Integrity and Generosity of your Temper, of your invincible Loyalty to your Prince, your undaunted Zeal for the Reformed Religion, and grave and
<pb facs="tcp:106959:5"/>
Obliging Deportment towards all you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with. I shall trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship no farther, but conclude this Address with that which I am sure is the hearty Prayer of all your honest Clergy, that the God of Heaven would long continue your Lordship a Blessing to the Church and to this Diocess, an Honour to your Sacred Order and the Noble Stock you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from; and if what I here present prove but so prosperous as to do some good in the World, and obtain your Lordships Acceptance, it will be a noble Compensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this well-meant Endeavour.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> SHALL not trouble the Reader with a long Apology for the Publication of the ensuing Treatise, though I might plead (as other Authors do) the Importunity of Friends, whose Judgments I very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. For, to say the Truth, I do by no means think that in an Affair of this Nature it is <hi>safe</hi> or <hi>fit</hi> for a man to be over-born by the persuasions of those whose <hi>Judgments</hi> he hath just cause to suspect may be brib'd by their <hi>Friendships.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had I not hop'd that in such an Age as this, (wherein through our own <hi>Divisions</hi> and <hi>Debaucheries,</hi> both in <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> and the hellish Contrivances of our <hi>Enemies,</hi> we have such a dismal Prospect of things before us) these Papers might be of some <hi>Vse</hi> to Religion and the Souls of men, I would never have troubled the World with them; but hoping they might, I have ventured upon that reason to publish them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106959:7"/>I HAVE for some years been a sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spectator of the black Cloud that is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering over my Native Country, and I must confess have not been without my share of the <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Anxieties</hi> of the Age; but being at last quite sick of looking <hi>downwards</hi> upon this uncomfortable Scene of things, I had no other way to relieve my oppressed Thoughts but to raise them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this miserable World, and entertain them with the <hi>Comforts</hi> of Religion, and the <hi>Hopes</hi> of a better State beyond the Grave; wherein, I thank God, I have found such <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Mind as render'd my blackest Apprehensions of the ensuing Storm very <hi>tolerable.</hi> And now because I would not eat my Morsel <hi>alone,</hi> and injoy my Satisfaction to <hi>my self,</hi> I have indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by this following Treatise of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Way thither, to <hi>break</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute</hi> it among my distressed Neighbours; that so by carrying their Minds from these <hi>dismal</hi> Expectations into the <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py</hi> Regions above, and directing their Lives and Actions <hi>thither,</hi> I may communicate to them the blessed Art how to live <hi>happily</hi> in a distracted World. And methinks, when our <hi>present</hi> State is so perplext and uncertain, we should be more than ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned to make sure of something,
<pb facs="tcp:106959:7"/>
and to provide for a <hi>future</hi> Well-being, that so we may not be miserable in <hi>both</hi> Worlds.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Argument</hi> I have undertaken, I may without breach of Modesty say, it is a <hi>great</hi> and a <hi>noble</hi> one; it is the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> which next to the <hi>Angelical</hi> approaches nearest to the Life of God. But as for the <hi>Management</hi> of it, all that I can say is this, I have imploy'd my <hi>best</hi> Thoughts and Skill about it; and if, after this, I have any where <hi>wronged</hi> or <hi>misrepresented</hi> it, it is more my <hi>Vnhappiness</hi> than my <hi>Fault.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be thought that in the <hi>first three Chapters</hi> I have discours'd more <hi>specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively,</hi> than 'tis fit in a Book that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for <hi>common</hi> Use and Edification; but it may be when the Reader hath considered the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Arguments I have there handled, and how necessarily they fall in with my <hi>Design,</hi> he will be convinc'd that 'twas <hi>unavoidable.</hi> And yet I doubt not but with a little Diligence and Attention of mind the <hi>plainest</hi> Reader may be able to comprehend the main <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of what I drive at.</p>
            <p>IN the first place I thought 'twould be necessary in treating of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> to give some Account of the blessed <hi>End</hi> it refers to, that so from the Nature of <hi>that,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106959:8"/>
we might be the better able to judg of the <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Vsefulness</hi> of those <hi>Means</hi> which Christianity prescribes in order to it. And this I have indeavoured in the <hi>first Chapter</hi>; where I have only so far explained the Nature of the heavenly State and Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as was necessary to light and conduct us through the ensuing Design.</p>
            <p>In the second place I judg'd it would be no less expedient to give some <hi>general</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what <hi>kinds</hi> of Means are necessary to our obtaining this <hi>End</hi>; that so we might be convinc'd how requisite both the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> and <hi>instrumental</hi> Parts of the <hi>Christian Life</hi> are to our everlasting Happiness. And this I have attempted in the <hi>second Chapter</hi>; wherein from the Consideration of the vast Distance there is between the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> State of Heaven, and this <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>degenerate</hi> State of Human Nature, I have indeavoured to shew that 'tis not only neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for us to <hi>practise</hi> and <hi>acquire</hi> those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Vertues in the perfection whereof the heavenly Bliss consists, but that to inable us to practise, acquire and improve them, there are sundry <hi>other</hi> instrumental Duties indispensably necessary; which Duties, as I have there proved, are of no other <hi>Vse</hi> or <hi>Significancy</hi> in Religion, than as they are <hi>Means</hi> of Vertue and Piety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106959:8"/>AND having thus distributed the Means into their proper Kinds and Order, I have in the <hi>third Chapter</hi> treated largely of the <hi>first</hi> Kind, to wit, the Practice of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Vertues</hi>; in which I confess I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther handled the particular Vertues in their full <hi>Extent</hi> and <hi>Latitude,</hi> nor inforc'd them with all their <hi>moral Reasons</hi>; that being done already to excellent purpose in those two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Treatises of <hi>Holy Living and Dying,</hi> and of <hi>the whole Duty of Man.</hi> Nor could I have done it without swelling this Discourse, which is large enough already, into a Volume too large for common Use. And indeed all that was necessary to <hi>my</hi> Purpose, was only so far to explain the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of each particular Vertue as that the Reader might thereby understand what is meant by them; but that which most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd me in pursuance of my <hi>main</hi> Design, was to prove that the Practice of every Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is an <hi>essential</hi> Part of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> and a <hi>necessary</hi> Means to the blessed End of it. And accordingly, as I have shewn from the express Commands of our Religion our <hi>indispensible</hi> Obligation to practise every Vertue; so I have indeavoured to shew how in the Practice of it we do naturally <hi>grow up</hi> to the heavenly State, as, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, how in the course of a sinful Life we do
<pb facs="tcp:106959:9"/>
by a necessary Efficiency gradually <hi>sink</hi> our selves into the State of the Damned. For I have proved at large, that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> in the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of each particular <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> and that in the perfection of these two opposite <hi>Qualities</hi> consists the main <hi>Happiness</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> of those two opposite <hi>States.</hi> From whence it will necessarily follow, that as in the Practice of the one or t'other we grow more <hi>virtuous</hi> or <hi>vicious,</hi> so proportionably we rise up towards <hi>Heaven</hi> or sink down towards <hi>Hell</hi> by a fatal Tendency of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Truth of which is not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the generality of <hi>Christian Writers,</hi> but also by the best and wisest of the <hi>Heathen Philosophers</hi>; though this, I think, is the <hi>first</hi> Attempt that hath been made to derive the Heavenly and the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish States from the nature of the particular Virtues and Vices. I pray God that what I have said may but ingage some more <hi>skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Pen in the Prosecution of this <hi>noble</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. For I know nothing in the World that can be more effectual to ingage men to be <hi>substantially</hi> Religious, to take them off from <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Formality,</hi> from all <hi>presumptuous</hi> Hopes and <hi>false</hi> Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, than their being throughly convinc'd of this Truth, that the eternal <hi>Happiness</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:106959:9"/>
               <hi>Misery</hi> of Souls is founded in their <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Vice,</hi> and that there is as <hi>inseparable</hi> a Connexion between <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory, Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> as there is between <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Heat, Frost</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> or any other necessary <hi>Cause</hi> and its <hi>Effect.</hi> For if they were but throughly persuaded of <hi>this,</hi> they would easily discern what wretched <hi>Non-sense</hi> it is, to think of going to Heaven or escaping Hell whilst they continue in any wilful Course of <hi>Disobedience</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus treated at large of the <hi>first</hi> Sort of Means by which the End of our <hi>Christian Life</hi> is to be obtained, I proceed in the <hi>fourth Chapter,</hi> which is the largest of all, to give an Account of the <hi>second,</hi> viz. the <hi>Instrumental Duties</hi> of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are injoin'd us as <hi>Means</hi> subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to our Practice, Acquisition and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of those <hi>Heavenly Vertues</hi> in the perfection whereof our Chief Happiness consists. And for the more distinct hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of these, I have considered men under a <hi>Threefold</hi> State with respect to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Life</hi>; First, as <hi>entering</hi> into it; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as <hi>actually ingaged</hi> in it; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>perfecting</hi> and <hi>improving</hi> themselves by <hi>Perseverance</hi> in it; to each of which I have <hi>appropriated</hi> such of the <hi>instrumental
<pb facs="tcp:106959:10"/>
Duties</hi> as I conceived did more <hi>especially</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them. 'Tis true, some of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here treated of, are not <hi>purely</hi> instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, but of a <hi>mixt</hi> Nature, such as <hi>Faith, Prayer, actual Dedication of our good Works to God,</hi> &amp;c. which are <hi>essential</hi> Parts of Divine Worship, and, as such, do belong to those <hi>Divine Vertues</hi> the Perfection wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of makes a Principal Part of the everlasting Happiness of Souls. But <hi>here</hi> I have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them only as <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> in the Use of which we are to acquire and perfect those <hi>Beatifical</hi> Vertues. And of this sort of Means I do not remember any <hi>one</hi> Particular recommended in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but what hath been here treated of. Upon <hi>some</hi> indeed I have insisted much more <hi>briefly,</hi> than upon <hi>others,</hi> because I find them already <hi>largely</hi> accounted for in other practical Books, and especially in those two excellent Treatises above-named; but of those which <hi>they</hi> either cursorily touch, or take no notice at all, I thought my self obliged to give a <hi>larger</hi> Account.</p>
            <p>FROM the whole I would recommend to the pious Reader the Consideration of the admirable <hi>Structure</hi> and <hi>Contrivance</hi> of the <hi>Practical Part</hi> of Christianity, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proposed to us an <hi>End</hi> so great and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, and so highly worthy of our most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
<pb facs="tcp:106959:10"/>
prosecutions, hath also furnish'd us with such choice and effectual <hi>Means</hi> of all sorts to attain it. The consideration of which would be in itself a great Inducement to me to believe <hi>Christianity</hi> a <hi>Divine Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> though I were utterly unacquainted with its <hi>External</hi> Evidence and Motives of Credibility. For it can never enter into my Head that such a <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>exquisite</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance to make men <hi>good</hi> and <hi>happy,</hi> could ever owe its Original to the mere invention of a <hi>Carpenters Son,</hi> and a company of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate <hi>Fishermen.</hi> Especially considering how far it excels the Moral Precepts even of those <hi>divine Philosophers</hi> who believ'd the future State of a blessed Immortality, and exerciz'd their best Wit in prescribing <hi>Rules</hi> to guide and direct men thither.</p>
            <p>AND having given this large Account of the <hi>instrumental Duties</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> and also inforc'd the several Divisions of them with proper <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> I thought fit to add a <hi>fifth Chapter,</hi> wherein I have given some <hi>Rules</hi> for the more profitable <hi>reading</hi> of this practical Discourse, and also some general <hi>Directions</hi> for the Exercise of our <hi>private Religion</hi> in all the different States of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> together with certain <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> fitted for each State. In which I have
<pb facs="tcp:106959:11"/>
supposed, what I doubt is a very deplorable Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Generality of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans after their <hi>Initiation</hi> by <hi>Baptism</hi> into the Publick profession of Christianity, are so unhappy as to be seduc'd either through bad <hi>Example</hi> or <hi>Education</hi> into a <hi>vicious</hi> State of Life; and that consequently from <hi>thence</hi> they must take their first start into the through Practice of Christianity. Not that I make the least doubt, but that there are a great many excellent Christians, who by the Blessing of God upon their pious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, have been secur'd from this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and trained up from their Infancy under a prevailing Sense of God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and therefore for such as these, as there is no need of that solemn method of <hi>Repentance</hi> prescribed in the <hi>first Section</hi> of the <hi>fourth Chapter,</hi> so neither is there of those first <hi>penitential Prayers</hi> in this <hi>fifth Chapter,</hi> which are accomodated to that State. For these persons have long since been <hi>actually ingaged</hi> in the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> and, as 'tis to be supposed, have made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable <hi>Improvements</hi> in it, and therefore as they are only concerned in the Duties of the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>third</hi> States of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> so they are only to use the Prayers which are fitted to <hi>those</hi> States, which with some variation of those phrases which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:106959:11"/>
the past Course of our Life to have been <hi>vicious,</hi> they may easily accommodate to their own Condition. But the Design of this Discourse is not only to <hi>conduct</hi> them <hi>onwards</hi> in their Way who have already <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi> upon the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> but also to <hi>reduce</hi> those to it, who have been so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to <hi>wander</hi> into vicious Courses; or rather, though it serves <hi>both</hi> Purposes, 'tis wholly designed for the <hi>same</hi> persons, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>seek</hi> and <hi>bring back</hi> those lost Sheep who have <hi>straid</hi> from the Paths of Christian Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Vertue, and then to <hi>lead</hi> them on through all the intermediate Stages to the happy State of immortal Pleasures at the end of them. And now if what hath been said should, by the Blessing of God, obtain its designed Effect upon any person, I ask no other Requital for all the Pains it hath cost me, but his earnest Prayers to God for me, that after my best Endeavours to guide and direct <hi>him</hi> to Heaven, I may not fall short of it <hi>my self.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. I. Concerning the ultimate End of the Christian Life.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N order to our understanding, what is the Nature, Use, and Excellency of any <hi>Means,</hi> it is necessary we should have a true and genuine Notion of those pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>Ends</hi> which they drive at. For the nature of them, as they are <hi>Means,</hi> consists in being serviceable to some <hi>End;</hi> but to what they are particularly serviceable, must be collected from the nature of those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Ends</hi> whereunto they are directed. And therefore till we know what those particular <hi>Ends</hi> are, it is impossible we should know whether they are <hi>Means</hi> or no, or, which is the same thing, whether they are serviceable to any <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Purpose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT being therefore the Design of this <hi>Work</hi> to explain the nature of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> it will be necessary (for the clearing of our way) to give some account of the blessed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106959:18"/>
                  <hi>End</hi> for which it is intended; which will very much contribute to our right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the great usefulness and subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency of each part of it thereunto. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p n="1">I. I shall endeavour to shew what is the peculiar <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Wherein the true Nature of this <hi>End</hi> consists.</p>
               <p n="1">I. As for the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> we are assured from Scripture, that it is no other but <hi>Heaven</hi> it self, that state of endless <hi>Bliss</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> which God hath prepared in the World above, for the reception of all those, <hi>who by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in well-doing seek for glory and honour and immortality.</hi> That this is the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> is evident from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis every where proposed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apostles, as the Chief Good of a Christian, and the Supreme Motive to all Christian Virtue. For so St. <hi>John,</hi> that bosome-Favourite of our Saviour, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, that <hi>This is the promise which Christ hath promised us, even Eternal Life,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> ii.25. And if we look into the Gospel of St. <hi>John,</hi> who hath more largely recorded our Saviours Sermons and Discourses than any other Evangelist, we shall find <hi>Eternal Life</hi> still proposed by him as the supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106959:18"/>
Promise to encourage and persuade men to the profession and practice of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</hi> For so <hi>John</hi> iv.36. 'tis proposed by our Saviour as that which is the Harvest of a Christian, to which, like the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman's plowing and sowing, all our care and endeavour is to be directed; <hi>He that reapeth, receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto eternal life.</hi> Consonantly whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, Gal.</hi> vi.8. And this, as our Saviour tells us, is the great Reward which he gives to all those that hear and follow him, <hi>John</hi> x.27, 28. and this the great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he every where insists on, that he that believeth hath <hi>Life Everlasting,</hi> that whosoever heareth his word hath <hi>Life Everlasting,</hi> and that his commandment is <hi>Life Everlasting.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> vi.22. <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life</hi> is expresly said to be the End of <hi>having our fruit unto Holiness</hi>; and as such we are bid to direct our actions unto it, to <hi>believe in Christ unto Everlasting Life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i.16. to do good, to this end, that we <hi>may lay hold upon Eternal Life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi.18, 19. <hi>to look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. xii.2. And therefore Heaven is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106959:19"/>
to be the Christian <hi>Canaan,</hi> to which we are to direct all our steps, whilst we are travailing through this World. <hi>Heb.</hi> xi.14, 15, 16. And the whole life of a Christian is expressed by <hi>seeking</hi> it: <hi>Mat.</hi> vi.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii.14. <hi>Col.</hi> iii.1. And the <hi>incorruptible</hi> Crown is affirmed to be as much the end of the race of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> as those <hi>corruptible</hi> Crowns were of the races in the <hi>Olympick Games.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix.25. For it is to <hi>Eternal Glory</hi> that we are <hi>called,</hi> 1 Pet. v.10. 2 Thes. ii.14. and in the discharge of all that Duty whereunto we are <hi>called,</hi> we are to <hi>look</hi> to this <hi>blessed Hope</hi> as our great <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Encouragement, Tit.</hi> ii.13.</p>
               <p>THIS I have the more largely insisted upon, because of a great mistake that many persons have lain under in this matter; which is, that the <hi>Glory of God</hi> is the only ultimate <hi>End</hi> of a Christian, and that this is a distinct <hi>End</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi>; The first of which I confess, is very <hi>true,</hi> but the last ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>false.</hi> That the <hi>glory of God</hi> is the last End of a Christian, is evident from those Texts which bid us <hi>do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. x.31. and which make the <hi>glory of God</hi> to be the point in which all the <hi>fruits of righteousness</hi> do concenter, <hi>Phil.</hi> i.11. which propose this as the <hi>End</hi> of all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106959:19"/>
Religious Performances, that <hi>God in all things may be glorified,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv.11. and affirm, that tis to this purpose that we are chosen to be Christians, that we should be to the <hi>Praise of his Glory. Eph.</hi> i.12. But that the <hi>glory of God</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is no distinct <hi>End</hi> from our being made partakers of the <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> is as evident from hence, that this <hi>Glory</hi> consists not in any thing that we can add or contribute to Him, whose essential Glory is so immense and secure, that there is nothing we can do, can either Increase or Diminish it; and there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glory can redound to him from any thing without, but what is the Reflection of his own natural Rays. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands himself too well, to value him self either the more or the less for the Praises or Dispraises of his Creatures. For he is enough of Stage and Theatre to himself, and hath the same satisfying Prospect of his own <hi>Glory</hi> in the midst of all the loud <hi>Blasphemies</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> as among the perpetual <hi>Halelujahs</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And having so, it cannot be supposed that he should injoyn us to Praise and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him for the sake of any Good or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that can accrue to <hi>Himself</hi> by it, or out of any other pleasure he takes in hearing himself applauded and commended
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106959:20"/>
by us, than he doth in any other Act that is decent and reasonable in it's own Nature; but 'tis <hi>therefore,</hi> he will have us Praise him, because he knows it is for <hi>Our</hi> Good, and highly conduces, as it is a most reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Action, to the Perfection and Happiness of our reasonable Natures; because our praising him naturally excites us to imitate him, and to transcribe into <hi>our own</hi> Natures those Adorable Perfections, which we do so admire and extol in <hi>His.</hi> So that to pursue our own Perfection and Happiness, is to Glorifie God according to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and intention; who requires us to Glorifie <hi>him</hi> for no other purpose, but that thereby we may Glorifie <hi>our selves.</hi> And indeed <hi>our</hi> Happiness is <hi>Gods</hi> Glory, even as <hi>all</hi> other worthy <hi>Effects</hi> are the Glory of their <hi>Causes.</hi> Tis <hi>He</hi> that gives being to it, and consequently <hi>He</hi> that is glorified by it. It being nothing but the resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his own Almighty Goodness, or his own out-stretched Rays shining back upon Himself. And therefore <hi>we</hi> aim at Gods glory just as <hi>He himself</hi> doth, when we aim to be as happy as He would have us, that is, when we pursue Heaven and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with his Infinite Goodness, whose great design is to advance us to that blessed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which we shall Glorifie him for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106959:20"/>
ever, and be Everlasting Monuments of his overflowing Benignity. So that whether we call our last End <hi>Heaven,</hi> or the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> it is all but one and the same thing; since by obtaining Heaven, we shall Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him according to his own <hi>Design</hi> and <hi>Intention.</hi> And this, I think, may suffice to shew, what is the true ultimate <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life.</hi> But then</p>
               <p n="2">II. IT will be yet farther necessary for our clearing the way to the Design in hand, to enquire what <hi>Kind</hi> of <hi>Happiness</hi> this is; Which when we understand, we shall be the better able to comprehend what <hi>Duties</hi> or <hi>Means</hi> are necessary for the obtaining it. And this Enquiry will be easily resolved, by considering the Nature of <hi>Those</hi> for whom it was prepared and intended. For all <hi>Happiness</hi> consists in the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Exercise</hi> of the Faculties of Nature, about Objects that are suitable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. There is indeed a <hi>privative</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, which is nothing but <hi>Indolence</hi> or <hi>freedom</hi> from <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>misery</hi>; and this consists not so much in the <hi>Exercise,</hi> as in the <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>quiet</hi> of the Faculties. And herein the soft and restive <hi>Epicureans</hi> placed the whole Happiness of a Man: In which I confess, they would not be very much mistaken, if there were no happiness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106959:21"/>
to a Man beyond that Animal and Sensual one, in which the Disciples of this <hi>Atheistical Philosopher</hi> placed their chief Good. For the greatest part of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Sense indeed are merely <hi>Privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Misery, and short Reprieves from the Griefs and Troubles of a wretched Life. For what else is our <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Rest,</hi> but only the removal of our <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Weariness?</hi> which being removed, the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is presently over, and then we grow weary again of our <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Ease</hi>; till <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Weariness</hi> return and sweeten them, and gives them a fresh and new relish. For when we are weary of <hi>Rest,</hi> we are fain to recreate our selves with <hi>Action,</hi> and when we are weary of <hi>Action,</hi> to refresh our selves with <hi>Rest,</hi> and so round again still in the same Circle. Thus the greatest part of the pleasure of <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> consists in asswaging the pain of our <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirst.</hi> For when <hi>this</hi> is over, you see the pleasure ceases, and till it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again, every fresh morsel is but a new load to a tired Digestion. So that in short, the greatest part of those <hi>sensual Felicities</hi> which we do here enjoy, are only short in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissions of the <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>uneasinesses</hi> of a wretched Life. But if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Happiness</hi> belonging to a Man, but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106959:21"/>
what consists in not being sensible of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,</hi> it were much more desirable to be a <hi>Stone</hi> than a <hi>Man,</hi> and the only way for him to be perfectly Happy, would be, to deprive himself of all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Perception.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TIS true, That which is <hi>positive</hi> in our Happiness can never be perfectly injoyed by us, without a perfect <hi>Indolence</hi> and <hi>Insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi> of <hi>Pain</hi>; it being impossible for us to have a <hi>perfect sense</hi> of any thing, whilst we have the least touch or feeling of its <hi>Contrary.</hi> But were <hi>Happiness</hi> nothing else but a <hi>non-perception</hi> of <hi>Misery,</hi> it would have no <hi>positive</hi> Essence or Reality of its own, which is directly contrary to all humane Experience. For we plainly feel, that our <hi>Happiness</hi> hath in it, not only a <hi>Rest</hi> from <hi>Evil,</hi> but a <hi>grateful Motion</hi> to <hi>Good,</hi> and that as our <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> consists in an <hi>acute</hi> and <hi>sensible perception</hi> of such things as are most ungrateful to our Natures; so <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> or <hi>Satisfaction</hi> consists in a <hi>vigorous perception</hi> of the contrary. So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>the not being miserable</hi> (which is not so properly an <hi>Essential Part</hi> of Happiness, as a necessary <hi>Disposition</hi> to it, without which the Faculties of our Natures will be indisposed to relish and perceive it) there is a <hi>positive Happiness</hi> which (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) consists in a <hi>constant free</hi> and <hi>vigorous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106959:22"/>
Exercise</hi> of the Faculties about such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as are most convenient and suitable to their Natures. For <hi>Happiness</hi> in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral includes <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi> both which are necessarily included in <hi>such</hi> an Exercise of the Faculties. For <hi>then</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are <hi>Perfect, when</hi> they are <hi>freely, constantly</hi> and <hi>vigorously</hi> imployed about such objects, as are most congruous to their several natures; when they are recovered from all <hi>indispositions,</hi> whether <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>moral,</hi> to those proper motions and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for which they were framed; and do freely, constantly, and without any clog or interruption direct all their courses towards such Objects as are their natural Centers. And <hi>then</hi> the Faculties are most <hi>pleas'd</hi> and <hi>delighted</hi> too, <hi>when</hi> they are most vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercised about that which is most sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them; when they are not only determined to such Objects as are most agreable to their Natures, but do also act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and exert themselves towards them with the greatest <hi>Sprightliness</hi> and <hi>Vigour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE things I thought meet to premise concerning <hi>Happiness</hi> in the <hi>General,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very needful to the clearer resolution of the present Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> Wherein consists the <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Happiness</hi> of a <hi>Man.</hi> In short therefore, the proper <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106959:22"/>
                  <hi>Happiness</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> considered as a <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being,</hi> consists in the <hi>constant, free,</hi> and <hi>sprightful</hi> Exercise of his Faculties about such Objects as are most convenient to his <hi>rational Nature,</hi> which consisting wholly of <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> that is, of a Faculty of <hi>Knowing</hi> and a Faculty of <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> the most suitable Objects of it are such as are most worthy to be <hi>known,</hi> and most worthy to be <hi>chosen.</hi> When therefore the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> is always <hi>vigorously</hi> exercised in seeing and contemplating the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and excellent <hi>Truths,</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>vigorously</hi> employed in chusing and embracing the most desirable <hi>Goods,</hi> then is the whole Rational Nature <hi>Happy.</hi> Now if you cast abroad your thoughts over the whole extent of <hi>Being</hi>; you will presently find that there is nothing in it so worthy to be <hi>known</hi> and <hi>chosen</hi> as <hi>God</hi>; whose Power being the source and fountain of all <hi>Truth,</hi> that is, of all that either <hi>is</hi> or is <hi>possible,</hi> and whose Nature being the subject of all <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Perfection,</hi> wherein it originally resides, and from whence'tis derived to all the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creation; you must upon these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts necessarily allow <hi>Him,</hi> to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely the most worthy Object in all the World of <hi>Beings,</hi> for our <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> to <hi>contemplate,</hi> and our <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>chuse.</hi> And if
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106959:23"/>
so, then the very Life and Quintessence of the <hi>Heaven</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> considered as a <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Being,</hi> must needs consist in a close and intimate <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God, and a Free and Uncontroverted <hi>Choice</hi> of Him.</p>
               <p>BUT that we may more fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Nature of this <hi>Happiness,</hi> it will be needful that we should more distinctly explain, what these <hi>two</hi> Essential <hi>Acts</hi> of it do import, and what <hi>Happiness</hi> is included in them. And</p>
               <p n="1">I. THE <hi>Happiness</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> consists in a free and intimate <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God, For our <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> hath naturally as strong an Appetite to <hi>Truth,</hi> as our <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> hath to <hi>Food,</hi> and as grateful a relish of it, when it hath once discovered it, as an <hi>Hungry-man</hi> hath of a <hi>pleasant morsel.</hi> And though in this life its <hi>Appetite</hi> is many times <hi>pall'd</hi> and <hi>deadned,</hi> partly through the <hi>difficulty</hi> of <hi>knowing,</hi> occasioned either by the natural <hi>indispositions</hi> of its Organs, or the inveterate <hi>prejudices</hi> of a bad Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and partly by being continually employed in <hi>secular cares</hi> and <hi>pursuits,</hi> which do perpetually <hi>divert,</hi> and so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <hi>wean</hi> it from its natural inclination to <hi>Truth:</hi> Yet when we go from this World, and leave these causes behind us, which give such a check to its <hi>Appetite,</hi> doubtless its

of God; that is in <hi>chusing</hi> him for the Rule and Pattern of our <hi>Natures,</hi> and for the object of our <hi>Love, Adoration</hi> and <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>; all which, (as I shall shew hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) are <hi>Beatifical Acts,</hi> and do abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contribute to the <hi>Happiness</hi> of <hi>Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures.</hi> For <hi>Happiness,</hi> (as hath been premised) consists not in <hi>Rest,</hi> but in <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and there is no <hi>Motion</hi> can contribute to the <hi>Happiness</hi> of any Being but what is suitable to its own Nature.

have most of <hi>Sense</hi> in them, so is the <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi> with those that have most of <hi>Reason</hi> in them.

And this is the cause why men <hi>now</hi> find so little Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in these most <hi>Rational</hi> Acts of <hi>Godliness</hi>; because by their own <hi>bad customs</hi> they have rendered themselves <hi>averse,</hi> or at least very <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> to them, which necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily renders us <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>listless</hi> in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of them, and consequently causes them to go off with <hi>little gust,</hi> if not with an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful relish.</hi> But even in this <hi>imperfect state</hi> we find by experience, that the more our <hi>corrupted nature</hi> discharges and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdens it self of those <hi>vicious indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

which do so <hi>cramp</hi> and <hi>arrest</hi> it in these its <hi>Heavenly operations,</hi> the more it is <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> still and <hi>delighted</hi> in them; Yea, and that when it is so far inured to a <hi>Godly Life</hi> as to be able to practise the several <hi>vertues</hi> of it, but with the same degree of <hi>activity</hi> and <hi>vigour</hi> as 'twas wont to do its most <hi>belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Lusts,</hi> it is unspeakably more <hi>pleased</hi> and <hi>satisfied,</hi> and finds more <hi>Sweetness</hi> by a thousand degrees, in its <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Adoration, Obedience</hi> and <hi>Imitation of God,</hi> than ever it did in the highest relishes of <hi>Epicurism</hi> and <hi>Sensuality</hi>; that the more perfectly we <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Adore,</hi> &amp;c. the more of <hi>Heaven</hi> we tast in these <hi>Blessed Acts,</hi> and that, when by a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> practice of them we have once rendered them <hi>natural</hi> to us, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy such an <hi>Heaven upon Earth</hi> in the <hi>easie, free</hi> and <hi>vigorous exercise</hi> of them, as we would not exchange for all the Pleasures and Felicities which the World can afford us. And yet, God knows, the most perfect state of <hi>Godliness</hi> which we attain to <hi>here,</hi> hath so many degrees of <hi>imperfection</hi> in it, and in this we are so disturbed and interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>bodily Indispositions,</hi> and the <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>necessities</hi> of this present Life, that from the <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> which results from it here, we can hardly <hi>guess</hi> at those <hi>ravishing Felicities</hi> which will spring out of it <hi>hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

               <p>SUPPOSE we then a Society of <hi>Rational Beings</hi> placed in such a State, wherein they have an Object of <hi>infinite Perfections</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

before them, and no Evil from <hi>without</hi> or <hi>within</hi> to check or divert them from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting <hi>all their Powers</hi> upon him in the most <hi>reasonable Actions:</hi> Suppose them now to be moving with <hi>unspeakable vigour</hi> and <hi>agility,</hi> like so many <hi>ever-, living Orbs</hi> about this their <hi>everlasting Center</hi>; to be as full of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to him as ever their <hi>Hearts</hi> can <hi>hold</hi>; to be <hi>copying</hi> his <hi>Perfections,</hi> and <hi>adoring</hi> his <hi>Excellencies</hi> with an uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Alacrity,</hi> and breathing forth themselves to him in <hi>chearful Praises</hi> and <hi>Rapturous Halelujahs</hi>; in a word, to be exercising themselves about him to their utmost <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> in all those <hi>blessed Offices</hi> which <hi>his</hi> Nature and <hi>their</hi> Relation to him call for: Suppose, I say, <hi>all this,</hi> and you have before ye that which is the very <hi>top</hi> and <hi>flower</hi> of the <hi>Heaven</hi> of a <hi>reasonable Creature</hi>; who in this <hi>blessed state</hi> is fixed, as it were in his own proper <hi>Element,</hi> where without any <hi>let</hi> or <hi>distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,</hi> he freely <hi>moves</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> according to his most <hi>natural Tendence</hi> and <hi>Inclination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND now by this time I think it is clear enough, that the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>principal Part</hi> of the <hi>Heaven</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> considered as a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Creature,</hi> consists in <hi>Knowing</hi> and <hi>Chusing</hi> of God. But besides <hi>this,</hi> there are other blessed <hi>Ingredients</hi> of Heaven; the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106959:27"/>
                  <hi>principal</hi> whereof is, the Knowing and Chusing <hi>those</hi> that are <hi>most like</hi> unto God; namely, the <hi>blessed Jesus</hi> in his <hi>Human Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> who are <hi>all</hi> in their several Measures and Degrees the express and lively <hi>Images</hi> of God. And therefore if to Know and Chuse God be the <hi>supreme</hi> Felicity of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then doubtless the <hi>next</hi> to <hi>that</hi> is, to <hi>Know</hi> and be <hi>Acquainted</hi> with these blessed <hi>Images</hi> of him, and freely to <hi>chuse</hi> their <hi>Company</hi> and <hi>Conversation,</hi> and be entirely <hi>united</hi> to them in <hi>Affection</hi>; without which it would be no Felicity to dwell in the <hi>same place</hi> with them. For to <hi>co-habit</hi> with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus and with Saints and Angels, and not be <hi>acquainted with,</hi> and <hi>united to</hi> them in <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> would be rather a <hi>Burden</hi> than a <hi>Pleasure.</hi> The Happiness therefore of being in their <hi>Society,</hi> consists in <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Chusing</hi> them. And this is every where implied, where our being with <hi>them</hi> is mentioned as a part of our Heaven. Thus 1 Thes. iv.17. to <hi>be ever with the Lord,</hi> is the same thing with being <hi>ever in Heaven</hi>; but then 'tis to be ever with him upon <hi>Choice</hi>; for so those words imply, Phil. i.23. <hi>I desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far better.</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is mentioned by the Apostle as a

                  <hi>dear Priviledge</hi> of our being Members of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> whereby we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to the Society of <hi>Holy Myriads of Angels, of the general assembly of the Church of the first-born, of God the Judge of all, of the Spirits of Just men made perfect, and of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the Mediator of the New Covenant,</hi> Heb. xii.22, 23, 24. And indeed this must needs be an <hi>inestimable Happiness,</hi> not only to <hi>co-habit,</hi> but be <hi>acquainted with,</hi> and in Heart and Will <hi>united</hi> to this Blessed and Glorious Company. For what Soul that has any <hi>Spark</hi> of Cordial Love to <hi>Jesus,</hi> the <hi>best Friend</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> that ever was; any <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remembrance</hi> of what he <hi>did</hi> and <hi>suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> for our sakes; would not esteem it a <hi>mighty Felicity</hi> to be admitted into his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> and to be an <hi>Eye-witness</hi> of the happy Change of his past <hi>woful</hi> Circumstances? To see him that was so <hi>cruelly treated,</hi> so barbarously <hi>vilified, tortured,</hi> and <hi>butchered</hi> for our sakes, <hi>raised</hi> to the highest pitch of Splendour and Dignity, to be <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of all the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Heaven, to be <hi>worshipped</hi> and <hi>celebrated</hi> throughout all the noble <hi>Choir</hi> of <hi>Archangels</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Spirits of just men made Perfect?</hi> Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly methinks had I only the Priviledge to <hi>look</hi> in and <hi>see</hi> my dear and blessed Lord <hi>surrounded</hi> with all this <hi>Circle</hi> of Glories,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106959:28"/>
it would be a most <hi>Heavenly Consolation</hi> to me, though I were sure never to <hi>partake</hi> of it. The very <hi>Communion</hi> I should have in the <hi>Joyes</hi> of my <hi>Master,</hi> would be a kind of Heaven at <hi>Second-hand</hi> to me, and my Soul would be wondrous Happy by <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing</hi> with him in his <hi>Felicity</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</hi> But Oh! when that <hi>Blessed Person</hi> shall not only <hi>permit</hi> me to <hi>see</hi> his Glory, but <hi>introduce</hi> me into it, and make me <hi>Partaker</hi> of it; when I shall not only <hi>behold</hi> his <hi>Beloved Face,</hi> but be <hi>admitted</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>Dear Conversation,</hi> and <hi>dwell</hi> in his <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Embraces</hi> for ever; when I shall hear him record the <hi>wondrous Adventures</hi> of his Love, through how many <hi>woful Stages</hi> he passed to rescue me from <hi>Misery,</hi> and make me <hi>Happy,</hi> and in the mean time shall have a most <hi>ravishing Feeling</hi> of <hi>that</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; how will my Heart <hi>spring</hi> with <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>burn</hi> with <hi>Love,</hi> and my Mouth <hi>o'reflow</hi> with <hi>Praises</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> to him!</p>
               <p>AND as our Acquaintance with, and Choice of the <hi>Blessed Jesus</hi> must needs contribute vastly to our Happiness; so must also (though not in so <hi>high</hi> a Degree) our being <hi>intimately acquainted</hi> and <hi>united</hi> with <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels.</hi> Who being not only endowed with large and comprehensive <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> but also with perfect <hi>Good-nature</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106959:29"/>
and most generous <hi>Charity,</hi> must needs make <hi>excellent Company.</hi> For as their <hi>Goodness</hi> cannot but render their Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion infinitely <hi>free</hi> and <hi>benign,</hi> so their great <hi>Knowledge</hi> must necessarily render it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>delightful.</hi> And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so <hi>Knowing</hi> as they are, they must needs be supposed to <hi>understand</hi> all the <hi>wise Arts</hi> of <hi>Endearment</hi>; and being so <hi>Good,</hi> they must be also supposed to be continually <hi>practising</hi> them. And if so, what a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Conversation</hi> must theirs be, the <hi>Scope</hi> whereof is the most <hi>glorious Knowledge,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> whereof is the most <hi>perfect Friendship?</hi> Who would not be willing to leave a <hi>foolish, froward,</hi> and <hi>ill-natured</hi> World, for the blessed Society of these <hi>wise Friends</hi> and <hi>perfect Lovers?</hi> And what a Felicity must it be to spend an Eternity in such a <hi>noble</hi> Conversation! Where we shall hear the <hi>deep Philosophy</hi> of Heaven com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with <hi>mutual Freedom</hi> in the Wise and Amicable Discourses of <hi>Angels</hi> and of <hi>Glorified Spirits</hi>; who without any <hi>Reserve,</hi> or <hi>affectation of Mystery,</hi> without <hi>Passion</hi> or <hi>Interest</hi> or <hi>peevish Contention</hi> for <hi>Victory,</hi> do <hi>freely</hi> Philosophize, and <hi>mutually</hi> impart the treasures of each others <hi>Knowledge.</hi> For since all <hi>Saints</hi> there are great <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and all <hi>Philosophers</hi> perfect <hi>Saints,</hi> we must
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106959:29"/>
needs suppose <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Goodness, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to be equally intermingled throughout all their Conversation; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, what can be imagined more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!

Saviour calls <hi>Paradise, Luke</hi> xxiii.43. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> 2 Cor. xii.2. both which in the phrase of that Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak it to be a place of <hi>unspeakable Glory</hi>; for so the Jews do commonly call this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Seat the <hi>Third</hi> or <hi>Angel-bearing</hi> Region of Heaven, by which they denote it to be the <hi>Palace</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> of the whole World, where his most glorious Courtiers do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side; and they also call it <hi>Paradise,</hi> in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Earthly Paradise of <hi>Eden</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as <hi>that</hi> was the <hi>Garden</hi> of this <hi>lower</hi> World, so <hi>this</hi> is of the <hi>whole Creation.</hi> And though we have no <hi>exact description</hi> of this place in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and that perhaps because no humane language can describe it; yet since God hath chosen it for the <hi>Everlasting Theatre</hi> of Bliss and Happiness, we may thence reasonably conclude that he hath most <hi>exquisitely furnished</hi> it with all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations that are requisite to a most <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>blissful</hi> Life.</p>
               <p>BESIDES which also there is the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Duration</hi> of it, which is another great Accession to its Happiness. That such is the Nature of its Enjoyments, as that they do not, like all other Pleasures, <hi>spend</hi> and <hi>wast</hi> in the Fruition; that though it will be always <hi>feeding</hi> our Faculties with new Delights, yet it will never be <hi>exhausted,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106959:30"/>
but be always <hi>equally,</hi> because <hi>infinitely,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from a Period. So that its Happiness consisting of an <hi>infinite Variety</hi> of Pleasure extended to an <hi>infinite Duration,</hi> it will be impossible for those that enjoy it to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>cloyd</hi> with the repetition of it, or <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented</hi> with the fear of losing it.</p>
               <p>BUT these <hi>Two last</hi> I only mention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not so properly belong to our present Argument; which is only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Nature of <hi>Heaven</hi> so far as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the right understanding of the Nature of those <hi>Means</hi> by which it is to be attained.</p>
               <p>NOW from what hath been said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this great <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> these <hi>Two</hi> things are to be inferr'd concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. THAT the <hi>main</hi> of Heaven consists not so much in any <hi>outward</hi> Possession, as in an <hi>inward</hi> State and Temper. For though Heaven be doubtless a most <hi>glorious Place,</hi> and all its blessed <hi>Inhabitants</hi> do possess and hold it by an everlasting <hi>Tenure</hi>; yet 'tis a great mistake to imagine that the main hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of Heaven consists in living for ever in a <hi>glorious Place,</hi> which separated from all the rest of Heaven would be but a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>hungry</hi> kind of Happiness. For <hi>Life</hi> is no otherwise a Happiness, than as it is the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106959:31"/>
Principle of all our <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>grateful Perceptions</hi>; and if we could live for ever without <hi>perceiving,</hi> it would be the same thing to us, as if we were nothing but a Company of everlasting <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi>; and what great matter would it signifie to live for ever in a <hi>glorious Place,</hi> unless we could be for ever affected by it with a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful sense</hi> and <hi>perception</hi>; which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, because all <hi>delightful sense</hi> (as hath already been proved) arises out of the <hi>vigorous exercise</hi> of our Faculties about such Objects as are suitable to them; but what can there be in the most <hi>glorious Place</hi> so suitable to a <hi>Rational Mind</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> as to keep them for ever <hi>vigorously</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and exercised about it? It may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for a while employ the <hi>Mind</hi> in an eager Contemplation of its <hi>new</hi> and <hi>surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> Beauties; but how soon would the Mind dis-relish it, were it to be its <hi>only</hi> Entertainment for Eternity? And as for the <hi>Will,</hi> what would a fine Place signifie to it, if it were not replenished with such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as are suitable to its own <hi>Options?</hi> And indeed there is nothing that can <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly</hi> gratifie a Rational Mind and Will, but what has in it such an <hi>Infinity</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> as is everlastingly <hi>Knowable,</hi> and such an <hi>Infinity</hi> of <hi>Goodness</hi> as is everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106959:31"/>
                  <hi>Desireable</hi>; or, which is the same thing, nothing but what hath <hi>Truth</hi> enough in it for the one to be vigorously <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating</hi> for ever, and nothing but what hath <hi>Goodness</hi> enough in it for the other to be as vigorously <hi>loving, adoring,</hi> and <hi>imitating</hi> for ever. And such an Infinitude of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> is no where to be found but in <hi>God.</hi> But <hi>God,</hi> as well as the <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Duration</hi> of Heaven, being an Object that is <hi>external</hi> to us, neither is, nor can be a Happiness to us unless we <hi>act upon</hi> him, and <hi>freely exercise</hi> our Faculties about him; unless we <hi>Know</hi> him, and <hi>Love</hi> him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that <hi>that</hi> which <hi>Felicitates</hi> all, is our own <hi>Internal Act</hi>; 'tis by <hi>this</hi> that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Heaven, and perceive all the Pleasures of it. 'Tis not by <hi>being in Heaven</hi> that men are constituted Happy, but by <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously exerting</hi> their Faculties upon the Heavenly Objects. For without <hi>this,</hi> to be <hi>in</hi> Heaven or <hi>out of it</hi> would be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indifferent to us. The Happiness of Heaven therefore consists in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Heavenly Action</hi>; in being so <hi>attempered</hi> and <hi>connaturaliz'd</hi> to the Objects of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as to be always <hi>acting upon,</hi> and <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employing</hi> our Faculties about them. For as there is no Pleasure in Acting <hi>coldly</hi> upon <hi>suitable</hi> Objects, so there is Pain and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106959:32"/>
Trouble in acting <hi>vigorously</hi> upon <hi>unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> ones. And therefore to make <hi>Heaven</hi> it self a <hi>Happiness</hi> to us, tis necessary not only that we should act vigorously upon the Objects of it, but that we should <hi>so</hi> act from a <hi>suitableness</hi> of Temper to them. That we should contemplate God, submit to his Will, adore and imitate his Perfections from a <hi>God-like Temper</hi> and <hi>Disposition.</hi> For otherwise these Acts will be <hi>Penances</hi> instead of <hi>Pleasures</hi> to us; and the more <hi>intensely</hi> we exert them, the more <hi>painful</hi> they will be. And if we were in Heaven, all that Heavenly Exercise in which the Happiness of it consists, would be but a <hi>Torment</hi> and <hi>Vexation</hi> to us, unless we had a <hi>Heavenly Temper.</hi> For as the Parts of <hi>Matter</hi> can never <hi>rest,</hi> but do move about in a perpetual <hi>Whirl-pool,</hi> till they are <hi>hit</hi> into a place or <hi>Interstice</hi> that is of the same <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> with them; so there is nothing can <hi>rest</hi> in Heaven but what is <hi>Heavenly.</hi> All that is otherwise <hi>rebounds</hi> and <hi>flyes off</hi> of its own accord, and can never <hi>acquiesce</hi> there, till 'tis of the same Form, and Temper, and Disposition with it. From hence therefore it's evident, that the Happiness of a Man in <hi>Heaven</hi> consists not so much in the <hi>outward</hi> Glory of the Place, as in the <hi>inward</hi> State of his own
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106959:32"/>
Mind, which from a <hi>suitableness</hi> of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Heavenly Objects doth always <hi>freely</hi> employ and exercise its Faculties about them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. THAT the <hi>Heavenly State</hi> is nothing else but the <hi>Perfection</hi> of all <hi>Heavenly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> For it hath been already proved, That Heaven consists in a clear and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and a free and unconte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted <hi>Choice</hi> of God, and of those Blessed Beings that resemble him; and <hi>these Two</hi> comprehend <hi>all</hi> Heavenly Virtue. So that the difference between the state of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> is not in <hi>Kind,</hi> but in <hi>Degree.</hi> For Grace is the <hi>Seed</hi> of Glory, and Glory is the <hi>Maturity</hi> of Grace. 'Tis <hi>Knowledge</hi> exalted above all <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Prejudice,</hi> above all <hi>Difficulty</hi> or <hi>Obscurity</hi> of Apprehension; 'tis <hi>Love</hi> strained from all <hi>repugnancies</hi> of Flesh and Spirit, and refined into a pure <hi>Celestial flame</hi>; tis <hi>Obedience</hi> to and <hi>Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of God, perfectly separated from all <hi>sinful</hi> Defects, and freed from the <hi>Clog</hi> of <hi>counter-striving</hi> Principles; 'tis <hi>Adoration</hi> of and <hi>Dependency</hi> upon him, without the least degree of <hi>Indisposition</hi> or <hi>Despondency</hi>; in a word, 'tis a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>uncontrolled</hi> Motion of all the Heavenly Virtues together, in which they are every one most <hi>vigorously</hi> exerted, without the least <hi>Check</hi> or <hi>Impediment.</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106959:33"/>
This therefore being the <hi>State of Heaven,</hi> as is evident from what hath been discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it hence follows, that the main diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> is only <hi>Gradual</hi>; that Virtue is the <hi>Beginning</hi> of Heaven, and Heaven is the <hi>Perfection</hi> of Virtue. And if so, then as the <hi>lowest</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of true Virtue is a <hi>step</hi> Heaven-wards, so every <hi>farther</hi> Degree is a <hi>nearer Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> towards the Heavenly state. So that as we <hi>grow</hi> in Grace, and proceed from <hi>one</hi> Degree of Virtue to <hi>another,</hi> we draw <hi>nearer</hi> and <hi>nearer</hi> to that blessed Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which we shall be all <hi>pure Virtue</hi> without any <hi>sinful</hi> Alloy or Intermixture. And this is the true <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of HEAVEN.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Concerning the <hi>Means</hi> by which this Great <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life</hi> is to be attained.</head>
               <p>IT is to be considered that the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Christianity being to <hi>advance</hi> our Natures to such a sublime Degree of Purity and Perfection as is requisite to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate us for the Enjoyment of a <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bliss</hi>; it was necessitated in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, to strain our Duty to a greater <hi>Height</hi> than any <hi>preceding</hi> Law had done before it. For the <hi>End</hi> of all Gods <hi>Laws</hi> is the <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> of his <hi>Subjects</hi>; and therefore that they may be effectual <hi>Means</hi> to promote this <hi>End,</hi> it's necessary that the <hi>Duties</hi> they enjoyn should be such as the <hi>Nature</hi> of our Happiness requires. Now in the first state of our Nature, which was that of <hi>Innocence,</hi> we seem to have been design'd only for a <hi>Terrestrial Paradise,</hi> that is, to enjoy a <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, Animal Happiness</hi> in a state of <hi>Earthly Immortality.</hi> And to serve and promote this end, God gave us the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which seems to have been nothing else but only <hi>Right Reason</hi> dictating to us what is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106959:34"/>
necessary to be done in order to an <hi>Earthly Happiness.</hi> And accordingly the Duties of this Law were of a much <hi>lower</hi> strain than the Duties of Christianity; they being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Means and Instruments of a much <hi>lower</hi> Happiness. For in this our <hi>Earthly</hi> and <hi>Animal</hi> State, Right Reason could require nothing of us but what was subservient to our <hi>Earthly</hi> and <hi>Animal</hi> Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and nothing could be <hi>good</hi> for us but what tended thereunto, nothing <hi>evil</hi> but what did obstruct and oppose it. But now that our Happiness is placed in <hi>another</hi> World, and in such <hi>vastly different</hi> Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from those of a Terrestrial Paradise, we must proceed upon <hi>other</hi> Principles. For now every Action is Good or Bad, Wise or Foolish, as it <hi>serves</hi> or <hi>hinders</hi> our Happiness in the World to come. And therefore it is highly reasonable that now we should live at a <hi>different rate,</hi> than what we were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to in that <hi>Animal</hi> state wherein we were first Created; that we should submit our <hi>earthly</hi> to our <hi>heavenly</hi> Interest, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Joyes and Pleasures of <hi>this</hi> Life, whensoever they stand in competition with the spiritual Felicities of the <hi>Life to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now</hi> we are no longer to look upon this World as our <hi>Native Countrey,</hi> but as a <hi>Foreign Land</hi>; and so we are to reckon our
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106959:34"/>
selves <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims</hi> upon Earth; and accordingly to use the conveniencies of this Life as <hi>strangers</hi> do their <hi>Inns,</hi> not to abide or take up our habitation in them, but only to bait and away, and refresh our selves that so we may be the better enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Journey to the Eternal World. For the scene of our <hi>Happiness</hi> being shifted from an Earthly Immortality, to an Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and consequently the Happiness it self being now much more <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> than it would have been, had it continued Earthly; it's necessary that our Nature should be <hi>exalted</hi> with it, and that we should be <hi>raised</hi> as high above the <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of mere Earthly Creatures, as <hi>that</hi> is above the <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> of an Earthly Happiness; otherwise it will be impossible for us to relish and enjoy it.</p>
               <p>NOW every Agent hath need of <hi>more</hi> or <hi>fewer</hi> Means proportionably as he is <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off,</hi> or <hi>nearer</hi> to the End he drives at. As for instance, the Husbandman that hath a <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>fruitful</hi> Soil to sow his Seed in, is <hi>nearer</hi> to the attaining of a good Harvest, than he that hath a <hi>barren</hi> or <hi>stony</hi> Ground to work upon; and therefore hath much <hi>less</hi> to do. For whereas the latter, before he can plough and sow, must manure his Ground and gather out the stones of it; the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106959:35"/>
former needs only plough up the fertile Earth, and cast his Seed into it. Or to come closer to the case in hand; a man that is meerly <hi>ignorant</hi> is in a much <hi>nearer</hi> capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of true Knowledge, than he whose mind is altogether prejudiced with <hi>erroneous</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and therefore needs much <hi>fewer</hi> Helps and Means to attain it. For <hi>his</hi> mind being perfectly disengaged, is like a fair Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, on which as there is nothing <hi>writ,</hi> so there is nothing to be <hi>blotted out</hi>; So that all that he hath to do, is to inquire after and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truth when it is fairly proposed to him. But as for the <hi>Prejudiced</hi> man, he hath a great deal to <hi>unlearn</hi> before he can be capable of Learning; a great many <hi>false</hi> Principles to be expunged, before ever the <hi>true</hi> Notions of Things can be imprinted on his Understanding.</p>
               <p>IF therfore we would take a true account of all those <hi>Means</hi> that are necessary to our attaining of Heaven, we must consider what a <hi>vast distance</hi> we are from it in this corrupt and degenerate state of our Nature. If we were in a state of <hi>Indifference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Virtue and Vice we should be much <hi>nearer</hi> Heaven than we are; For then, as we should be without those <hi>Heavenly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> in the free Exercise whereof the state of Heaven consists; so we should be without
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106959:35"/>
all that <hi>Repugnance</hi> and <hi>Aversation</hi> to them which renders them so difficultly attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and our Nature being already in an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> would by the least <hi>over-weight</hi> of Motive be presently inclined to Virtue and Goodness. But, alas! in this <hi>corrupt</hi> state whereinto we are sunk, our Nature runs Evil-wards with a very strong and prevailing <hi>Biass</hi>; and is not only <hi>void</hi> of virtue, but <hi>averse</hi> to it. And this sets us at a far greater distance from the blessed <hi>End</hi> of our Religion than otherwise we should be. For every Degree of vicious Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in us, is a <hi>Remove</hi> from Heaven, a <hi>Descent</hi> from that Perfection of virtue wherein the Heavenly Blessedness consists. And if so, how <hi>remote</hi> from Heaven are the Generality of men in the Beginning of their Progress thither; when to their natural <hi>Corruption</hi> they have superadded by their sinful Courses so many inordinate <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and inveterate sinful <hi>Habits</hi>; when by a long series of wicked Actions, they have raised and blown up their Concupiscence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such raging <hi>flames</hi> of Lust as <hi>generally</hi> they do! And being thus far gone back from our <hi>End,</hi> there are sundry <hi>Means,</hi> which otherwise would have been perfectly <hi>needless</hi> and <hi>superfluous,</hi> that are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> thereunto. For
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106959:36"/>
had we begun our Progress towards Heaven from a state of <hi>Indifferency</hi> between virtue and vice, we had had no more to do but to practise those several virtues of Religion of which the Heavenly Life and state consists; to <hi>love,</hi> and to <hi>contemplate,</hi> to <hi>adore,</hi> and to <hi>obey</hi> God, and behave our selves <hi>justly</hi> and <hi>charitably</hi> towards one another; all which would have been so <hi>easie,</hi> that we should have had no occasion of any <hi>Instrumental Duties</hi> to facilitate them to us. Whereas now starting Heaven-wards, as we general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, from a most <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>degenerate</hi> State, there are sundry <hi>other</hi> Means which we must use as <hi>Instruments</hi> that are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our acquiring and persevering in the virtues of the Heavenly Life; to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the Difficulties of, and killing the vicious Aversations of our Natures against them: All which would have been <hi>needless,</hi> at least in a great measure, had not our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture been so <hi>depraved</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> as it is.</p>
               <p>SO that as the case <hi>now</hi> stands with us, there are <hi>Two</hi> sorts of Means that are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to our obtaining of Heaven; The first is the Practice of those <hi>Heavenly virtues,</hi> in the Perfection whereof consists the state of Heaven; the Second is the Practice of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Instrumental Duties,</hi> which are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our acquiring those Heavenly virtues,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106959:36"/>
and overcoming the Difficulties of them. The first sort of these are the <hi>proximate</hi> Means, those which directly and immediatly respect the Great and Ultimate End; The second the more <hi>remote</hi> Means, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly respect those Means that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly respect the <hi>End.</hi> The first is like the Art of the <hi>Builder</hi> which immediatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the House; The second like the Art of the <hi>Smith</hi> which immediately respects the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> of Building.</p>
               <p n="1">I. ONE sort of Means necessary to the obtaining of Heaven, and that which more <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> respects it, is the <hi>Practice</hi> of those <hi>Virtues</hi> in the Perfection whereof the Heavenly Life consists. For we find by experience that all Heavenly Virtues are to be acquired and perfected only by <hi>Practice</hi>; That as all <hi>bad</hi> Dispositions are acquired and improved into Habits by <hi>bad</hi> Practices and Customs, so are all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>virtuous</hi> ones by the <hi>contrary</hi> Practices. For <hi>Religion</hi> proceeds in the methods of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and carries us on from the <hi>Acts</hi> to the <hi>Dispositions,</hi> and from the <hi>Dispositions</hi> to the <hi>Habits</hi> of Virtue. And by the same method the <hi>Divine Grace</hi> which accompanies Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, does ordinarily work its Effects upon the spirits of men, not by an <hi>instantaneous Infusion</hi> of virtuous Habits into the Will,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106959:37"/>
but by persuading them to the <hi>Practice</hi> of those <hi>Virtues</hi> that are contrary to their <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Habits,</hi> and to persist in the practice of them till they have mortified <hi>those</hi> Habits, and throughly habituated and inured them selves to <hi>these.</hi> So that the Grace of God is like a <hi>Graff,</hi> which though it is put into a <hi>Stock</hi> which is quite of <hi>another</hi> kind, doth yet make use of the Faculties and Juices of the Stock, and so by cooperating with them, converts it by degrees into its <hi>own</hi> Nature. And this is exactly agreeable to the common experience of men, who in the beginning of their Reformation are so far from acting ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously from <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Inclination,</hi> that it goes against the very <hi>Grain</hi> of their Nature, and they would much rather return to their vicious courses, if they were not chased and pursued by the <hi>Terrours</hi> of an <hi>awakened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>; and when afterwards they come to act upon a more <hi>ingenuous</hi> Principle, yet still they find in themselves a great <hi>Averseness</hi> and <hi>Reluctancy</hi> to it, and 'tis a great while usually ere they arrive to a <hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Facility</hi> of acting <hi>virtuously.</hi> But then by <hi>perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in the practice of Virtue they are more and more <hi>inclined</hi> and <hi>disposed</hi> to it, and so by degrees it becomes <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> to them. If therefore we would ever arrive to that Perfection of Virtue which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106959:37"/>
State implies, it must be by the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of Virtue, by a continual <hi>training</hi> and <hi>exercising</hi> our selves in all the parts of the Heavenly Life, which by degrees will <hi>wear off</hi> the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of it, and <hi>adapt</hi> and <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarize</hi> our Nature to it. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And we may as reasonably expect to commence <hi>learned</hi> without <hi>study,</hi> as <hi>virtuous</hi> without the <hi>Practice</hi> of Virtue. Since therefore the Formal Happiness of our reasonable Natures consists in the Perfection of all the Heavenly virtues, and 'tis by these alone that we can rellish and enjoy the blissful Objects of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it hence follows, that the <hi>Practice</hi> of those virtues is the most <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> Means to obtain the <hi>Blessed End</hi> of our Religion.

Now the <hi>Carnal Mind,</hi> (which includes all that is repugnant to the <hi>Heavenly Virtues</hi>) the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, is <hi>Enmity against God, Rom.</hi> vii.17. that is, hath a natural <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi> to the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. And this <hi>Antipathy</hi> the same <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, is founded in our <hi>wicked works, Coloss.</hi> i.21.

               <p n="2">II. THIS Religion of the <hi>Means</hi> is of no farther Use as to the <hi>perfecting</hi> our Natures, than as it is instrumental to produce and promote in us those <hi>Heavenly Virtues</hi> which are implied in the Religion of the <hi>End.</hi> For doubtless to be a Perfect Man is to live up to the Highest Principle of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is <hi>Reason</hi>; and till we are once released from the slavery of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> and all our Powers of Action are so subdued to this <hi>superiour</hi> Principle as to be wholly <hi>regulated</hi> by it, and we <hi>chuse</hi> and <hi>refuse,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hate,</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> according as right Reason di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects,

And till we are in some measure, arrived to this, our Nature is so far from being <hi>perfect,</hi> that it is the most <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>confused</hi> thing in the whole world; A more undistinguished <hi>Chaos,</hi> where <hi>Frigida cum Calidis,</hi> Sense and Reason, Brute and Man, are shuffled together without any order, like a confounded Heap of Ruines. And therefore as for this Religion of the <hi>Means,</hi> it will be altogether insignificant to the <hi>Perfection</hi> of our Natures, unless by the Practice of it we do acquire a Habit of acting according to the <hi>Law</hi> of our <hi>Reason,</hi> which <hi>Habit</hi> includes all <hi>Heavenly Virtue.</hi> For constantly to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>do</hi> what is best and most reasonable, is the very Crown and Perfection of every <hi>reasonable Nature</hi>; and therefore so far as our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> our <hi>Sorrow</hi> for <hi>Sin</hi> and the other <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentals</hi> of Religion, promote this <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Habit</hi> in us, so <hi>far</hi> are they <hi>perfective</hi> of our Nature, and no <hi>farther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. THIS Religion of the <hi>Means</hi> is of no farther Use to Us as to the <hi>Entitling</hi> us
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106959:40"/>
to Heaven, than as it is productive of those <hi>Heavenly Virtues</hi> which the Religion of the <hi>End</hi> implies. For our <hi>Title</hi> to Heaven depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wholly upon Gods <hi>Promise,</hi> must imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately result from our performance of those <hi>Conditions</hi> upon which he hath <hi>promised</hi> it; which till we have done, we can have no more <hi>Claim</hi> or <hi>Title</hi> to it than if he had never <hi>promised</hi> it at all. But the sole Condition upon which he hath <hi>promised</hi> it, is Universal Righteousness and Goodness; for so, <hi>without Holiness,</hi> we are assured that <hi>no man shall see God</hi>; and <hi>Mat.</hi> v. our Saviour intails all the Beatitudes of Heaven upon those Heavenly Virtues of <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Heart, Benignity</hi> of <hi>Temper,</hi> &amp;c. So also <hi>Rom.</hi> ii.7. the Promise of Eternal Life is limited to our <hi>Patient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in well doing.</hi> And that we may know before hand what to trust to, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour plainly tells us, that <hi>not every one that cries Lord, Lord,</hi> that makes solemn <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Addresses</hi> to me, <hi>shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven</hi>; And <hi>this is the will of God,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>even our Sanctification</hi>; that is, our being purged from all Impurities of Flesh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and inspired with all Heavenly Virtues. And the Apostle expresly enumerates those Virtues upon which our Entrance into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106959:41"/>
Life is promised, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Add to your Faith Virtue, and to Virtue Knowledge, and to Knowledge Temperance, and to Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Patience, and to Patience Godliness, and to Godliness Brotherly Kindness, and to Brotherly Kindness Charity; For if these things be in you, and abound,</hi> saith he, <hi>they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the Knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> that is, That you shall receive the proper <hi>Fruit</hi> of that <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which is Eternal Life; for thus <hi>v.</hi> xi. he goes on, <hi>For so,</hi> or upon this Condition, <hi>an Entrance shall be ministred unto you abundantly into the everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi> So that unless our Faith purifies our Hearts, and works by Love; unless our sorrow for Sin works in us Repentance, or a Change of Mind; unless our Prayers raise in us Divine and Heavenly Affections, that is, unless we so practise the <hi>Duties</hi> of the Religion of the <hi>Means</hi> as thereby to acquire the <hi>Virtues</hi> of the Religion of the <hi>End,</hi> it will be all as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant to our <hi>Title</hi> to Heaven, as the most <hi>indifferent</hi> Actions in the World.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. THIS Religion of the <hi>Means</hi> is of no farther Use to the <hi>disposing</hi> and <hi>qualifying</hi> us for Heaven, than as it is an effectual means of the Religion of the <hi>End.</hi> Which is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly distinct Consideration from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106959:41"/>
For it would be no advantage to us to have a <hi>Right</hi> to Heaven, unless we were antecedently <hi>qualified</hi> and <hi>disposed</hi> for it. Because Pleasure which is a Relative thing, implies a <hi>Correspondence</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Object</hi> and the <hi>Faculty</hi> that tasts and enjoys it. But in the <hi>Temper</hi> of every wicked Mind there is a strong <hi>Antipathy</hi> to the Pleasures of Heaven; which being all <hi>chast,</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>spiritual,</hi> can never agree with the vitiated Palat of a <hi>base</hi> and <hi>dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> Soul. For what concord can there be between a <hi>spiteful</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Spirit and the Fountain of all <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi>; between a <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>carnalized</hi> one, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands no other Pleasures but only those of the Flesh, and those <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Virgin</hi> Spirits that neither <hi>eat</hi> nor <hi>drink,</hi> but live for ever upon <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Contemplation?</hi> Certainly till our Mind is <hi>contempered</hi> to the Heavenly State, and we are of the same <hi>disposition</hi> with God, and Angels, and Saints, there is no Pleasure in Heaven that can be agreeable to us. For, as for the <hi>main,</hi> we shall be of the same <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Disposition</hi> when we come into the <hi>other</hi> World, as we are when we leave <hi>this</hi>; it being unimaginable how a <hi>Total Change</hi> should be wrought in <hi>us</hi> meerly by passing out of <hi>one</hi> world into <hi>another:</hi> And
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106959:42"/>
therefore as in <hi>this</hi> world it is <hi>Likeness</hi> that does <hi>congregate</hi> and <hi>associate</hi> Beings together, so doubtless it is in the <hi>other</hi> too. So that if we carry with us <hi>thither</hi> our <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>devillish</hi> dispositions (as we shall doubtless do, unless we <hi>subdue</hi> and <hi>mortifie</hi> them here) there will be no Company fit for us to asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with, but only the <hi>devillish</hi> and <hi>damned</hi> Ghosts of wicked men, with whom our wretched Spirits being already <hi>joined,</hi> by a likeness of Nature, will mingle themselves, as soon as ever they are excommunicated from the society of Mortals. For whither should they flock, but to the Birds of their own Feather; with whom should they asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, but with those <hi>malignant</hi> Spirits to whom they are already joined by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Nature? So that supposing that when they land in Eternity, it were left to their own Liberty to go to <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> into the society of the <hi>Blessed</hi> or the <hi>Damned</hi>; it is plain that Heaven would be no Place for them, that the Air of that <hi>bright</hi> Region of <hi>eternal Day</hi> would never agree with their <hi>black</hi> and <hi>hellish</hi> Natures. For, alas! what should they do among those <hi>Blessed Beings</hi> that inhabit it, to whose God-like Natures, Divine Contemplations, and Heavenly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, they have so great a <hi>Repugnancy</hi> and <hi>Aversation?</hi> So that besides the having
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106959:42"/>
a <hi>Right</hi> to Heaven, it is necessary to our enjoying it that we shoule be antecedently <hi>disposed</hi> and <hi>qualified</hi> for it. And it being thus, God hath been graciously pleased to to make those very Virtues the <hi>Conditions</hi> of our <hi>Right</hi> to Heaven which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Dispositions</hi> and <hi>Qualifications</hi> of our Spirits for it; that so with one and the same Labour we might <hi>entitle</hi> our selves to, and <hi>qualifie</hi> our selves to enjoy it.</p>
               <p>NOW (as we shewed you before) the <hi>Condition</hi> of our <hi>Right</hi> to Heaven, is our <hi>practising</hi> those Heavenly Virtues which are implied in the Religion of the <hi>End</hi>; and as the Religion of the <hi>Means</hi> no further <hi>entitles</hi> us to Heaven than as it produces and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes in us those Heavenly Virtues, so it no further <hi>qualifies</hi> us for it. For when the Soul goes into Eternity, it leaves the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Means</hi> behind it, and carries nothing with it but only those Heavenly <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Dispositions</hi> which it here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by those <hi>Means.</hi> For as for <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Consideration, Hearing</hi> of Gods <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Receiving</hi> of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. they are all but Scaffolds to that Heavenly Building of inward <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi>; and when this is once finished for Eternity, then must those Scaffolds all go down, as things of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Use or Necessity. But as for the <hi>Graces</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:106959:43"/>
of the <hi>Mind,</hi> they are to stand for ever, to be the Receptacles and Habitations of all Heavenly Pleasure. And hence the Apostle tells us, that of those three Christian Graces, Faith, Hope and Charity, <hi>Charity</hi> (which in the largest sense of it comprehends <hi>all</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Virtue) is the greatest; because the Two former, being but <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> shall cease in Heaven, and be swallowed up for ever in <hi>Vision</hi> and <hi>Enjoyment</hi>; but <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> saith he, <hi>never faileth,</hi> 1 Cor. xii.13.</p>
               <p>BY all which it is apparent that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Means</hi> is no further useful to us, than as it is apt to produce and promote in us those Heavenly Virtues, the practice of which is the most <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> Means to the ultimate <hi>End</hi> of a Christian. Wherefore as a man may <hi>knock</hi> and <hi>file,</hi> and yet be no <hi>Mechanick,</hi> though the <hi>Hammer</hi> and <hi>File</hi> with which he does it are very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tools to the making of any curious <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine</hi>; so a man may <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. and yet be a very Bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the blessed Trade of a Heavenly Life. For though it is true, these are excellent <hi>Means</hi> of Heavenly Living, yet as the Art of the <hi>Mechanick</hi> consists not barely in <hi>using</hi> his Tools but in using them in <hi>such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> as is necessary to the perfecting and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing his Work; So the Art of one
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106959:43"/>
that pretends to the Heavenly Life, consists not barely in <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> &amp;c. but in using these <hi>Means</hi> with that Religious <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Artifice</hi> which is necessary to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them effectually subservient to the <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND thus I have given a general Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Means</hi> which are necessary to our obtaining of Heaven, and which, as I have shewed, are either such as tend more <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> to it, or such as more <hi>remotely</hi> respect it. The first is the Practice of those <hi>Heavenly Virtues</hi> in the Perfection whereof the Happiness of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven consists; the second is the Practising of those <hi>Duties</hi> which are necessary to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring and perfecting those <hi>Heavenly Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi> And of these two Parts consists the whole <hi>Christian Life</hi>; which takes in not only all those <hi>Virtues</hi> that are to be practised by us in Heaven, but also all those <hi>Duties,</hi> by which we are to overcome the Difficulty of those Virtues, and to acquire and perfect them. The first of these, for Distinction sake, we will call the <hi>Heavenly Part</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> it being that part of it which we shall lead in <hi>Heaven,</hi> after we have learnt it here upon <hi>Earth</hi>; The second I shall call the <hi>Warfaring</hi> or <hi>Militant Part</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Life,</hi> which is peculiar to our <hi>Earthly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106959:44"/>
State,</hi> wherein we are to contend and strive with the manifold Difficulties which attend us in the Exercise of those <hi>Heavenly Virtues.</hi> Both which, I conceive, are implied in those words of the Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> i.27. <hi>Only let your Conversation be as becometh the Gospel</hi>; where the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

For, to live as <hi>Cittizens</hi> of Heaven, is, First to live like those who are the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of Heaven, to imitate their blessed <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> in doing the Will of God upon <hi>Earth,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:106959:45"/>
as it is done by them in <hi>Heaven</hi>; and this takes in the <hi>Practice</hi> of all those <hi>Heavenly Virtues</hi> of which the Religion of the <hi>End</hi> consists: Secondly, To live like those that have a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <hi>Citizenship</hi> in Heaven, that are <hi>entitled</hi> by Covenant to the <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> and <hi>Immunities</hi> of it, but are as yet to win its <hi>Possession</hi> by a continual <hi>Warfare</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> with those manifold Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Oppositions which lie in our way to it; and this takes in the <hi>Practice</hi> of all those <hi>Duties</hi> in which the Religion of the <hi>Means</hi> consists. So that to live <hi>like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> or <hi>as becomes the Gospel,</hi> is to live in the continual Use of both kinds of the <hi>Means</hi> of Happiness.

Concerning those <hi>Humane Virtues</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a <hi>Man</hi> as he is a <hi>Reasonable Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> shewing that they are all included in the <hi>Heavenly Part</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> and that the Practice of them effectually conduces to our future Happiness.</head>
                  <p>FIRST we will consider Man in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a meer <hi>Rational Animal,</hi> that is compounded of contrary Principles, <hi>viz. Spirit</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> or a <hi>Rational Soul</hi> and <hi>Humane Body</hi>; by which Composition He is, as it were, the Buckle of both Worlds, in whom the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Material</hi> World are <hi>clasped</hi> and <hi>united</hi> together; and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as he does, of both Extreams of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Matter, Angel</hi> and <hi>Brute,</hi> there arise within him from those contrary Natures contrary Propensions, <hi>viz. Rational</hi> and <hi>Sensual,</hi> or <hi>Angelical</hi> and <hi>Brutish</hi>; And in the due Subordination of these, his <hi>Sensual</hi> to his <hi>Rational</hi> Propensions, consists all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Virtue.</p>
                  <p>For his <hi>Reason</hi> being the noblest Principle of his Nature, must be supposed to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in him by God to <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> him, to be an <hi>Eye</hi> to his blind and bruitish
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106959:48"/>
Affections, to <hi>correct</hi> the Errours of his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, to <hi>bound</hi> the Extravagancies of his Appetites, and <hi>regulate</hi> the whole Course of his Actions; so as that he may do nothing that is destructive or injurious to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Frame and Structure of his Nature. But now in this compounded Nature of a Man, there are his <hi>Concupiscible</hi> and <hi>Irascible Affections:</hi> with the first of which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and pursues his <hi>Pleasures</hi>; and with the second, he shuns and avoids his <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>; and there are also <hi>Bodily Appetites,</hi> such as Hunger, Thirst, and Carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence; and together with these a <hi>Self-Esteem</hi> and <hi>Valuation</hi>; all which are the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subjects of his Reason, and indeed the only Subjects upon which it is to exercise its Dominion. So that in the well and ill Government of <hi>these,</hi> consists all <hi>Humane Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice.</hi> To the perfect well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning therefore of a mans self, there are Five things indispensably necessary:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That He should impartially consult his <hi>Reason</hi> what is absolutely best for him, and by what means it is best attainable, and and then <hi>constantly</hi> pursue what it proposes and directs him to. For so far as he is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this, he casts off the Government of his <hi>Reason.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:106959:48"/>2. That he should proportion his <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscible</hi> Affections to the just value which his <hi>Reason</hi> sets upon those things which he <hi>affects</hi>: For every Degree of Affection which exceeds the merit of Things, is <hi>irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> and consequently injurious to our <hi>Rational Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he should not suffer his <hi>Irascible</hi> Affections to exceed those Evils and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which he would <hi>avoid</hi>; For if he doth, <hi>they</hi> will prove greater Evils to him than <hi>those</hi> Evils or Dangers are which raise and provoke them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he should not indulge his <hi>Bodily Appetites</hi> to the Hurt and Prejudice of his <hi>Rational Nature:</hi> For if he does, he will violate the <hi>nobler,</hi> for the sake of the <hi>viler</hi> Part of Himself. And</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That upon the whole, he should main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>Modest Opinion</hi> of himself; and not think better of his own <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of himself than it deserves: For by so doing, he will be apt to overlook his own <hi>Misgovernments,</hi> and so incapacitate himself for any farther <hi>Improvements.</hi> And in these five Particulars consists all that Virtue which belongs to a man, considered meerly in the Capacity of a <hi>Rational Animal</hi>:

                     </list>
All which, as I shall shew, are Essential Parts of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> and such as do effectually contribute to our <hi>Heavenly Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. PRUDENCE. And this is the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Ground-Work</hi> of all other Virtues; 'Tis this that gives <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> to all our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that proposes the <hi>Ends,</hi> and prescribes the <hi>Measures</hi> of our Actions. For <hi>Prudence</hi> consists in being guided and directed by <hi>Right Reason,</hi> as it proposes to us the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest <hi>Ends,</hi> and directs us to the fittest and most effectual <hi>Means</hi> of obtaining them. So that to live <hi>prudently,</hi> is to live in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Exercise</hi> of our <hi>Reason,</hi> and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pursuing such <hi>Ends</hi> as <hi>Right Reason</hi> proposes, by such <hi>Means</hi> as <hi>Right Reason</hi> directs us to, which is the proper Business of all the Virtues of Religion. And hence <hi>Religion</hi> in the Scripture is frequently called by the Name of <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Prudence; The Fear of the Lord that is Wisdom,</hi> saith <hi>Job, and to depart from Evil that is Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Job xxviii.28. And, <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psal.</hi> cxi.10. where <hi>the Fear of the Lord</hi> comprehends all the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106959:49"/>
are therefore <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>prudent,</hi> because they are the fittest <hi>Means</hi> to those worthiest <hi>Ends</hi> which <hi>Right Reason</hi> proposes. So that to exercise our Reason in the <hi>Search</hi> and <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> of what is absolutely best for us, and to follow our Reason in the <hi>Pursuit</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> of what it discovers to be so, is that virtue of <hi>Prudence</hi> whereunto we stand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged as we are <hi>Rational Animals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR our Reason being the <hi>noblest</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our Nature, That by which we are raised above the Level of <hi>Brutes,</hi> yea, by which we are allied to <hi>Angels,</hi> and do bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon <hi>God himself,</hi> ought upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be submitted to, as the supream <hi>Regent</hi> and <hi>Directress</hi> of all our other Powers and to be looked upon as the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>Guide</hi> of all our <hi>Animal Motions.</hi> And when to gratifie our <hi>sensual</hi> Appetites, or <hi>unreasonable</hi> Passions we either <hi>neglect</hi> those <hi>Ends</hi> which our Reason proposes to us, or <hi>pursue</hi> them by such <hi>Means</hi> as our Reason disallows of, we reverse the very order of our Natures, and tread <hi>Antipodes</hi> to our selves; And while we do so, it is impossible we should be happy, either <hi>here,</hi> or <hi>hereafter.</hi> For every thing, you see, is diseased while it is in an <hi>unnatural</hi> State and Condition, while its Parts are <hi>displaced,</hi> or put into a <hi>Disorder,</hi> or <hi>distorted</hi> into an unnatural Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106959:50"/>
And so it is with a Man, who while he preserves his Faculties in their natural <hi>Station</hi> and <hi>Subordination</hi> to each other, while he keeps his <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Appetites</hi> in subjection to his <hi>Will,</hi> and his <hi>Will</hi> to his <hi>Reason,</hi> he is <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>quiet,</hi> and enjoys within himself perpetual <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>; But when once he <hi>breaks</hi> this order, and suffers his Passions or his Appetites to <hi>usurp</hi> the Place of his Reason; to <hi>impose</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Ends</hi> to it, or <hi>prescribe</hi> contrary <hi>Means</hi>; his Faculties, like <hi>disjointed</hi> Members, are in perpetual <hi>Anguish</hi> and <hi>Anxiety.</hi> And hence it is that in the Course of a wicked Life, we feel such restless Contentions between our <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Flesh,</hi> between the <hi>Law in our Minds,</hi> and the <hi>Law in our Members</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Nature is out of <hi>Tune,</hi> and its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are <hi>displaced</hi> and <hi>disordered,</hi> and that sovereign Principle of <hi>Reason</hi> which should <hi>sway</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> us, is <hi>deposed,</hi> and made a <hi>Vassal</hi> to our <hi>Appetites</hi> and <hi>Passions.</hi> For in all our evil Courses we <hi>chuse</hi> and <hi>refuse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> not as <hi>Reason</hi> directs us, but as <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> biasses us; and our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son having nothing to do in all this <hi>Brutish Scene</hi> of Action, either sleeps it out, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out minding or regarding, or else sits by as an idle Spectator of it, and only <hi>censures</hi> and <hi>condemns</hi> it. And it is this that causes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106959:50"/>
all that <hi>Tumult</hi> and <hi>Contest</hi> that is in our Natures; and till, by the Exercise of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> our Faculties are reduced, and set in order again, our <hi>Mind</hi> will be like our <hi>Body,</hi> while its Bones are out of Joint, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <hi>restless</hi> and <hi>unquiet.</hi> And therefore to remove this great Indisposition of our Nature to Happiness, <hi>Prudence</hi> is required of us, as one of the principal <hi>Virtues</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly Part</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR thus our Saviour injoins that we should be <hi>wise as Serpents</hi> as well as <hi>harmless as Doves,</hi> Mat. x.16. which though it be here prescribed in a <hi>particular</hi> Case only, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Persecution</hi>; yet since the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it extends to <hi>all other</hi> Cases, and it is fit we should be Prudent in <hi>all</hi> our Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings as well as in <hi>suffering Persecution,</hi> it is upon that account equivalent to an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Command. So also <hi>Ephes.</hi> v.15. <hi>See that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise</hi>; i. e. In the whole Course of your Actions take heed that ye follow the Guidance of your <hi>Reason,</hi> and do not suffer your selves to be seduced by your blind <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,</hi> which are meer <hi>Ignes Fatui,</hi> or the <hi>Guides</hi> of <hi>Fools.</hi> And accordingly the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle prays for his Christian <hi>Colossians, That they might be filled with the Knowledge of God in all Wisdom and spiritual Vnderstanding,</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:106959:51"/>
Coloss. i.9. <hi>i. e.</hi> That they might have such a knowledge of Gods will as might render them truly <hi>prudent,</hi> and cause them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the best <hi>Ends</hi> by the best <hi>Means.</hi> And though this Virtue seldom occurs in the new Testament under its own Name, yet, as in the above-named Places it is expressed by <hi>Wisdom,</hi> so it is elsewhere by <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as particularly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi.6. where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Ministers of the Church to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themselves such by several Virtues, and particularly by <hi>Pureness,</hi> i. e. <hi>Continence,</hi> and by <hi>Knowledge,</hi> i. e. by <hi>Prudence</hi>; For, besides that <hi>Knowledge</hi> as it signifies an <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Divine Things,</hi> was not a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> in the Apostles, but a <hi>Gift</hi> of God, and so not proper to be enumerated amongst these <hi>Virtues</hi>; there is hardly any Account to be given why the Apostle should place <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the midst of so many <hi>Moral Virtues,</hi> if he did not thereby mean the <hi>Virtue</hi> of <hi>Prudence,</hi> which is, as it were, the <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> of all the other <hi>Virtues.</hi> So again, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i.6. where he bids us add to <hi>Faith, Virtue,</hi> i. e. Fortitude, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of Mind; <hi>and to Virtue Knowledge, and to Knowledge Temperance</hi>; By <hi>Knowledge</hi> it is highly probable he means <hi>Prudence,</hi> because he places it in the midst of those <hi>two Virtues</hi> which border nearest upon <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:106959:51"/>NOW that the Practice of <hi>this Virtue</hi> is a most proper and effectual <hi>Means</hi> of our <hi>Everlasting Happiness,</hi> is evident from hence, Because the Practice of it is a constant Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of <hi>Reason.</hi> For to act <hi>prudently</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is to follow the <hi>best</hi> Reason; to aim at Heaven, which is the <hi>best</hi> End, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our Actions thither by the <hi>best</hi> Rules; 'Tis to consult what is <hi>best</hi> for our selves, and how it may be <hi>most effectually</hi> obtained. In a word, it is to <hi>intend</hi> the <hi>chiefest Good</hi> above All, and to <hi>level</hi> our Lives and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons most <hi>directly</hi> towards it. This is <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Prudence</hi> in the <hi>General</hi>; and as for those <hi>Particulars</hi> of it, which we are obliged to exercise in the several <hi>States, Relations,</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> wherein we are placed, they all consist in doing what is most <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> with respect to that Great and Blessed End.</p>
                  <p>FOR by living in the continual Practice of <hi>Religious Prudence,</hi> we shall by degrees habituate our selves to a Life of <hi>Reason,</hi> and shake off that drowsie Charm of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> which hangs upon our Minds, and renders our Faculties so <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>unactive</hi>; And having disused our selves a while to obey their <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>imperious</hi> Dictates, our Reason will reassume its Throne in us, and direct all our Aims and Endeavours to what
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106959:52"/>
is <hi>Fittest</hi> and most <hi>Reasonable.</hi> For we being finite and limited Beings, cannot operate <hi>divers</hi> ways with <hi>equal</hi> vigour <hi>at once</hi>; and our Faculties are made in such a <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>aequilibrious</hi> order, that proportionably as the one does <hi>increase</hi> in Activity, the others always <hi>decay</hi>; And so accordingly as we <hi>abate</hi> in the strength of our <hi>Brutish,</hi> we we shall <hi>improve</hi> in the vigour of our <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Faculties. But to act suitably to their Natures being the End of all our <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Powers of Action,</hi> the God of Nature to excite them thereto, has founded all their <hi>Pleasure</hi> in the <hi>vigorous</hi> Exercise of them upon <hi>suitable</hi> Objects. Since therefore our <hi>Reason</hi> is the best and noblest of all <hi>Powers of Action,</hi> to be sure the greatest <hi>Pleasure</hi> we are capable of, must spring out of the Exercise of our <hi>Reason.</hi> Wherefore since <hi>Prudence</hi> consists in the <hi>Vse</hi> of our <hi>Reason,</hi> the Practice thereof must needs effectually contribute to our <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Happiness.</hi> For <hi>Vse</hi> and <hi>Exercise</hi> will mightily <hi>streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> our Reason, and render it not only more <hi>apprehensive</hi> of what is fit and reasonable; but also more <hi>persuasive</hi> and <hi>prevalent</hi>; and when once it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into a <hi>prevailing Principle</hi> of Action, and hath acquired not only <hi>Skill</hi> enough to <hi>prescribe</hi> what is Right to us; but also
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106959:52"/>
                     <hi>Power</hi> enough to <hi>persuade</hi> us to comply with its prescriptions; to <hi>chuse</hi> and <hi>refuse,</hi> to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hate,</hi> to <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear, desire</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> and regulate all our Actions by its Laws and Dictates, then are we entring upon our <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Happiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR that which makes us <hi>unhappy</hi> is that our sinful and ureasonable Affections do so <hi>hamper</hi> and <hi>intangle</hi> us, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>freely</hi> exercise our Faculties upon such Objects as are most suitable to them; that our Minds and Wills are so <hi>fettered</hi> by our vicious Inclinations, that we cannot exert them upon that which is most worthy to be <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Chosen,</hi> without a great deal of <hi>Difficulty</hi> and <hi>Distraction.</hi> But now under the Conduct of our <hi>Reason</hi> our Faculties will by Degrees recover their <hi>Freedom,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage themselves from those vicious <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances</hi> which do so <hi>clog</hi> and <hi>interrupt</hi> them in all their Rational Motions. And when this is throughly effected, we are in full Possession of the <hi>Heavenly State,</hi> which, as I have shewed, consists in the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Exercise of our Rational Faculties upon the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>worthiest</hi> Objects. For when once our <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Appetites</hi> are perfectly subdued to our <hi>Reason,</hi> all our Rational Faculties will be <hi>free,</hi> and every one will move towards its proper Object
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106959:53"/>
without any <hi>Lett</hi> or <hi>Hindrance</hi>; our <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> will be swallowed up in a fixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the <hi>sublimest Truth,</hi> our <hi>Wills,</hi> intirely resigned to the Choice and Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>truest Good</hi>; our <hi>Affections,</hi> unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably devoted to the Love and Fruition of the most <hi>excellent Beauty and Perfection</hi>; and in this consists the Happy State of <hi>Heaven</hi>; So that to live <hi>prudently,</hi> or, which is the same, to govern our selves by our <hi>best Reason,</hi> is both a <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> means of attaining to the <hi>Heavenly State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. ANOTHER Virtue which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to a Man considered meerly as a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Animal</hi> is MODERATION; which consists in proportioning our <hi>Concupiscible</hi> Affections to the just worth and value of Things; so as neither to spend our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <hi>too prodigally</hi> upon Trifles, nor yet be <hi>over-sparing</hi> or <hi>niggardly</hi> of them to real and substantial Goods. But to <hi>love, desire,</hi> and <hi>expect</hi> things more or less, according to the Estimate which our best and most impartial <hi>Reason</hi> makes of their Worth and Goodness. For he that affects things more than in the Esteem of Reason they deserve, affects them <hi>irrationally,</hi> and regulates his Passion by his <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>extravagant</hi> Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and not by his <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Judgment.</hi> And while men do thus neglect their <hi>Reason,</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:106959:53"/>
and accustome themselves to <hi>desire,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>affect</hi> without it, they necessarily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able themselves to enjoy a <hi>Rational Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> For, besides that their Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties being thus <hi>laid by</hi> and <hi>unemployed,</hi> will naturally contract <hi>Rust,</hi> and grow eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day more <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>restive</hi>; Besides that their <hi>unexercised</hi> Reason will <hi>melt away</hi> in Sloth and Idleness, and all its vital Powers <hi>freeze</hi> for want of motion, and, like stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water, <hi>stagnate</hi> and gather mire, and by degrees <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>putrefie,</hi> till at last it will be impossible to revive them to the <hi>vigorous Exercise</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> wherein their Pleasure and Happiness consists; Besides this, I say, by habituating our selves to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect things <hi>irrationally,</hi> i. e. to love the <hi>least</hi> Goods <hi>most,</hi> and the <hi>greatest least</hi>; we shall disable our selves from enjoying <hi>any</hi> Goods, but only such as cannot make us happy. For he that loves any Good more than it is worth, can never be happy in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it; because he <hi>thinks</hi> there is more in it than he <hi>finds,</hi> and so is always <hi>disappointed</hi> in the <hi>Fruition</hi> of it. And the <hi>Grief</hi> of being disappointed of what he <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,</hi> does commonly countervail the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of what he <hi>finds</hi> and <hi>enjoys.</hi> While he is in the <hi>pursuit</hi> of any Good which he <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately</hi> dotes upon, he is <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative</hi>;

he swells with <hi>Phantastick</hi> Joys, and juggles himself into <hi>Expectations,</hi> that are as large and boundless as his <hi>Desires</hi>; But when once he is <hi>seized</hi> of it, and finds how vastly the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> falls short of his <hi>Expectation,</hi> his <hi>Pleasure</hi> is presently lost in his <hi>Disappointment,</hi> and so he remains as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied as ever. And thus if he were to spend an Eternity in such <hi>Pursuits</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,</hi> his Life would be nothing but an Everlasting Succession of <hi>Expectations</hi> and <hi>Disappointments.</hi> So that all <hi>inordinate</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection destroys its own <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and necessarily renders us by so many Degrees miserable, as it exceeds the real worth and value of Things.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES which also it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that all these <hi>lesser</hi> Goods which are the Objects of our <hi>Extravagant</hi> Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are things which we must ere long be for ever <hi>deprived</hi> of: For the <hi>lesser</hi> Goods are those, which are only good for the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> Part of us, that is, for our <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Animal Life</hi>; the proper Goods whereof are the <hi>Outward, Sensitive</hi> Enjoyments of this World; All which, when we leave this world we must leave <hi>for ever,</hi> and go away into Eternity, with nothing about us, but only the Good, or Bad <hi>Dispositions</hi> of our Souls, So that if our Soul be <hi>carnalized</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:106959:55"/>
through our <hi>immoderate</hi> Affection to the things of this World, we shall carry that <hi>Affection</hi> with us, but leave the things which we thus vehemently <hi>affect</hi> behind us for ever. For that which is the <hi>prevailing Temper</hi> of Souls in this Life will doubtless be so in the other too; and so far is that of the Poet true
<q>
                        <l>—Quae gratia currûm</l>
                        <l>Armorúmque fuit vivis, quae cura nitentes</l>
                        <l>Pascere equos, eadem sequitur tellure repostos.</l>
                     </q>
For though the coming into the other world will questionless <hi>improve</hi> those Souls which are <hi>really good</hi> before, yet it is not to be imagined how it should <hi>create</hi> those <hi>good</hi> who are <hi>habitually bad</hi>; and if we <hi>retain</hi> in the <hi>other</hi> world that <hi>Prevailing Affection</hi> to these sensitive Goods which we <hi>contracted</hi> in <hi>this,</hi> it must necessarily render us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably <hi>miserable</hi> there. For every <hi>Lust</hi> the Soul carries into the other world, will, by being eternally separated from its <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> convert into an <hi>Hopeless Desire,</hi> and upon that account grow more <hi>furious</hi> and <hi>impatient.</hi> For of all the Torments of the mind I know none that is comparable to that of an outragious <hi>Desire</hi> joined with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair</hi> of Satisfaction; which is just the case
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106959:56"/>
of sensual and worldly minded Souls in the other Life where they are full of <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>unrebated</hi> Desires, and like starving men that are shut up between two Dead Walls are tormented with a <hi>fierce,</hi> but <hi>hopeless</hi> Hunger, which having nothing else to feed on, preys and quarries on <hi>themselves</hi>; and in this desolate condition they are forced to wander to and fro, tormented with a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Rage,</hi> an Hungry and Unsatisfied <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,</hi> craving food, but neither <hi>finding,</hi> nor <hi>expecting</hi> any; and so in unexpressible An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish they pine away a long Eternity. And though they might find content and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, could they but <hi>divert</hi> their Affections another way, and reconcile them to the Heavenly Enjoyments; yet being irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably preingaged to sensual Goods, they have no Savour or Relish of any thing else, but are like <hi>Feaverish Tongues</hi> that disgust and nauseate the most grateful Liquors by reason of their own <hi>overflowing Gall.</hi> So impossible is it for men to be happy, either here or hereafter, so long as their Affections to the lesser Goods of this World do so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately exceed the worth and value of them.</p>
                  <p>ONE Essential Part therefore of the <hi>Christian Life</hi> which is the Great <hi>Means</hi> of our Happiness, is the Virtue of <hi>Moderation</hi>;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106959:56"/>
the peculiar Office whereof is to bound our <hi>Concupiscible</hi> Affections, and proportion them to the Intrinsic Worth of those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Goods which we <hi>affect</hi> and <hi>desire.</hi> For though the word <hi>Moderation,</hi> according to our present Acceptation of it, be no where to be found in the New Testament, yet the Virtue expressed by it, is frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined; as particularly where we are forbid to <hi>set our Affections upon the Things of the Earth,</hi> Col. iii.2. <hi>To love the World or the Things that are in the World,</hi> 1 John ii.15. Which Phrases are not to be so understood as if we were not to love the Enjoyments of the World <hi>at all</hi>; for they are the Blessings of God, and such as he has proposed to us in his Promises as the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements</hi> of our Obedience; and to be sure, he would never encourage us to obey him by the Hope of such Rewards as are <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for us to desire and love: The meaning therefore of these Prohibitions is, that we should so <hi>moderate</hi> our Affections to the world, as not to permit them to exceed the Real Worth and Value of its Enjoyments. For it is not <hi>simply</hi> our loving it, but our loving it to <hi>such a Degree</hi> as is inconsistent with our Love of God that is here forbidden; For <hi>he that loveth the world,</hi> saith St. <hi>John, the Love of the Father is not in him,</hi> i. e. he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106959:57"/>
that loves it to such a Degree as to <hi>prefer</hi> the Riches, Honours, and Pleasures of it <hi>before God</hi> and his <hi>Duty</hi> to him, hath no real Love to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> He loves not God <hi>as God,</hi> as the Chiefest Good and Supream Beauty and Perfection. And hence <hi>Covetousness,</hi> which is an immoderate Desire of the world, is called <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Col. iii.5. because it sets the world in the place of God, and gives it that supream Degree of Affection which is only due to him; And this the Apostle there calls <hi>Inordinate Affection,</hi> because it extravagantly exceeds the Intrinsic Worth and Value of its Objects. Wherefore we are strictly enjoined to <hi>take heed and beware of Covetousness,</hi> Luke xii.15. And to <hi>let our Conversation be without Covetousness,</hi> Heb. xiii.5. By all which and sundry other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Prohibitions of the Gospel, the <hi>Moderation</hi> of our <hi>Concupiscible</hi> Affections is made a necessary part of the <hi>Christian Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW that this also mightily contributes to our Acquisition of the <hi>Heavenly Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> is evident, not only from what hath been already said, but also from hence, that till our Affections are thus <hi>moderated,</hi> we can have no Savour or Relish of the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyments.</hi> For in this corrupt State of our Nature, we generally <hi>understand</hi> by our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106959:57"/>
                     <hi>Affections,</hi> which, like <hi>coloured Glass,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present all Objects to us in their own <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Complexion.</hi> When therefore a mans <hi>Affections</hi> are immoderately carried out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards worldly things, they will be sure by Degrees to corrupt and deprave his <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and render him as unfit to judge of divine and spiritual Enjoyments, as a <hi>Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is to be a <hi>Moderatour</hi> in the <hi>Schools.</hi> For when a mans thoughts have been employed another way, and the Delights of <hi>Sense</hi> have for a long while preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied his <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> he will judge things to be <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> according as they <hi>disgust,</hi> or <hi>gratifie</hi> his lower Appetites: And this being the Standard by which he measures things, 'tis impossible he should have any Savour of those <hi>Spiritual Goods</hi> in which the Happiness of Heaven consists. For though in his Nature there is a Tendency to <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pleasures,</hi> yet this he may, and very frequently does, stifle and extinguish by addicting himself wholly to the Delights and Gratifications of his <hi>Sense,</hi> which by degrees will so melt down his <hi>Rational</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations into his <hi>Sensual,</hi> and confound and mingle them with his <hi>Carnal</hi> Appetites, that his <hi>Soul</hi> will wholly sympathize with his <hi>Body,</hi> and have all <hi>Likes</hi> and <hi>Dislikes</hi> in common with it; And there is nothing will
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106959:58"/>
be capable of pleasing the <hi>One</hi> but what does gratifie the unbounded Liquorishness of the <hi>Other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW to such a Soul the spiritual World must needs be a <hi>barren wilderness,</hi> where no Good grows that it can live upon, none but what is nauseous and distastful to its <hi>coarse</hi> and <hi>vitiated</hi> Palate; where there are noble Entertainments indeed for Minds that are <hi>contempered</hi> to them, that have already tasted and experienced them; but not one Drop of Water to cool the Tip of a <hi>Sensual</hi> Tongue, or gratifie the Thirst of a <hi>Carnal</hi> Desire. So that were we admitted to that Heavenly Place where the Blessed dwell, yet unless we had acquired their Heavenly <hi>Disposition</hi> and <hi>Temper,</hi> we could never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate with them in their Pleasures. For so great would be the Antipathy of our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Affections to them, that we should doubtless flie away from them, and rather chuse to be for ever <hi>Insensible,</hi> than be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to an everlasting <hi>Perception</hi> of what is so <hi>ungrateful</hi> to our Natures. So that till we have in some measure moderated our <hi>Concupiscible</hi> Affections, and weaned them from their excessive Dotages upon <hi>sensual</hi> Good, it is impossible we should enjoy the Happiness of Heaven; For such perfect Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites are a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Heaven and a <hi>Carnal</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:106959:58"/>
Mind, that unless This be <hi>spiritualized,</hi> or That be <hi>carnalized,</hi> it is impossible they should ever meet and agree.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. ANOTHER Virtue that belongs to a Man considered meerly as a <hi>Rational Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> is FORTITUDE; which in the largest sense consists in not permitting our <hi>Irascible</hi> Affections to exceed those Evils or Dangers which we seek to repel or avoid; in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Anger,</hi> our <hi>Malice, Envy,</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> in such due subjection as not to let them exceed those Bounds which Reason, and the Nature of Things, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe them. For I do not take <hi>Fortitude</hi> here in the narrow sense of the <hi>Moralists,</hi> as it is a Medium between <hi>Irrational Fear</hi> and <hi>Fool-Hardiness</hi>; but as it is the Rule by which all those <hi>Irascible</hi> Passions in us which arise from the sense of any Evil or Danger, ought to be guided and directed; That by which we are to guard and defend our selves against all those <hi>troublesome</hi> and <hi>disquieting</hi> Impressions which outward Evils and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are apt to make upon our Minds: And in this Latitude <hi>Fortitude</hi> comprehends not only <hi>Courage,</hi> as it is opposed to <hi>Fear</hi>; but also <hi>Gentleness,</hi> as it is opposed to <hi>Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Sufferance,</hi> as it is opposed to <hi>Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; Contentedness,</hi> as it is opposed to <hi>Envy</hi>; and <hi>Meekness,</hi> as it is opposed to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106959:59"/>
                     <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi>; All which are the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>pusillanimous</hi> Minds, that are not able to withstand an Evil, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the least Touch of it without being <hi>startled</hi> and <hi>disordered</hi>; that are so softned with Baseness and Cowardise that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not resist the most gentle Impressions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. For as sick Persons are <hi>offended</hi> with the light of the Sun, and the freshness of the Air, which are highly <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> to such as are well and in health; Even so Persons of weak and feeble minds are easily offended, their Spirits are so tender and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate that they cannot endure the least Air of Evil should blow upon them; and what would be only a <hi>Diversion</hi> to a Couragious Soul, <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>incommodes</hi> Them. And whatsoever Courage such persons may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, it's meerly a Heat and Ferment of their Bloud and Spirits; A Courage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Game-Cocks</hi> and <hi>Mastives</hi> out-vy the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Heroes</hi> of them all. But as to that which is truly Rational and Manly, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in a firm Composedness of Mind in the midst of Evil or Dangerous Accidents, they are the most wretched Cowards in Nature. For the true <hi>Fortitude</hi> of the Mind consists in being hardened against Evil upon <hi>Rational Principles</hi>; in being so fenced and guarded with <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Consideration,</hi> as that no
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106959:59"/>
dolorous Accident from without is able to invade it, or raise any violent Commotions in it; In a word, in having such a constant Power over its <hi>Irascible</hi> Affections, as not to be overprone either to be timorous in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or envious in Want, or impatient in Suffering, or angry at Contempt, or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and revengeful under Injuries and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations. And till we have in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure acquired this Virtue, we can never be happy either here or hereafter.</p>
                  <p>FOR whilst we are in this world, we must expect to be encompassed with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Crouds of Evil Accidents, some or other of which will be always pressing upon and justling against us: So that if our minds are <hi>sore</hi> and <hi>uneasie,</hi> and over-apt to be <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> with Evil, we shall be continually <hi>pained</hi> and <hi>disquieted.</hi> For, whereas were our Minds but <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> all the Evil Accidents that befall us would be but like a Shower of Hail upon the Tiles of a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick-House, which with all its <hi>Clatter</hi> and <hi>Noise</hi> disturbs not the Harmony that is <hi>within</hi>; our being too apt to be moved into Passion by them, <hi>uncovers</hi> our mind to them, and lays it open to the Tempest. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the greatest Hurt which these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Evils do us, is, their <hi>disturbing</hi> our Minds into violent Passions; and this they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106959:60"/>
will never cease doing, till we have through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>fortified</hi> our Reason against them. For if our <hi>Reason</hi> commands not our Passions, to be sure <hi>outward Accidents</hi> will; and while they do so, we are Tenants at will to them for all our Peace and Happiness; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they happen to be <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad,</hi> so must we be sure still to be <hi>Happy</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.</hi> And in this Condition, like a Ship without a Pilot in the midst of a Tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sea, we are the sport of every wind and wave, and know not, till the Event hath determined it, how the next Billow will dispose of us; whether it will dash us against a <hi>Rock,</hi> or drive us into a quiet <hi>Harbour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SO miserable is our Condition <hi>here,</hi> while we are utterly destitute of this Virtue of <hi>Fortitude</hi>; But much more miserable will the want of it necessarily render us <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi> For all those Affections which fall under the Inspection and Government of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> are, in their <hi>Excesses,</hi> naturally vexatious to the Mind, and do always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb and raise Tumults in it. For so <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Impatience</hi> distracts and alienates it from it self, and confounds its Thoughts, and shuffles them together into a heap of wild and disorderly Fancies; so <hi>Malice, Envy,</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> do fill it with anxious biting Thoughts, that like young Vipers gnaw the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106959:60"/>
Womb that bears them, and fret and gall the wretched Mind that forms, and gives them Entertainment. And though in this world we are not so sensible of the mischief which these black and rancorous Passions do us; partly because our sense of them is <hi>abated</hi> with the Intermixture of our Bodily Pleasures; and partly because while we ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as we do, by these unwieldy Organs of Flesh, our Reflexions cannot be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably so <hi>quick,</hi> nor our Passions so <hi>violent,</hi> nor our Perceptions so <hi>brisk</hi> and <hi>exquisite</hi> as they will doubtless be when we are stript into naked Spirits; yet if we go away into the other World with these Affections <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified</hi> in us, they will not only be far more <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>outragious</hi> than now, and we shall not only have a far <hi>quicker</hi> Sense of them than now; but this our sharp sense of them shall be <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>simple,</hi> without any intermixture of Pleasure to soften and allay it. And if so, Good Lord! what exquisite <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Tormentors</hi> will they prove, when an extreme <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Hate, Envy</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> shall be all together, like so many hungry Vultures, preying on our Hearts; and our Mind shall be continually <hi>baited</hi> and <hi>worried</hi> with all the furious Thoughts which these outragious Passions can suggest to us! When with the meagre Eyes of <hi>Envy</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:106959:61"/>
we shall look up towards the Regions of Happiness, and incessantly <hi>pine</hi> and <hi>grieve</hi> at the Felicities of those that inhabit them; when through a sense of our own <hi>Follies,</hi> and of the miserable Effects of them, our <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Impatience</hi> shall be heightned, and boiled up into a <hi>Diabolical Fury</hi>; and when at the same time, an Inveterate <hi>Malice</hi> against all that we converse with, and a fierce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of <hi>Revenging</hi> our selves upon those who have contributed to our Ruine, shall, like a Wolf in our Breasts, be continually gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and feeding upon our Souls, what an insupportable <hi>Hell</hi> shall we be to our selves! Doubtless that <hi>Outward Hell</hi> to which bad Spirits are condemned is very terrible; but I cannot imagine, but that the worst of their Hell is <hi>within</hi> themselves, and that their own Devillish Passions are severer <hi>Furies</hi> to them than all those <hi>Devils</hi> that are without them. For <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Envy, Malice</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> are both the Nature and the Plague of Devils; and though, as Angels, they are the Creatures of God; yet, as Devils, they are the Creatures of these their Devillish <hi>Affections</hi>; they were <hi>these</hi> that transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from Blessed Angels into Cursed Fiends, and could they but once cease to be <hi>envious</hi> and <hi>malicious,</hi> they would cease to be Devils, and turn Blessed Angels again.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106959:61"/>
If then these rancorous Affections have such a malignant Influence as to <hi>blacken</hi> Angels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Devils, and make them the most <hi>miserable</hi> who were once the most <hi>happy</hi> Creatures, how can we ever expect to be happy so long as we indulge and harbour them?</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE to remove this great Impediment of our Happiness, Christianity strictly enjoins us to practise this necessary Virtue of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which consists in the due Regulation of all these our <hi>Irascible</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; in moderating our <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,</hi> suppressing our <hi>Envy,</hi> and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing all our unreasonable <hi>Hatred</hi> and Desire of <hi>Revenge.</hi> For hitherto tend all those Evangelical Precepts which require us to <hi>put away all bitterness and wrath, all cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and evil speaking and malice,</hi> Ephes. iv.31. <hi>to lay aside all malice, and to be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in malice,</hi> 1 Pet. ii.1. 1 Cor. xiv.20. <hi>to be strengthned with all might unto all patience and long suffering,</hi> Coloss. i.11. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly all the Virtues which are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this of <hi>Fortitude</hi> are reckoned among the Fruits of that Blessed Spirit by which we are to be guided and directed, <hi>Gal.</hi> v.22. <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit is peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, and meekness</hi>; all which are nothing but this great Virtue of Fortitude, severally exerting it self upon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106959:62"/>
those several <hi>Irascible</hi> Affections that are in us, and guiding and regulating them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to those Laws and Directions which right Reason severally prescribes them; and setting such Bounds and Limits to each of them as are necessary to the Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of our Rational Natures; That so when Outward Dangers or Evils do excite them, they may not start out into such wild Excesses as to become <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Diseases</hi> to our Minds.</p>
                  <p>NOW how much the Practice of this Virtue conduces to our Heavenly Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is evident from hence, That all the Diseases and Distemperatures which our Mind is capable of, are nothing else but the <hi>Excesses</hi> of its <hi>Concupiscible</hi> and <hi>Irascible</hi> Affections; but its being affected with Good and Evil <hi>beyond</hi> those Limits and Measures which Right Reason prescribes. Did we but love outward Goods according to the value at which true Reason rates them, we should neither be vexed with an <hi>Impatient Desire</hi> of them while we <hi>want,</hi> nor disappointed of our <hi>Expectation</hi> while we <hi>enjoy</hi> them. And when our Desires towards these outward Goods are reduced to that Coolness and Moderation as neither to be <hi>impatient</hi> in the <hi>Pursuit,</hi> nor <hi>dissatisfied</hi> in the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of them, it is impossible they should give
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106959:62"/>
any Disturbance to our Minds. And so, on the other hand, did we but take care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our Resentments of Outward Evils and Dangers as Right Reason advises, they would never be able to <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>discompose</hi> our Minds. For Right Reason advises that we should not so resent them as to <hi>increase</hi> and <hi>aggravate</hi> them; that we should not add the Disquietude of an <hi>anxious Fear</hi> to the Dangers that threaten us, nor the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an <hi>Outragious Anger</hi> to the Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are offered us, nor the Smart of a <hi>Peevish Impatience</hi> to the sufferings that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us; In a word, that we should not ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate our Want through an <hi>invidious Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> at anothers Fulness, nor sharpen the Injuries that are offered us by a <hi>malicious</hi> and <hi>revengeful</hi> Resentment of them. And he that follows these Advices of Reason, and conducts his <hi>Irascible</hi> Affections by them, has a Mind that is elevated above the Reach of Injury; that sits above the Clouds in a calm and quiet Aether, and with a brave Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency hears the rowling Thunders grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and burst under its Feet. And whilst Outward Evils fall upon <hi>timorous</hi> and <hi>pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish</hi> and <hi>malicious</hi> Spirits, like Sparks of Fire upon a heap of Gunpowder, and do presently blow them up, and put them all in Combustion; when they happen to a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:106959:63"/>
Mind they fall like Stones on a Bed of Down, where they sit easily and quietly, and are received with a calm and soft Complyance. When therefore by the continual Practice of <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> we have tamed and civilized our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscible</hi> and <hi>Irascible</hi> Affections, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them under the Government of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, our Minds will be free from all <hi>Disease</hi> and <hi>Disturbance,</hi> and we shall be liable to no other Evil but that of Bodily Sense and Passion. So that when we leave our <hi>Bodies</hi> and go into the World of <hi>Spirits,</hi> we shall presently feel our selves in perfect <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Ease.</hi> For the <hi>Health</hi> of a Reasonable Soul consists in being <hi>perfectly Reasonable,</hi> in having all its Affections <hi>perfectly</hi> subdued to a well-informed Mind, and clothed in the Livery of its Reason. And while it is thus, it cannot be diseased in that <hi>Spiritual</hi> State wherein it will be wholly separated from all <hi>bodily</hi> Sense and Passion; because it has no Affection in it that can any way disturb or ruffle its calm and gentle Thoughts. And then feeling all within it self to be <hi>well,</hi> and as it <hi>should</hi> be; every String tuned into a perfect Harmony; every Motion and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction corresponding with the most perfect Draughts and Models of its own Reason, it must needs highly <hi>approve</hi> of, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106959:63"/>
                     <hi>satisfied</hi> with it self; and while it sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys its own Motions and Actions, it must necessarily have a most delicious Gust and Rellish of them, they being all such as its best and purest Reason approves of, with a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>ungainsaying</hi> Judgment. And thus the Soul being cured of all <hi>irregular</hi> Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and removed from all <hi>corporeal</hi> Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, will live in perfect <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Vigor,</hi> and for ever enjoy within it self a Heaven of <hi>Content</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. ANOTHER Virtue which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to a man considered meerly as a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Animal</hi> is TEMPERANCE; which consists in not indulging our <hi>Bodily Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites</hi> to the Hurt and Prejudice of our <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Nature</hi>; Or, in refraining from all those <hi>Excesses</hi> of Bodily Pleasure, of Eating, Drinking and Venery, which do either <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order</hi> our Reason, or <hi>indispose</hi> us to enjoy the pure and spiritual Pleasures of the Mind. For, besides that all Excesses of <hi>Bodily</hi> Pleasures are naturally prejudicial to our <hi>Reason,</hi> as they indispose those Bodily Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans by which it operates, (For so <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> dilutes the Brain, which is the Mint of the Understanding, and drowns those Images it stamps upon it in a Floud of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome Rheums and Moistures; and <hi>Gluttony</hi> cloggs the Animal Spirits, which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106959:64"/>
are, as it were, the Wings of the Mind, and indisposes them for the Highest and Noblest Flights of Reason; so <hi>Wantonness</hi> chafes the Bloud into Feverish Heats, and by causing it to boil up too fast into the Brain, disorders the motions of the Spirits there, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the <hi>Phantasms,</hi> that the Mind can have no clear or distinct Perception of them; by which means our Intellectual Faculties are very often <hi>interrupted,</hi> and forced to sit still for want of proper Tools to work with, and so, by often <hi>loitering,</hi> grow by degrees <hi>listless</hi> and <hi>unactive,</hi> and at the last, are utterly <hi>indisposed</hi> to any Rational Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;) Besides this, I say, (which must needs be a mighty prejudice to our Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature) by too much <hi>familiarizing</hi> our selves to <hi>bodily</hi> Pleasures, we shall break off all our <hi>acquaintance</hi> with <hi>spiritual</hi> ones, and grow, by degrees, such utter strangers to them, that we shall never be able to rellish and enjoy them; and our <hi>Soul</hi> will contract such an <hi>Vxorious Fondness</hi> of the <hi>Body (that</hi> being the Shop of all the Pleasure it was ever acquainted with) that 'twill ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to live happily without it. For though in its separate state it cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that the Soul will retain the <hi>Appetites</hi> of the Body; yet, if while it is in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it wholly abandons it self to <hi>Corporeal</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:106959:64"/>
Pleasures, it may, and doubtless will, retain a vehement <hi>hankering</hi> after it, and <hi>longing</hi> to be re-united to it; which, I conceive, is the only sensuality that a separated Soul is capable of. For when such a Soul arrives into the Spiritual World, her having wholly accustomed her self to <hi>bodily</hi> Pleasure, and never experienced <hi>any other,</hi> will necessarily render her incapable of enjoying the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of pure and blessed Spirits. So that being left utterly destitute of all her dear Delights and Satisfactions, which are such as she knows she can never enjoy but in <hi>conjunction</hi> with the <hi>Body,</hi> all her Appetite and Longing must necessarily be an outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Desire of being <hi>Embodied</hi> again, that so she may be capable of repeating her old <hi>sensual</hi> Pleasures, and acting over the <hi>bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Scene anew.</p>
                  <p>AND this, as some think, is the Reason why such <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>sensual</hi> Souls have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared so often, after their separation, in the <hi>Churchyards,</hi> or <hi>Charnel-Houses</hi> where their Bodies were laid; because they cannot please themselves without them:<note place="margin">Plat.

And hence, among other Reasons, it was that the Primitive Christians did so severely abstain from Bodily Pleasures, that by this

means they might gently <hi>wean</hi> the Soul from the Body, and teach it before hand to live upon the Delights of separated Spirits; that so upon its separation it might drop into Eternity, like ripe Fruit from the Tree, with Ease and Willingness; and that by accustoming it before to <hi>spiritual</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Delights, it might acquire such a savoury Sense and Relish of them, as to be able, when it came into the <hi>spiritual</hi> world, to live wholly upon them, and to be so intirely satisfied with them, as not to be endlesly vext with a tormenting Desire of returning to the Body again.

us up to a Life incorruptible.</hi> i. e. They did so use them, as that as much as in them lay, they might wean their Souls from the pleasures of them, that so they might have the better Appetite to that Spiritual Food upon which they were to live for ever.</p>
                  <p>AND therefore thus to <hi>temperate</hi> and <hi>restrain</hi> our selves in the Use of bodily Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures is one of the necessary Virtues of the <hi>Christian Life.</hi> For hitherto tend all those Precepts concerning <hi>abstaining from fleshly lusts which war against our Souls,</hi> I Pet. ii.11. and <hi>mortifying the deeds of the Body,</hi> Rom. viii.13. and <hi>keeping under the Body,</hi> 1 Cor. ix.27. and <hi>putting off the body of the sins of the Flesh,</hi> Coloss. ii.11. And we are strictly enjoined <hi>to be temperate in all things, to watch and be sober, and walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in excess of wine, revellings and banquettings</hi>; The sense of all which is, That we should not indulge our <hi>bodily</hi> Appetites to the vitiating and depraving of our <hi>spiritual</hi>; that we should not plunge our selves so far in the Pleasures of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> as to drown our Sense and Perception of <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; but that we should so far subdue and mortifie our <hi>Sensuality,</hi> as that it may not have the <hi>Dominion</hi> over us, nor be the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106959:66"/>
                     <hi>prevalent</hi> Delight and Complacency of our Souls; but that the <hi>commanding</hi> Biass, and <hi>swaying</hi> Propension within us may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Divine and Heavenly Enjoyments; that so, when we leave this Body, we may not be so <hi>wedded</hi> to the Pleasures of it, as not to be able to be Happy without them; but that we may carry with us into Eternity such a quick Sense and lively Rellish of the Pleasures above, as to be able to <hi>live upon,</hi> and be for ever <hi>satisfied</hi> with them.</p>
                  <p>SO that at first View it is evident how much the Practice of this Virtue conduces to our Future Happiness. For by taking us off from all excess of bodily Pleasure, it dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses us to enjoy the Pleasures of Heaven, and <hi>connaturallizes</hi> our Souls to them: So that when after a long Exercise of <hi>Temperance,</hi> we come to leave the <hi>Body,</hi> our Soul will be so loosned from it before hand, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred so indifferent to the <hi>Delights</hi> of it, that we shall be able to part both with <hi>It</hi> and <hi>Them</hi> without any great <hi>Regret</hi> or <hi>Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and to live from them for ever without any disquieting <hi>Longings</hi> or <hi>Hankerings</hi> after them. For, as when we are grown up by Age and Experience to a sense of more <hi>manly</hi> Pleasures, we despise Nuts and Rattles, which when we were <hi>Children,</hi> we accounted our Happiness, and should have reckoned our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106959:67"/>
selves undone had we been deprived of them; So when by the Practice of a severe <hi>Temperance,</hi> we have acquired a thorough sense of the Pleasures of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> we shall look upon all our <hi>bodily</hi> Pleasures as the little Toys and Fooleries of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant State, with which we pleased our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish Fancies when we knew no better. And whereas had we been deprived of them <hi>then,</hi> we should have cried and bemoaned our selves, as little Children do when they lose their Play-Games, and reckoned our selves undone and miserable; upon the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we have had of the <hi>Nobler</hi> and more <hi>Generous</hi> Pleasures of Religion, we shall be able to despise these <hi>little, poor</hi> Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Infancy; to take our leave of them without a Tear in our Eyes, and to live eternally without missing them. For, our Minds being for the main reconciled to <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Pleasures, we shall put off all Remains of <hi>bodily</hi> Lust with our <hi>Bodies,</hi> and so flie away into the spiritual world with none but <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites about us; where meeting with an <hi>infinite Fulness</hi> of Spiritual Joys and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, of which we had many a <hi>foretast</hi> in the Body, our <hi>predisposed</hi> Mind will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently close with, and feed upon them, with such an <hi>unspeakable</hi> Content and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

as will <hi>ravish</hi> it for ever from the Thoughts of all other Pleasures. So that now we shall not only be able to <hi>subsist</hi> without Fleshly Delights, but to <hi>despise</hi> and <hi>scorn</hi> them; our Faculties being treated eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment with far <hi>nobler</hi> Fare and <hi>better</hi> Joys.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. ANOTHER of those Virtues which belong to a man considered meerly as a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Animal,</hi> is HUMILITY; which consists in a <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>lowly</hi> opinion of our selves, and of our own <hi>Acquisitions, Merits,</hi> or <hi>Endowments</hi>; Or, in not valuing our selves beyond what is <hi>due</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> upon the account of any Good we are possessed of, whether it be <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External.</hi> For <hi>Pride,</hi> or an over-weening <hi>Self-Conceit</hi> is the Bane of all our Virtue and Happiness. It causes us to overlook our <hi>Defects,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hinders us from making farther <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and it possesses us with an opinion that we <hi>deserve</hi> more than we have and thereby renders us <hi>dissatisfied</hi> with our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Enjoyments. For by how much any man <hi>over-values</hi> himself, by so much he <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-values</hi> what he enjoys; because while he compares what he enjoys with the fond opinion that he hath of himself, he always finds it <hi>short</hi> of his Desert, and so can never be <hi>satisfied</hi> with it. Yea, such is the cross
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106959:68"/>
and capricious Humour of a proud Spirit, that the more it possesses, the bigger it swells with the <hi>opinion</hi> of its own Desert; and the <hi>more</hi> it is opiniated of its own Desert, the <hi>less</hi> it is satisfied with that which it possesses and enjoys. For when a man is exceeding apt to <hi>flatter</hi> and <hi>cokes</hi> himself, he will catch at any Pretence to exalt his own Merit and Desert, and be ready to measure it, not only by what he <hi>is,</hi> but by what he <hi>has</hi> too; and then reckoning his <hi>outward</hi> Possessions to be the Rewards or Products of his <hi>Inward</hi> Worth, the more he <hi>has,</hi> the more he will still imagine he <hi>deserves to have.</hi> So that his <hi>Opinion</hi> of his own <hi>Desert</hi> will still run on so fast before his <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> that though they should follow it never so close, as the Hinder Wheels of a Coach do the Fore ones, yet it would be impossible for them to overtake it; And so long as he conceives his Enjoyments to be <hi>behind</hi> his Desert, he will be always <hi>discontented,</hi> and <hi>dissatisfied</hi> with them; and while he continues of this Humour, the utmost Bliss and Glory that Heaven affords would not to be able to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him. For if he were set equal in Glory with the <hi>highest Saint,</hi> he would be so puffed and exalted by it in his own Conceit, that he would fancy he merited the Glory of an <hi>Angel</hi>; and if from thence he were advanced
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106959:68"/>
to the Throne of an <hi>Arch-Angel</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would flatter himself into a conceit that he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Glory and Dignity of a <hi>God</hi>: And so long as he fancied his Advancement to be <hi>below</hi> his Merit, he would never be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented</hi> with it, how <hi>high</hi> soever it were, but be continually <hi>vexing</hi> and <hi>repining</hi> that he was raised no <hi>higher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND this I verily believe was the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and that which finally ruined and undid him. For when he was an <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> he was doubtless placed by the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> in such an Order or Degree of Dignity as became the Dignity of his Nature. But he, reflecting on his own Indowments, and the Glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein he was placed, began first to swell with an <hi>arrogant</hi> and <hi>overweening</hi> conceit of himself, and to set <hi>too high</hi> a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon his own Angelical Graces and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and, as the natural Effect of this, to imagine that he was not high enough advanced in the Scale of the <hi>Heavenly Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,</hi> and that his <hi>Station</hi> in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Angels was <hi>beneath</hi> the Grandeur and Dignity of his Nature. This made him look up with <hi>envious</hi> Eyes upon the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Orders <hi>above</hi> him, into whose sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Rank he being forbid to aspire by God, the Prince of Spirits, he proceeded by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106959:69"/>
to malign and hate both <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Them.</hi> And this he first expressed by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a <hi>Conspiracy</hi> against him with some of his Fellow-Angels, whom he found most apt to be wrought upon by him; together with whom he made an open <hi>Revolt,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook the Blessed Abodes, as not enduring to abide any longer amongst those Blessed Orders whom he so inveterately <hi>hated</hi> and <hi>envied</hi>; and so with his revolted <hi>Legions</hi> descends into this Aery Region, where ever since he hath persisted in open Hostility against God and Heaven. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is said of Him and his Accomplices, that they <hi>kept not their first Station,</hi> that is, they would needs have a <hi>higher</hi> Station in Heaven than that wherein God had placed them; which because they could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>they left their own Habitation,</hi> i. e. forsook Heaven their Native Country and Abode, and came down into these lower Parts of the World, upon Design to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their Party against Heaven by sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Mankind into the same Revolt with themselves, <hi>Jude</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>THUS 'twas the Devils <hi>Pride,</hi> you see, that made him <hi>Envious,</hi> his <hi>Envy</hi> that made him <hi>Spiteful</hi> and <hi>Malicious,</hi> all which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made him a <hi>Devil.</hi> And thus it would be with <hi>us,</hi> if we could be admitted into
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106959:69"/>
Heaven whilst we are under the Power and Prevalence of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-Conceit.</hi> For while we think better of our selves, than God does, we shall never be <hi>contented</hi> with his Retributions, who will be sure to deal with every man according to his works; and that excessive value we should have of our selves, would cause us to <hi>undervalue</hi> the Degree and Rank of Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness wherein we should be placed by the just Rewarder of Souls, as a Station much beneath our imagined Excellency and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And hence we should proceed to <hi>think hardly</hi> of God, and to <hi>repine</hi> against him as a partial and unequal Distributer of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and to <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>malign</hi> those that were placed higher in Glory than our selves; and so at last, out of an implacable <hi>Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Discontent,</hi> to leave our Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the Devils did, and fly away to their Revolted Party. So impossible is it for a Soul that is under a prevailing Habit of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-Conceit</hi> to be happy either here or hereafter.</p>
                  <p>AND therefore to remove this Obstacle, Christianity imposes the Practice of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> as a necessary means of our Happiness; and requires us <hi>to put on humbleness of mind,</hi> Col. iii.12. <hi>to be clothed with humility,</hi> 1 Pet. v.5. <hi>to walk with all lowliness and meekness,</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:106959:70"/>
Ephes. iv.1, 2. and <hi>in lowliness of mind to esteem others better than our selves,</hi> Phil. ii.3. In a word, to follow the Example of our Blessed Lord, who was <hi>meek and lowly,</hi> Mat. xi.29. and <hi>in honour to prefer one another,</hi> Rom. xii.10. The sense of all which is, that we should labour, as much as in us lies, to think very <hi>meanly</hi> and <hi>modestly</hi> of our selves, and not to be discontented if <hi>others</hi> think <hi>meanly</hi> of us too; <hi>i. e.</hi> that we should nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>proud</hi> nor <hi>vainglorious,</hi> neither too much exalted in our <hi>own</hi> opinions, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to insinuate into <hi>others</hi> a higher opinion of us than we do really deserve: In short, that we should so effectually repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to our selves the little Reason we have to be proud of any Personal Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it be of Body, or Mind, to strut, like <hi>Esop</hi>'s Crow, in these borrowed Feathers, which we could neither <hi>give</hi> to our selves, nor <hi>merit</hi> of God, but are wholly owing for to the Divine Bounty; so to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate upon our Minds the Folly and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culousness of being proud of any <hi>Outward Goods</hi> we possess, such as fine Cloths, great Estates, or Popular Reputation, all which are so far from either <hi>making</hi> or <hi>speaking</hi> us <hi>wiser</hi> or <hi>better</hi> men, that they are too often the Fruits and Testimonies of our <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Knavery</hi>; And, in fine, that we should so
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106959:70"/>
impartially reflect upon the many Follies and Indiscretions, Errors and Ignorances, Irregularities of Temper, Defects of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Deviations from Right Reason that we are guilty of, as to shame our selves out of all those <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>arrogant</hi> Conceits that do so <hi>swell</hi> and <hi>impostumate</hi> our Minds.</p>
                  <p>AND when by these, and such like <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> Reflections we have laid our selves low in our own Eyes, and so far abased our <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-Conceit</hi> as to be effectually convinced of the Folly of it, and throughly persuaded to abhor and hate it, to watch and strive against it, and to be habituated for the main to <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>lowly</hi> thoughts of our selves; though we should not here ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to an absolute Perfection in <hi>Humility</hi> (having none here to converse, or compare our selves with but such as our selves, such as are many of them our <hi>Inferiours,</hi> many our <hi>Equals,</hi> and many but few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Degrees our <hi>Superiours</hi>) yet, as soon as we go off from this <hi>lower</hi> Form, in which we may seem so considerable, into the Class and Society of those Glorious Inhabitants <hi>above</hi> (in whose bright Presence we shall appear but like so many <hi>Glow Worms</hi> in the midst of a Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Stars</hi>) all the <hi>little Remains</hi> of Pride and Self-Conceit in us, will immediately vanish from our Minds.

of an Angel the <hi>Beloved Apostle</hi> could not forbear prostrating himself; how <hi>prostrate</hi> and <hi>lowly</hi> must we be, when we see not only the whole Choir of Angels together, but God himself too, the Prince and Father of Spirits! For even here we find that the <hi>nearer</hi> we approach God, the more we <hi>shrink</hi> and <hi>lessen</hi> in our own Eyes; and if in the Presence of <hi>Angels</hi> we are but <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> in the Presence of <hi>God</hi> we shall be <hi>Nothings.</hi> But Oh! when we shall not only <hi>discern</hi> how infinitely he outshines us in Glory, but shall also continually <hi>feel</hi> by the most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Communications of his Goodness how we hang upon him, and derive every Breath and Joy and Glory from him; how our Being and Well-Being are the meer Alms and Pensions of his Bounty; how every Grace and Beauty in us is but the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that a faint one too, of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretched Rays; when, I say, we shall feel all this, as we shall do in Heaven every moment, by a quick and sensible Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how must it needs wean us from all <hi>self-arrogating</hi> Thoughts, and perfectly <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> us in our own Eyes! And when this is done, our minds will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>tempered</hi> and <hi>prepared</hi> for the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Perfect Happiness; For now, such a <hi>modest</hi> opinion we shall have of our selves,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106959:72"/>
that whatsoever Degree of Glory we are placed in, we shall look upon it as far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our Desert, and upon that account, be unspeakably <hi>satisfied</hi> and <hi>contented</hi> with it, and freely <hi>acknowledge</hi> it to be a thousand Degrees beyond what we could desire or hope for. And so far shall we be from <hi>grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at, or <hi>envying</hi> those above us, that out of an <hi>humble</hi> sense of our own Unworthiness we shall readily prefer them before our selves, and freely acknowledge that we are only so many Degrees <hi>inferiour</hi> to <hi>them</hi> in Glory, as they are <hi>superiour</hi> to <hi>us</hi> in Divine Graces and Perfections. Upon which we shall not only <hi>acquiesce,</hi> but heartily <hi>rejoice</hi> in their Advancement, and be abundantly <hi>pleased</hi> that their <hi>Reward</hi> is as much greater than ours, as we do acknowledge their <hi>Virtue</hi> to be. In a word, so far shall we be from <hi>repining</hi> and <hi>murmuring</hi> at God for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding <hi>us</hi> as liberally as <hi>others,</hi> that we shall be thoroughly sensible that he hath been bountiful to us infinitely beyond our <hi>Desert</hi> or <hi>Expectation</hi>; that 'twas not out of a fond <hi>Partiality,</hi> ot blind <hi>Respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> that he raised others to higher Degrees of Glory than our selves, but out of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of strict <hi>Justice</hi> that exactly ballances and adjusts its Rewards, according to the Degrees of our Desert and Improvement.

                  <p>THUS you see how all those Virtues which appertain to a man considered as a <hi>Reasonable Animal,</hi> conduce to the Great Christian End, <hi>viz.</hi> The Happiness of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

For, as I have shewed you in the Beginning of this Section, the proper office of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Virtue consists in so regulating all our Powers of Action, as that we do nothing that is hurtful or injurious to our Rational Nature; and thus, you plainly see, these Five aforenamed.

                        </gap>ative,</hi> there is, as I shewed you, a <hi>Positive</hi> Part of Happiness, which consists not in <hi>Rest,</hi> but in <hi>Motion</hi>; in the Vigorous Exercise of our
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106959:73"/>
Rational Faculties upon such Objects as are most suitable to them; And to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Part of our Happiness, there are other kinds of Vertues necessary to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by us, of which I shall discourse in the two following Sections. But though the <hi>immediate</hi> Effect of these <hi>Humane</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues we have been discoursing of, be only the Happiness of <hi>Rest,</hi> yet do they tend a great deal farther, even to the Happiness of <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Exercise.</hi> For it is impossible so to suppress that Active Principle within us, as to make it totally surcease from Motion; and therefore as every intermission of its <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> Actings does but make way for <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>extravagant</hi> ones; so eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abatement of its <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>injurious</hi> motions, makes way for <hi>beatifical</hi> ones; And so the <hi>Humane</hi> Virtues by giving us rest from those Motions that are <hi>afflictive</hi> to our Natures, incline and dispose us to such Motions and Exercises as are most <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> to it.</p>

                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:106959:74"/>1. That we should frequently <hi>think of,</hi> and <hi>contemplate</hi> the beauty and perfection of his nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That upon the account of these perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we should humbly <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> him.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. AS we are rational Creatures related to <hi>God,</hi> we are obliged to be often <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating</hi> and <hi>thinking upon</hi> him. For the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural use of our understanding is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template Truth, and therefore the more of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> there is in any knowable object, and the farther it is removed from <hi>Falshood</hi> and <hi>Non-entity,</hi> the more the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is concerned to <hi>contemplate</hi> and <hi>think upon</hi> it. God therefore being the most <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> object, as he stands removed by the <hi>necessity</hi> of his existence from all <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:106959:75"/>
of not-being, must needs be the most perfect Theme of our Understanding, the best and greatest Subject, on which it can employ its Meditations. And besides that he is the most <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> of all beings, he is also the source and spring of all <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reality,</hi> his Power conducted by his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Goodness being the cause not only of all that <hi>is,</hi> but of all that either <hi>shall</hi> be, or <hi>can</hi> be. And is it fit that our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which was made to <hi>contemplate,</hi> should wholly overlook the fountain of it? But besides this too, that he is the greatest <hi>Truth</hi> himself, and the cause of every thing else that is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real,</hi> he is the Sovereign of Beings, and the most <hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> as he includes in his infinite Essence all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible perfections both in kind and degree. And what a monstrous Irreverence is it for minds that were framed to the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Truth, to pass by such a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> one without any regard or obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; as if he stood for a cypher in the world, and were not worthy to be thought upon? Nay and besides all this (which one would think were enough to oblige our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings to the strictest attendance to him) he is a Truth in which above all others we are most <hi>nearly concerned,</hi> as he is not only the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Prop</hi> of our Beings, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106959:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Consolation</hi> of our lives, but the sole <hi>Arbiter</hi> of our Fate too, upon whom our everlasting well or ill being depends. And what can we be more concerned to <hi>think</hi> and <hi>meditate</hi> upon than this great being, from whom we sprang, in whom we live and breath and of whom we are to expect all that evil or good that we can fear or hope for. All which considered, there is no doubt to be made but that our Understanding was chiefly made for God, to look up to him and contemplate his Being and Perfections. And though in this <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect</hi> State it is too often averted from him, by this vast variety of sensual things that surround it, and intercept its Prospect, yet as our Soul recovers out of this <hi>sensual</hi> condition into a life of <hi>Reason,</hi> we find by experience that its Understanding presently looks upwards, by a natural Instinct, and directs it self to God, as to its proper <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Center.</hi> And as it grows more and more <hi>indifferent</hi> to the objects of Sense, so it becomes more and more <hi>vigorous</hi> in its tendency towards God and divine things. And 'tis no wonder it doth so, since it is God only who is an <hi>infinite</hi> Truth, that is able to satisfie its <hi>infinite</hi> Thirst after Truth. And hence it is, that till we have throughly fixed our Minds and Wills upon God, we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106959:76"/>
do naturally affect such an <hi>Infinity</hi> of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that our Desires are always reaching at <hi>new</hi> Pleasures, and carried forth after <hi>new</hi> Possessions; that our Fancy is always entertaining our mind with <hi>new</hi> Ideas, and our Understanding continually calling for <hi>new</hi> Scenes of Contemplation. By which, as one hath well observed, the Soul declares that it is not to be perfectly pleased with <hi>finite</hi> Truth or Good. Which possibly may be the reason of that delight we take in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Pictures of Anticks and Monsters, because they <hi>exceed</hi> the limits of Truth, and so do <hi>enlarge</hi> as it were the prospect of the Soul, which by its unconfined motions, shews that it is of a Divine Extract, and that it can never be perfectly satisfied but in union with God, who is an infinite ocean of Truth and Goodness. For as for all other beings, they are so very <hi>shallow,</hi> that we quickly see (or at least shall do, when we see after the manner of Spirits) to the very bottom of their Truth and Reality; and when we have done that, they have no more in them to feed and entertain our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings. So that when we have exhausted the Truth of <hi>finite</hi> Beings, we must either cease to understand any more, which would be to deprive our noblest Faculty of any farther Pleasure, or we must at last fix our
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106959:76"/>
mind upon God, in whom it will find such <hi>infinite</hi> Truth, as will be sufficient to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it throughout all its <hi>infinite</hi> Duration. But unless we do <hi>now</hi> acquaint our minds with God by frequent <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating</hi> upon him, we shall by degrees grow such <hi>Strangers</hi> to him, that, by that time we go into the other world, we shall be so far from being <hi>pleased</hi> with contemplating him, that we shall look upon him as an <hi>uncouth</hi> object, and out of distast <hi>avert</hi> and turn our eyes from him. For the mind of man must be <hi>familiarized</hi> to its objects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be able to contemplate them with <hi>pleasure,</hi> and though the objects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be never so <hi>amiable,</hi> yet while the mind is <hi>unused</hi> to them, its thoughts will <hi>start</hi> and <hi>flie off</hi> from them, and without a great deal of violence, will never be reduced to a <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> attention to them. So that if we go into eternity with minds <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomed</hi> to the thoughts of God, we shall be continually flying away from him, as Bats and Owls do from the light of the Sun, and never be able to compose our <hi>awkward</hi> thoughts into a fixed contemplation of his glory. And when we have thus banished our selves from the only object that can for ever <hi>bless</hi> and <hi>satisfie</hi> our understanding, that can keep it in everlasting <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi>

and feed its greedy thoughts eternally with <hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> discoveries, we have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lost one of the sweetest Pleasures that humane nature is capable of; and so must necessarily <hi>pine</hi> and <hi>languish,</hi> under an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal discontentedness. To prevent which, the Gospel enjoins us to train up our minds to divine <hi>Contemplation,</hi> and to be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>meditating</hi> upon God; <hi>to mind those things that are above,</hi> for so the Greek word is to be rendred, <hi>Coloss.</hi> iii.1. <hi>to sanctifie the Lord God in our hearts,</hi> 1 Pet. iii.15. that is, by entertaining great and worthy Thoughts of him. And therefore the Gospel is set before us as a <hi>Glass,</hi> that therein we may <hi>contemplate and behold the glory of God,</hi> 2 Cor. iii.18. namely, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory which is therein discovered and revealed to us; that we may set him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before our minds, and <hi>gather up</hi> our thoughts about him, and force them to <hi>dwell</hi> and <hi>stay</hi> upon him, that so they may taste and relish his heavenly beauties, and please and satisfie themselves with the view and contemplation of them. For though to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate closely upon God may at first be <hi>irksome</hi> and tedious to our unexperienced minds, yet when by the constant practice of it, we have worn off that <hi>Strangeness</hi> towards God which renders the thoughts of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106959:78"/>
him so <hi>troublesome</hi> to us, and by frequent converses are grown better acquainted with him, we shall grow by degrees so <hi>pleased</hi> and <hi>satisfied</hi> with the thoughts of him, that we shall not know how to live <hi>without</hi> them; and our minds at last will be toucht with such a lively sense of his attractive beauties, that we shall never be well but while we are with him; so that he will become the constant Companion of our thoughts, and the daily theme of our <hi>Meditations</hi>; and nothing in the world will be so <hi>grateful</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to us, as to retire now and then from the world, and converse with God in holy <hi>Contemplations.</hi> And though by reason of our present <hi>Circumstances</hi> and <hi>Necessities</hi> there is no remedy but our thoughts must be often diverted from him, and forced to attend to our secular occasions; yet after they have been used a while to God, we shall find they will never be so well pleased, nor so much at ease as when they are retired from every thing but God, and composed and setled into divine meditations. So that when we go away into the other world, where we shall be removed from those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome <hi>Circumstances</hi> and <hi>Necessities,</hi> which did here so often divert our thoughts from God, our minds which have been so <hi>long</hi> accustomed and habituated to him, will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106959:79"/>
fasten upon him, and intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themselves to the contemplation of his nature and glory. For our minds being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready strongly <hi>inclined</hi> and <hi>byass'd</hi> towards God by those grateful foretasts we have had of him in the warmths of our Meditation, when we come in the still and quiet regions of the blessed, where we shall immediately have a more close and intimate view of him than ever, all our thoughts will naturally run towards him, and be so captivated with the first sight of his glory, that we shall never be able to look off again, as long as eternity endures, but <hi>one</hi> view will invite us to <hi>another,</hi> and what we see will so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport and ravish us, that we shall still desire to see further and further. And because our finite mind will never be able fully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all that is <hi>knowable</hi> in his infinite being, we shall be so delighted in every further Knowledge of him, that we shall still desire to know further, and that <hi>Desire</hi> as fast as it springs shall still be satisfied with a further <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and so to eternal ages, each new satisfaction shall immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spring a new desire, and each new desire immediately terminate in a new satisfaction. And now, O happy mind! what tongue can express thy joys and raptures! that being thus in conjunction with God art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106959:79"/>
filled with glorious Ideas, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed round with the wonders of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; so that at every glance thou seest some new <hi>Charm,</hi> and with every thought makest some vast <hi>Discovery.</hi> O the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sporting pleasure of that blessed Vision! which now I can hardly think of without an ecstasie; when my poor longing Mind, which here gropes about for truth in a dark dungeon of Errour and Ignorance, shall be let forth into the heavenly light, to see as it is seen, and know as it is known, how will it fix its greedy eyes upon God, of whose acquaintance it is now so desirous! With what infinite delight will its winged and active thoughts hover in the light of his Countenance, which through every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Eternity will be still revealing new Beauties to us, such as will not only for ever <hi>employ,</hi> but for ever <hi>inflame</hi> our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. AS we are Rational Creatures related to <hi>God,</hi> we are obliged humbly to <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Adore</hi> him, that is, that out of a most awful esteem and profound reverence of his super-excellent Majesty, and boundless Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, we should bow down our Souls before him, and address our selves to him by <hi>Invocation</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> by <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> as to the Alsufficient, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106959:80"/>
and sole disposer of every good and perfect gift; and that in these our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses we should outwardly express this our reverential Esteem of him, by such humble gestures of Body, as are most apt to testifie it to others. For all this is but a just and due acknowledgment of what he is in <hi>himself,</hi> and to <hi>us,</hi> and all his <hi>Creation.</hi> The profoundest Reverence and Veneration we can pay him, is but a just Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Infinite <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>; the most fervent Invocations and Prayers we can offer him, are but a due owning of him to be what he is, the supream <hi>Disposer</hi> and <hi>Author</hi> of all things; the most ample and glorious Praises we can give him are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably short of what is owing to his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Excellencies</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi>; the most thankful Acknowledgments we can make him, are but poor compositions for those vast sums which we owe to his <hi>Bounty</hi> and <hi>Liberality.</hi> So that all our Worship is a most just Due arising from what he is in <hi>himself,</hi> and from what he doth to <hi>us,</hi> and to all his <hi>Creatures.</hi> And till we are made throughly sensible of both, we are utterly incapable of eternal Happiness; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, as I shewed you before, in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous exercise of our Rational Faculties upon God, doth necessarily require that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106959:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we should be duely affected with his Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Actions. For unless we are so, we shall never be able to engage our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vigorously to employ and exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about him; unless our minds be over-awed with an habitual sense of his infinite Majesty and Power, we shall be apt to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect him as an object too mean for our great Faculties to converse with; unless our minds be strongly disposed to <hi>esteem</hi> and <hi>admire</hi> his Glory and Excellencies, we shall never be able to excite our Understanding and Will to act upon him with any life and vigour: in a word, unless we are possessed with a constant sense that he is the <hi>Spring</hi> of all those goods which we enjoy or hope for, we shall be apt to look upon him as one with whom we are very little concerned, and so to neglect and disregard him. So that unless we do now acquire an habitual Devotion of mind toward God, when we go from hence into the other world, we shall find our faculties so <hi>averse</hi> and <hi>listless</hi> to all that heavenly Motion and Exercise wherein the Happiness above consists, that we shall be utterly incapable to tast and enjoy it. For in eternity our Souls will run according to the prevailing byass which they carry thither with them; but 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they should run towards God with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106959:81"/>
                     <hi>life</hi> and <hi>freedom,</hi> unless they are constantly drawn and inclined to him by a devout ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of his Majesty, and admiration of his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi> And hence it is that the Gospel doth so strictly oblige us to <hi>adore and worship God,</hi> Rev. xxii.9. <hi>to worship him in spirit and in truth,</hi> Joh. iv.24. <hi>to pray without ceasing,</hi> 1 Thes. v.17. and <hi>pray always with all prayer and supplication,</hi> that is, earnestly to supplicate God upon every fit opportunity and time of need, <hi>Ephes.</hi> vi.18. in a word, <hi>to offer to God the sacrifice of praise that is the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name,</hi> Heb. xiii.15. and <hi>to thank God without ceasing,</hi> 1 Thes. ii.13. The meaning of all which is, that out of a deep and quick sense of the infinite Majesty and Power, Alsufficience and Beneficence of God, we should be frequently bowing our selves before him, and offering up our Prayers and Praises, and Thanksgivings to him. And in the constant practice of these, we shall be growing up by degrees to that blissful state of Heaven. For all these acts of divine Worship being immediate addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of our minds to God, do so unite us to him, that in every hearty Prayer, Praise, or Thanksgiving, we do in a manner touch <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> him. So while we humbly adore <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we are sensibly struck with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106959:81"/>
the rays of it; while we earnestly <hi>invocate</hi> his Goodness and Mercy, we are touched with a strong attractive virtue from him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we plainly feel our selves drawn up to him, and rapt into a real enjoyment of him: in a word, while we are offering our hearty Praises and Thanksgivings to him, we are under a captivating sense of his infinite Gloy and Beneficence, and with a sensible touch of this his heavenly fire, our hearts are kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled and inflamed. Insomuch that while we are upon our knees in a warmth and fervour of Devotion, our minds have many times as <hi>quick</hi> a perception, as <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> a relish of God, as ever our bodily palate had of the most gustful meats or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors. So that by frequently repeating these our devotions, we frequently repeat these our sensations of God; which being often renewed will grow more <hi>vigorous</hi> and <hi>constant,</hi> and so at last improve into an <hi>active, permanent</hi> and <hi>habitual</hi> sense of him. And having thus acquired by our frequent and devout Worship, a <hi>lively constant</hi> feeling and perception of the Majesty and Glory, of the Bounty and Benignity of God, when ever we go into eternity this like a vital spring will give a <hi>perpetual motion</hi> to our Faculties, and vigorously exert and employ them upon God for ever. The quick and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106959:82"/>
lively sense we shall have of his infinite Majesty and Power, will for ever aw our Understandings and Wills into a strict at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and submission to him; and have such a commanding power over us as will even constrain us to regard him with the profoundest Reverence and Veneration. For there we shall have far greater and clearer apprehensions of his Majesty than ever we had in this imperfect state; which will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our pre-acquired sense of it to such a degree of Respect and Veneration, as will for ever over-rule our Faculties, and keep our Understandings, Wills and Affections in close and strict attendance to him. And as our sense of his Majesty will sweetly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> so our sense of his infinite Beauty and Beneficence will invincibly <hi>allure</hi> us to exert and exercise our faculties upon him. For he that hath an affectionate sense of the Beauty and Goodness and Bounty of God, hath a heart ready tuned for the Musick of heaven, ready set and composed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Praises and Halelujahs. So that when he goes away from hence into the other world, and is there admitted to a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate view of the <hi>perfections,</hi> and a more abundant participation of the <hi>blessings</hi> of God than ever, his predisposed mind will immediately be seized with such a <hi>strong
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106959:82"/>
pathetick</hi> sense of both, as that he will not be able to withhold expressing and venting it in the most rapturous strains of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Praise and Thanksgiving. And this will be his business and employment for ever, to admire and extoll the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of God, of which he will every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make new and glorious Discoveries; and to celebrate with grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the infinite riches of his Bounty, of which he will every moment have fresh and sweet experiences. So that whilst by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual acts of Praise and Thanksgiving we endeavour to affect our minds with a due sense of the Goodness and Bounty of God, we are practising before-hand the Musick of Heaven, and taking out the Songs of <hi>Zion</hi>; that so when we go from hence, we may be qualified and prepared to bear a part in the Celestial Choir. So that true devotion (you see) which consists in a quick and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sense of the infinite Majesty, Beauty, and Benignity of God, doth most effectually dispose the mind to all those divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly exercises wherein the state of heaven consists.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. AS we are rational Creatures related to <hi>God,</hi> we are obliged to an unfeigned <hi>love of,</hi> and <hi>complacency in</hi> him. And that both upon the account of what he is in <hi>himself,</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:106959:83"/>
as he is the most <hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in whom there is an harmonious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of all imaginable Beauties and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, of Wisdom and Goodness, of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Mercy, and every other amiable thing that can claim or attract a reasonable Affection, all which in infinite degrees are contempered together in his nature: and also upon the account of his infinite Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Beneficence to us. For besides that he hath compassed us round, like so many <hi>fortunate Islands,</hi> with a vast Ocean of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Blessings, in which there is all that is either <hi>necessary, convenient,</hi> or <hi>pleasant</hi> for our bodily use and enjoyment; besides that he hath inspired us with immortal Minds, and stamped them with those fair impresses of his own Divinity, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Truth and the love of Goodness, which are both of them very forward capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the highest Perfection, and most exalted Happiness: in a word, besides that to supply and gratifie these our noble Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities he hath prepared for us an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Heaven, and furnisht it with all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and and Delights that a Heaven-born Mind can desire or enjoy: besides all this, I say, he hath sent his own Son from heaven to reveal to us the Way thither, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to return into it, by dying for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106959:83"/>
our sins, and thereby obtaining for us a publick Grant and Charter of Mercy and Pardon, upon Condition of our return; yea and as if all this were too little, he hath sent his <hi>Spirit</hi> to us in the room of his Son to abide amongst us, and as his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> to drive on this vast design of his love to us, to excite and persuade us to return into that sure way to heaven, which he hath described to us, and to assist us all along in our travel thither. So wondrous careful hath he been not to be defeated of this his kind intention to make us everlastingly happy. And now what Heart can be so <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>impenetrable</hi> as to resist such pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful <hi>Charms</hi> and <hi>Endearments!</hi> Methinks if we had but the common Sense and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of men in us, it would be impossible for us to reflect upon such miracles of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Love as these are, without being intimately <hi>touched</hi> and <hi>affected</hi> with them. But till we are so, it will be impossible for us to enjoy Heaven; for how can we freely exert our Faculties upon an Object that we do not <hi>love</hi>; and if we cannot, how can we without <hi>loving</hi> God enjoy Heaven; which consists in the free and cheerful out-goings of all our Faculties upon him? For if when we go into Eternity we <hi>love</hi> him not, either he will be <hi>indifferent</hi> or <hi>hateful</hi> to us; if
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106959:84"/>
the <hi>former,</hi> we shall altogether neglect and take no notice of him; if the <hi>latter,</hi> we shall either flie away from him, and banish our selves from his presence, or be forced to abide and endure it with extream regret and torment. For whilst our minds are <hi>averse</hi> and <hi>repugnant</hi> to him, whatsoever we see in him will but the more enrage and canker our malice against him; and even the sight of those his glorious Perfections which so enravish the hearts of the blessed inhabitants of Heaven, will only provoke and boil up our Dislike of him to a higher degree of Hatred and Aversation. For so we find by experience in this life that while our minds are <hi>unreconciled</hi> to God, it is a <hi>Pennance</hi> to us to come near him, to admit any Thoughts of or Conversation with him. And this is the reason why we take so much pains as we do to misrepresent him to our selves, to draw such Pictures and Ideas of him upon our Minds, as best correspond with our own Tempers; that so having thus transformed the Notion of him into the Image of our selves, <hi>Narcissus</hi>-like we may fall in love with him, or at least more easily endure his blessed Presence and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When therefore we shall go into the other world where all these Disguises of the divine Idea shall be taken off, and <hi>we shall see
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106959:84"/>
him as he is,</hi> circled about with his own Rays of unstained and immaculate Glory, we shall never be able to <hi>abide</hi> him; but being all <hi>affrighted</hi> and <hi>confounded</hi> at the Glory of his Presence, we shall be forced to <hi>run away,</hi> and if possible to <hi>hide</hi> our selves from him in everlasting <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Despair.</hi> For our Wills being poisoned and infected with an habitual <hi>Enmity</hi> against him, it must needs be torment to us to <hi>see</hi> him, because we must always see him <hi>happy</hi>; which is so great an <hi>eye-sore</hi> to those damned Spirits that hate him, that I am apt to think, that next to being delivered out of their own <hi>Misery,</hi> the chiefest Good they desire or wish for is, to be delivered from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Sense of his <hi>Happiness.</hi>. For what greater torment can our Mind endure, than to be an everlasting Spectator of the Bliss and Happiness of one whom it <hi>hates?</hi> How then will it fret and gall our <hi>meagre</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi> Spirits to see that blessed Being whom we cannot endure, surrounded with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Happiness; with a Happiness so <hi>vast</hi> as that it can admit of no <hi>Increase,</hi> and yet so <hi>secure,</hi> as that it can never suffer a <hi>Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution</hi>? So that 'tis impossible, you see, for the Mind of Man to live happily upon God in the other life, unless it be inspired before-hand with an hearty <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:106959:85"/>AND hence it is that our holy Religion doth so strictly require us <hi>to love the Lord our God, with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind,</hi> Mat. xxii.37. <hi>to love him because he loved us first, to delight our selves in the Lord,</hi> Psal. xxxvii.4. <hi>and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Lord,</hi> Phil. iii.1. <hi>and to rejoice in the Lord always,</hi> Phil. iv.4. <hi>i. e.</hi> to be habitually complacent or well pleased with the infinite Beauty, Goodness and Perfection of the divine Nature. Nay of such vast im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is the Love of God in the account of the Gospel, that 'tis there recommended as the proper Principle of Christian Life. For so, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii.10. we are told that <hi>love is the fulfilling of the law,</hi> that is, the adequate Principle of all Christian Obedience; and <hi>Gal.</hi> v.6. we are told that <hi>neither Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, nor uncircumcision availeth any thing in Christ Jesus, but faith which worketh by love,</hi> that is, there is nothing of any account with Christ, buch such a Belief of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as begets in us a hearty Love to God, and doth thereby work and exert it self, as by that which is the only genuine Principle of Christian Life and Action. 'Tis true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side this principle of Love, the Gospel acts us both by our Fear and Hope, exciting the one by Threatnings of the greatest Evils, and animating the other with Promises of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106959:85"/>
the greatest Goods; but yet it is certain that neither <hi>these</hi> nor <hi>any other</hi> Principles of religious Action can be acceptable to God, whilst they are totally separated from Love to him. For there is no Principle of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience can be acceptable to God that is not a Principle of Universal Obedience; but to <hi>love</hi> God being a great and main instance of Obedience, that can be no principle of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Obedience, which doth not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally excite us to <hi>love</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>'TIS true, the Religion of most men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins upon the Principles of Hope and Fear, and it cannot be denied but these are good <hi>Beginnings</hi>; but yet till by these we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to <hi>love</hi> God, as well as to do the other Parts of our Duty, our Obedience is <hi>lame</hi> and <hi>partial,</hi> and consequently <hi>unacceptable.</hi> So that though Hope and Fear are good <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients</hi> to compound an acceptable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Obedience, yet without an <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture</hi> of Love they are by no means suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. There may be indeed, and at first there generally is, much less of Love in this internal spring of our Obedience than of Hope or Fear, whilst yet the whole <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> is truly pleasing and acceptable to God. For the lowest degree of cordial Love intermixed with our Hope and Fear, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to <hi>leaven</hi> and <hi>consecrate</hi> them into

an acceptable Principle of Obedience; but still the less of Love there is in it, the more <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>languid,</hi> and <hi>imperfect</hi> it is, and in all its progresses towards Perfection, its <hi>ripeness</hi> and <hi>maturity</hi> is to be measured by the degrees of Love that are in it. And till our Love is arrived to that degree of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Ardency, as to become the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Motive</hi> and <hi>Master Ingredient</hi> of this our compounded Principle of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, our state in Goodness is very <hi>low</hi> and <hi>imperfect.</hi> So that in short, the Principle that acts and moves us in Religion, is still more and more perfect, the <hi>more</hi> of Love there is in it, and the <hi>less</hi> of Hope and Fear; and when Hope and Fear are both swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Love, and this is become the sole Spring of Action in us, then 'tis the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of Heaven, the <hi>Soul</hi> that acts and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the Religion of <hi>just men made perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SO that if ever we design to grow up to <hi>their</hi> blessed State, we must endeavour to <hi>kindle</hi> and <hi>blow up</hi> the Love of God in our Hearts. And in order hereunto we must be frequently representing to our own Minds, the infinite Reasons we have to <hi>love</hi> him, and pressing our selves with the vast Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations he hath laid upon us; spreading them fairly before our Thoughts in all their <hi>endearing</hi> Circumstances. We must ever
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106959:87"/>
and anon set our <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>frozen</hi> Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those <hi>melting Flames</hi> of his Love and Beauty, and never leave <hi>chafing</hi> them at 'em, <hi>urging</hi> and <hi>pressing</hi> them with the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them, till we feel the heavenly Fire begin to <hi>kindle</hi> in our Bosoms. And above all things we must take care by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Practice of what is agreeable to Gods Nature, to <hi>reconcile</hi> our Minds and Tempers to him; for till this is done we can never be habitually <hi>pleased</hi> or <hi>delighted</hi> in him; but when once by the Practice of those eternal Rules of Goodness that are founded in his blessed Nature, we have so far reconciled our Natures to him, as that <hi>our</hi> Hearts and <hi>his</hi> stand <hi>bent</hi> the same way, and are for the main alike <hi>inclined</hi> and <hi>disposed,</hi> then we are prepared for, and made proper and convenient <hi>Fuel</hi> to receive this heavenly <hi>Flame</hi> of Love to him; and when this is once so throughly <hi>kindled</hi> in our Hearts, as that we are habitually <hi>well pleased</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted</hi> in him, so as to <hi>rejoice</hi> in his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, <hi>acquiesce</hi> in his Will, and <hi>meditate</hi> on his Beauty and Goodness, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned <hi>complacency</hi> of Soul, we are then in the same State (that is in Kind, though not in Degree) with the blessed People of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And though in this Life we may not be able to raise our selves, to that Height of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106959:88"/>
Love as we <hi>desire,</hi> and much less as that blessed Object <hi>deserves,</hi> our present Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege being <hi>short,</hi> our Thoughts <hi>unsteady</hi> and our Affections <hi>entangled</hi> in Sense and sensual things; yet when we go from hence into the other World, and are there admitted to a more intimate View of his Nature, Works, and Perfections, our imperfect Love will be immediately improved into an high Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Flame. For now we shall not only <hi>know</hi> him better, having him always in our View, and continually shining full in our Eyes; but we shall be removed from all other Objects that are apt to divert our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> or divide our <hi>Affections</hi> from him. So that now our Love being kindled and fed with the purest Light, with the ever out-streaming Rays of the most perfect Beauty and Goodness, will always exert its utmost Vigour, and spend it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Decay in one continued everlasting Rapture.</p>
                  <p>AND then how unconceivably happy will our State be, when we shall always live in <hi>view</hi> of the most <hi>lovely</hi> Object, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>love</hi> him as much as we <hi>are able,</hi> and <hi>be able</hi> to love him a thousand times more than we can now <hi>imagine!</hi> For the longer we <hi>view</hi> the more we shall <hi>know</hi> him, and the more we <hi>know,</hi> the better we shall <hi>love</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:106959:88"/>
him, and so through everlasting ages our Love shall be <hi>stretching</hi> and <hi>extending</hi> it self upon his infinite Beauty and Loveliness. Now Love is naturally a most <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> Passion, a Passion that <hi>sooths</hi> and <hi>ravishes</hi> the Heart, and puts the Spirits into a <hi>brisk</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> motion. For it wholly consists in a fixed <hi>complacency</hi> or <hi>well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness</hi> of Mind arising from the apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Goodness and Congruity of the thing beloved; and it is meerly by accident that it hath any <hi>disquieting</hi> or <hi>ungrateful</hi> Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mingled with it. Either the Person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is <hi>absent,</hi> which fills it with <hi>unquiet Desire</hi>; or he is <hi>unhappy,</hi> or <hi>unkind,</hi> which mingles it with <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi>; or he is <hi>fickle</hi> and <hi>inconstant</hi> which imbitters it with <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Jealousie</hi>; but consider it separately from all these Accidents, and it is nothing but pure <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Complacency.</hi> But now in Heaven our Love of God will have none of these <hi>disquieting</hi> Accidents attending it, for there he will never be <hi>absent</hi> from us, but continually entertaining our amorous Minds with the Prospect of his infinite Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; there we shall ever <hi>feel</hi> his Love to us in the most <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>endearing</hi> Effects, even in the Glory of that Crown which he will set upon our Heads, and in the ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sweetness of those Joys he will infuse
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106959:89"/>
into our Hearts; there we shall experience the <hi>continuation</hi> of his Love, in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Fruition of all that an everlasting Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven means, and be convinced as well by the Perpetuity of his Goodness to us, as by the Immutability of his Nature, that he is an <hi>unchangeable</hi> Lover: in a word, there we shall find him a most happy Being, <hi>happy</hi> beyond the vastest wishes of our Love, so that we shall not only <hi>delight</hi> in him as he is infinitely <hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>amiable,</hi> but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice</hi> and <hi>triumph</hi> in him too as he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>blessed</hi> and <hi>happy.</hi> For Love unites the <hi>Interests</hi> as well as the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Lovers, and mutually <hi>appropriates</hi> to each, each others Joys and Felicities. So that in that blessed State we shall share in the Felicity of God proportionably to the Degree of our Love to him. For the more we love him, the more we shall still <hi>espouse</hi> his happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and the more we are <hi>interested</hi> in his Happiness, the happier we must be, and the more we must enjoy of it. Thus Love gives us a real Possession and Enjoyment of God; it makes us Copartners with him in himself, and derives his Happiness upon us, and makes it as really <hi>ours</hi> as <hi>his.</hi> So that Gods Happiness is as it were the common <hi>Bank</hi> and <hi>Treasury</hi> of all divine Lovers, in which they have every one a <hi>Share,</hi> and of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106959:89"/>
which proportionably to the Degrees of their Love to him, they do actually <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate</hi> to all Eternity. And could they but love him as much as he <hi>deserves,</hi> that is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,</hi> they would be as <hi>infinitely</hi> blessed and happy as <hi>he.</hi> For then all <hi>his</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would be <hi>theirs,</hi> and they would have the same delightful Sense, and Feeling of it all, as if it were all transplanted into their own Bosoms. God therefore being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>lovely,</hi> infinitely <hi>loving,</hi> and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>happy</hi> Being, when once we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to dwell for ever in his blessed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, our Love to him can be productive of none but <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>ravishing</hi> emotions; for the immense perfections it will then find in its Object, must necessarily refine it from all those Fears and Jealousies, Griefs and Displeasures that are mingled with our <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> loves, and render it a pure <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Complacency.</hi> So that when once it is grown up to the Perfection of the heavenly State, 'twill be all Heaven, 'twill be an eternal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise of Delights within us, a living Spring whence Rivers of Pleasures will issue for evermore. O blessed State, in which my heart shall be brim-full of Love, and my Love shall triumph alone within me, and be all Joy and Ravishment, being removed for ever out of the Noise and Neighbourhood
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106959:90"/>
of all those disquieting Affections which here are wont to mingle with, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually disturb and incommode it!</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. AS we are rational Creatures related to <hi>God,</hi> we are obliged attentively to <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> him in all his imitable Perfections and Actions. For this is an allowed Maxim, <hi>Perfectissimum in suo genere est mensura re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquorum,</hi> that is, that which is most perfect in its kind is to be the rule and measure of all those Individual natures that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under it.

God therefore being the most perfect of all in the whole kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Beings, must needs be the supream Pattern of all those Individuals that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; and so far as any of them <hi>disagree</hi> with him, so far they are <hi>defective</hi> in their Natures. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Phil. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 132. <hi>i. e.</hi> God is the Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of every reasonable Nature, and Man is his Imitation and Image. For he is a Being that is infinitely reasonable in all his Voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Actions, that hath not the least intermixture either of Humour or Folly, or
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106959:90"/>
Prejudice in his Choices, but is always, and in every thing governed by his own pure and all-comprehending Wisdom. Upon which account he ought to be owned and looked upon by every reasonable Being, as the sovereign Standard and Pattern of their Natures; and so far as any reasonable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture moves or acts <hi>counter</hi> to his, which is the most <hi>perfectly</hi> reasonable, so far it ought to be looked upon as <hi>monstrous</hi> and <hi>unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> in its kind. For as it is monstrous in a humane Body to have its parts displaced, its Mouth opened in its Belly, or its Legs growing out of its Shoulders, because these are unnatural positions, that are directly contrary to the true Idea, Form and Figure of a humane body; so every reasonable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that doth not <hi>imitate</hi> and <hi>take after</hi> Gods, but chuseth and acts contrary to him, is so far monstrous and mishapen, because 'tis <hi>wrythed</hi> and <hi>distorted</hi> into a Figure that is directly contrary to its natural Pattern and Exemplar. And while it continues so, it is not capable of true Happiness. For that which renders God so infinitely happy in himself, is not so much the Almighty Power he hath to defend himself from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Hurts and Injuries, as the exact Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all his Motions and Actions, with the all-comprehending Reason of his own
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106959:91"/>
Mind. For he always sees what is best, and what he sees is best he always <hi>chuses</hi> and <hi>affects,</hi> and this makes him perfectly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with himself, and fills him with infinite Joy and Complacency; because when ever he surveys himself in the glorious mirrour of his own Mind, he discerns nothing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self but what is infinitely <hi>lovely,</hi> nothing but what exactly corresponds with the <hi>fairest Ideas</hi> of his own infinite Reason. Whereas if, upon an impossible Supposal, it were otherwise, there would arise a <hi>Civil War</hi> within his own Bosom, against which <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence</hi> it self could not <hi>protect</hi> or <hi>defend</hi> him. For in despight of himself he would be continually exposed to the just <hi>reproaches</hi> of his own Mind, and his own All-seeing Eye would every moment <hi>detect,</hi> and <hi>libel,</hi> and <hi>upbraid</hi> him, and render him a most <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious</hi> Spectacle to himself. So that he would be so far from being infinitely <hi>pleased</hi> and <hi>satisfied</hi> with himself, that his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Reason would be an everlasting <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>AND so will <hi>ours</hi> be to us, unless we take care to <hi>imitate</hi> God in those his divine Perfections, from whence his infinite <hi>self-satisfaction</hi> arises. For so long as we are conscious to our selves that we wilfully <hi>swerve</hi> and <hi>deviate</hi> from the great Exemplar
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106959:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of our rational Natures, we cannot but be <hi>ashamed of</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> our selves, and be highly <hi>dissatisfied</hi> with our own Actions. Our Conscience must necessarily <hi>reproach</hi> our Will, and our Reason <hi>upbraid</hi> our base Inclinations. Now what an intolerable plague is it for a man to be forced to make <hi>Invectives</hi> against himself, and continually to carry his own <hi>Satyrs</hi> in his bosom.

Like a desperate Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer who having killed an innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, reflects with <hi>Horrour</hi> upon his own Act, <hi>tears</hi> his Hair, <hi>beats</hi> his Breast, <hi>curses</hi> and calls himself a thousand Villains; but being hereby chased into a greater Fury, instead of <hi>reforming</hi> he grows more <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous,</hi> and so murthers another, and then rages <hi>afresh</hi> at his own Act, but still the more he <hi>rages,</hi> the more he <hi>murthers.</hi> And this will necessarily be our State in the other world, if through our neglect of <hi>imitating</hi> God, we go away thither under an habitual Contrariety of nature to him. Besides that we shall be wholly indisposed
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106959:93"/>
to those beatifical Acts of divine Love, Worship and Contemplation, in which, as I have shewed, a great part of the pleasure Heaven consists. For since all Love is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Likeness, and Likeness is the effect of Imitation, how is it possible we should love God unless we imitate him, and if we do not love him, what Pleasure can we take in contemplating and adoring him.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE in prosecution of its great Design, which is to make us happy, the Gospel strictly requires us to be always <hi>imitating,</hi> so far as they are imitable, the Perfections and Actions of our heavenly Father; to endeavour to <hi>form</hi> our Natures to his, to <hi>rectifie</hi> the Features and Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Souls by his most amiable I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea; to be continually <hi>framing</hi> our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, by the noble pattern of his Mercy and Goodness, his Justice, Purity, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that so being <hi>new cast</hi> as it were in the perfect mould of his Nature, we may be <hi>transformed</hi> into living Images of him. So <hi>Ephes.</hi> v.1. <hi>be ye therefore <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> imitators,</hi> or <hi>followers of God, as dear Children,</hi> i. e. that so you may resemble him in the Qualities of your Minds, as children do their Parents in the Lineaments of their Bodies. And this is the sense of all those Evangelical Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which require us <hi>to be pure as God
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106959:94"/>
is pure, merciful as he is merciful,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as our heavenly Father is perfect</hi>; that is, to take example by God in the whole course of our lives, and trace and follow him in all his imitable Perfections, by <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on that new, that god-like man,</hi> that divine temper and disposition, <hi>which after God,</hi> that is, according to the pattern of his Nature, <hi>is created in righteousness, and true holiness,</hi> Ephes. iv.24. This therefore is an essential part of our <hi>Christian Life,</hi> to set God always before our Eyes, as the great Pattern of our Lives and Actions, and to endeavour constantly to write after him, and transcribe his Graces into our Natures; that so when we go away into the other World, we may carry with us at least a rude and imperfect draught of his blessed Image upon our Minds, such as when we are removed from the manifold impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of flesh and blood, and the perpetual diversions of this sensitive World, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a near view of God, may be a prevailing byass upon our Wills, and incline us to imitate him for ever. For if for the main we are here transformed by imitating God into a <hi>godlike</hi> Temper and Disposition, all those <hi>involuntary contrarieties</hi> to him, which by reason of our Ignorance of his Nature, of our bodily Temper, and the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106959:94"/>
manifold Temptations we are here exposed to, are still remaining in our Natures, will be immediately extinguished upon our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival into the other World; where being freed from all our <hi>misconceptions</hi> of God, from all the <hi>repugnancies</hi> of our bodily Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him, and from all those <hi>Temptations</hi> that were wont to avert us from him, we shall have no <hi>involuntary</hi> Disposition or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in us; and then our Wills being already predominantly inclined to follow God, and take example by him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no contrary Inclination to contend with, we shall presently <hi>attend to</hi> and <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> his Perfections with the greatest Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, Freedom and Alacrity of Soul. So that now we shall be so <hi>intensely</hi> fixed to chuse and act like God, who is the Example and Pattern of our Natures, that we shall everlastingly regulate all our Motions by those very eternal Laws of Reason, whereby he everlastingly wills and acts; and there is nothing will be so abhorrent to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as an <hi>ungodlike</hi> Will or Action. For if as the Apostle tells us, <hi>by beholding now the glory of God in a glass, we are changed into the same image from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. iii.18. then doubtless much more shall we be so, when we behold him <hi>face to face.</hi> 'Tis true as our <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God who is

an infinite <hi>Truth</hi> can never be <hi>absolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> because if it were it would be an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> Knowledge; so neither can our <hi>Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> of him be, who is an infinite <hi>Goodness,</hi> because if it were we should be <hi>infinitely</hi> good; both which are contradictions to the state of a Creature: yet as we shall be <hi>knowing</hi> him farther and farther, so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably we shall be <hi>imitating</hi> him too through infinite Ages of Duration; and still every act of our Imitation shall be so <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>vigorous,</hi> that it shall leave a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impression of his infinite Perfection on our Natures. So that though our <hi>finite</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can never arrive to a <hi>perfect</hi> Likeness of that infinitely lovely and amiable Being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it can never be <hi>infinitely</hi> amiable; yet it shall be everlastingly <hi>approaching</hi> nearer and nearer to him, proportionably as it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers more and more of his infinite Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Amabilities, and be still growing more <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> more <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign,</hi> according as its prospect of the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Purity, Justice</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is enlarged and extended. So that as his Beauty shines into us, it will still im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print it self upon us, and transform us into blessed Images of it self; and then according as we are assimilated to the divine Nature, we shall still partake of those Joys and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106959:95"/>
which are inseparable to it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it in Bliss as much as we do in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For as Gods <hi>infinite</hi> Perfection is the spring of his <hi>infinite</hi> Self-satisfaction, so from our <hi>finite</hi> Perfection there shall ever redound to us a Satisfaction equal to our <hi>finite</hi> Capacities. For though we shall never attain to <hi>absolute</hi> Perfection, that is, to all the <hi>possible degrees</hi> of Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is the Peculiar of God; yet to Eternity we shall be <hi>growing on</hi> to it, and in every Period of our growth, we shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly what we <hi>ought to be,</hi> that is, we shall ever <hi>know</hi> as much of God as is possible for us, our present State and Circumstances considered; and so far as we <hi>know</hi> of him we shall to our utmost power continually <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> and <hi>resemble</hi> him. And thus in our eternal Race to Perfection, our Wills shall always follow our Understanding, and our Understandings shall always follow God with their utmost Vigour and Activity; so that neither the <hi>one</hi> nor the <hi>other</hi> shall ever be deficient of any Degree of Knowledge and Goodness which <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to them.</p>
                  <p>NOW what an unspeakable Satisfaction must this give to the Mind, when surveying it self round about, it shall find every thing within it self exactly as it <hi>ought to be</hi>; every
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106959:96"/>
Faculty to its utmost Power and Capacity perfectly <hi>corresponding</hi> with its original Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Exemplar; when upon the strictest Scrutiny it will discover nothing within it self, but what the most <hi>critical</hi> Conscience will be forced to approve of; no Motion or Action, but what will endure the Test of its <hi>severest</hi> Reason: in a word, when it shall interchangeably turn its Eyes from God to it self, and compare Grace with Grace, and Feature with Feature, and perceive what an amiable Consent and Agreement there is between its own <hi>Copy</hi> and his fair <hi>Original</hi>; what a pure <hi>Imitation</hi> of God its Life is, and how exactly <hi>Deiform</hi> all its Motions and Actions are: when, I say, our blessed Minds shall always find themselves in this <hi>Godlike</hi> Posture and Condition, O! what incomparable Content and Satisfaction will they take in themselves! With what enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing Pleasure will they ever review their own Motions, which being immediately copied from the Nature of God, will be such as its severest Reason will be always forced to commend and approve of! So that now the happy Mind will be always <hi>triumphing</hi> in its own Purity, and enjoy within it self an everlasting Heaven of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Peace; now 'twill continually be <hi>crowned</hi> with Applauses of its own Reason,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106959:96"/>
and all its Actions will have the joyful <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes</hi> of a well-pleased Conscience continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally resounding after them. And thus by imitating Gods <hi>Perfections,</hi> we shall imitate his <hi>Happiness</hi> too, and shall for ever <hi>take after</hi> him, not only in respect of the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our Natures, but also in the most blessed and comfortable Enjoyment of our selves. Besides that our Resemblance of God will everlastingly dispose us to <hi>love,</hi> and our Love to <hi>contemplate</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> him. For all these blessed Acts do reciprocally fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and promote each other; just like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous Bodies that are placed in a Circle, the first of which being moved thrusts on the second, the second the third, the third the last, if there be no more between; and then the last thrusts on the first, and so round again in the same order. So that if we carry with us into Eternity a Frame and Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature like Gods, we shall always so <hi>imitate</hi> as still to <hi>love</hi> him, so <hi>love</hi> as still to <hi>contemplate</hi> him, so <hi>contemplate</hi> as still to <hi>adore</hi> him, so <hi>adore</hi> as still to <hi>imitate,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>contemplate</hi> him anew; and in this blessed Circle we shall move round for ever, with unspeakable Vigour and Alacrity.</p>

For God hath a just Dominion ove<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> all, founded in his own infinite Power, that doth not like other Dominions result to him from any external Acts or Atchievements, but is the eternal Prerogative of his own Nature. For he, as well as all other Beings, hath a freedom to exercise his own Abilities so far as it is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi>; but being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely paramount to all other Powers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, he can be subject to no <hi>superiour</hi> Authority, nor consequently be obliged by any <hi>other</hi> Law but that of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that whatsoever he <hi>can</hi> do, he can <hi>justly</hi> do, if it be not contrary to the infinite Perfections of his Nature. For his Power being infinite, and unconfined as well as his Wisdom, Justice and Goodness, doth sufficiently warrant him to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is consistent with <hi>them</hi>; otherwise he would be infinitely powerful in vain. And therefore since he <hi>can</hi> exercise a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all, he must needs have an eternal Right to do it, so far as his own Wisdom, Goodness and Justice will permit, which are the only Laws by which he can be <hi>boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> in the exercise of his infinite Power and Ability. So that while he governs us by such Rules and Laws, as are convenient to his own Nature, his own Greatness and Power, which exalts him above all other
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106959:97"/>
Law or Authority, sufficiently warrants him so to do. And being thus <hi>rightfully</hi> enthroned by the infinite Preeminence of his own Power and Majesty, all other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings so far as they are capable stand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably obliged to <hi>submit</hi> and <hi>resign</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to his Government.</p>
                  <p>BUT besides that we are obliged to him as he is <hi>God,</hi> we are also bound to him as he is our <hi>Creatour.</hi> For there is always a Power acquired by <hi>Benefits,</hi> where there is none <hi>antecedently</hi>; especially where the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit confer'd is no less than that of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the case between us and God. And this is such a Benefit as is sufficient to entitle him to us, by an <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>unalie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> Propriety, though he had no <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> right of Dominion over us by virtue of his own infinite Greatness. So that though before he created us or any other Being, he had free Power to act any thing that lay within the compass of <hi>just</hi> and <hi>lawful,</hi> which <hi>just</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> was undefineable by any other Law but that of his own Nature; and though since his Creation his Power is no more than <hi>so,</hi> (so that he hath not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to himself any new <hi>Power</hi> by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us, but only made new <hi>Subjects</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to exercise that ancient Power, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which was eternally inherent in him)
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106959:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet doubtless by giving us our Beings, he hath laid <hi>new</hi> Obligations upon us to obey him. For now <hi>deriving</hi> our selves, as we do, from him, we are bound by all the ties of Equity and Justice to <hi>render back</hi> our selves to him, and to submit those powers to his Dominion, which are the effects and off-spring of his Bounty. For what can be more just and equal, than that <hi>that</hi> Will which is the <hi>Cause</hi> of our Beings, should be the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of our Actions; then that we should serve him with those Powers we derived from him, and render him back the fruits of his own Plantation? For now we are not <hi>our own</hi> but <hi>Gods,</hi> and He alone hath power to dispose of us; and whensoever we dispose of our selves contrary to his Will and Pleasure, we do not only <hi>invade</hi> his Property, but employ the spoils of it <hi>against</hi> him. And whilst we continue thus doing, it is impossible we should ever be happy. For besides that while we continue in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against him, we are in an actual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with Hell; for so when we are told that Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft, that is, Rebellion against God, the meaning is, that like Witches, we are in League with the Devil, and are listed Volunteers under those infernal Powers, who for blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trumpet of Rebellion in Heaven
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106959:98"/>
were banished thence six thousand years ago, and have ever since been raising Forces in this lower World against God; so that whilst we continue with them in Defiance to God, we are in the Devils Muster-Roll, who is Captain General of all the revolted Legions, and so are of the quite opposite Party to the Loyal people of Heaven, and consequently can never hope while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue such to be admitted to their Society and Happiness; besides all this, I say, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against God doth naturally draw a Hell of Miseries after it. For it cannot be supposed that the wise Sovereign of the World, should be so unconcerned for his own Authority, as to suffer his Creatures to <hi>spurn at</hi> and <hi>affront</hi> it without ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting his Displeasure against them in some <hi>dire</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> Effects. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though in <hi>this</hi> Life which is the time of our Tryal and Probation, he mercifully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears us <hi>to lead us to Repentance</hi>; yet if we leave this Life with our Wills <hi>unsubdued</hi> and <hi>unresigned</hi> to him, we must not expect to be thus gently dealt with in the other. For it is as easie for him who is the Father of our Spirits, to correct our Spirits, as 'tis for the Parents of our Flesh to correct our Flesh. And though our Souls are no more impressi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble with <hi>material</hi> stripes, than Sun-beams are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106959:99"/>
with the blows of a hammer; yet are they liable to have horrid and dismal <hi>thoughts</hi> impress'd upon them, and to be as much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved by <hi>them,</hi> as sensible Bodies are with the most exquisite Torments. So that if God be displeased with us there is no doubt but he can <hi>imprint</hi> his Wrath upon our Minds, in black and ghastly thoughts, and cause it perpetually to <hi>drop</hi> like burning sulphur on our Souls. And it being in his Power thus to lash our Spirits, to be sure, when once he is implacably incensed against us (as he will be in the other World if we go Rebels thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) he will more or less let loose his Power upon us, and make us feel his wrathful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments, by infusing supernatural Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours into our Souls, and scourging our guilty and defenceless Spirits with inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of dire and frightful Thoughts. Now though this be not a <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> Effect of our Rebellion against God, because it depends upon his Will who is a free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; yet considering that he is a <hi>wise</hi> Agent, and that as such it is necessary he should one way or other manifest his Displeasure against such as are unreclaimable Rebels to his authority, it is <hi>next</hi> to a natural one; and at least the fearful Expectation of it in such rebellious spirits (which is a misery next to the enduring it) is <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable.</hi>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:106959:99"/>
For God hath imprinted a dread of his own Power and Majesty so deeply on our Natures, that we are not able with all our arts of Self-deceit wholly to <hi>obliterate</hi> and <hi>deface</hi> it; and though in this life we may sometimes <hi>suppress</hi> and <hi>stupifie</hi> our Sense of God, yet even <hi>here</hi> in despight of our selves, 'twill ever and anon <hi>return</hi> upon us. And if when we have done what we know is offensive to that invisible Majesty we stand in aw of, we do but suffer our selves seriously to <hi>reflect</hi> upon it, there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently arises in our minds a swarm of <hi>horrid</hi> Thoughts and <hi>dismal</hi> Expectations; and if in this present State in which we have so many Salvo's for our wounded spirits, so many Pleasures and Self-delusions to charm our natural dread of God, our overcharged Consciences do notwithstanding so often <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil</hi> upon us, and <hi>alarm</hi> us with such dismal abodings; what will they do hereafter, when all those Pleasures are <hi>removed,</hi> and all those Self-delusions <hi>baffled</hi> with which we were wont to sooth and divert them. Then doubtless we shall be continually stung with sharp and dire Reflections, and our Consciences like tragick Scenes be all hung round with the Ensigns of Horrour; then shall the dread of God perpetually haunt us like a grim Fury, and the terrour
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106959:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his offended Majesty strike us into an everlasting Trembling and Agony. For so S. <hi>James</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Devils themselves do believe and tremble,</hi> James ii.19. they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is an Almighty Being above them, and are conscious that they are in actual Rebellion against him, which makes them horribly afraid of his vengeance; and yet such is the inveterate devilishness of their Natures, that they will by no means hearken to a Submission, but in despight of their own Dread and Horrour, do still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in an open Defiance to their Almighty Enemy, and so tremble and sin, and sin and tremble for ever. And so shall we, if we go into the other World habitual Rebels to God; our deep and inveterate malice against him will still hurry us on to <hi>incense</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi> him, and then our natural <hi>Dread</hi> of his Power and Majesty will break into <hi>fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>horrible</hi> Thoughts, and so be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually revenging upon us those our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual provocations of him. For then our soul will be nakedly exposed to the lash of its own <hi>furious</hi> thoughts, and have no shield to defend it self against the terrours of its <hi>guilty</hi> Conscience, which being rouzed up and kept awake by the <hi>unintermitting</hi> Sense of our misery, will be always <hi>clamouring</hi> upon us, and continually <hi>torturing</hi> us with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106959:100"/>
black and horrid Reflections. So that whilst we are wandering among <hi>wretched</hi> Ghosts, through those <hi>dismal</hi> shades below, we shall be perpetually meditating <hi>Horrours,</hi> and never leave lashing our selves with our own <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>terrible</hi> thoughts, till we have chased our selves into <hi>Furies,</hi> and boiled up our self-condemning Rage into an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Madness. Thus as our sense of our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeness</hi> to God will ever fill us with <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Confusion,</hi> so will the sense of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> against him continually strike us into <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Amazement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO prevent which, our holy Religion, which doth so industriously consult our Happiness, requires us now to <hi>submit our selves to God,</hi> James iv.7. <hi>to live to God,</hi> Gal. ii.19. <hi>to present our selves living sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, holy and acceptable to God,</hi> Rom. xii.1. <hi>to yield our selves unto God, and our members as instruments of righteousness unto God,</hi> Rom. vi.13. the sense of all which is, that we should endeavour, so to affect our Minds with the sense of Gods Authority over us, and with the manifold Reasons of our obedience to him, as to be firmly and constantly resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved within our selves, neither to <hi>chuse</hi> any thing that he <hi>forbids,</hi> nor to <hi>refuse</hi> any thing that he <hi>commands</hi>; that we should set him up a Throne in our Hearts, a <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing</hi>

Resolution of Obedience, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he may sit and reign, and have the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Empire and Command of all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motions and outward Actions; in a word, that we should acquire such an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Respect to and Reverence of his sovereign Authority, that no temptation from <hi>within</hi> or <hi>without</hi> us, may be able to countermand it, or to seduce us from our duty into any wilful course of Rebellion against him. And when once we have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our minds into this obediential Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we are in a forward preparation for Heaven. And though by reason of those Remains and Reliques of corrupt Nature that are in us, which are here continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally excited by the many Temptations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which we live, we may find <hi>reluctant</hi> and <hi>counter-striving</hi> Principles within us; a <hi>stubborn</hi> Appetite contending against an <hi>obedient</hi> Will, and sometimes upon <hi>Surprize</hi> or <hi>Inadvertence</hi> over-powering it; yet if we heartily <hi>bewail</hi> this as our Unhappiness, and if when we thus fall we <hi>weep</hi> and <hi>rise again,</hi> and take <hi>more</hi> care of our steps for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we shall carry with us when we go from hence into the other World a Will that is habitually <hi>resigned</hi> to God; and so being there removed from all the Temptations that were wont to excite in us those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106959:101"/>
Appetites and Inclinations, we shall immediately become <hi>all</hi> Duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and freely give up our selves to God without the least shadow of <hi>Contest,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy.</hi> And in this blessed State we shall continue for ever, so <hi>intirely</hi> devoted to God that between him and us there shall ever be one common Will, and End, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; and our Hearts which before were in <hi>a great measure</hi> set and tuned to the Heart of God, will be instantly such <hi>perfect Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> with it, that whensoever, or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he speaks, we shall still <hi>resound</hi> and <hi>eccho</hi> to him, from our inmost bowels, with unspeakable Chearfulness and Alacrity.</p>
                  <p>AND being thus reduced to a perfect <hi>Submission</hi> to the Will of God, we shall therein find our selves incomparably happy. For now our Wills being always determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Will of God, we shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly eased of all the <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Distraction</hi> of chusing. Now our Minds will no longer hover in <hi>Suspence,</hi> nor be divided between <hi>contrary</hi> Reasons, but all its thoughts will glide gently on in a calm and even Current, without ever being tossed and bandied to and fro by <hi>cross</hi> and <hi>opposite</hi> Deliberations. For now it no sooner knows the Will of God, but it rests in it immediately with a <hi>free</hi> Assent, and <hi>uncontrolled</hi> Approbation;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106959:102"/>
so that upon <hi>new</hi> Occasions it's free from the trouble of forming <hi>new</hi> Choices and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being already fixt under all Events to one <hi>steady</hi> Course of Motion, and <hi>immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably</hi> resolved whatever befals, ever to do what God would have it. And its will thus perfectly acquiescing in God as in its proper Place and Element, it will no longer dispute as it was wont to do, no longer waver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Loadstones, but always obey upon the first Motion, and follow him for ever without Deliberation. In which happy state we shall be no longer ground between those <hi>coutermoving</hi> Milstones, <hi>the law in our Minds,</hi> and <hi>the law in our Members,</hi> but being intirely <hi>resigned</hi> to God we shall ever obey him <hi>secundo flumine,</hi> with a full Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Inclination, and Nature. And what a mighty Ease must this be to the Soul; especially considering that by being thus entirely subject to God, it will not only be released from the <hi>Trouble</hi> of chusing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating, but also throughly warranted of the <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Rectitude</hi> of its own Choices. For so far as we are subject unto God, <hi>our</hi> Wills are <hi>his,</hi> and so are our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too; and whilst they are so, we can have no reason to mistrust, either that they are <hi>bad</hi> in themselves, or that he is <hi>angry</hi> and <hi>displeased</hi> at them. For his Will we
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106959:102"/>
know is governed by his Nature, which is the <hi>Standard</hi> of Good and Evil, the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> of Right and Wrong; so that while we <hi>will</hi> and <hi>act</hi> as he would have us, we have a sufficient warrant for what we do; a warrant that will for ever <hi>bear us out</hi> and <hi>justifie</hi> us to our own Minds, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways render us abundantly <hi>satisfied</hi> with our selves; so that we shall not only always <hi>acquit</hi> but always <hi>reverence</hi> our selves, and our Conscience will not only cease to <hi>shame</hi> us, but be continually <hi>applauding</hi> and <hi>smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> upon us, and instead of those impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Clamours</hi> with which it was wont to entertain us, its constant eccho to all our actions will be <hi>well done good and profitable servant.</hi> So that being entirely determined by the Will of God, which never varies from the Law of his Nature, we shall be perfectly <hi>satisfied</hi> with our selves, and for ever <hi>chuse</hi> and <hi>act</hi> without the least <hi>Mistrust</hi> or <hi>Hesitance.</hi> And then our Wills being perfectly subject to his, and all our powers of action entirely at his Devotion, we shall never have the least ground to fear or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his <hi>Displeasure,</hi> but be always fully satisfied that he <hi>loves</hi> us, that we are <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>pretious</hi> in his Eyes, and that to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he will <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>look upon</hi> us with the smiles of an unchangeable Complacency.

The sense of which will ravish our Hearts and for ever fill us <hi>with joy unspeakable and full of glory.</hi> So that whereas rebellious Souls are perpetually haunted with two restless Furies, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>shame</hi> of their <hi>guilt</hi> and the <hi>fear</hi> of their <hi>danger,</hi> which even here do give them more <hi>disturbance</hi> than all their sins can <hi>pleasure,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi>; when once we are perfectly <hi>subjected</hi> to God, we shall be for ever discharged of them <hi>both,</hi> and then will our happy minds be always as <hi>couragious</hi> as Truth, and as <hi>confident</hi> as Innocence it self.</p>
                  <p>AND as by our perfect <hi>Submission</hi> to God, we shall be wholly released from the <hi>trouble</hi> of chusing, and sufficiently warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our own <hi>Choices,</hi> so we shall be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly <hi>satisfied</hi> both of the Wisdom and Success of them. For then we shall be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, even by a sweet and happy Experience, that whatsoever God commands us to do he most certainly knows that it is for our good, and that <hi>that</hi> is the Reason why he commands it. So that when we are entirely <hi>subjected</hi> to God, our Choices and Actions will be all directed by an infallible Wisdom to our own good. For while we chuse what God would have us, our Wills are guided by Gods Wisdom, and so in every genuine act of Obedience we are as <hi>infallible</hi>

as Omniscience it self. When therefore we are perfectly <hi>resigned</hi> to God, we shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will and act with as much <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> of a happy and prosperous Success as if we our selves were infinitely wise, and had a perfect Comprehension of all possible Issues and Events. And whilst wretched Rebels grope about under the Conduct of their own blind Wills, and for the most part do they know not <hi>what,</hi> and go they know not <hi>where</hi> themselves, but live by <hi>chance,</hi> and act <hi>at random</hi>; our Wills and Actions being wholly steered by an All-wise Will, that never fails to measure them by the best Rules, and point them to the best Ends, we shall be always sure of our hands, and know infallibly before hand that every thing we <hi>will</hi> or <hi>do</hi> shall conspire to our own good. And this will enable us to perform the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Race of our Obedience, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Freedom and Alacrity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways render us wondrous light, and nimble, and expedite in our Operations. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as when men know not what may happen upon such an Action, and are not able to pry out all those hidden Events, that lurk in the Womb of their own Designs, they always act with <hi>Caution</hi> and <hi>Anxiety,</hi> and are <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>tremulous</hi> in their Motions; when once we are sure of a good Event, we
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106959:104"/>
still go on with Courage, and Chearfulness; and so we shall ever do, when we ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>will</hi> and <hi>act</hi> under the command of God. For now we shall always see good Issues before us, and be firmly assured from that infallible Wisdom which governs <hi>his</hi> Will, and by his <hi>ours,</hi> that every thing we will or do shall be crowned with a happy Effect. And this will for ever wing our Souls with an unwearied Vigour and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and render each act of our Obedience unspeakably <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> to us. And now O blessed mind! what Tongue or Thought can reach thy happiness; who living in a most perfect Subjection to an All-good and All-wise Will, art never in the least concerned or troubled to <hi>debate</hi> and <hi>deliberate</hi> what to chuse, but dost ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly embrace and follow what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodness, and an infinite Wisdom hath <hi>chosen</hi> for thee!</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. AS we are reasonable Creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to <hi>God,</hi> we are also obliged chearfully to <hi>trust in</hi> and <hi>depend upon</hi> him. For as he is the Prop and Center of all the moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creation, the Almighty <hi>Atlas,</hi> that bears it upon his Shoulders, and keeps it from sinking into Ruine, we and every Creature in Heaven and Earth do hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and draw our breath from him,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106959:104"/>
and if he shake us off but for a moment, we presently drop into nothing and perish. For could we exist of our selves this <hi>present</hi> moment, we might as well have done so the moment <hi>before,</hi> and may as well do so the moment <hi>after,</hi> and so backward and forward to all Eternity; and unless we had such a Fulness of Essence in us, as to exist of our selves from all eternity past to all eternity to come, it is impossible we should exist so much as one <hi>moment</hi> without new supplies from the infinite and independent Fountain of Being. And what can be more fit or reasonable than that we who are thus born up by him, should freely <hi>trust in</hi> and <hi>depend upon</hi> him; than that we should build our Hope upon the Prop of our Existence, and make him the Stay of our Confidence in whom <hi>we live and move and have our being?</hi> Especially considering what a proper Object of Trust and Dependance he is; and that not only as he is the sovereign Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposer of all those Issues and Events which concern us, but also as he is infinitely Wise, and always understands what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>hurtful</hi> to us, and as he stands engaged both by his own <hi>essential</hi> Goodness, and <hi>free</hi> Promise never to fail those that put their Trust in him, but to manage all their Affairs to their everlasting Interest and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106959:105"/>
And in whom can we more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally <hi>confide</hi> than in a Being of infinite Wisdom, Goodness and Power; that always <hi>knows</hi> what is best for us, that always <hi>wills</hi> what he <hi>knows</hi> so, and always <hi>does</hi> what he <hi>wills?</hi> All which considered, its certainly incomparably more to our Interest and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that our Concerns should lie in his hands, and be managed as he sees best, than that every thing should happen to us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our own Will and Desire. For there are innumerable things which in the natural Series and Order of Causes are <hi>concomitant</hi> and <hi>consequent</hi> to every Event, the greatest part of which are out of the Sphere of our Cognizance; by reason of which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for us to make an infallible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> of any Event that befals us; because though we may be secure that such an Event <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> by it self may be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> for us, yet for all we know there may be such Concomitants or Consequents inseparable to it, as may quite alter its Nature, and render that <hi>evil,</hi> which considered <hi>singly</hi> may be good for us, or that <hi>good</hi> which considered <hi>singly</hi> may be evil. We earnestly wish for such an Event, and are very confident it would be mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to us; but alas! if <hi>it</hi> should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal us, according to the Series of things a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106959:105"/>
thousand <hi>others</hi> must, and what they wil<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> prove we are not able to prognosticate; but for all we know, the Mischief of <hi>them</hi> may abundantly out-weigh the Benefit of <hi>this.</hi> And this being so, how extremely unfit are we to make Choices for our selves, since in most particulars 'tis almost an equal lay whether what we chuse will prove our <hi>Food</hi> or our <hi>Poison?</hi> But now God being the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Orderer and Disposer of things, and having the <hi>first</hi> link of every Chain of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in his own hands, must needs have an intire Comprehension of all the <hi>intermediate</hi> ones, from the beginning to the end; and his Power being not only the cause of all <hi>actual</hi> Events, but also of the <hi>possibility</hi> of those that shall never be actual, he must needs discern the utmost Issues and Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants of every <hi>possible,</hi> as well as of every <hi>future</hi> Event, and perfectly understand not only what <hi>will</hi> be beneficial or injurious to us, but also what <hi>might</hi> be so. So that 'tis impossible for him to be mistaken in his Choices, because he knows as well before hand what things <hi>would</hi> be to us if they <hi>were,</hi> as what they <hi>are</hi> when they do <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> exist. Upon the whole therefore 'tis doubtless of inestimable Advantage to us, to be in the hands of God; and verily next to Hell it self, I know nothing that is more
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106959:106"/>
formidable than for God to let us alone, and give us up to our own Wills and Desires. And should he call to us from Heaven, and tell us, that he was resolved to cross our Desires no more, but to comply with all our Wishes, let the event prove good or bad, we should have just reason to look upon our selves as the most <hi>forlorn</hi> and <hi>aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned</hi> Creatures on this side Hell, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons excluded from the greatest Blessing that belongs to a Creature; and if we had any hope of his re-acceptance of us, it would be infinitely our Interest to <hi>resign</hi> back our selves, and all our concerns to him, and on our bended knees to beseech him above all things not to leave us to <hi>our selves,</hi> or throw us from <hi>his</hi> Care and Conduct. It being therefore upon all accounts so highly fit and reasonable, and so much to our Interest and Advantage, that we should freely <hi>trust</hi> our selves, and all our Affairs into the hands of God, and <hi>depend</hi> upon him for the good success of all our honest Endeavours and Undertakings; that we should acquiesce in his Disposal of things, and under all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward events be pleased and satisfied with his Conduct, as knowing that howsoever things may happen to us, they cannot be otherwise than as the wise and good God is pleased either to permit, or to order and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106959:106"/>
determine them; this I say being so fit in it self, and so much for our Interest, it is impossible that without it we can be happy either here or hereafter. For since both our Being and Well-being are wholly dependent on the Will of God, and we can neither <hi>be,</hi> nor be <hi>happy</hi> one moment longer than he pleases, how is it possible we should ever be <hi>quiet,</hi> and <hi>satisfied</hi> in our own minds without a great <hi>Assurance</hi> of and <hi>Confidence</hi> in him? When we consider what a mighty Stake we have in his hands, how all our Fortunes lie at his feet, and how easily he can frown us into <hi>nothing,</hi> or spurn us into a Condition ten thousand times <hi>worse</hi> than nothing when ever he pleases, how can we be otherwise <hi>secure</hi> in our own minds, or avoid being eternally <hi>anxious</hi> and <hi>solicitous,</hi> but by firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>relying</hi> on his Truth and Goodness; to the want of which is to be attributed all that <hi>carking</hi> Care, <hi>tormenting</hi> Fear and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting</hi> Thoughtfulness, which perpetually haunts the minds of men. They are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that their Condition is dependent, and that it is not in their own Power, either to make it what they would have it, or to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and continue it when it is made so; they know that by a thousand Chances which in despight of their Foresight or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may happen, the next moment either
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106959:107"/>
themselves may be snatched from what they possess, or what they possess may be snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them; they find that their most probable Designs are liable to innumerable Miscarriages, and that when they have formed their Projects never so wisely, there are infinite cross Accidents may intercurr and dash them in pieces; and in this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain State of their Affairs, they either think not of God at all, but live at the Courtesie of a fickle Chance, and leave themselves to be tossed, and bandied to and fro at the pleasure of a blind and undesigning Fortune, upon whose ever-moving Wheel their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thoughts can never rest; or if they think of God, it is with great <hi>Mistrust</hi> and <hi>Despondency</hi>; they fear he will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardful enough of them, nor prove so kind to them as they could wish, and are possest with an obstinate opinion that 'twould be much better for them to be their own Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, than to live at his Disposal and Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And hence proceed all those Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Discontents, those <hi>fretting</hi> Cares, <hi>dismaying</hi> Fears, <hi>perplexing</hi> and <hi>misgiving</hi> Thoughts, which do continually gaul and disquiet them; and from these their thorny disquietudes it is impossible they should ever be wholly free, no not in Heaven it self, till they have wrought their Minds to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106959:107"/>
a perfect <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in God. For we shall be altogether as dependent upon God for our <hi>heavenly,</hi> as we are for our <hi>earthly</hi> Happiness; because, though all those Acts of heavenly Virtue, in which our heavenly Happiness consists, will be much <hi>more</hi> in our own Power, than any of these worldly goods are, yet they will be no <hi>longer</hi> in our Power than God shall think fit to enable us to chuse, and act, and to support us in our Being and Existence, which then we shall sensibly perceive entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the All-enlivening vigour of his vital breath. And therefore though he hath <hi>promised</hi> to continue our being in that most blessed State for ever, yet unless we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>trust</hi> in his Veracity, our Minds will be continually disturbed with anxious and misgiving Thoughts; we shall be afraid lest one time or other he should forget his Promise, and upon some unknown Reason or Emergency withdraw from us that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his All-upholding Power, upon which our Being and Well-being depends, and let us drop into Nothing. And the <hi>greater</hi> our Happiness is, the <hi>more</hi> we should be afraid of losing it; because we should be always sensible that it entirely depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pleasure of God, whose Truth and Goodness, we could not perfectly <hi>confide</hi> in.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106959:108"/>
So that were we placed in the midst of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a <hi>misgiving, distrustful</hi> Mind of God, <hi>that</hi> would imbitter all the joys of it, and give them a harsh and ungrateful Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel. For the <hi>fearful</hi> Apprehensions we should continually have of being thrust out of Heaven again, and tumbled headlong from all our Glory, would be such a <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual</hi> Affliction to us, that we should even <hi>pine away</hi> our happy Eternity, for fear of being eternally deprived of it. So impossible it is for any dependent Being to be happy, without an entire <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in God upon whom its Being and Happiness depends.</p>
                  <p>AND therefore the Gospel to render our future Happiness compleat, endeavours to train us up before-hand to a firm and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Confidence</hi> in God, by making it an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of our duty to <hi>commit the keeping of our souls to God in well-doing,</hi> 1 Pet. iv.19. <hi>to trust in the living God who gives us all things richly to enjoy,</hi> 1 Tim. vi.17. <hi>not to trust in our selves but in God who raiseth the dead,</hi> 2 Cor. i.9. <hi>to believe in God,</hi> and not be troubled at any Events which happen to us in this world, <hi>John</hi> xiv.1. and <hi>not to cast away our confidence, Heb.</hi> x.35. and the like; the Sense of all which is, to press and engage us to a constant and chearful <hi>Relyance</hi> upon
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106959:108"/>
God, and to endeavour to affect our minds with a deep sense of his over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and a full Assurance of the Goodness of all those great Designs he is driving on in the World; and accordingly to <hi>acquiesce</hi> in, and <hi>embrace</hi> all Events as the tokens of his Love and Favour, and always to live upon this Persuasion, that it is infinitely better for us to be in Gods hands than in our own, and that he knows much better how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose of us, and our affairs than we do, and that he will take care to dispose of them as much to our advantage as we our selves should, if <hi>we</hi> knew as much as <hi>he</hi> doth. Now though by reason of those strong Impressions which sensible things in this Life of Sense make upon us, we should not <hi>always</hi> be able so firmly to <hi>rely</hi> upon, and <hi>repose</hi> our selves in Gods invisible Power, as not to be at all disquieted about the Issues and Events of things; yet if by frequent acts of <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Relyance</hi> on him, we have so disposed our minds to <hi>confide</hi> in him, as that by looking up to his over-ruling Providence, we can <hi>ordinarily</hi> stay and support our selves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the Changes and Revolutions of this world; if when a storm of Adversity hangs lowring over, or showers down upon us, we can flie to God for shelter, and promise our selves Safety and Protection under the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106959:109"/>
out-stretched wings of his Providence; in a word, if when we smart, we can <hi>ordinarily</hi> hope in him, and rest persuaded that under his gracious Conduct and Disposal, all things shall work together for our good; this our <hi>imperfect, wavering</hi> Hope and Dependance, shall in the other life be immediately ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a most perfect <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> For there we shall be wholly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from this Life of Sense, by which our <hi>Trust</hi> in Gods invisible Providence is very much <hi>weakned</hi> and <hi>distracted</hi>; and besides we shall have much <hi>quicker</hi> and <hi>clearer</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of his Nature, and of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Reasons we have to <hi>confide</hi> in him. And then when after all the threats of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous Voyage, we shall find our selves landed in a blessed World, and possessed of all its promised Glories, this mighty <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment</hi> of Gods Fidelity and Goodness, will immediately settle our predisposed minds, into such an immovable <hi>Confidence</hi> in him, as that from thenceforth no <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Distrust</hi> will ever find the least access to our thoughts, but we shall be so perfectly assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his Truth and Goodness, that though we shall feel our selves sustained and blest every moment by the arbitrary Influences of his Benignity and Power, yet we shall be as <hi>confident</hi> for ever of the continuance of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106959:109"/>
our bliss, as we could be, if we did <hi>self-exist,</hi> and held the eternity of our Being and Happiness as independently as God doth <hi>his.</hi> For though our Condition will be ever <hi>dependent,</hi> yet'twill be ever depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon such a foundation as can no more fail than Gods own Life and Being; <hi>viz.</hi> upon his Veracity and Goodness, both which are so essential to him, as that he cannot exist without them. And knowing our selves so firmly secured in this our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent State, as that we can never sink unless God himself sink under us, we shall be to all Eternity not only as <hi>safe,</hi> but as <hi>satisfied</hi> in it, as if we were every one a God to himself; and in this blessed Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we shall quietly enjoy God and our selves for ever. So that our <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> in God will crown the Pleasure of all our other Virtues, by giving us full Security of an everlasting Fruition of it. For now the ravished mind will have no <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust</hi> to cramp or arrest it, in its blessed ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; no <hi>anxious</hi> Thoughts of a sad futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to sower its present enjoyments; but 'twill enjoy <hi>all</hi> Heaven every moment, in a fearless Security of enjoying it <hi>all</hi> for ever. And when it shall perfectly <hi>love, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> God, with a sure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Confidence,</hi> of <hi>contemplating, loving</hi> and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106959:110"/>
                     <hi>adoring</hi> him perfectly for ever, O! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably will this enhance the Pleasure of those beatifical Acts! For now in every moment of all our blessed Eternity, we shall still have the Joy of a blessed Eternity to come; and besides all those Pleasures which each present moment of our heavenly Life shall abound with, we shall still have the Pleasure of a Prospect of infinite Ages of Pleasure. And thus the blessed mind, you see, by its perfect <hi>Dependance</hi> upon God, consummates its own Heaven, and secures it self for ever in a most quiet and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed Enjoyment of it.</p>
                  <p>BY all which I think it sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, how much each of these <hi>Divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> which as rational Creatures we are obliged to exert, and exercise upon <hi>God,</hi> contributes to our heavenly Happiness; and consequently, how indispensably necessary our present Practice of them is to <hi>dispose</hi> and <hi>capacitate</hi> us to enjoy it.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>MAN of all sublunary Creatures is the most adapted for <hi>Society.</hi> For though the greatest part of other Creatures do <hi>covet</hi> Society, as well as he, yet <hi>he</hi> alone is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with that gift of Nature which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Society most <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>useful,</hi> and that is the gift of <hi>Speech.</hi> By means of which we can express our Thoughts, and maintain a mutual Intelligence of Minds, with one another; and thereby divert our Sorrows, mingle our Mirth, impart our Secrets, communicate our Counsels, and make mutual Compacts and Agreements to supply and assist each other. And in these things consists the greatest <hi>Vse</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> of Society. And as of all Creatures we are the best <hi>fitted</hi> for Society, so we stand in the greatest <hi>need</hi> of it. For as for other Creatures, after they come into the World they are much <hi>sooner</hi> able to help themselves than <hi>we</hi>; and after we are most able to help
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106959:111"/>
our selves, there are a world of Necessaries and Conveniences <hi>without</hi> which we cannot be happy, and <hi>with</hi> which we cannot be supplied without each others aid and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; which in an <hi>unsociable</hi> State of Life we should of all Creatures in the World be the most indisposed to render to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as <hi>Aristotle de Repub. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 298. hath observed, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> As man in his perfect state is the best of all Animals, so separated from Law and Right he is the worst. For out of Society we see his Nature presently degenerates, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being inclined to assist, grows al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways most salvage and barbarous to his own kind. Since therefore we have so much need of each others help, Society is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to cherish and preserve in us our natural Benevolence towards one another, without which instead of being mutually <hi>helpful,</hi> we should be mutually <hi>mischievous.</hi> For as the same Philosopher hath observed, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Id. ibid.</hi> He that cannot contract Society with others, or through his own Self-sufficiency doth not need it, belongs not to any Commonwealth,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106959:111"/>
but is either a wild Beast, or a God. We being therefore so framed for Society, and under such necessities of entring into it, it hence necessarily follows, that being <hi>asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated</hi> together, we are all obliged in our several Ranks and Stations so to behave our selves towards one another as is most for the <hi>Common Good</hi> of All; and that since the Happiness of each <hi>particular</hi> Member of our Society redounds from the Welfare of the <hi>Whole,</hi> and is involved in it, we ought to esteem nothing good for <hi>our selves</hi> that is a Nuisance to the <hi>Publick.</hi> Because what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>this</hi> suffers, I and every man suffer; and unless I could be happy <hi>alone,</hi> that can never be for my Interest in <hi>particular,</hi> that is against my Interest in <hi>common.</hi> Now in such a mutual Behaviour as most conduces to our common Benefit and Happiness as we are in Society with one another, consists all <hi>Social Virtue</hi>; the proper Use and Design of which is to preserve our Society with one another, and to render it a common Blessing to us all. And hereunto five things are necessary, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we be <hi>charitably</hi> disposed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we be <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> in all our Intercourses with each other.</p>

                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:106959:112"/>3. That we behave our selves <hi>peaceably</hi> in our respective States and Relations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That we be very <hi>modest</hi> towards those that are <hi>Superiour</hi> to us in our Society, whether it be in Desert or Dignity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That we be very <hi>treatable</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending</hi> to all that are <hi>Inferiour</hi> to us. Under these Particulars are comprehended all those <hi>Social Virtues</hi> upon which the Welfare and Happiness of Humane Society depends. Now that the Practice of all these is included in the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> and doth effectually conduce to our everlasting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, I shall endeavour particularly to prove. And</p>
                  <p n="1">I. AS rational Creatures <hi>associated</hi> and so related to <hi>one another,</hi> we are obliged to be <hi>kindly</hi> and <hi>charitably</hi> disposed towards each other. For the end of our Society being mutually to <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> one another; it is necessary in order hereunto that we should every one be <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>benevolent</hi> to every one, that so we may be continually inclined mutually to aid and do good Offices to one another. And so far as we fall short of <hi>this,</hi> we fall short of the End of our Society. For to be sure the less we <hi>love</hi> one another, the less prone we shall be to <hi>promote</hi> and <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> each others Welfare, and consequently the less Advantage we shall reap from our
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106959:112"/>
mutual Society. But if instead of <hi>loving,</hi> we <hi>malign</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> each other, our Society will be so far from contributing to our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, that it will be only a means of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring us more <hi>miserable.</hi> For it will only furnish us with fairer Opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mischief</hi> to one another, and that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Intercourse we shall have by being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in Society will supply us with greater Means and Occasions to wreak our <hi>spight</hi> upon each other. For Society puts us within each others reach, and by that means (if we are enemies) renders us more <hi>dangerous</hi> to one another; like two adverse Armies, which when they are at a Distance can do but little hurt, but when they are joined and mingled never want opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to destroy and butcher one another. So that <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> you see, renders our Society a Plague, and we were much better live <hi>apart</hi> poorly and solitarily, and withdraw from one another as Beasts of Prey do into their separate Dens, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in one anothers reach, and be always liable, as we must be while we are in Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, to be <hi>baited</hi> and <hi>worried</hi> by one another.</p>
                  <p>AND as <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> spoils all our Society in <hi>this</hi> Life, and renders it worse than the most dismal Solitude, so it will also in the <hi>other.</hi> For whensoever the Souls
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106959:113"/>
of men do leave their Bodies, they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less flock to the Birds of their own Feather, and consort themselves with such separate Spirits as are of their own Genius and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For besides that good and bad Spirits are by the eternal Laws of the other World distributed into two <hi>separate</hi> Nations, and there live <hi>apart</hi> from one another, having no other Communication or Intercourse but what is between two Hostile Countries that are continually designing and attempting one against another; so that when wicked Souls do leave this Terrestrial Abode and pass into Eternity, they are presently incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated by the Laws of that invisible State into the Nation of wicked Spirits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined for ever to their most wretched So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and Converse; besides this, I say, <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> doth naturally <hi>congregate</hi> Beings, and incline them to associate with those of their own Kind. Now <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> is the proper Character of the Devil, and the natural Genius of Hell; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently 'tis by a malicious Temper of Mind that we are <hi>naturalized</hi> before-hand Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Kingdom of Darkness, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the Conversation of Furies. So that when we go from hence into Eternity, this our <hi>malignant</hi> Genius will render us utterly averse to the <hi>friendly</hi> Society of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106959:113"/>
Heaven, and naturally press and incline us to consort with that wretched Nation of <hi>spightful</hi> and <hi>rancorous</hi> Spirits, with whom we are already joined by a Likeness and Communion of Natures. But O! much better were it for us to be shut up all alone for ever in some dark Hole of the World, where we might converse only with our own melancholy Thoughts, and never hear of any other being but our selves, than to be continually plagued with such vexatious Company! For though we who are specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors only of <hi>Corporeal</hi> Action, cannot discern the manner how one Spirit acts upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet there is no doubt but <hi>Spiritual</hi> Agents can strike as immediately upon Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as <hi>bodily</hi> Agents can upon Bodies; and supposing that these can mututually act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another, there is no more doubt but they can mutually make each other feel each others <hi>Pleasures</hi> and <hi>Displeasures,</hi> and that according as they are more or less <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,</hi> they can more or less <hi>aggrieve</hi> and <hi>afflict</hi> one another. And if so, what can be expected from a company of <hi>spightful</hi> and <hi>malicious</hi> Spirits joined in Society together, but that their Conversation should be a continual Intercourse of mutual <hi>Mischiefs</hi> and <hi>Vexations?</hi> especially considering how they <hi>here</hi> laid the foundation of an eternal
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106959:114"/>
Quarrel against one another. For <hi>there</hi> all those Companions in Sin will meet, who by their ill <hi>Counsels,</hi> wicked <hi>Insinuations,</hi> and bad <hi>Examples</hi> did mutually contribute to each others Ruine; and being met in such a <hi>woful</hi> State; how will the torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sense of those irreparable injuries they have done each other, whet their <hi>Fury</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst and incite them to <hi>play the Devils</hi> with one another? And what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from such a Company of <hi>waspish</hi> Beings, so implacably incensed against one another, but that being shut up together in the infernal Den, they should be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <hi>hissing at,</hi> and <hi>stinging</hi> each other? But then besides those mutual plagues which these furious Spirits must be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to inflict upon one another, they will be also nakedly exposed to the powerful Malice of the <hi>Devils</hi> those fierce Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Gods righteous Vengeance, who, as we now find by Experience, have power to suggest <hi>black</hi> and <hi>horrid</hi> Thoughts to us, and to <hi>torture</hi> our Souls with such dreadful Imaginations as are far more sharp and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite than any <hi>bodily</hi> Torments. And if <hi>now</hi> they have such Power over us, when God thinks fit to let them loose, what will they have <hi>hereafter,</hi> when our wretched Spirits shall be wholly abandoned to their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106959:114"/>
Mercy, and they shall have free Scope to exercise their Fury upon us, and glut their <hi>hungry</hi> Malice with our Griefs and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? It seems at least a mighty probable Notion, that <hi>that</hi> horrid Agony of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the Garden which caused him to shriek and grone, and sweat as it were great Drops of Blood, was chiefly the effect of those <hi>preternatural</hi> Terrours, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, with whom he was then contesting, <hi>impressed</hi> upon his innocent Mind. And if they had so much Power over his <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi> Soul, that was so strongly guarded with the most <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>unspotted</hi> Virtues, what will they have over ours when we are abandoned to them, and thrown as Preys into their Mouths? With what an Hellish Rage will they fly upon our <hi>guilty</hi> and <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous</hi> Souls, in which there is so much Tinder for their injected Sparks of Horror to take fire on?</p>
                  <p>SINCE therefore <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> doth so naturally incline and hurry our Souls towards the wretched Society of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and damned Spirits, the Gospel which so industriously consults our Happiness, takes all possible Care to train us up in <hi>Charity</hi> and mutual <hi>Love</hi>; and makes it a Principal, as well as necessary Part of our <hi>Christian Life,</hi> heartily to <hi>love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:106959:115"/>
For this, as our Saviour tells us, is the Darling Precept which lay next to his Heart; <hi>this is my Commandment that ye love one another,</hi> Joh. xv.12. And accordingly we are bid not only <hi>to follow after Charity,</hi> 1 Cor. xiv.1. and <hi>to do all things with Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> 1 Cor. xvi.14. but also <hi>to put on Charity above all things,</hi> Col. iii.14. and to <hi>dwell in Love,</hi> which the Apostle tells us, is to <hi>dwell in God who is Love,</hi> 1 Joh. iv.16. The intent of all which is, to oblige us to bear an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>good Will</hi> to all, and to take an hearty <hi>Complacency</hi> in all that are truly lovely; to be ready to contribute to and rejoice in every ones <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Welfare,</hi> and in a word, to live in the continual exercise of all those <hi>charitable</hi> Offices which our present State and Condition requires and calls for. To be <hi>courteous</hi> and <hi>affable,</hi> and to treat all those we converse with with an obliging Look, a gentile Deportment and endearing Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. To be <hi>long-suffering, mild</hi> and <hi>easie to be entreated</hi>; not to break forth into Rage and Storm upon every petty Provocation, and when we are justly provoked not to suffer our Displeasure to fester into <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Rancour,</hi> but to be forward and easie to be reconciled. To be of a <hi>compassionate</hi> and <hi>sympathizing</hi> Temper, and to rejoice with those that rejoice, and weep with those
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106959:115"/>
that weep. To be <hi>candid</hi> Interpreters of Men and their Actions; to be ready to <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate</hi> and <hi>excuse</hi> their Faults and put <hi>fair</hi> Comments on their Actions; and to be so far from making <hi>malicious</hi> Glosses on their <hi>innocent</hi> Meaning, from <hi>proclaiming</hi> their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, and <hi>rejoicing</hi> in their Falls, as not to believe ill of them but upon undeniable Evidence, and when we are forced to do so, to <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>lament</hi> them, and <hi>endeavour</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> for their Reformation. In short, to be <hi>benign</hi> and <hi>bountiful</hi> to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous and distressed, and to endeavour according to our Ability to allay their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, remove their Oppressions, support them under their Calamities, and counsel them in their Doubts; to be ready to every good Work, and like Fields of Spices to be scattering our Perfumes through all the Neighbourhood; and all this out of an <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> purpose to promote their Good, and not meerly to acquire to our selves a popular Vogue and Reputation. All which are essential Parts of that Charity which the Gospel enjoins us to exercise to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another. For so the Apostle as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, 1 Cor. xiii.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Charity suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth long, and is kind, charity envieth not, charity vaunteth not it self, is not puffed up, doth not behave it self unseemly, seeketh not
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106959:116"/>
her own, is not easily provoked; thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW though there be several Acts of Charity that will cease for ever in Heaven, such as <hi>long-suffering, giving of Alms</hi> and <hi>forgiving of Injuries,</hi> and the like; because among the People of Heaven there will be none of the Faults or Miseries about which <hi>these</hi> Acts are conversant; yet even the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>these</hi> is indispensably necessary to <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>dispose</hi> our Minds to heavenly Charity, which till we are <hi>disposed to</hi> by universal Love, we shall never be capable of <hi>exercising</hi>; but since all virtuous Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions are acquired by Acts, it is impossible we should acquire the Disposition of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Love, unless we universally practise it. 'Tis by <hi>giving Alms</hi> that that we must acquire cordial Charity to the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>; and by <hi>forgiving Injuries</hi> that we must dispose our selves to love those that <hi>offend</hi> us. For these Acts are <hi>Causes</hi> as well as <hi>Signs</hi> of a charitable Temper, and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary not only to <hi>signifie</hi> it where it <hi>is,</hi> but also to <hi>produce</hi> it where it is <hi>not.</hi> When therfore by acting all those Parts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which are proper to <hi>this</hi> as well as the <hi>other</hi> State, we have acquired this blessed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106959:116"/>
Disposition of <hi>universal Charity,</hi> our Minds are fairly <hi>framed</hi> and <hi>tempered</hi> for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Heaven. And though in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Justle and Tumult of this World some little <hi>Piques</hi> and <hi>Displeasures</hi> should now and then arise in our Minds, yet if in the <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>standing</hi> Temper of our Souls we are hearty Well-wishers to all Men, and hearty Lovers of all that do in any measure <hi>love</hi> and <hi>resemble</hi> God, we are in a natural Tendency to Heaven, that perfect Element of Love, and when we go from hence shall consort our selves with unspeakable Joy and Alacrity with those <hi>great</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> Lovers that inhabit it. Who being all of them most amiable and Godlike Souls, that are every one of the same Temper with our selves, being touched at the same Loadstone and made partakers of the same Divine Nature, we shall immediately close and join with them in the strictest Unions of Love. For those heavenly People being all of them most <hi>flagrant</hi> Lovers of God, are so united in him who is the common <hi>Center</hi> of Love, that no Saint or Angel can enjoy <hi>his</hi> Love without possessing a proportionate Degree of <hi>theirs</hi>; and their Love of one another being all <hi>subordinate</hi> to their common Love to God, and <hi>grounded</hi> upon it, though their strongest Inclination, like that of <hi>excited</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:106959:117"/>
Needles, be still towards <hi>him</hi> the blessed Magnet at which they have every one been touched, yet do they all <hi>stick fast</hi> to one another, being <hi>clung</hi> inseparably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by those attractive Virtues which they have all derived from him. And in this state of perfect <hi>Friendship</hi> they converse together with unspeakable Pleasure, and all their Conversation is a perpetual Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Endearments. And now what a blessed Society must this be, wherein perfect <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Friendship</hi> reigns and hath an All-commanding Empire; where every Heart <hi>mingles</hi> with every one, and all like precious dusts of Gold, are melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together into one solid Ingot; where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Myriads of blessed Spirits, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably <hi>clasping</hi> and <hi>twining</hi> with one another, are so inseparably <hi>united</hi> and <hi>grown together</hi> that they are all but one <hi>compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Soul! And when from the highest Angel to the lowest Saint they are all so <hi>tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> by the Heart-strings that every one is every ones <hi>dear</hi> Friend, what inexpressible <hi>Content</hi> and <hi>Complacency</hi> must they needs take in one another! When I shall pass all Heaven over through ten thousand millions of blessed Beings, and meet none but such as I most dearly <hi>love</hi> and am as dearly <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi> by, O! what unspeakable Rejoicings
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106959:117"/>
and Congratulations will there be between us! Especially when I shall find no Defect either of Goodness or Happiness in <hi>them,</hi> nor they in <hi>me,</hi> to damp our mutual Joy and Delight in each other; but every one shall be what every one wishes him, a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> and a <hi>blessed</hi> Friend. For perfect Lovers have all their <hi>Joys</hi> and <hi>Griefs</hi> in common between them; but the Heavenly Lovers having no <hi>Griefs</hi> among them, do only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their <hi>Joys</hi> to one another. For where they love so perfectly as they do in Heaven, there can be no such thing as a <hi>private</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> Happiness, but every one must have a share in every ones; and consequently in this their mutual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Blisses, every ones Happiness will, by his Friendship to every one, be multiplied into as many Happinesses as there are Saints and Angels in Heaven; and so every Joy of every Member of the Church Triumphant runs round the whole Body in an eternal <hi>Circulation.</hi> For that blessed Body being all composed of <hi>consenting</hi> Hearts, that like perfect Unisons are tuned up to the same Key, when any one is <hi>touched,</hi> every one <hi>ecchoes</hi> and <hi>resounds</hi> the same Note; and whilst they thus mutually <hi>strike</hi> upon each other, and <hi>all</hi> are affected with <hi>every ones</hi> Joys, it is impossible but that, in a State
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106959:118"/>
where there is nothing but Joy, there should be a continual Consort of <hi>ravishing</hi> Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among them. For such is their dear Concern for one another, that every ones Joy not only <hi>pays to,</hi> but <hi>receives</hi> Tribute from every ones; so that when any <hi>one</hi> blessed Spirit rejoices, his Joy goes round the whole Society; and then all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicings in his Joy <hi>reflow</hi> upon, and <hi>swell</hi> and <hi>multiply</hi> it; and so as they mutually <hi>borrow</hi> one anothers Joys, they always <hi>pay</hi> them back with Interest, and by thus <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocating</hi> do everlastingly <hi>increase</hi> them.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. AS we are rational Creatures related to <hi>one another,</hi> we are obliged to be <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> in all our Intercourses with each other. To yield to every one whatsoever by any Kind of Right, whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>acquired,</hi> he can demand or challenge of us. For there are some things to which every Man hath a Right by Nature as he is a Part or Member of Humane Society. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>Life,</hi> which is the Principal of all our Actions and Perceptions, is freely lent us by God, who is the Source and Fountain of Life; and consequently till God <hi>resumes</hi> his Loan, or we <hi>forfeit</hi> it by our own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we have all a natural Right to <hi>live,</hi> and for any man to attempt to deprive us of our Life, or of our Means of living, is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106959:118"/>
the highest Injury and Injustice. Again, <hi>Words</hi> being instituted for no other End but to signifie our Meaning and to be the Instrument of our Intercourse and Society with one another, every one who is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Humane Society hath a Right to have our Meaning <hi>truly</hi> signified to him by our Words, and whosoever <hi>lies</hi> or <hi>equivocates</hi> to another, doth thereby injuriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of the natural Right of Society. Again, a <hi>good Name</hi> being the Ground of Trust and Credit, and Credit the main Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new of Society, till men have forfeited their good Name, they have a natural Right to be <hi>well reputed</hi> and <hi>spoken</hi> of; and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever either by <hi>false</hi> Witness, <hi>publick</hi> Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or <hi>private</hi> Whisperings, endeavours to attaint an innocent Mans Reputation, doth thereby injuriously attempt to exclude him from the Conversation of Men, and shut the Door of Humane Society against him. Once more, <hi>Promises</hi> being the great Security of our mutual Intercourse and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with one another, every Man that hath a Right to Society hath a Right to what another <hi>promiseth</hi> him, provided it be but <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>possible</hi>; and therefore for any man to promise what he <hi>intends</hi> not to perform, or to <hi>go back</hi> from his Promise when he lawfully <hi>may</hi> and <hi>can</hi> perform it,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106959:119"/>
is an Act of unjust Rapine; and I may eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whit as honesty rob another Man of what is his <hi>without</hi> my Promise, as of what I have made his <hi>by</hi> it; he having an equal Right to <hi>both</hi> by the fundamental Laws of Society. In fine, the great Design of our Society being to <hi>help</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> one another, every Man has a Right to be <hi>aided</hi> and <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted</hi> by every one with whom he hath any Dealing or Intercourse; to have some share of the Benefit of all that Exchange, Traffick and Commerce which passes between him and others; and therefore for any man in his Dealings with others to take Advantage from their Necessity or Ignorance to <hi>oppress</hi> or <hi>over-reach</hi> them, or to deal so <hi>hardly</hi> by them as either not to allow them any share of the Profit which accrues from their Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or not a <hi>sufficient</hi> share for them to subsist and live by, is an injurious Invasion of that natural Right which the very End and Design of Society gives them. But then besides these <hi>natural,</hi> there are also <hi>acquired</hi> Rights; and such are those which either by <hi>legal</hi> Constitution or by <hi>mutual</hi> Compacts and Agreements we are seized and vested with; which <hi>Constitutions</hi> and <hi>Compacts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absolutely necessary to the upholding and regulating of humane Societies, it is no less necessary that all those Rights which
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106959:119"/>
they confer should be inviolably preserved; and whosoever knowingly or wilfully takes away or detains from another what he is thus entitled to by Law or Agreement, is guilty either of a <hi>Fraud</hi> or a <hi>Robbery,</hi> either of which is an unjust Violation of the Rights of humane Society. So that the Practice of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> as it is confined to humane Society, consists in not intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either upon the <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>acquired</hi> Rights of those with whom we have any Dealing or Intercourse; in not endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deprive them either of their <hi>Lives</hi> or <hi>Livelihoods,</hi> unless by their own Actions they <hi>forfeit</hi> them to us; in imparting our <hi>true</hi> Meaning to them by our Words, and neitheir <hi>hiding</hi> it under <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Falshoods,</hi> nor <hi>disguising</hi> it with equivocal <hi>Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>; in making good to them all our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and possible <hi>Promises,</hi> in not falsely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persing their <hi>good Names</hi> and <hi>Reputations,</hi> nor suffering them to be <hi>falsely aspersed</hi> when we are able to vindicate them; in neither using them <hi>cruelly</hi> in our Dealings, so as wilfully to damnifie them, nor <hi>hardly</hi> so as either to rake <hi>all</hi> the Advantage to our selves, or not to allow them such a <hi>compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> share of it as is necessary to support and maintain them: in a word, not to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud</hi> or <hi>rob</hi> them of any thing which either
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106959:120"/>
by Constitution of <hi>Law,</hi> or by <hi>Compact</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> they have a Right to. This is <hi>civil Righteousness,</hi> and without this it is impossible that any Society should be <hi>happy.</hi> For how can any one be secure in a Society where <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Rapine, Falshood</hi> and <hi>Oppression</hi> reign; where Causes are decided not by Rules of <hi>Justice</hi> but by dint of <hi>Power,</hi> and the strongest Arm is the sole <hi>Arbitrator</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong</hi>; where <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> and <hi>Professions</hi> are only <hi>Traps</hi> and <hi>Snares,</hi> and every man lays <hi>Ambushes</hi> in his Words, and lurks behind them in <hi>reserved</hi> Meanings, only to await an Opportunity to <hi>surprize</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> every one he converses with? It would doubtless be far more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible for Men to <hi>disperse</hi> and <hi>disband</hi> their Society and live <hi>apart</hi> as Vermin do, and subsist by <hi>robbing</hi> and <hi>filching</hi> from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than live together as they must in such a State of Injustice like Bundles of Briars and Thorns, and out of their mutual Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies and Distrusts be continually <hi>tearing</hi> and <hi>scratching</hi> one another.</p>
                  <p>NOW, as I shewed you before, what Mens Tempers are <hi>here,</hi> such will their Company be <hi>hereafter.</hi> So that if we go out of <hi>this</hi> World with an <hi>unrighteous</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we must expect to be confined in the <hi>other</hi> to an <hi>unrighteous</hi> Society; and if Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106959:120"/>
be such a <hi>Nuisance</hi> to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in this Life, what a <hi>Plague</hi> will it be to it in the Life to come? For the most <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi> Societies of Men in this Life, have some <hi>Remains</hi> of Justice and Equity among them; and though the <hi>best</hi> of them have many corrupt Members that are bad in the <hi>main,</hi> yet whether it be by their natural Temper, or their Fear of Punishment or Disgrace, or by their Sense of Honour or Checks of Conscience, they are frequently restrained from <hi>many</hi> bad things, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from <hi>Dishonesty</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi>; by which means their Society is rendred much more tolerable. But in the other Life, as they are all <hi>perfectly</hi> good that are in the Society of the good, so they are all <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> wicked that are in the Society of the wicked; and whatsoever Checks there may be in their Natures to any <hi>particular</hi> Acts of Wickedness, they are there <hi>all</hi> born down by their inveterate Malice against God, and outragious Despair of ever being reconciled to him. So that in all their Society with one another there is not the least Intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Intercourse, but all their Conversation is <hi>Falshood</hi> and <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, Violence</hi> and <hi>Oppression,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever else is <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>injurious</hi> to one another.

                  <p>THAT this therefore may not be our Fate <hi>hereafter,</hi> it is a great Part of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of our Holy Religion to train us up for better Company, by inuring us <hi>before-hand</hi> to the Practice of <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Justice.</hi> For so it obliges us <hi>to do unto men whatsoever we would that men should do unto us,</hi> Mar. vii.12. that is, so to deal with every man as if we had exchanged persons with him, and he were in <hi>our</hi> place, and we in <hi>his.</hi> And in particular it enjoins us to <hi>be harmless as Doves as well as wise as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> Mat. x.16. <hi>to converse in the World with simplicity and godly sincerity,</hi> 2 Cor. i.12. <hi>to keep up an honest conversation in the world,</hi> 1 Pet. ii.12. <hi>not to lie to one another,</hi> Col. iii.9. <hi>not to go beyond or defraud our brother in any matter,</hi> 1 Thess. iv.6. The sense of all which is, to oblige us to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a strict <hi>Integrity</hi> in all our Professions and Intercourses with men, and not to allow our selves in any Course of Action which the Laws of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Sincerity</hi> disapprove; to measure our <hi>Words</hi> by our <hi>Meaning,</hi> and our <hi>Meaning</hi> so far as we are able, by the

                     <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> of things; to converse among men with a generous <hi>Openness</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> and with as little <hi>Reserve</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise</hi> as is possible and prudent, considering what a <hi>treacherous</hi> and <hi>ill-natured</hi> World we have to deal with; to <hi>be</hi> what we <hi>seem,</hi> and not to paint ill Meanings with smiling Looks and smooth Pretences; to <hi>notifie</hi> our Intentions and <hi>unfold</hi> our Hearts, and, so far as innocent Prudence will admit, to turn our selves <hi>inside outwards</hi> to all we converse with; to give to every one his due and not to intrench upon other mens Rights, whether it be to their <hi>Lives</hi> or <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Reputations</hi> or <hi>Estates</hi>: in a word, to weigh to our Neighbours and our selves in the same Balance, and to do to <hi>them</hi> whatsoever we could reasonably wish <hi>they</hi> should do to <hi>us,</hi> if <hi>we</hi> were in <hi>their</hi> Persons and Circumstances. By the Practice of which excellent Rules our Mind will by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees be refined and purified from all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition to <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi>; and then when we go from hence into Eternity we shall carry thither with us such a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Frame of Mind, such an honest <hi>Plainness</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> of Temper as will immediately qualifie and dispose us for the Society of <hi>just men made perfect,</hi> who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us already united to them in <hi>Disposition</hi>

and <hi>Nature,</hi> will joyfully receive us into their blessed Communion. And now, O! the blessed State we shall be in, when being stripped of all <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>unjust Desire,</hi> of all <hi>Insincerity</hi> and <hi>Craftiness</hi> of Temper, we shall be admitted into a Nation of <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> People, where every one has his appropriate Seat and Mansion of Glory, and is so perfectly <hi>contented</hi> with it that he never <hi>covets</hi> what another enjoys, so that every one possesses what is his own with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least suspicion of being ejected by a <hi>subtiler</hi> or more <hi>powerful</hi> Neighbour; where being perfectly assured of each others <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,</hi> they converse together with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Openness and Freedom, and in all their Language, whatsoever it be, do <hi>read</hi> their Hearts and <hi>convey</hi> their Intentions to one another; where their Souls converse <hi>face to face,</hi> and do freely <hi>unbosom</hi> themselves to one another without the least <hi>Disguise</hi> or <hi>Dissimulation</hi>; so that in all their Society there is no such thing as a <hi>Secret</hi> or <hi>Mystery,</hi> but they are all Bosom Friends to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and every one has a Window into every ones Breast! O! blessed God what a most <hi>happy</hi> Conversation must such just Souls as these enjoy with one another, from whose Society all Fraud and Falshood, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Oppression is for ever banished!
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106959:124"/>
For whilst they live together as they do in the continual Exercise of perfect <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> they can neither design upon nor suspect one another, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently must needs converse together with infinite Security and Freedom. And being all of them thus inviolably safe in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi>; every one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys his proper Rank and Degree of Glory without Fear or Disturbance, and freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> Thoughts to every one without any Strangeness or Reserve. Thus all Heaven over there is a most perfect <hi>Freedom</hi> of Conversation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those <hi>righteous</hi> People that inhabit it, and every one is every ones <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and every ones Neighbour is as <hi>Himself.</hi> For in all their Communication and Intercourse they mutually <hi>exchange</hi> Persons with one another, and there is no one <hi>doth</hi> that to another which he would not gladly have <hi>done</hi> to himself in the same Condition and Circumstances. So that none of them all can possibly be aggrieved because they <hi>are</hi> every one dealt by just as they <hi>would be,</hi> most <hi>fairly,</hi> most <hi>righteously</hi> and <hi>faithfully.</hi> And hence there can be no <hi>Grudges</hi> among them, no <hi>Whisperings, Backbitings</hi> or spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Misrepresentations,</hi> because every one likes what every one does, and so they are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106959:124"/>
all perfectly satisfied with one another. And thus you see in the Exercise of perfect <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> all the Society of Heaven is rendred perfectly <hi>happy.</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. AS we are rational Creatures related to <hi>one another</hi> we are obliged to behave our selves <hi>peaceably</hi> in our respective States and Relations. For Society being nothing but an united Multitude, it is indispensably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the preservation of its Union, that every Individual Member of it should <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably</hi> comport himself towards every one in that Degree and Order wherein he is placed. Because, as the Health of <hi>natural</hi> Bodies depends upon the Harmony and Agreement of their Parts, so doth the Prosperity of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties or <hi>political</hi> ones. For 'tis <hi>Peace</hi> and mutual <hi>Accord</hi> which is the Soul that doth both animate and unite Society and keep the Parts of it from dispersing and flying abroad into Atoms, which nothing but Force and Violence can hinder them from, when once they are broken into Discords and Dissentions. So true is that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>A Kingdom divided against it self can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand.</hi> For besides that Division im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the strength of a Society, which like an impetuous Stream being parted into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Currents runs with far less force, and is much more easily forded; for the several
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:106959:125"/>
Factions that are in it are like the several Nations in a Confederate Army, which though they be all united into one Body have several contrary Interests and Designs, which divides their Councils and sows Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies among them, and so renders them not only less <hi>able</hi> to withstand the Force of an unanimous Enemy, but also less <hi>willing</hi> to aid and assist one another; besides this, I say, Faction and Discord naturally disunite and separates Society, as it dissolves the Bond of Peace which holds it together. For a Society without Peace is but an aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Body whose Parts lie together in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused heap, but have no Joints or Sinews to fasten them to one another; for want of which instead of mutually assisting, they do but mutually load and oppress each other; which must necessarily divide their <hi>Wills</hi> and their <hi>Interests,</hi> and when that is done 'tis only external Force that hinders them from dividing and separating their <hi>Society.</hi> Upon this account therefore every man is obliged, as he is a Member of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to comport himself <hi>peaceably</hi> with all men; because otherwise he will necessarily render himself a publick Pest and Nuisance. For so long as he is of an <hi>unquiet</hi> and <hi>turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> Spirit, instead of being an <hi>Help</hi> he must necessarily be a <hi>Disease</hi> to every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106959:125"/>
of which he is a Member; and if those with whom he is joined were all of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Spirit, it would be much better for them all to live asunder in the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Condition, than to continue in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety together; because instead of <hi>helping</hi> and <hi>assisting</hi> they would be sure to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <hi>vexing</hi> and <hi>plaguing</hi> one another.</p>
                  <p>IF therefore we go into the other World with an <hi>unquiet</hi> and <hi>quarrelsome</hi> Temper, we shall be thereby inclined to and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the most wretched and miserable Society, even the Society of those <hi>factious</hi> Fiends that could not be quiet even in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it self, but raised a Mutiny before the Throne of God, and for so doing were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thence, and damned to keep one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Company in endless Misery and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair. The Souls of men therefore being by the Laws of the Invisible State always assigned to that Society of Spirits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are most connaturalized in their Temper, we must expect, if we go into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with <hi>turbulent</hi> and <hi>contentious</hi> Minds, to be thrust into the Society of Devils and damned Ghosts, with whom we are already joined in a strict Communion of Natures. And O! what a <hi>dreadful</hi> thing must it be, to be forced to spend an Eternity in such <hi>wretched</hi> Company! Verily methinks the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106959:126"/>
most horrid and frightful Idea I can form in my own Mind, is, that of a company of <hi>snarling</hi> and <hi>quarrelsome</hi> Spirits, crouded like so many Scorpions and Adders into a Den together, and there forced by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomousness of their Temper to live in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Mutiny, and be perpetually <hi>hissing</hi> and <hi>spitting</hi> Poison at one another. For though those words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> xii.25, 26. imply that Satans Kingdom is <hi>not</hi> divided, yet they are not to be so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as if there were any such thing as <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>Concord</hi> among those rancorous Spirits, for that is impossible to be imagined; no, doubtless they <hi>would</hi> be divided eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dally if they <hi>could,</hi> being such continual plagues as they are to one another, and think it a mighty Happiness to be shut up all <hi>alone</hi> in separate Dens, where they might never <hi>see</hi> nor <hi>hear</hi> of one another more; but being chained together as they are by an adamantine Fate, which they cannot withstand, they consent in <hi>this</hi> and in this <hi>only,</hi> to oppose all good Designs, and do the utmost Mischief they are able. But as to all their other Intercourses they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually embroiled, and do live in an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Variance with one another. So that their Society is like that Monster <hi>Scylla,</hi> whom the Poets talk of, whose inferiour
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106959:126"/>
parts were a company of Dogs that were perpetually snarling and quarrelling among themselves, and yet were inseparable from one another as being all of them parts of the same substance.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE since to be united by indissoluble Ligaments to this wretched So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety will be the certain Fate of all <hi>factious</hi> and <hi>contentious</hi> Souls, our blessed Religion, whose great Design is to advance our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, hath taken abundant care to educate our Minds in <hi>Quietness</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> For hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tend all those Precepts of it which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to <hi>follow peace with all men,</hi> Heb. xii.14. <hi>to be at peace among our selves,</hi> 1 Thess. v.13. <hi>to follow after the things that make for peace,</hi> Rom. xiv.19. <hi>to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> Eph. iv.3. <hi>to be of one mind and to live in peace,</hi> 2. Cor. xiii.11. <hi>and if it be possible, and as much as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men,</hi> Rom. xii.18. in a word, <hi>to mark them that cause divisions among us, and avoid them,</hi> Rom. xvi.17. and to do our part <hi>that there be no divisions among us, but that we be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgement,</hi> 1 Cor. i.10. The Design of all which is to bind us over to the Study and Practice of <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> and restrain us by the strictest Obligations
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106959:127"/>
from all <hi>schismatical, factious</hi> and <hi>turbulent</hi> Behaviour in those sacred or civil Societies whereof we are Members. And unless we do sincerely endeavour to fulfil these Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, however we may <hi>monopolize</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness to our own Party, and <hi>claw</hi> and <hi>cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize</hi> one another, we are Saints of a quite different strain from those blessed ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and are acted by the <hi>factious</hi> Spirit of the Devil, whose Business it is to foment Divisions, and kindle Disturbances and Commotions wherever he comes. This therefore must be our great Care if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign for Heaven, to root out of our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers all Inclination to <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> and to compose our selves into a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date</hi> and <hi>peaceable, calm</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> frame of Spirit; and not only to avoid all unnecessary Quarrels and Contentions <hi>our selves,</hi> but so far as in us lies be Peace-makers between <hi>others,</hi> and preserve a friendly Union <hi>with</hi> and <hi>among</hi> our fellow members. And if through humane <hi>Frailty</hi> and <hi>Infirmity,</hi> through our own <hi>Ignorance</hi> or the plausible <hi>Pretences</hi> of Seducers, through the too great Prevalence of our worldly <hi>Interest</hi> or the Principles of a bad <hi>Education,</hi> it should be our Misfortune to be insensibly <hi>misled</hi> into unwarrantable Dissents and Divisions, yet still to keep our Minds in a <hi>teachable</hi>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:106959:127"/>
Temper, and our Ears open to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Conviction</hi>; to be desirous of <hi>Accommodation,</hi> and willing to hear the Reasons on <hi>both sides,</hi> and as soon as we are <hi>convinced</hi> of our Error to <hi>repent</hi> of our Division and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately return to <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHICH if it be our constant Practice and Endeavour, we shall by Degrees form our Minds into such a <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Temper, that when we go into the other World where we shall be perfectly disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from all temporal Interests, and throughly convinced of all our erroneous Prejudice, our Souls will be effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered to the <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> Society of the Blessed; who having no private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests to pursue, no particular Affections to gratifie, no Ends or Aims but what are common to them all, which is to <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi> and <hi>love</hi> that never-failing Spring whence all their Felicity flows, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible there should be any Occasion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred by any of them of any Schism or rupture of Communion. And so those happy People live in the most perfect Unity and Concord, as being all united in their Ends and tied together by their heart-strings. For they having no counter Opinions or cross Interests to divide them, nothing but Truth <hi>shining</hi> in their Minds, nothing but
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106959:128"/>
Goodness <hi>reigning</hi> in their Wills, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible there should be any <hi>dissenting Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> among them, any <hi>Non-conformist</hi> to the blessed Laws of their Communion; but conspiring together as they do in the same Mind and Interest, and in the same peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Intentions and Affections, they must needs walk hand in hand together in a most perfect <hi>Vniformity.</hi> So that if we would live for <hi>ever</hi> with these blessed Folk, we must <hi>now</hi> endeavour to <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>compose</hi> our selves into their Temper; to discharge our Minds, as much as we are able, of every <hi>froward</hi> and <hi>contentious</hi> Humour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our Wills to a perfect loathing of them; that so being <hi>qualified</hi> for their Society we may be <hi>admitted</hi> to it when we go away from this <hi>wrangling</hi> World. And then how unspeakably happy shall we be, when with Minds perfectly refined from all Contention and Bitterness we shall be received into the Company of those <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>sedate</hi> Spirits, and bear our part in their <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>placid</hi> Conversation, wherein they freely commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their minds to one another without the least <hi>Fierceness</hi> or <hi>Insolence, Captiousness</hi> or <hi>Misconstruction, Clamour</hi> or <hi>Contention for Victory,</hi> and do eternally discourse over the <hi>wise</hi> things of Heaven and still perfectly concenter both in their <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106959:128"/>
                     <hi>Wills</hi>; wherein like so many Stars in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction they mingle Light with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do peaceably communicate the treasures of their Knowledge without the least bandying or Controversie. For though <hi>some</hi> of them do doubtless know much more than others, yet there being no Intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Error in the Knowledge of <hi>any,</hi> it is impossible they should <hi>oppose</hi> or <hi>contradict</hi> one another, because whatsoever is true, agrees with every thing that is true. And being thus united in Mind and Judgment, they freely communicate their Thoughts without ever disputing one anothers Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which renders it impossible for them ever to <hi>quarrel</hi> or <hi>disagree.</hi> So that all their Communion is a perfect <hi>Concord</hi> of Souls; wherein there is no such thing as a <hi>Schism</hi> or <hi>Division,</hi> as passing <hi>cruel</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures or affixing <hi>hard</hi> Names or bandying <hi>Anathema's</hi> at one another, but in Mind and Heart they are all as perfectly <hi>one</hi> as if they were all animated by one and the same Soul. And thus they live unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably happy in the mutual Exercise of an everlasting <hi>Peace,</hi> and all their Conversation with one another is perfect <hi>Harmony</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Discords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. AS we are rational Creatures rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>one another,</hi> we are obliged <hi>modestly</hi>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:106959:129"/>
to submit to our <hi>Superiours,</hi> and chearfully to <hi>condescend</hi> to our <hi>Inferiours</hi> in those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Societies whereof we are Members. These two I put together, because they are Relatives, and as such do mutually explain and contribute light to each other. Now it being necessary to the Order and End of all Societies that their Members should be distinguished into <hi>superiour</hi> and <hi>inferiour</hi> Ranks and Stations; that some should be trusted with the power of <hi>Commanding,</hi> and others reduced to the condition of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> that so in this regular Subordination they may every one in their several stations be obliged to <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> each other, and according to their several Capacities to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the good of the <hi>Whole</hi>; which in a state of Equality (wherein every Man would be absolute Lord of himself) cannot be expected, considering the different Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Interests by which Men are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this I say being upon this account ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, it is upon the same Reason equally necessary that they should mutually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form those Offices to one another, which are proper to their respective Ranks and Stations.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106959:129"/>
their own <hi>imperious</hi> Wills, but to <hi>provide</hi> for and <hi>secure</hi> the Common-weal; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to take care that they do not prostitute their <hi>Power</hi> to their own private <hi>Avarice</hi> or <hi>Ambition,</hi> but that they employ it for the Common Good and Benefit of their Subjects and Inferiours; that they be ready to do them all good Offices, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate their <hi>Infirmities,</hi> consult their <hi>Conveniencies,</hi> and comply with all their reasonable <hi>Supplications</hi>; considering that for this End they derived their Authority from God who is the Fountain of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to whom they are accountable for their good and bad Administration of it. And so for the Inferiours, it is no less necessary for the Common Good, that they perform their parts towards those that are above them; that they behave themselves towards them, with all that <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Modesty, Respect</hi> and <hi>Submission</hi> which their Place and Authority calls for; that they reverence them as the <hi>Vicegerents</hi> of God, and address to them as to <hi>sacred</hi> Persons, and render a chearful Obedience to that divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that is stampt upon all their <hi>just</hi> Laws and Commands; considering that in their several Degrees, they represent the Person of the great Sovereign of the World, to whom we owe an intire Subjection, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106959:130"/>
consequently are in every thing to be <hi>obeyed</hi> and <hi>submitted</hi> to, that he hath not expresly <hi>countermanded.</hi> For that Subjects and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours should thus behave themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, is indispensably neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the Welfare of all Societies. For whilst the Inferiours of any Society do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately refuse to submit to the Will of their Superiours, and the Superiours to condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the Common Good of their Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, they are contending together, either for a <hi>Confusion</hi> or a <hi>Tyranny</hi>; and if the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours prevail Tyranny follows, if the Inferiours, Confusion; either of which is extremely mischievous, not only to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in general, but to each of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Parties, For if <hi>Confusion</hi> follows, 'tis not only the Superiour Party suffers by being <hi>deposed</hi> from its Authority, but the Inferiour too by being <hi>deprived</hi> of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and exposed to one anothers <hi>Rapine</hi> and <hi>Violence</hi>; and if <hi>Tyranny</hi> follows, 'tis not only the Inferiour Party suffers by being forced upon a <hi>rigorous</hi> and <hi>uneasie</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but the Superiour too, by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually perplexed how to <hi>force</hi> and <hi>extort</hi> that Obedience; and thus both Parties suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under the bad effects of each others Misdemeanour. So that to make our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety happy, it is necessary, that whether
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106959:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we be Superiours or Inferiours, we should be of a <hi>gentle, yielding</hi> and <hi>treatable</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; that so which Rank soever we are placed in, we may be <hi>pliable</hi> either way, to a <hi>fair</hi> Condescension, or a <hi>just</hi> Submission. For whilst we are of <hi>obstinate, perverse</hi> and <hi>untractable</hi> Tempers, we are neither fit to be Superiours nor Inferiours, but must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be Plagues and Grievances to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which Rank or Order soever we are placed in. And though in this life we have not always such a sensible Experience of the Evil and Mischief of this <hi>malignant</hi> Temper, because now it is counter-influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by those more <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>auspicious</hi> ones that are in Conjunction with it; yet when we go into Eternity, we shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to such a Society of Spirits as are all <hi>throughout</hi> of our own Genius and Temper. For as in the Society of the Blessed there is a Conjunction of every <hi>Vertue</hi> in every Member, so there is of every <hi>Vice</hi> in the Society of the Wicked; who do not only retain those Vices in their Natures, which they were here inclined and addicted to, but are also continually excited to all other Vices they are capable of, by their inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Enmity against God, which in that miserable estate is perpetually enraged, by their Despair of being ever reconciled to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:106959:131"/>
him. So that whatsoever wicked Temper we carry with us into Eternity, we shall be sure to meet with it in every individual Member of the Society of the Wicked, and consequently if we carry thither with us a <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>untreatable</hi> Temper that will not endure either to <hi>submit</hi> or <hi>condescend,</hi> we shall be sure to find the same Humour reigning throughout all the Society of the Wicked. And then being eternally united to it, (as we must expect to be if we are allied to it by Nature) in what a miserable state shall we be, when every Member of our Society shall be of the same <hi>unconversable</hi> Temper with our selves, and we shall find none that will <hi>comply with,</hi> or endeavour to <hi>sooth</hi> and <hi>mollifie</hi> our Obstinacy; when all our whole Society shall consist of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>stiff</hi> and <hi>stubborn</hi> Spirits that will neither <hi>submit to,</hi> nor <hi>bear with</hi> one another, but every one will have his will upon every one, so far as he is able to force and extort it; when those that are superiour in Might and Power, do all rule with a <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical</hi> Will, and will <hi>condescend</hi> to nothing that is beneficial for their Subjects; and those that are inferiour do obey with a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi> and <hi>stubborn</hi> Heart, and will <hi>submit</hi> to nothing but what they are <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>compelled</hi> to, and 'tis nothing but meer Power
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:106959:131"/>
and Dread by which they <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>are ruled:</hi> in a word, when they all mutually <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>abominate</hi> each other, and those that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> are a Company of <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>imperious</hi> Devils that impose nothing but Grievances and Plagues, and those that <hi>obey</hi> are a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>surly</hi> and <hi>untractable</hi> Slaves, that submit to nothing but what they are <hi>driven to</hi> by Plagues; so that <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,</hi> are both the Matter and the Motive of all their Obedience and Subjection; when this, I say, is the State of their Society with one another, how is it possible but that they should be all of them in a most <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>miserable</hi> Condition? For where all is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Compulsion</hi> (as to be sure all is among such a Company of <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>self-willed</hi> Spirits) there every one must be supposed to be, so far as he is able, a Fury and a Devil to every one; and those that <hi>do compel</hi> are like so many salvage Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants continually vexed and enraged with <hi>stubborn</hi> Oppositions and Resistances, and those that <hi>are compelled</hi> like so many obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Gally-Slaves are continually <hi>lashed</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unsufferable obedience, and forced by <hi>one</hi> Torment to submit to <hi>another</hi>; and thus all their Society with one another is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Intercourse of mutual <hi>Outrage</hi> and <hi>Violence.</hi>

                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:106959:132"/>THIS being therefore the miserable Fate and Issue of a <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>stubborn</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable</hi> Temper, the Gospel whose great design is to direct us to our Happiness, doth industriously endeavour to root it out of our Minds, and to plant in its room a <hi>gentle, obsequious</hi> and <hi>condescending</hi> Disposition. For hither tend all those Evangelical Precepts which require us <hi>to become weak to the weak that we may gain them,</hi> 1 Cor. ix.22. <hi>to bear with their infirmities,</hi> Rom. xv.1. <hi>and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, and be patient towards them,</hi> 1 Thess. v.14. And on the other hand, <hi>to submit our selves to our Elders,</hi> 1 Pet. v.5. <hi>and to those that have the rule over us,</hi> Heb. xiii.17. <hi>to obey our Magistrates, our Parents, and our Masters, to be subject to Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and not speak evil of Dignities, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Kings and submit to their laws, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> 1 Pet. ii.13, 14. in a word, <hi>to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour all men as they deserve,</hi> 1 Pet. ii.17. <hi>and to hold good men in reputation,</hi> Phil. ii.19. <hi>and in honour to prefer one another,</hi> Rom. xii.10. The sense of all which is, to oblige us to treat all men as becomes us, in the Rank and Station we are placed in; to <hi>honour</hi> those that are our <hi>Superiours</hi> whether in Place or Vertue, to give that modest Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Judgments, that Reverence to their Persons, that Respect to their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:106959:132"/>
and Homage to their Desires or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which the Degree or Kind of their Superiority requires; to <hi>condescend</hi> to those that are our <hi>Inferiours,</hi> and treat them with all that Candour and Ingenuity, Sweetness and Affability, that the respective Distances of our State will allow; to consult their Conveniencies, and do them all good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and pity and bear with their Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so far as they are <hi>safely</hi> and <hi>wisely</hi> tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. By the constant Practice of which, our minds will be gradually cured of all that <hi>Perverseness</hi> and <hi>Surliness</hi> of Temper, which indisposes us to the respective Duties of our Relations; of all that <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Selfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which renders us averse to the proper Duty of Superiours, and of all that <hi>Self-Conceit</hi> and <hi>Impatience of Command</hi> which indisposes us to the duty of Inferiours. And our Wills being once wrought into an easie <hi>pliableness</hi> either to <hi>Submission</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension,</hi> we are in a forward Preparation of Mind to live under the Government of of Heaven, where doubtless under God the supream Lord and Sovereign, there are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless Degrees of Superiority and Inferio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For so some are said to reap <hi>sparingly</hi> and some <hi>abundantly,</hi> some to be Rulers of <hi>five</hi> Cities, and some of <hi>ten,</hi> some to be the <hi>least,</hi> and some the <hi>greatest</hi> in the Kingdom
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106959:133"/>
of Heaven; all which implies, that in that blessed State, there is a great Variety of Degrees of Glory and Advancement. And indeed it cannot be otherwise in the Nature of the thing; for our Happiness consisting in the Perfection of our Natures, the more or less <hi>perfect</hi> we are, the more or less <hi>happy</hi> we must necessarily be; for every farther Degree of Goodness we attain to, is a <hi>wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>enlargement</hi> of our Souls for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Degrees of Glory and Beatitude. And accordingly when we arrive at Heaven which is the Element of Beatitude, we shall all be filled according to the <hi>Content</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> of our Capacities, and drink in more or less of its Rivers of Pleasure, as we are more or less <hi>enlarged</hi> to contain them. So that according as we do more and more improve our selves in true Goodness, we do naturally make more and more Room in our Souls for Heaven, which doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fill the Vessels of Glory of all sizes, and pour in happiness upon them till they all overflow and can contain no more. Since therefore they are all of them entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to, and guided by right Reason, there is no doubt but in these their different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Glory and Dignity, they mutually behave themselves towards one another, as is most <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>becoming</hi>; and that since
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:106959:133"/>
under God the Head and King of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, there is from the highest to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est a most exact and regular Subordination of Members, they do every one perform their Parts and Duties towards every one, in all those different Stations of Glory they are placed in, and consequently do <hi>submit</hi> and <hi>condescend</hi> to each other, according as they are of a <hi>superiour</hi> or <hi>inferiour</hi> Class and Order. So that if when we go from hence into the other world, we carry along with us a <hi>submissive</hi> and <hi>condescending</hi> Frame of Spirit, we shall be trained up, and predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed to live under the blessed <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Heaven; to yield a chearful Conformity to the Laws and Customs of it; and to render all the Honours to those <hi>above,</hi> and all the Condescensions to those <hi>beneath</hi> us in Glory, which the Statutes of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Regiment do require; in doing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we shall all of us enjoy a most unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Content, and Felicity. For though in the Kingdom of Heaven, as well as the Kingdoms of the Earth, there are number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Degrees of Advancement, and Dignity, and one Star <hi>there,</hi> as well as <hi>here,</hi> differeth from another Star in Glory; yet so <hi>freely,</hi> and <hi>chearfully</hi> do they all <hi>condescend</hi> and <hi>submit</hi> to each other, in these their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive differences of Rank and Station, that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:106959:134"/>
in the widest Distances of their State, and Degrees of Glory, they all maintain the dearest <hi>Intimacies</hi> and <hi>Familiarities</hi> with each other; and neither those that are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour are either <hi>envied</hi> for their Height, or <hi>contemned</hi> for their Familiarity, nor those that are Inferiour <hi>despised</hi> for their Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or <hi>oppressed</hi> for their Weakness. For in that blessed State, every one being best <hi>pleased</hi> with what best becomes him, it is every ones <hi>Joy</hi> to behave himself towards every one as best becomes the Rank and Degree he is placed in; and those that are <hi>above,</hi> do <hi>glory</hi> in condescending to those that are <hi>below</hi> them, and those that are <hi>below,</hi> do <hi>triumph</hi> in submitting to those that are <hi>above</hi> them; and thus in all those Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Glory and Dignity between them, they alternately <hi>reverence</hi> their Superiours, and <hi>condescend</hi> to their Inferiours, with the same <hi>unforced</hi> Freedom and Alacrity, and so do eternally converse with one another (notwithstanding all their Distances) with the greatest <hi>Freedom,</hi> and most endearing <hi>Familiarity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND thus I have endeavoured to give you an account of the first sort of <hi>Means,</hi> by which <hi>Heaven</hi> the great <hi>End</hi> of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> is to be obtained; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>proximate</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> ones, which comprehend
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:106959:134"/>
the Practice of all those Virtues, which as <hi>Rational Creatures</hi> related to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>one another</hi> we stand eternally obliged to; and shewed how they are all of them essential Parts of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> and how <hi>Heaven</hi> it self consists in the <hi>Perfection</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>SO that upon the whole, the best Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition I can give of the State of Heaven is this, That it is the <hi>everlasting, perfect</hi> Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of all those <hi>Humane, Divine,</hi> and <hi>Social</hi> Virtues, which as <hi>Rational Animals,</hi> related to <hi>God,</hi> and all his <hi>Rational Creation,</hi> we are <hi>indispensably</hi> and <hi>everlastingly</hi> obliged to. And therefore since the only natural way, by which we can <hi>acquire</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> these Vertues is <hi>Vse</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> it hence necessarily follows, that the <hi>Practice</hi> of them is the only <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> Means, by which that <hi>Heavenly State</hi> is to be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and obtained.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. Therefore let us consider the <hi>Suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of these Virtues to our present <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Relation.</hi> For in our Baptism, wherein we gave up our Names to Christ, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Denizens</hi> and <hi>Freemen</hi> of Heaven, and were received into a Covenant that upon
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106959:135"/>
Performance of our Part of it actually intituled us to all its blessed <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Immunities.</hi> So that in that sacred Solemnity of our Initiation into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Covenant, we contracted a strict Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the blessed People of Heaven, and became their <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Citizens.</hi> For so the Apostle tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii.19. <hi>Now therefore ye are no more strangers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners, but fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of God</hi>; and <hi>the houshold of God</hi> consists of the whole Congregation of the Saints, whether <hi>militant</hi> upon Earth or <hi>triumphant</hi> in Heaven. For so, <hi>Eph.</hi> iii.15. it is called <hi>the whole family of heaven and earth.</hi> So that we are Confederates with them in the same Covenant, even that by which they hold all the Joys and Glories they are possessed of; and if we will do as they have done, that is, perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it, we shall be Cohabitants with them in the same Glory. We are adopted Children of the same Father with them, Members of the same Family, Coheirs of the Promise of the same Glory, Brethren of the same Confraternity and Corporation; and all the difference between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>us</hi> is only this, that we are <hi>abroad</hi> and they <hi>at home</hi>; we are on <hi>this,</hi> and they on <hi>t'other</hi> side <hi>Jordan</hi>; we in the <hi>Acquest</hi> and they in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106959:136"/>
the <hi>Possession</hi> of the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi>; to which we are intitled as well as they, and that by the same Grant from the supreme Proprietor. So that by calling our selves <hi>Christians,</hi> we do in other words call our selves <hi>Brethren, Coheirs,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Citizens</hi> with the blessed Inhabitants of Heaven. And what can be more <hi>suitable</hi> to such a Profession than for us to live as they do, in the continued Practice of all these <hi>heavenly Virtues?</hi> And what a shame will it be for us that are by Profession their Brethren, not to <hi>coppy</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi> their Behaviour; that we who are below Stairs in the same House and Family should abandon our selves to <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>Devilishness,</hi> whilst our blessed Kindred above are entertaining themselves with those heavenly Pleasures which result from the perfect Exercise of all <hi>heavenly Virtue</hi>; that we should be <hi>neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, provoking</hi> and <hi>blaspheming</hi> God, whilst they are <hi>contemplating</hi> and <hi>admiring, loving</hi> and <hi>praising, imitating</hi> and <hi>obeying</hi> him; that we should be <hi>cheating</hi> and <hi>defrauding, envying</hi> and <hi>despising, maligning</hi> and <hi>embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> one another, whilst they are conversing together with the greatest <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,</hi> with the most obliging <hi>Respects</hi> and <hi>Condescensions,</hi> and in the strictest <hi>Vnity</hi> and dearest <hi>Friendship?</hi> What a vile Reproach
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:106959:136"/>
are our wicked lives to the Conversation of these our <hi>Fellow-Citizens</hi> above? For while we profess our selves their <hi>Brethren,</hi> those who understand no better will be prone to suspect that <hi>they</hi> live as <hi>we</hi> do; and how would such a Suspicion tempt an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Heathen to renounce Heaven, as the <hi>Indian</hi> King did, when he was told that the bloudy <hi>Spaniards</hi> went thither; and rather chuse to go down to the darkest Hell than to a Heaven that is peopled with such <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical</hi> Company? So that by our <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>unsaint-like</hi> Lives, we take an effectual Course to bring Heaven it self into Disgrace, and to cast such a Slander on its blessed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, as may justly expose them to the Scorn and Hatred of all those honest Minds that know them no otherwise than by us their <hi>unworthy</hi> and <hi>degenerate</hi> Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; and could those blessed Spirits look down from their Thrones of Bliss, and see what a Company of <hi>wretched</hi> Christians there are that claim <hi>Kindred</hi> with them, they would doubtless be ashamed of the <hi>Relation,</hi> and count themselves highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured and disgraced by it, and heartily wish that we would disown our <hi>Sins</hi> or our <hi>Baptism,</hi> and openly renounce their <hi>Alliance</hi> or more strictly imitate their <hi>Manners.</hi> And really 'tis a burning Shame that we should
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106959:137"/>
profess our selves Fellow-Citizens with them for no other purpose but to <hi>scandalize</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> them; and it were heartily to be wished even for the <hi>Credit</hi> of Heaven and of our blessed Brethren that inhabit it, that if we will not be so <hi>generous</hi> as to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Example, we would at least be so <hi>honest</hi> as to renounce their Kindred, and not to claim a Relation to their Family meerly to <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>disgrace</hi> them.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. CONSIDER the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of the heavenly Life. For if we may estimate Actions by the Examples from whence they are copied, as in other Cases we are wont to do, doubtless the most <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi> are such as are copied from the Lives of the glorious Inhabitants of Heaven. For besides that sublime Rank of Dignity whereunto they are advanced, as being the Courtiers and immediate At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of the Almighty Sovereign of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; a Dignity which by how much more it excells that of the greatest Potentate of this world, by so much more it <hi>authorizes</hi> the Examples of those that wear it; besides this I say, their Examples being the most perfect Copies and Imitations of the Life of God, are thereby rendred not only more <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>glorious,</hi> but also more <hi>obliging</hi> and <hi>authoritative.</hi> For by
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106959:137"/>
following them, we follow God, who is the Standard of all rational Perfection, and who by being the first and best in the whole kind of Rational Entities, is the supream Rule and Measure of them all. So that in imitating the blessed People above, we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate those who in <hi>their</hi> Place and Station do live at the same Rate as the great God doth in <hi>his,</hi> and regulate themselves by the same infallible Reason. We do what God himself would do if he were in <hi>our</hi> Place; and there is no other difference between <hi>his</hi> life and <hi>ours,</hi> but what necessarily arises out of our different States and Relations. And what more <hi>glorious</hi> thing can we do, than to live by the Pattern of <hi>their</hi> Lives, who live so exactly by the Pattern of God's? For the Example of living which those blessed People set us, is the Example of God at <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-hand</hi>; 'tis his most rational Life <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,</hi> so far as it is rationally <hi>imitable,</hi> that is, so far as it is <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> for a rational creature to transcribe it. For in the State of <hi>finite</hi> Creatures they live in a perfect Conformity to the same immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reason whereby God regulates himself in the State of an <hi>infinite</hi> Creator. So that their Example is an Imitation in kind of all those particular Excellencies in him, which they <hi>may</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to imitate; and 'tis an
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106959:138"/>
Imitation in general of that eternal <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> with respect to Conditions and States, which he constantly observes in all his transactions with his Creatures. And as their Example is a perfect Copy of God's, so 'tis a Copy fitted in all particulars for <hi>our</hi> Use and Imitation. For it doth not only describe to us all those particular <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> in him which are to be imitated by us, but all those particular <hi>Duties</hi> to which that eternal Law of Equity and Goodness by which he governs <hi>himself</hi> in <hi>his</hi> State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of <hi>us</hi> in <hi>ours</hi>; and shews not only wherein we are to imitate him <hi>in kind,</hi> but also wherein we are to follow him <hi>in general,</hi> in doing what is most fit for us in the State and Relation of <hi>Creatures,</hi> even as he doth what is most fit for him in the State and Relation of a God and <hi>Creator.</hi> So that the Example of those heavenly Inhabitants is the Example of God himself, exactly fitted and attempered to the State and Condition of Creatures. For just as they live, the All-wise and All-good God himself would live, if he were in their State and Relation. Wherefore by imitating their heavenly Lives and Manners, we do our selves the greatest Right, and do most effectually consult the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of our own Natures. For whilst we tread in theirs, we tread in the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106959:138"/>
Footsteps of God, and have his glorious Example to warrant and justifie our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we behave our selves as it becomes the Children of the King of Heaven, and so far as it consists with the condition of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we live like so many Gods in the world; which is doubtless the utmost height of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> that any rational Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition can aspire to. So that methinks had we any spark of true Gallantry and Bravery of Mind in us, we should despise all other kinds of Life but <hi>this,</hi> and pity those gilded Bubbles that have nothing to boast of but their fine Cloaths and great Estates and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Titles of Honour; we should look upon all other Dignities as the trifling Play-games of Children in comparison of <hi>this,</hi> of living like the great Nobility of Heaven, that do all live by the pattern of the Life of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. CONSIDER the great <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of a heavenly Life. So long as we live <hi>earthy</hi> and <hi>sensual</hi> Lives, our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Souls are imprisoned in Sense, and all their Motions are circumscribed and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the narrow Sphere of <hi>sensitive</hi> Goods and Enjoyments. So that when we would follow our Reason, and do as that prescribes and dictates, we find our selves miserably <hi>hampered</hi> and <hi>intangled</hi>; the Lusts of our Flesh do hang like gyves so <hi>heavily</hi>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:106959:139"/>
upon us, that when ever our Reason and Conscience call we cannot move with any <hi>Freedom,</hi> but are fain to <hi>labour</hi> at every Step, and after a few faint Essays are utterly <hi>tired</hi> under the weight of our <hi>reluctant</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. So that the good which many times we would we do not, the law in our Minds being counter-voted by the law in our Members. Our reason and conscience tell us that we ought to <hi>love</hi> God above all, to <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> him and surrender up our selves to his Command and Disposal; and we are many times strongly inclined to follow its Dictates and Directions; but alas when we come to put them in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we find so many pull-backs within us, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o many <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>stubborn</hi> Aversions to our good Inclinations, that we have not the power to do as we would, or to dispose of our selves according to our own most reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Desires, but like miserable Slaves that are chained to the Oar, we are fain to row on whithersoever our imperious Lusts do command us, though we plainly see we are running on a Rock and invading our own destruction. And as we are not free in this ill State of life to follow our <hi>Reason,</hi> so neither are we free to follow our <hi>Lusts.</hi> For as when we would follow our Reason, our Lusts <hi>cling about</hi> and <hi>intangle</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:106959:139"/>
us, so when we would follow our Lusts our Reason <hi>clogs</hi> and <hi>restrains</hi> us; and by objecting to us the <hi>Indecency</hi> and <hi>Danger,</hi> the infinite <hi>Turpitude</hi> and <hi>Hazard</hi> of our sinful Courses, lays so many Rubs in our way that we cannot sin with any Freedom, but whithersoever we go we walk like Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners with the Shackles of <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> on our heels. So that which way soever we turn our selves, we find that our Power to dispose of our selves is under a great <hi>Restraint</hi> and <hi>Confinement,</hi> and we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther get leave of our Lusts to follow our Reason, nor of our Reason to follow our Lusts. For when we attempt the <hi>latter,</hi> our Reason curbs us with <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi>; and when we endeavour the <hi>former,</hi> our Appetite bridles us with <hi>Dislike</hi> and <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</hi> In this extremity therefore what is to be done that we may be <hi>free?</hi> Why the case is plain, we must resolve to conquer either our Reason or our Lusts: if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer our Reason, (which we shall find by far the <hi>harder</hi> Task of the two) we shall acquire the Freedom of <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Brutes,</hi> the Freedom to do Mischief and wallow in the mire without Shame or Remorse; but if we conquer our Lusts, we acquire the Freedom of <hi>Men,</hi> yea of <hi>Saints</hi> and of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>; the freedom to act reasonably with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106959:140"/>
Reluctance or Aversation; and this being much more <hi>easily</hi> to be acquired than the former, I dare appeal to any mans Reason which of the two is in it self most eligible. If therefore we would vindicate our <hi>rational</hi> Freedom, we must resolve to shake off those slavish Fetters, our <hi>brutish</hi> and our <hi>devilish</hi> Appetites, that do so perpetually <hi>turmoil</hi> and <hi>incumber</hi> us in all our virtuous Attempts and rational Operations; we must tie up our selves from executing their Commands and serving their wicked Wills and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and heartily resolve to act as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us in the Capacity of rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures related to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>one another.</hi> And then though <hi>at first</hi> we must expect to find our selves <hi>confined</hi> and <hi>straitned</hi> by our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Aversations, we shall be immediately released from all that <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> which did so continually curb us in the carreer of our Wickedness; and even our <hi>vicious</hi> Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation (if we couragiously persist in our <hi>good</hi> Resolution) will grow weaker and weaker, and be every day less and less combersome to us, till it is <hi>totally</hi> extinguished. And then we shall feel our selves intirely resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into our own Power, and be able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Check</hi> or <hi>Controle</hi> to dispose of our selves and all our Motions according as it shall seem to us most <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi>; then we
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:106959:140"/>
shall act with the greatest Vigour and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, having no counter-striving Principles to <hi>restrain</hi> or <hi>retard</hi> us, no vicious Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations on the one side, or guilty Shame or Fear on the other to <hi>counterpoize</hi> us in our rational Motions; then we shall move with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Check or Confinement in a large and noble Sphere, for we shall be pleased with what is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good</hi> without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve or Exception, and we shall do what we please without any <hi>Let</hi> or <hi>Hindrance.</hi> So that by ingaging our selves in the <hi>heavenly Life,</hi> we enter into a state of glorious <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and if we constantly persist in it and do still <hi>prevalently</hi> list to live as becomes us, we shall be more and more free to live as we <hi>list,</hi> till at last we are arrived into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Liberty, wherein we shall live without Restraint or Controul, without check of Conscience, or reluctance of Inclination, which are the two main Bars that <hi>confine</hi> and <hi>straiten</hi> men in their Operations. If therefore we would ever be <hi>free,</hi> let us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately come off from our vicious Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the Practice of this divine and heavenly Life, wherein by degrees if we couragiously hold on we shall wear off those Shackles that do so miserably hamper and intangle us; and then we shall be intirely free to do whatsoever our reason dictates to us; then
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106959:141"/>
we shall <hi>run the ways of Gods commandments,</hi> and like our blessed Brethren above be all Life and Spirit and Wing in the discharge of our Duty to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. CONSIDER the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of this <hi>heavenly Life.</hi> 'Tis true there is a sort of Pleasure that results from all the Acts of a <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>earthly</hi> Conversation; but we find by Experience, that though in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit it strangely <hi>allures</hi> and <hi>inchants</hi> us, yet in the Fruition it always <hi>disappoints</hi> our Expectation, and scarce <hi>performs</hi> in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment one half of what it <hi>promised</hi> to our Hope; and at the best 'tis but a <hi>present</hi> and <hi>transient</hi> Satisfaction of our <hi>brutish</hi> Sense, a Satisfaction that <hi>dims</hi> the Light, <hi>sullies</hi> the Beauty, <hi>impairs</hi> the Vigour, and <hi>restrains</hi> the Activity of the Mind; diverting it from <hi>better</hi> Operations, and indisposing it to the fruition of <hi>purer</hi> Delights; leaving no <hi>comfortable</hi> Rellish or <hi>gladsome</hi> Memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, but oftentimes <hi>going out</hi> in a stink, and <hi>determining</hi> in Bitterness, Regret and Disgrace. But in each act of this divine and celestial Life, there is something of the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> something of those <hi>divine</hi> Refreshments and Consolations upon which the good People of Heaven do live. For the greatest part of their Heaven springs from within their own Bosoms, even from
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106959:141"/>
the Conformity of their Souls to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly State and the sprightful out-goings of their Minds and Affections towards the heavenly Objects; from their <hi>contemplating</hi> and <hi>loving,</hi> their <hi>praising</hi> and <hi>adoring</hi> the most high God, from their <hi>Imitation</hi> of his Perfections, their <hi>Subjection</hi> to his Will, and <hi>Dependance</hi> on his Veracity; all which Acts, as I have already shewed, have the most <hi>ravishing</hi> Pleasures appendant to them, and are so necessary to the Felicity of rational Creatures, that the Wit of Man cannot fancy a <hi>rational</hi> Heaven without them. For the heaven of a rational Creature consisting in the most <hi>intense</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Exercise of its rational Faculties about the most <hi>suitable</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> Objects, what Object can be more convenient to such Faculties than that Almighty Sovereign of Beings, whose <hi>Power</hi> is the Spring of all <hi>Truth,</hi> and whose <hi>Nature</hi> is the Pattern of all <hi>Goodness.</hi> So that without a perfect Union of our Minds and Wills and Affections with God, there can be no possible <hi>Idea</hi> of a perfect Heaven of rational Pleasures, but in this blessed Union lies the very <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Quintessence</hi> of Heaven. Since therefore in every Act of every Virtue of the divine Life, there is at least an imperfect Union of the Soul with God, it necessarily follows that there must
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106959:142"/>
be some degree of the Pleasure of Heaven in every one. So that if we do not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence much greater Joy and Delight in the Acts of this divine Life, than ever we did in the highest Epicurisms and Sensualities, 'tis not because there are not much <hi>greater</hi> in them, but because we never exerted them with that <hi>Sprightliness</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> as we do our sensual Appetites and Perceptions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are <hi>clogg'd</hi> in the Exercise of them either by <hi>false</hi> Principles, or <hi>bodily</hi> Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, or <hi>sinful</hi> Aversations. But if we would take the pains to <hi>inure</hi> and <hi>accustom</hi> our selves to these heavenly Acts, we should find by degrees they would grow <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to us; and our Souls would be so <hi>habituated, contempered</hi> and <hi>disposed</hi> to them that we should upon all Occasions exert them with great Fredom and Inlargement. And then we should begin to feel and relish the Pleasure of them; then we should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Heaven of Delights springing up from within us and unfolding it self in each beatifical Act of our heavenly Conversation; then we should find our selves under the <hi>central</hi> force of Heaven most sweetly drawn along and attracted thither by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magnetism of its Joys and Pleasures; and in every act of our celestial Behaviour we should have some Foretast of the celestial
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106959:142"/>
Happiness. So that now we shall no longer need external Arguments to convince us of the Truth and Reality of that blessed State; for we shall feel it within our selves, and be able to penetrate into its blessed Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by the light of an infallible Experience. Now we shall have no Occasion to search the <hi>Records</hi> of Heaven to assure our selves of our Interest in it; for by a most <hi>sensible</hi> Earnest of Heaven within us, we shall be as <hi>fully</hi> satisfied of our Title to it, as if one of the winged Messengers of Heaven should come down from thence and tell us that he saw our Names <hi>inrolled</hi> in the Book of Life. And with this sweet Experience of Heaven within us we shall go on to Heaven with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Triumph and Alacrity, being tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all along from step to step with the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Relishes of its Joys and Pleasures; and in every vigorous Exercise of every Virtue of the Heavenly Life, we shall have such lively <hi>tasts</hi> and <hi>sensations</hi> of Heaven, as will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually excite us to exercise them still more <hi>vigorously</hi>; and still the more <hi>vigorously</hi> we exert them the <hi>more</hi> of Heaven we shall tast in them; and so the <hi>Vigour</hi> of our Virtue shall increase the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of it and the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of it shall increase its <hi>Vigour,</hi> till both are perfected and grown up into the blessed State of Heaven. Wherefore as we do love
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:106959:143"/>
Pleasure, which is the great Invitation to Action, let us be persuaded once for all to make a through Experiment of the <hi>heavenly Life</hi>; and if upon a sufficient Trial you do not find it the most <hi>pleasant</hi> kind of Life that ever you led, if you do not experience a far more noble Satisfaction in it than ever you did in all your <hi>studied</hi> and <hi>artificial</hi> Luxuries, I give you leave to brand me for an <hi>Impostor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. CONSIDER the great <hi>Repose</hi> and <hi>Ease</hi> of a Heavenly Life and Conversation. In every <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Course of Life, we find by Experience there is a great deal of <hi>Vneasiness</hi> and <hi>Disquiet.</hi> For the Mind is <hi>disturbed,</hi> the Conscience <hi>galled,</hi> the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections <hi>divided</hi> into opposite Factions, and the whole Soul in a most <hi>diseased</hi> and <hi>rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Posture. And indeed it is no Wonder it should be so, since 'tis in an <hi>unnatural</hi> State and Condition. For whilst 'tis in any unreasonable Course of Action, the very Frame and Constitution of it, as it is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Being, suffers an unnatural Violence, and is all <hi>unjointed</hi> and <hi>disordered.</hi> And therefore as a Body when its Bones are <hi>out,</hi> is never at Rest till they are <hi>set</hi> again; so a rational Soul when its Faculties and Powers are <hi>dislocated</hi> and put out of their <hi>natural,</hi> i. e. <hi>rational</hi> Course of Action, is continually <hi>rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:106959:143"/>
and <hi>disturbed,</hi> and always <hi>tossing</hi> to and fro, <hi>shifting</hi> from one Posture to another, <hi>turning</hi> it self from this to t'other Object and Enjoyment, but finding no ease or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in <hi>any</hi> till 'tis restored again to its own rational Course of Motion, and that is to act and move towards God, for whom it was made, and in whom alone it can be happy. And if its Reason were not strangely <hi>dozed</hi> and <hi>stupified</hi> with Sense and sensitive Pleasure, it would doubtless be a thousand times more <hi>restless</hi> and <hi>dissatisfied</hi> in this its preternatural State than it is; it would feel much more Distraction of Mind, Anguish of Conscience, and Tumult of Affections than 'tis now capable of, amidst the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enjoyments and Diversions of this World. For as a musical Instrument, were it a living thing, would doubtless be sensible of <hi>Harmony</hi> as its proper State (as a great Author of our own ingeniously discourses) and abhor <hi>Discord</hi> and <hi>Dissonancy</hi> as a thing preternatural to it; even so were our Reason but <hi>alive</hi> and <hi>awake</hi> within us, our Souls which according to their natural Frame were made <hi>Vnison</hi> with God, would be <hi>exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely</hi> sensible of those divine Virtues where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its <hi>Consonancy</hi> consists, as of that which is its proper State and native Complection; and complain as sadly of the <hi>vicious</hi> Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:106959:144"/>
of its Faculties, as the Body doth of <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Diseases</hi>; 'twould be perfectly <hi>sick</hi> of every unreasonable Motion, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to <hi>rest</hi> till its <hi>disjointed</hi> Faculties were <hi>rectified,</hi> and all its <hi>disordered</hi> Strings set <hi>in tune</hi> again. Which being once effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as it will <hi>quickly</hi> be in a continued Course of heavenly Action) we shall presently find our Souls disburthened of all those <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> Humours that do so perpetually <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, disquet</hi> and <hi>disturb</hi> us. For by <hi>relying</hi> upon God, we shall totally quit and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our selves of all those restless Cares and Anxieties which circle and prick us like a Crown of Thorns; by our hearty <hi>Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to his heavenly Will, we shall ease our Consciences of all that Horror, Rage and Anguish which proceeds from the invenom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Stings of our Guilt; by <hi>loving, admiring</hi> and <hi>adoring</hi> him, our Affections will be cured of all that Inconsistence and Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy that render them so <hi>tumultuous</hi> and <hi>disquieting.</hi> And these things being once accomplished, the <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>restless</hi> Soul will presently find it self in perfect <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Ease.</hi> For now all her jarring Faculties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tuned to the musical Laws of Reason, there will be a perfect Harmony in her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and she will have no disquieting Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within her; nothing but <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:106959:144"/>
Thoughts, <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>sweet</hi> Reflections, <hi>tame</hi> and <hi>manageable</hi> Affections, nothing but what abundantly contributes to her <hi>Repose</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> So that do but imagine what an Ease the Body enjoys when after a lingering Sickness it recovers a sound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and feels a lively Vigour possessing every Part, and actuating the Whole; such and much more is the Ease and Quiet of the Soul, when by the diligent Practice of the heavenly Life it feels it self recovered from the languishing Sickness of a sensual and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish Nature. Now she is no more <hi>tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> and <hi>agitated</hi> in a stormy sea of restless Thoughts and guilty Reflections, no more <hi>scorched</hi> with Impatience, or <hi>drowned</hi> with Grief, or <hi>shook</hi> with Fear, or <hi>bloated</hi> with Pride or Ambition, but all her Affections are resigned to the blessed Empire of a spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Mind, and cloathed in the Livery of her Reason. Now all the War and Contest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law in her <hi>Members</hi> and the Law in her <hi>Mind</hi> is ended in a glorious Victory and happy Peace; and those <hi>divided</hi> Streams her Will and Conscience, her Passions and her Reason are united in <hi>one</hi> Channel and flow towards <hi>one</hi> and the same Ocean. And being thus jointed and knit together by the Ties and Ligaments of Virtue, the Soul is perfectly <hi>well</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> and enjoys a most
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106959:145"/>
sweet <hi>Repose</hi> within it self. Wherefore as you value your own Rest and Ease, and would not be endlesly <hi>turmoiled</hi> and <hi>disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted,</hi> be persuaded heartily to ingage your selves in the Course of a heavenly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; and then though at first you must expect to find some <hi>Difficulty</hi> in it by reason of its Contrariety to your corrupt Natures, yet if you vigorously <hi>persist</hi> in it, you will find the Difficulty will soon <hi>wear off,</hi> and then 'twill be <hi>all</hi> Ease and Pleasure. For when our Nature is depraved either by <hi>Sensuality</hi> or <hi>Devilishness,</hi> 'tis like a Bone out of joint, full of Pain while it is <hi>out,</hi> and much more painful while it is <hi>setting,</hi> but as soon as <hi>that</hi> is done, 'tis immediately <hi>well</hi> and <hi>easie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. AND lastly, Consider the absolute <hi>Necessity</hi> of this heavenly Life and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For besides that God exacts it of us as an indispensable Condition of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and hath assured us that <hi>if we live after the flesh we shall die,</hi> and that <hi>without holiness we shall never see the Lord,</hi> besides this, I say, an heavenly Conversation is in the Nature of the thing <hi>necessary</hi> to qualifie us for Heaven, or, as the Apostle expresses it, <hi>to make us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> For Happiness being a <hi>relative</hi> thing, implies in the very Nature of it a mutual <hi>Correspondence</hi> between the <hi>Objects</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:106959:145"/>
which <hi>felicitate</hi> and the <hi>Faculties</hi> which are <hi>felicitated</hi> by them; and be the Objects never so good in themselves, never so preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Pleasure and Bliss, yet if they do not <hi>agree</hi> with the Faculties whereunto they are objected, instead of <hi>blessing,</hi> they will but <hi>afflict</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> them; and if a man were placed in the midst of Heaven among all the <hi>ravishing</hi> Fruitions with which that blessed place abounds, yet unless his Mind and Temper did <hi>suit</hi> and <hi>agree</hi> with them, they would be so many <hi>Miseries</hi> and <hi>Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to him, and he would be <hi>afflicted</hi> even in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom, and grope for <hi>Heaven</hi> in the midst of <hi>Paradise.</hi> So that supposing that God were so unreasonably <hi>fond</hi> of the Happiness of wicked Souls, as to prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Honour of his Government and the Purity of his Nature and the Sanction of his Laws, yet still there is an <hi>invincible</hi> Obstacle behind that must render their future Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>impossible</hi>; and that is, that it cannot be without a plain <hi>Contradiction</hi> to the Nature of things, the Temper of wicked Souls being wholly <hi>repugnant</hi> to all the Felicities of the other World. So that if they were all set before them, they would not be able to enjoy them, but must be forced to <hi>pine</hi> and <hi>famish</hi> amidst all that plenty of Delights, there being no viand in all that heavenly
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106959:146"/>
Entertainment that they would relish any Sweetness in. And therefore if God should so far pardon them, as not to <hi>punish</hi> them himself by any immediate stroke of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, <hi>that</hi> would be the <hi>utmost</hi> Favour that his Omnipotent Goodness could do for them whilst they continued in their Sins; which, notwithstanding such a Pardon, would for ever continue them extremely miserable. And what great matter doth a Pardon signifie to a Malefactor that is dying of the Stone or Strangury? he could but have died though he had <hi>not been</hi> pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and die he <hi>must</hi> though he <hi>be.</hi> And just as little almost would it signifie to a depraved Soul to be pardoned and absolved by God, whilst it hath a Disease within that preys upon its Vitals, and hastens it on to a certain Ruine. For it could have been but miserable in the future Life if it had not been pardoned, and miserable it must be, if it continue wicked, whether it be pardoned or no. For it is not so much the Place as the State that makes either Heaven or Hell; and the State of Heaven and Hell consists in perfect <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi>; and proportionably as we do improve in <hi>either</hi> of these, so we do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards the <hi>one</hi> State or the <hi>other.</hi> For as Heaven is the center of all that is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106959:146"/>
                     <hi>virtuous, pure</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and all that is <hi>good</hi> tends thither by a natural Sympathy; so Hell is the center of all <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and all that is <hi>bad</hi> doth naturally press and sink down thither, as towards its proper Place and Element; and should not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance concern it self to exclude wicked Souls out of Heaven, yet their own Wickedness would do it. For that is a Place of such inaccessible Light and Purity, that no Impurity or Wickedness can approach it, but must of necessity be beaten off with the dreadful lightnings of its Glory, and tumbled headlong down as oft as it essays to climb up thither; as on the other hand, should not God by an immediate Vengeance precipitate wicked Souls into Hell, yet their own Wickedness by the mighty weight of its own Nature, would inevitably press and sink them down into that miserable Condition. What egregious Nonsense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it, for wicked men to talk of going to Heaven? Alas! poor Creatures what would you do there? There are no wanton <hi>Amours</hi> among those heavenly <hi>Lovers</hi>; no Rivers of <hi>Wine</hi> among their Rivers of Pleasure to gratifie your unbounded <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality</hi>; no <hi>Parasites</hi> to flatter your lofty <hi>Pride</hi>; no <hi>Miseries</hi> to feed your meagre <hi>Envy</hi>; no <hi>Mischiefs</hi> to tickle your devillish
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106959:147"/>
                     <hi>Revenge</hi>; nothing but <hi>chast</hi> and <hi>divine, pure</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Enjoyments, such as your <hi>brutish</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Appetites will eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>loath</hi> and <hi>nauseate.</hi> Wherefore if we mean to go to Heaven, and to be happy there, we must now endeavour to <hi>dispose</hi> and <hi>attemper</hi> our Minds to it; which is no other way to be done, but by leading a heavenly Life and Conversation; which by degrees will <hi>habituate</hi> and <hi>naturalize</hi> our Souls to the heavenly Virtues, and so <hi>work</hi> and <hi>inlay</hi> them into the Frame and Temper of our Minds, that 'twill be our greatest Pleasure to be <hi>exerting</hi> and <hi>exercising</hi> them. And then our Souls will be <hi>dressed</hi> and <hi>made ready</hi> for Heaven, and when we go from hence to take Possession of its Joys, they will be all so agreeable to our <hi>prepared</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, that we shall presently fall to and feed upon them with infinite Gust and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. But till by living a heavenly Life we have disposed our selves for Heaven, we are utterly incapable of enjoying it. So that now things are reduced to this Issue, that either our <hi>Sins</hi> or our <hi>Souls</hi> must die, and we must necessarily shake hands either with <hi>Heaven</hi> or our <hi>Lusts.</hi> And therefore unless we value eternal Happiness so little as to exchange it for the <hi>sordid</hi> and <hi>trifling</hi> Pleasures of Sin, and unless we love our Sins
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106959:147"/>
so well as to ransom them with the bloud of our Immortal Souls, it concerns us speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily to ingage our selves in this heavenly Life and Conversation. For this is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and immutable Law, that if we will be <hi>wicked,</hi> we must be <hi>miserable.</hi>

               <p>HAVING in the former Chapter given a large Account of the <hi>heavenly Part</hi> of the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> and shewn how <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> the Practice of all the Virtues that are comprehended in it tends to the heavenly State, and how <hi>naturally</hi> they all grow into eternal Happiness; I shall in the next Place endeavour to give some brief Account of that Part of the Christian Life which is purely <hi>militant,</hi> and which wholly consists of those <hi>instrumental Duties,</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:106959:148"/>
by the Use of which we are to conquer the <hi>difficulties</hi> of those heavenly Virtues, and to <hi>acquire</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> them. Which Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as I shewed before, Chap. 2. are the inbred <hi>Corruptions</hi> of our own Nature, together with those manifold <hi>Temptations</hi> from without, by which they are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>provoked</hi> and <hi>excited:</hi> and so to <hi>subdue</hi> and <hi>conquer</hi> these, as that they may neither take us off <hi>from</hi> nor clog and indispose us <hi>in</hi> the Exercise of the <hi>heavenly Virtues,</hi> is the great Design and Business of this <hi>warfaring</hi> Part of the Christian Life.</p>
               <p>THAT I may therefore handle it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, I shall divide it into three Parts, and endeavour with as much Brevity as I can; First, To <hi>explain</hi> the Duties of each Part, and to shew how they all conduce to our <hi>conquering</hi> the Difficulties of the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Virtues,</hi> and to the <hi>acquiring</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting</hi> them; and, Secondly, To <hi>press</hi> the Duties of each Part with <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>suitable</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>IN this part of our Christian Life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our <hi>Beginning</hi> or <hi>Entrance</hi> into it, which is in Scripture called <hi>Repentance from dead works.</hi>

                  <p>THIS first part of our <hi>militant</hi> Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but our <hi>Initial</hi> Repentance, or the first <hi>turning</hi> of our Souls to God from a state of wilful Sin and Rebellion, the Duties that are proper to it, and by which this <hi>turn</hi> of our Souls is to be introduced and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, may be reduced to these six Heads,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A hearty and firm <hi>Belief</hi> of the Truth of our <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A due <hi>Consideration</hi> of its <hi>Motives,</hi> and a ballancing of them with the <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> and <hi>Difficulties</hi> we are to undergo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A deep and through <hi>Conviction</hi> of our great need of a <hi>Mediator</hi> to render us acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:106959:149"/>4. A hearty <hi>Sorrow, Shame</hi> and <hi>Remorse</hi> for our Sins past.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Earnest <hi>Prayer</hi> to God for <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> to enable us effectually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A serious and well weighed <hi>Resolution</hi> to forsake and abandon them for ever.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. IT is necessary to our good <hi>Beginning</hi> of this our <hi>Christian Warfare,</hi> that we should heartily <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> of our Religion. For our hearty <hi>Belief</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is in Scripture represented as the main and principal Weapon by which we are to combat against the World and our own Lusts. And hence it is called <hi>the shield of faith,</hi> and <hi>the breastplate of faith,</hi> which are the two principal parts of Armour of <hi>Defence,</hi> denoting that an hearty <hi>Belief</hi> of the Gospel is the principal <hi>Defence</hi> of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian against all the <hi>fiery darts</hi> of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Armour of Proof that guards our Innocence, and renders us Invulnerable in all our spiritual Conflicts. For, <hi>above all things,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>take the shield of faith whereby ye shall be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked one,</hi> Eph. vi.16. And as it is the principal part of our <hi>defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi> so it is also of our <hi>offensive</hi> Armour. For so we find all the Victories and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of those glorious Heroes, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:106959:149"/>
attributed to this irresistible Weapon of their Faith. 'Twas by Faith that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised Crowns, confronted the Anger of Kings, and triumphed over the bitterest Torments and Afflictions; <hi>by faith that they wrought righteousness, obtained promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, stopped the mouths of lyons, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, and out of weakness were made strong.</hi> Nay so great a share hath <hi>Faith</hi> in the Successes of our <hi>Christian Warfare,</hi> that it is called by the Apostle, <hi>the good fight of faith,</hi> 1 Tim. vi.12. and S. <hi>John</hi> assures us, that <hi>this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith,</hi> 1 John v.4.</p>
                  <p>FOR if we firmly <hi>believe</hi> the Gospel, that will furnish us with undeniable Answers to return to all Temptations, and enable our Faith infinitely to <hi>out-bid</hi> the World whatsoever it should proffer us for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. For our <hi>Belief</hi> of the Gospel car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the one hand infinitely greater <hi>Goods,</hi> and in the other infinitely greater <hi>Evils</hi> to <hi>allure</hi> and <hi>bind</hi> us fast to our Duty, than any the World can propose to <hi>entice</hi> or <hi>terrifie</hi> us from it. For on the one hand it discovers to us those immortal Regions of the Blessed, which are the proper Seat and pure Element of Happiness; where the blessed Inhabitants live in a continued Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:106959:150"/>
of their utmost Wishes, being every moment entertained with fresh inravishing Scenes of Pleasure; where all their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is <hi>eternal,</hi> and all their Eternity no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but one continued Act of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Triumph</hi>; where there are no <hi>Sighs</hi> or <hi>Tears</hi>; no Intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Sorrow</hi> or <hi>Misery,</hi> but every Heart is full of <hi>Joy,</hi> and every Joy is a <hi>Quintessence,</hi> and every happy Moment is crowned with some fresh and new Enjoyment. On the other hand it sets before our eyes a most <hi>frightful</hi> and <hi>amazing</hi> Prospect of those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Shades of Horror, where mighty Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of condemned Ghosts perpetually wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to and fro, tormented with endless <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Despair</hi>; where they always <hi>burn</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>consuming,</hi> always <hi>faint</hi> but never <hi>die,</hi> being forced to languish out a long Eternity in unpitied Sighs and Groans. And after such a Prospect as this, what <hi>poor, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable</hi> Trifles will all the Goods and Evils of this world appear to us? But yet unless we <hi>believe</hi> the Reality of them, how great soever they may be <hi>in themselves,</hi> they will signifie no more to our <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> (which are the Master Springs of our Action) than if they were so many golden <hi>Dreams</hi> or live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Scare-crows.</hi> For all Proposals of good and evil do work upon the Minds of men
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106959:150"/>
proportionably as they are <hi>believed</hi> and <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented</hi> to; and as that which is not <hi>true, is not,</hi> so that which we do not <hi>believe,</hi> is to us as if it <hi>were not.</hi> How then is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible we should be moved by that Good or Evil which we do not <hi>believe,</hi> and in which by consequence we cannot apprehend our selves <hi>concerned?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE in our <hi>Entrance</hi> into the <hi>Christian Warfare,</hi> it is highly necessary that we do not take up our Faith at <hi>a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and believe <hi>winking,</hi> without knowing <hi>why</hi> or <hi>wherefore</hi>; but that we should, so far as we are able, impartially examine the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> of our Religion, and search into the <hi>Grounds</hi> of its <hi>Credibility,</hi> that so we may be able to give some Reason to <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>others</hi> of the Hope that is in us. For which End it will be needful that we should read, and impartially consider, some of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies</hi> for the <hi>Christian Religion</hi>; of which we have sundry excellent ones in our own Language <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleets</hi> Origines. Dr. <hi>Patricks</hi> Translation of <hi>Grotius.</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Wolsely.</hi>
                     </note>; and if we will but take the pains to instruct our selves in the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> Evidences of Christianity, we shall quickly see abundant cause to assent to it; and then our Faith being founded on a firm Basis of Reason will be able to bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106959:151"/>
to the World, and to out-stand the most furious Storms of Temptation.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. TO our good <hi>Beginning</hi> of this our <hi>Christian Warfare,</hi> it is also necessary that we should duly <hi>consider</hi> the <hi>Motives</hi> of our Religion, and ballance them with the <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> and <hi>Difficulties</hi> we are to undergo. For thus our Saviour makes <hi>Consideration</hi> a necessary Introduction to our <hi>Christian Warfare, Luke</hi> xiv.28. where he compares mens rushing headlong into the Difficulties of the Christian Life without Consideration, to a mans resolving to build a Tower with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out computing the Charge of it, or a Kings going to War without ever considering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand whether with his Army of ten Thousand he be able to encounter his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with Twenty. By both which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons he intimates to us the unprosperous Issue of mens listing themselves under his Banner to combat the Devil, the World and their own Lusts without ever considering before-hand either their <hi>own</hi> Strength or their <hi>Enemies,</hi> the Arguments with which <hi>they</hi> must fight, or the Difficulties that will <hi>trash</hi> and <hi>oppose</hi> them. So that when they come to execute their rash Resolutions, there start up so many Difficulties in their way which they never <hi>thought of,</hi> and against which they took no care to <hi>fore-arm</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:106959:151"/>
that they have not the Heart and Courage to stand before them, but after a few faint Attempts are presently sounding a cowardly Retreat.</p>
                  <p>FOR indeed <hi>Consideration</hi> is the Life and Soul of Faith, that <hi>animates</hi> and <hi>actuates</hi> its Principles, and <hi>elicits</hi> and <hi>draws forth</hi> all their natural Power and Energy. And let the Truths we believe be never so <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>momentous</hi> in themselves, never so apt to <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>invigorate</hi> us, yet unless we seriously <hi>consider</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> them to our Wills and Affections, and take the pains to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract out of them their native Vigour and Efficacy and to infuse it into our Faculties and Powers, they will lie like so many dead Notions in our Minds, and never impart to us the least Degree of spiritual Courage and Activity. And accordingly our Saviour attributes the ill Success of Gods Word in the Hearts of men (which he compares to the <hi>high-way,</hi> the <hi>stony</hi> and <hi>thorny</hi> Ground) either to their not considering it <hi>at all,</hi> or to their not considering it <hi>deeply</hi> enough, or to their not considering it <hi>long</hi> enough. Either the divine Truths which they heard went no farther than their Ears, and so lay openly exposed like so many loose corns upon the high-way to be picked up by the Fowls of the Air; or if it entred into their
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106959:152"/>
Mind and Consideration, it was so <hi>slightly</hi> and <hi>superficially,</hi> that like corn sown in a rocky ground it had not Depth enough to take root, to <hi>fasten</hi> and <hi>grow</hi> into their minds and <hi>digest</hi> into Principles of Action; or if they at present received it into their deeper and more serious Consideration, it was but for <hi>a little while,</hi> for by and by they permit their worldly Cares and Pleasures, like Thorns, to spring up in their Thoughts and Choak it, before it was arrived to any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. But that which rendred it so <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> and <hi>fruitful</hi> in good and honest Hearts, was, that having heard the word they <hi>kept it,</hi> i. e. retained it in their <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,</hi> and so <hi>brought forth fruit with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> Luk. viii.12, 13, 14, 15. So that to the making of a good <hi>Beginning</hi> in Religion, it is not only necessary that we should <hi>ponder</hi> the Motives and Arguments of Religion, and ballance them with the Difficulties of it, but that we should <hi>revolve</hi> and <hi>repeat</hi> them on our minds till we have represented to our selves with the utmost Life and Reality, whatsoever makes <hi>for</hi> and <hi>against</hi> our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Christian Warfare; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our having weighed them over and over in the Scales of an even and impartial Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we have brought the Debate to this Result and Conclusion, that there is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:106959:152"/>
more Weight in the <hi>Arguments</hi> of Religion to <hi>persuade</hi> us to it, than in all the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of it to <hi>dishearten</hi> us from it. For unless we enter into Religion <hi>fore-armed</hi> with the Motives, and <hi>forewarned</hi> of the difficulties of it, we shall never be able to stand our Ground; but finding more <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> than we expected, and having not a sufficient Strength of Argument to <hi>bear up</hi> against it, we shall quickly <hi>repent</hi> of our rash Undertaking, and be forced to <hi>retreat</hi> from it with Shame and Dishonour. For this is usually the Issue of those <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>unsetled</hi> Purposes which men make in the heats of their Passion; when they have been <hi>warmed</hi> by some pathetick Discourse, or <hi>startled</hi> by some great Danger, or <hi>chafed</hi> into a Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against their Sins by the sense of some very dolorous Accident whereinto they have been betrayed by them; in these or such like Cases, its usual with men to make <hi>hasty</hi> Resolutions of Amendment, without considering either the <hi>Matters</hi> which they resolve upon, or the <hi>Motives</hi> which should support their Resolution; and so finding when they come to Practice, more Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the Matter than they were aware of, and having not sufficient Motives to carry them through it, their Resolution <hi>flags</hi> in the Execution, and very often <hi>yields</hi>

to the next Temptation which encounters them.</p>
                  <p>NOW though I do not deny but that those Heats of Passion are good Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to <hi>begin</hi> our Religion in, and if <hi>wisely</hi> improved will very much contribute to our Voyage heavenwards, and like a brisk Gale of Wind render it much more <hi>expedite</hi> and <hi>easie</hi>; yet if in these Heats we resolve too soon, without a due Consideration of all Particulars, and of the Difficulties on the one side and the Arguments on the other, it is hardly possible that our Resolution should ever prove a lasting Principle of Goodness. For when we resolve <hi>inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,</hi> we resolve to do we know not <hi>what,</hi> and our Resolution includes a thousand Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that we are not <hi>aware</hi> of; most of which being repugnant to our vicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, will when we come to practise them be attended with such Difficulties as will easily startle our weak Resolution, which having not a sufficient Foundation of Reason to support it, will never be able to outstand those boisterous Storms of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation whereunto it will be continually exposed. If therefore we mean our Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution should <hi>hold out,</hi> and commence a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Principle of Goodness, we must found it in a through <hi>Consideration</hi> both of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:106959:153"/>
                     <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Difficulties</hi> of Religion, and of the <hi>Motives</hi> which should ingage us to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; we must set before our Minds all the Sins we must <hi>part with,</hi> and all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we must <hi>submit to,</hi> and fairly represent to our selves all the Difficulties and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations wherewith we must <hi>ingage</hi>; and as much as in us lies render them <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>present</hi> to us, by supposing our selves <hi>already</hi> ingaged in our Spiritual Warfare and surrounded with all the Temptations both from within and without that we can reasonably expect will oppose themselves against us; and having thus placed our selves in the midst of the Difficulties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we must never cease urging our selves with the great Arguments and Motives of it, till we have throughly persuaded our stubborn Wills and obtained of them an explicit Consent to every Duty that calls for our Consent and Resolution.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. TO our good <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Warfare</hi> it is also necessary that we be <hi>deeply</hi> and <hi>throughly</hi> convinced of our great need of a <hi>Mediator</hi> to make a Propitiation for our Sins and render us acceptable to God. For 'tis to convince us of this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Truth that the Scripture doth so expresly declare that as <hi>there is one God,</hi> so <hi>there is one Mediator between God and men,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:106959:154"/>
the man Christ Jesus,</hi> 1 Tim. ii.5. that <hi>if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,</hi> and that <hi>he is the Propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but for the sins of the whole world</hi>; and that <hi>'tis for his name sake that our sins are forgiven,</hi> 1 John ii.1, 2, 12. that <hi>we have redemption through his blood,</hi> Eph. i.7. and that <hi>without the shedding his blood there is no remission,</hi> and that <hi>'twas by the sacrifice of himself that Christ put away sin,</hi> Heb. ix.22, 26. that <hi>we are accepted of God through his beloved Son,</hi> Eph. i.6. that <hi>Christ is entred into heaven now to appear in the presence of God for us,</hi> Heb. ix.24. and that there <hi>he ever lives to make intercession for us,</hi> Heb. vii.25. that <hi>'tis through him that we have access unto the Father,</hi> Eph. ii.18. and <hi>by him that we have admittance to his grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> Rom. v.2. The design of all which is, throughly to <hi>convince</hi> us of this great truth, that by our Apostacy from God and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against him we have all rendred our selves so very obnoxious to his Vengeance, that he would not pardon us upon any less <hi>Atonement</hi> than the precious Blood, nor admit us into favour upon any less <hi>Motive</hi> than the powerful Intercession of his own Son; that by the heinousness of our Guilt we have so highly incensed the Father of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:106959:154"/>
Mercies against us, that no less considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Advocation</hi> of the greatest and dearest Person in the whole world will move him to admit of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and listen to our Supplications. And certainly next to exacting the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to our sins at our <hi>own hands,</hi> the most dreadful Severity he could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed was to resolve not to remit it upon any other consideration than that of his own Sons undergoing it in <hi>our stead</hi>; by which he hath given us the greatest reason that Heaven and Earth could afford to tremble at his Justice, even whilst we are inclosed in the Arms of his Mercy.</p>
                  <p>THIS therefore we ought to be deeply and throughly convinced of, that our Sins have set us at such a <hi>distance</hi> from God, that 'tis nothing but the bloud of Christ will <hi>reconcile</hi> him to us; and that though <hi>without</hi> our Repentance he will never be reconciled to us, yet 'tis not for the sake of that or any thing else <hi>we</hi> can do that he will be induced to receive us into favour, but only for the sake of that precious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which his eternal Son hath offered up for us. The firm <hi>Persuasion</hi> and <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> of which will mightily <hi>over-awe</hi> our minds, and imprint upon them such <hi>gastly</hi> and <hi>horrible</hi> Apprehensions of sin, as
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:106959:155"/>
will <hi>scare</hi> us from all thoughts of Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with it; the dreadful demonstration which God hath given us of his righteous severity against it in the very Reason of his pardoning it, will effectually <hi>antidote</hi> us against all our sinful Securities and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences: For this way of Gods pardoning us upon the Sacrifice of his Son, guards his Mercy with such an awful Terror, as is sufficient to dishearten the most desperate sinner from presuming upon it. For he that dares presume to sin on upon a Mercy that cost the bloud of the Son of God, hath courage enough to <hi>out-face</hi> the Flames of Hell, and is not capable of any Mercy that the great God can indulge with safety to his own Authority. For what Mercy can be safe from that mans <hi>Abuse</hi> and <hi>Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> that dares abuse a Mercy so <hi>guarded</hi> and <hi>secured</hi> as this is, by being founded upon such a dreadful Consideration?</p>
                  <p>AND as a through Persuasion of the Necessity of <hi>Christs Sacrifice</hi> to the Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Sins will fill us with awful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of the divine Severity, and set before us a most dismal Prospect of the vast demerit of our Sin, both which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to ingage us to a through Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so a through conviction of the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of his <hi>Intercession</hi> to render our <hi>Duties,</hi>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:106959:155"/>
our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> acceptable to God, will effectually <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>abase</hi> us in our own eyes, which, as I shall shew you by and by, is highly conducive to a good <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of this our <hi>Christian Warfare.</hi> For next to <hi>banishing</hi> us from his Presence <hi>for ever,</hi> the most effectual course God could take to <hi>abase</hi> us was to exclude us from all <hi>immediate</hi> Intercourse with him, and not to admit of any more Addresses or Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations from us, but only through the hands of a <hi>Mediator</hi>; which is a plain Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how infinitely <hi>pure</hi> he is, and how <hi>base</hi> and <hi>vile</hi> our Sins have rendred us: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he will not suffer a sinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to come near him otherwise than by a <hi>Proxy,</hi> that he will not accept of a <hi>Service</hi> from a guilty Hand, nor listen to a <hi>Prayer</hi> from a sinful Mouth, till 'tis first <hi>hallowed</hi> and <hi>presented</hi> to him by a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. So that unless we are strangely <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate,</hi> we cannot but be touched with a deep sense of our own <hi>Vileness,</hi> when we think at what a <hi>distance</hi> the pure and holy God keeps us; how he <hi>stands off</hi> at the Stench of our Abominations, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his Benignity towards us, will neither <hi>hear us,</hi> nor have any thing to <hi>do with</hi> us, without the powerful <hi>Intercession</hi> of his own Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:106959:156"/>AND as our Conviction of the Necessity we have of Christs <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> is very apt to affect us with holy <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> both which are very powerful Instruments of our Reformation; so our persuasion of the Reality and Excellency of his <hi>Mediation</hi> is no less apt to inspire us with a mighty <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> of Acceptance with God if we reform and amend. For it seems that upon <hi>propitiatory</hi> Sacrifices and <hi>interceding</hi> Spirits, guilty Minds have been always inclined to place their Confidence of Acceptance with God. Hence it was a Principle generally received by men of all Nations and Religions, (however it came to pass I know not,) that for sinful men to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease the incensed Divinity it was necessary, first, that some <hi>Life</hi> should be <hi>sacrificed</hi> to him by way of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for their Sins, and that the <hi>nobler</hi> it was, the more <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious</hi> it rendred him. 2. That some high Favourite of his should be prevailed with to <hi>intercede</hi> with him in their behalf. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon understanding by universal Tradition that there were a sort of <hi>middle Beings</hi> (whom they called <hi>Demons</hi>) between the sovereign God and Men, they began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to <hi>these</hi> and to bribe them with sacred Honours to <hi>interpose</hi> with God in their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. And if they could make a shift to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:106959:156"/>
rely upon <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> the most precious of which were the Lives of sinful Men; and to depend upon <hi>Intercessors</hi> of whose Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest with God they had little or no Security; what a mighty ground of Confidence and Assurance have <hi>we,</hi> for whom the Son of God once offered such a <hi>meritorious</hi> Sacrifice upon Earth, and continues to make such a <hi>powerful</hi> Intercession in Heaven? For besides that as he was a <hi>spotless</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> Person, his Sacrifice was <hi>wholly</hi> meritorious for guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offenders, and besides that as he was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of infinite <hi>Value</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> his Sacrifice was meritorious for a <hi>World</hi> of guilty offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; God, upon whose good Pleasure the <hi>Admission</hi> or <hi>Refusal</hi> of it intirely depended, has openly declared his Acceptation thereof as a Propitiation for the sins of the World, and ingaged himself by a publick <hi>Grant</hi> and <hi>Charter</hi> of Mercy to indemnifie for the sake of it every sinner in the World that will but return to him by a serious and hearty Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; neither of which great things could ever be said of any <hi>other</hi> Sacrifice. And in the virtue of this <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as well as of his own personal <hi>Interest</hi> with his Father, he now <hi>intercedes</hi> in our behalf; and pleading our Cause, as he doth, with the price of our Souls in his hand, even his precious Blood by which he redeemed them, we may
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106959:157"/>
be sure that with that powerful <hi>Oratory</hi> he cannot fail of succeeding in our behalf. For having <hi>purchased</hi> for us by his Blood, all those favours which he <hi>intercedes</hi> for, he is invested with the Right and Power of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing</hi> them upon us. So that now, for our greater Security, all those Favours which God hath <hi>promised</hi> us, are actually <hi>deposited</hi> in the hands of our <hi>Mediator</hi>; and though his bare Promise is in it self as great an Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as can be given us, yet it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that guilty Minds are naturally <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious</hi> and full of unreasonable <hi>Jealousies,</hi> and consequently whilst they looked upon God as their <hi>adverse</hi> Party, and a Party infinitely <hi>offended</hi> by them, would have been very prone to <hi>suspect</hi> the worst, had they had nothing but his bare Word to depend on. And therefore in Condescension to this piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Infirmity of his sinful Creatures, he hath not only <hi>promised</hi> them his Acceptance and Favour upon Condition of their Return to him, but hath also put the <hi>Performance</hi> of his Promise into a <hi>third Hand,</hi> even into the Hand of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> who by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Office is <hi>equally</hi> concerned for both Parties; as well that God should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his <hi>Promise,</hi> if we performed our <hi>Duty,</hi> as that we should perform our <hi>Duty</hi> if we received the Benefit of his <hi>Promise.</hi> And
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:106959:157"/>
hence, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii.22. our Mediator is called the <hi>Sponsor,</hi> or <hi>Surety of a better Covenant.</hi> So that now we have no longer to do with God <hi>immediately</hi> as our adverse Party, but by a <hi>Mediator,</hi> who by his Office is obliged to be on <hi>our</hi> side as well as <hi>Gods,</hi> and to take care that neither receive the <hi>others</hi> Part of the Covenant without performing his <hi>own.</hi> Thus as he hath been sometimes pleased in Complyance with humane Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to enforce his <hi>Promise</hi> with his <hi>Oath,</hi> not that the <hi>one</hi> is in its own Nature a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Security from <hi>God</hi> than the <hi>other,</hi> but because with <hi>Men</hi> an <hi>Oath</hi> is more obliging than a <hi>Promise</hi>; so in great Condescension to the unreasonable <hi>Diffidence</hi> of our guilty Minds, he hath not only <hi>promised</hi> us Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Acceptance upon our Repentance, but he hath also given us a <hi>collateral Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> for the Performance of it, even the Security of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> in whose hands he hath <hi>deposited</hi> whatsoever he hath promised us. Not that <hi>in it self</hi> this is a greater Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity than his own bare Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which he cannot <hi>falsifie</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his Being: but because this way of giving Security by a <hi>third Person</hi> is more <hi>accommodate</hi> to the Method of our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Agreements with one another, and consequently more apt to satisfie our <hi>anxious</hi> and <hi>diffident</hi> Minds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:106959:158"/>AND thus the Conviction of our need of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and the Persuasion of the <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of his Mediation will powerfully work both on our <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> which are the main Springs of all our religious Endeavours; and give us at once the most <hi>horrible</hi> Prospect of the Evil of Sin, and the most <hi>comfortable</hi> Assurance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Acceptance with God upon our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Amendment; both which are absolutely necessary to our successful <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi> into the <hi>Christian Warfare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. TO our <hi>Beginning</hi> of this <hi>Holy War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare</hi> it is also necessary that we should be affected with a deep <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Remorse</hi> for our past Iniquities. For this the Apostle calls <hi>sorrowing to repentance,</hi> and tells us that <hi>godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of,</hi> 2 Cor. vii.9, 10. and accordingly it is recorded of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Converts that the beginning of their repentance was their being <hi>pricked at the heart,</hi> Acts ii.37. and even Repentance it self is in Scripture called <hi>a broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart,</hi> this being the most immediate Preparation to a true Repentance or Change of mind, <hi>Psal.</hi> li.17. And hence the ancient Penitents are described in Scripture as <hi>gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves with sackcloth and repenting in dust and ashes</hi>; in Allusion to the antient
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:106959:158"/>
manner of <hi>great</hi> and <hi>solemn</hi> Mournings, which was to put on <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> cover the Head with <hi>Ashes,</hi> and sit in the <hi>Dust.</hi> And in the primitive and purest Ages of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it is evident that the <hi>bitterest</hi> Sorrows and Remorses were looked upon as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Preparations to Repentance; for the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents in those days, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> describes them, <q>lay prostrate at the Church Doors in Sackcloth and Ashes, supplicating the Prayers of the Presbyters and Widows, hanging on the Garments and Knees of those that entred into the Church, kissing their Footsteps and with rivers of Tears in their eyes beseeching their Prayers to God for their Pardon.</q>
Now though we are not under the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of such an <hi>Ecclesiastical Discipline,</hi> yet are we equally obliged with those ancient Penitents to exercise it <hi>internally</hi> in our Hearts. For sin is as bad <hi>now</hi> as it was <hi>then,</hi> and as great an evil in <hi>us,</hi> as it was in <hi>them</hi>; and therefore ought to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us with an <hi>equal</hi> Sorrow and Remorse. And indeed if we ever mean to wage War with it with Success, it is necessary we should acquire before-hand a through <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> of the Evil of it; that we should <hi>chastise</hi> our souls with some degree of that <hi>bitter</hi> Sorrow and Regret it deserves, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:106959:159"/>
inflict upon our selves some part of that Hell of infinite <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Anguish</hi> that is ingendring in its Womb; that so being the more <hi>sensible</hi> of its Malignity, we may be the more <hi>enraged</hi> against it and enter the Lists with it with the greater <hi>Resolution</hi> and <hi>Animosity.</hi> For our Sorrow and Remorse for our Sins, if it be <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>hearty,</hi> will convert into <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Indignation</hi> against them, and that Hatred will <hi>animate</hi> us in all our Conflicts with them, and render us more <hi>obstinate</hi> against their Terrors and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements. So that when in the aftercourse of our Warfare against them, we are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted afresh to <hi>yield</hi> and <hi>comply</hi> with them, the Remembrance of the past <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Sorrow, Remorse</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone for <hi>their</hi> sakes, will render us far more <hi>deaf</hi> and <hi>inexorable</hi> than otherwise we should be to their Solicitations.</p>
                  <p>IF therefore we would ingage in this spiritual Warfare with Success, we must be often <hi>reflecting</hi> upon our past Sins, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting</hi> them to our selves in all their <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating</hi> Circumstances. And when we have surveyed them <hi>round about,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered them in all their natural <hi>Turpitude; Disingenuity</hi> and <hi>Indecency,</hi> and applied them to our selves with all their <hi>appendant</hi> Stings, <hi>shameful</hi> Effects and <hi>dismal</hi> Circumstances,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:106959:159"/>
so that our hearts begin to <hi>feel</hi> them, and to <hi>smart</hi> and <hi>bleed</hi> under the dolorous Sense of them; then must we pour them out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in <hi>sad</hi> and <hi>mournful</hi> Confessions. For the very <hi>Confession</hi> of our Sins before so pure and great a Being, is in it self an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Means to increase our Shame and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them; and he must have a very hard Heart that can <hi>ingenuously</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Reserve</hi> lay open his crimes before the God of Heaven and Earth in all their <hi>black</hi> Aggravations, without being <hi>stung</hi> with a sensible Regret and Confusion; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he frequently repeat his Confessions as he ought to do.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. TO our successful <hi>Beginning</hi> of this our <hi>Christian Warfare</hi> it is also necessary that we earnestly <hi>implore</hi> the divine <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> to enable us to go through with it. For God knowing how unable we are <hi>of our selves</hi> to ingage in this great Enterprize with that good Conduct that is necessary to give us any probability of Success, hath promised us his own <hi>Presence</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> even from the <hi>Beginning</hi> to the <hi>End</hi> of it; and if in any part of it his Assistance be necessary, 'tis doubtless in the <hi>Entrance,</hi> which, as I shall shew you by and by, is by far the most <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous.</hi> If therefore we presume to <hi>enter</hi>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:106959:160"/>
upon it without <hi>supplicating</hi> God to <hi>second</hi> us with his Grace and Assistance, we shall quickly find our selves shamefully <hi>foiled</hi> and <hi>defeated.</hi> For though he hath promised to assist us, yet 'tis upon Condition that we earnestly <hi>beg</hi> and <hi>seek</hi> him; he will <hi>give his Spirit,</hi> but it is <hi>to those that ask it,</hi> Luke xi.13. he will <hi>draw near unto us,</hi> but first <hi>we must draw near unto him,</hi> James iv.8. and we are assured that <hi>we shall have if we ask, that we shall find if we seek, and that it shall be opened unto us if we knock,</hi> Mat. vii.7. And therefore we are bid to <hi>go boldly to the throne of grace that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy and find grace to help us in the time of need,</hi> Heb. iv.16. and not only to <hi>pray without ceasing,</hi> 1 Thess. v.17. but <hi>in every thing by prayer and supplication to let our requests be made known unto God,</hi> Philip. iv.6. and if in <hi>every thing</hi> we ought to make known our Wants to him, then much more in this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in which it will be impossible for us to succeed without his heavenly Aid and Assistance.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE as we hope for Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this our <hi>spiritual Warfare,</hi> we must earnestly implore his <hi>Concurrence</hi> with us, and beseech him to <hi>second</hi> us in all our weak Efforts and Endeavours. We must
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:106959:160"/>
lay open our woful Case before him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to him that we are heartily <hi>willing</hi> to do what we are <hi>able,</hi> but that without him we are abundantly sensible all will be <hi>in vain.</hi> We must tell him that our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance is <hi>upon</hi> him, and that all our Hope of Success is <hi>in</hi> him, and that we dare not stir one step <hi>without</hi> him; and beseech him that he will not <hi>stand by,</hi> and see us spend our selves in <hi>ineffectual</hi> Struglings, but that he will graciously stretch forth his <hi>helping</hi> Hand to us, and not suffer us to miscarry for want of his necessary <hi>Assistance.</hi> Which if we do, we may assure our selves that the merciful God, who is the Father of our Spirits, will never <hi>abandon</hi> his own off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring whilst it cries out to him, and with pitiful and bemoaning Looks implores his <hi>Aid</hi> and gracious <hi>Co-operation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHILST therefore we are thus endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to prepare our selves for our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Warfare, we ought in every act of Preparation to <hi>look up</hi> to God, and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>supplicate</hi> the Concurrence of his Grace and Spirit. While we are endeavouring to <hi>believe,</hi> we must beg him <hi>to help our Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> to remove all <hi>Prejudices</hi> from our minds and present the Evidences of our Religion to our Understandings in a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>convincing</hi> Light. When we are setting

our selves to a serious <hi>Consideration,</hi> we must beseech him to <hi>fix</hi> our Thoughts, to <hi>suggest</hi> to and <hi>repeat</hi> his heavenly Motives and Arguments so fast and thick upon our Minds, that no sinful or worldly Thought may be able to crowd in to <hi>disturb</hi> or <hi>divert</hi> our Meditations. When we are labouring to persuade our selves of our Need, and the Reality of our Saviours <hi>Mediation,</hi> we must earnestly intreat him to open our eyes, and convince us effectually of the horrible <hi>Danger</hi> of our sin, and of the infallible <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi> of that blessed Remedy. When we are attempting to <hi>affect</hi> our selves with the bitter Sense of our past Transgressions, we must implore him to strike in with us, and to inspire our Minds with such <hi>piercing</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> Convictions of the infinite <hi>Shame, Baseness</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> of them, as may sting our <hi>brawny</hi> Consciences to the quick, and dissolve our <hi>frozen</hi> Souls into a sorrowful Repentance; that so when we enter the lists and proceed to <hi>Resolution,</hi> which is the <hi>Beginning</hi> of our spiritual Warfare, we may be armed against our Sins with such a lively <hi>Faith,</hi> such puissant <hi>Considerations,</hi> such <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Animosity</hi> against them, and such an assured <hi>Hope</hi> of being rescued from the fatal Issues and Effects of them, as that we may be able to promise our selves

a happy Success in the ensuing <hi>Course</hi> of our Warfare against them. And having thus fitted and accoutred our selves for this great and momentous Enterprize;</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. WE are to enter into a serious and solemn <hi>Resolution</hi> of Amendment, of forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and renouncing all our Sins and never returning to them more, whatsoever Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations may <hi>invite,</hi> or Difficulties <hi>encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>oppose</hi> us. Which <hi>Resolution</hi> is in Scripture called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate <hi>Repentance,</hi> but in strictness signifies a <hi>Change of Mind</hi> or of Purpose and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a renouncing our <hi>sinful</hi> Purposes and solemnly ingaging our selves in a contrary Resolution of <hi>living soberly and righteously and godly in this present World.</hi> So that wheresoever the Precept of Repentance is expressed by this word, the meaning of it is, to oblige us to <hi>change</hi> the wicked <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses</hi> of our Hearts into a firm and serious <hi>Resolution</hi> of forsaking all ungodliness and worldly lusts and intirely resigning up our selves to the Will and Disposal of God. And hence it is that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, i. e. to <hi>change our minds</hi> and <hi>convert</hi> or <hi>turn,</hi> are in Scripture so often put together; the one denoting the <hi>inward</hi> Change of our Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the other the <hi>outward</hi> Change of our Practice pursuant to it.

and be converted,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> xxvi.20. <hi>that they should repent and turn to God and do works meet for repentance</hi>; that is, that they should resolve to forsake their Sins, and submit to their Duty, and put their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution into Practice. And so that other word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we also render <hi>Repentance,</hi> strictly signifies <hi>an after-care,</hi> that is pursuant unto this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <hi>Change of Resolution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW this Repentance or Change of Resolution is the <hi>Initial</hi> Act of the Religion of Sinners, whereby they <hi>resume</hi> their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man from the Service of sin, and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> and <hi>resign</hi> their Wills to God; whereby in Heart and Will they <hi>forsake</hi> the Devils Colours, and list themselves <hi>Volunteers</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Banner of Christ. And being so, it ought to be performed with so much the more <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Preparation.</hi> For the <hi>Beginning</hi> of all great Enterprizes is the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of them; which if it be not firmly laid will be apt to sink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Superstructures,</hi> and to endanger their Ruin and Downfal. Now all the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going</hi> Duties being necessary Preparations to a good <hi>Resolution,</hi> we ought before we <hi>resolve,</hi> to spend a considerable portion of time in the diligent Practice of <hi>them</hi>; and not to resolve hand over head till we are
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:106959:162"/>
duly and throughly prepared for it, till by exercising our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Consideration,</hi> &amp;c. we have <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>tamed</hi> our perverse and obstinate Wills, and throughly persuaded them to <hi>part with</hi> every Sin, and to <hi>approve of</hi> and <hi>consent to</hi> every Duty that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in a through Resolution of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. And if when we are about to <hi>resolve,</hi> we find upon a strict Examination any secret <hi>Reserve</hi> or <hi>Exception</hi> in our Wills, if there be any Lust which they are not throughly <hi>persuaded</hi> to part with, or any Duty to which they are not fully <hi>reconciled,</hi> we ought for that time to forbear <hi>resolving,</hi> and to go on in the Exercise of the <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> Duties, till we find our reluctant Wills throughly <hi>conquered</hi> and <hi>persuaded</hi> by them. For if there be any <hi>leak</hi> left open in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution for any Sin to creep in at, <hi>that</hi> will be sure to insinuate in the next <hi>Storm</hi> of temptation; and if it should not let in <hi>other</hi> Sins after it, as 'tis a thousand to one but it will, 'twill by its own <hi>single</hi> Weight sink us into eternal Perdition. Wherefore before ever we enter into the <hi>Resolution</hi> of Amendment, we ought to be very careful that our Wills be throughly <hi>prepared</hi> for it; that they be reduced to a fair <hi>Compliance</hi> with the matter we are resolving upon, and effectually <hi>dissuaded</hi> out of all Resolution
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:106959:163"/>
to the contrary; and when this is done, we may chearfully proceed to the forming of our good <hi>Resolution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHICH ought to be performed by us, between God and our selves, with the greatest <hi>Seriousness</hi> and <hi>Solemnity.</hi> For now our <hi>Hearts</hi> being ready, we are to betake our selves to our <hi>Knees,</hi> and in these or such like words to devote our selves to God, <hi>O thou blessed Author of my Being, I am now fully convinced that I ow my self to thee by a thousand Ties and Obligations, and am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely sorry and ashamed that I have so long sequestred and withdrawn my self from thee to serve my own base Lusts and Affections. Wherefore now in thy dread Presence, and in that of thy holy Angels, I here intirely resign up my self unto thee, and do resolve without any Reserve or Exception that whatsoever Temptations I may meet with for the future, I will never wilfully withdraw or alienate my self from thee more. From henceforth I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily renounce all my Sins, and particularly those that have been most dear and pleasant to me, and do faithfully promise to continue thy true and loyal Subject as long as I breath, and that whatsoever Invitations I may have to the contrary I will never revoke the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution I now make, or any part of it. So help me O my God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:106959:163"/>AND having thus solemnly <hi>resolved,</hi> it will be highly necessary that for the farther <hi>Ratification</hi> of it, we should yet more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly repeat it in the <hi>holy Sacrament</hi>; wherein, according to the Custom of <hi>Feasts</hi> upon <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> God and every faithful Communicant do <hi>mutually</hi> re-oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to one another, and upon the sacred Symbols of the Body and Blood of Jesus do <hi>ratifie</hi> to each other each others Part of that everlasting Covenant which by the Federal Rite of his meritorious Death and Sacrifice was inviolably <hi>sealed</hi> and <hi>confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> So that when we take those holy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into our hands, which the Priest in Gods stead presents and offers to us, we do in effect make this solemn Dedication of our selves to God; <hi>Here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our souls and bodies to be a reasonable, holy and lively Sacrifice unto thee; and here we call to witness this sacred Blood that redeemed us, and those vocal Wounds which do now inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for us, that from henceforth we oblige our selves never to start from thy service what Difficulties soever we may encounter in it, or what temptations soever we may have to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it.</hi> And having thus resolved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed our Resolution by the Body and Blood of our Saviour, and taken the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:106959:164"/>
upon it not to depart from what we have resolved, we have actually <hi>listed</hi> and <hi>ingaged</hi> our selves in a Warfare against Sin, the World and the Devil, upon the final <hi>Success</hi> whereof our everlasting Fate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is a vast <hi>Necessity</hi> of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this our Spiritual Warfare <hi>one time or other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That 'tis unspeakably most <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>advantagious</hi> for us to begin it <hi>now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the <hi>final Success</hi> of it doth very much depend upon the well <hi>Beginning</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That when once we have well <hi>begun</hi> it, the main <hi>Difficulty</hi> of it is conquered.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. CONSIDER the vast <hi>Necessity</hi> there is of beginning this Spiritual Warfare <hi>one time or other.</hi> For that which is necessary for us to accomplish <hi>at last,</hi> is necessary to be undertaken by us <hi>one time or other.</hi> Now it is as necessary for us to <hi>oppose</hi> and <hi>vanquish</hi> the Temptations of the World and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of our own Nature, as it is <hi>not to go</hi> to Hell, or <hi>not to miss</hi> of Heaven. For in this great Battel the everlasting Fate of our Souls is to be decided, and if we come
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:106959:165"/>
off <hi>Victors,</hi> we are <hi>made,</hi> if <hi>vanquished,</hi> we are <hi>undone</hi> to eternity. So that in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Warfare we do not contend like the Warriors of this World for a Triumphal Wreath that will <hi>wither</hi> upon our Brows, or for Fame and Renown which is nothing but the <hi>Breath</hi> of a company of <hi>talking Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or for the enlarging of our Empire over the next <hi>handful</hi> of a <hi>Turf</hi>; but we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with Enemies that are pursuing us to <hi>Hell,</hi> and binding us in Chains of <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Darkness.</hi> We are to fight for our <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> for all our hopes of Happiness and Well-being in a <hi>never-ending</hi> Life a; nd when so much depends upon the Success of our Conflict, and we must <hi>conquer</hi> and be <hi>crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or <hi>die; win</hi> the Field and Heaven or yield our selves <hi>captive</hi> to eternal Misery, I leave you to judge whether we are not obliged under the vastest <hi>Necessity</hi> one time or other to <hi>begin.</hi> And if we must begin <hi>one time or other,</hi> why not <hi>now</hi> as well as <hi>hereafter?</hi> and to what purpose should we <hi>defer</hi> entring upon that Work, which we all confess we must <hi>at last</hi> not only <hi>begin</hi> but <hi>accomplish</hi>? For to have <hi>accomplished</hi> a necessary Work, especially when it is <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult</hi> and <hi>important,</hi> is a great <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to the Mind; and whereas while it is yet to <hi>do,</hi> the prospect of the <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> of it
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:106959:165"/>
creates in us a great deal of <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Anxiety</hi>; when once it is <hi>done,</hi> or the main Difficulty of it is <hi>over,</hi> every Reflection on our past pains <hi>sweetens</hi> our present Repose, and <hi>crowns</hi> it with Joy and Triumph. And thus it is in our <hi>Entrance</hi> into the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> which we all confess to be both <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi>; and it being so, what do we else by our <hi>delaying</hi> it, but only <hi>prolong</hi> the pain and trouble of it? And whereas by one <hi>brave</hi> Attempt we might <hi>ease</hi> our selves and set our Souls at <hi>Rest</hi> for ever; we <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi> away our life in misery, and are <hi>sick</hi> with the Fear of our <hi>Remedy.</hi> Just like poor men that are under the torment of the <hi>Stone,</hi> they know they must be <hi>cut</hi> or <hi>die,</hi> but out of a frightful Apprehension of their Remedy they put it off <hi>from time to time</hi>; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise they will <hi>endure</hi> it rather than <hi>lose</hi> their Lives, but when they come to the Trial their Hearts fail, and they must needs have a little longer Respit; but <hi>all the while</hi> they endure not only the <hi>pain</hi> of their <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,</hi> but also the <hi>Apprehensions</hi> of their <hi>Cure,</hi> which <hi>at last</hi> they must also actually <hi>endure,</hi> or <hi>Death</hi> which is much more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to them. Whereas had they been cut <hi>at first,</hi> they might have saved themselves all that Torment and Fear of <hi>farther</hi> Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they endured in the time of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:106959:166"/>
their <hi>Delay.</hi> And just thus it is with those who <hi>defer</hi> their Repentance, which had they begun <hi>at first</hi> when they fell into their sinful Courses, their Hearts might have been at Ease a <hi>great while</hi> ago, and they might have saved themselves all those <hi>Gripes</hi> and <hi>Twinges</hi> of Conscience, and all those <hi>painful</hi> Apprehensions of the Smart and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of repenting <hi>at last,</hi> which they have been forced to endure in the several periods of their Delay. But alas, Repentance is a <hi>sad</hi> Remedy! Well, be it never so <hi>sad,</hi> you know you must endure it or that which is a thousand times <hi>worse.</hi> Why then you will endure it, that you are resolved upon, but fain you would have a little <hi>longer</hi> Respite. Ah foolish Souls! why will you <hi>prolong</hi> your Misery and <hi>linger</hi> out your Lives in Torment, when as by enduring <hi>now</hi> what you must endure <hi>at last,</hi> you might be presently at Ease, not only from the <hi>Pain</hi> of your <hi>past</hi> Guilt, but from the <hi>Fear</hi> of your <hi>future</hi> Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. CONSIDER that 'tis unspeakably most <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>advantagious</hi> for us to begin our Christian Warfare <hi>now.</hi> For <hi>this</hi> Life is the only time of our Trial and Probation, the Field in which our spiritual Warfare is to be fought, and from which we must all go off triumphing <hi>Conquerors</hi> or eternal
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:106959:166"/>
                     <hi>Slaves.</hi> And alas such a <hi>slippery</hi> and <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> thing is this our present Existence, that there is no one part of it we can call <hi>our own,</hi> but what is present. For all our <hi>Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is in Gods Hand and Disposal, and how he will <hi>shorten</hi> or <hi>prolong</hi> it we are not able to prognosticate. So that for ought we know the next moment may finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our everlasting Fate, and the Hopes of eternity which are now in our hands may slip through our fingers before to morrow morning, and leave us desperate for ever. What a dreadful Venture therefore do those men run, that <hi>delay</hi> from time to time the <hi>securing</hi> their Salvation by a timely Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? When 'tis <hi>now</hi> in their own Power, would they but lay hold on the <hi>present</hi> Opportunity, to secure their Victory and Crown, they rather chuse to go to <hi>cross or pile</hi> for them, and to stake them upon a Contingency that is not in their Power to dispose of.</p>
                  <p>BUT suppose they could secure that <hi>hereafter</hi> to themselves to which they do so venturously defer their Repentance, yet still there is another Venture of which they can <hi>never</hi> be secure, and that is, whether when that <hi>hereafter</hi> comes, God will not out of a just Resentment of their present Despite to, and Contempt of his Grace <hi>withdraw</hi> it from
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:106959:167"/>
them. Which if he should, they would be left in as great an incapacity of repenting as if he had withdrawn their <hi>Lives</hi> from them; it being as possible for us to repent without <hi>Life</hi> when we are <hi>dead,</hi> as without Gods <hi>Grace</hi> while we are <hi>living.</hi> So that promising that we will repent hereafter, we promise not only for <hi>our selves</hi> but for <hi>God</hi> too; we promise that <hi>he</hi> shall wait <hi>our</hi> lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and dance Attendance after us through all the tedious Stages of our Delays and Procrastinations; that he shall tamely put up all those Affronts and Provocations which between <hi>this</hi> and our <hi>hereafter</hi> we are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to offer him, and in the end be as much at our beck, and as ready to come in to our Assistance, when we shall think fit to call for him, as if we had never given him the least Offence or Provocation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For unless we can secure our selves of this, it will be every whit as uncertain whether we <hi>repent</hi> hereafter if we <hi>live,</hi> as whether we <hi>live</hi> to hereafter to <hi>repent.</hi> And what a madness is it for men that have now their Lives and Souls in their own hands, to stake and venture them upon two such contingent Issues, that are both of them so far out of their Power and Disposal?</p>
                  <p>BUT suppose there were no Hazard in either of these, that we were as secure both
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106959:167"/>
of our own <hi>Lives</hi> and Gods <hi>Grace</hi> as we are of the present Moment, yet we can never hope to begin our Christian Warfare so <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanaagiously</hi> as <hi>now.</hi> For all the time we are deferring it, our Enemies are gathering Strength and mustering up their Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us; our bad Inclinations are <hi>ripening</hi> and <hi>improving,</hi> and our evil Habits are growing more <hi>inveterate</hi>; and so many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Strength as <hi>these</hi> get, <hi>we</hi> lose; and so proportionably as their power to <hi>offend</hi> us increases, ours to <hi>defend</hi> our selves against them decreases. What a madness therefore is it for men who pretend to be resolved to ingage in the Christian Warfare, to <hi>defer</hi> it as they do from time to time, when they cannot but be sensible, if they take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of themselves, how much every further Delay <hi>improves</hi> their <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>impairs</hi> their <hi>Reason,</hi> how it <hi>fortifies</hi> their Enemy, and <hi>weakens</hi> themselves. You say you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of this Warfare, and <hi>resolved</hi> to undertake it <hi>one time or other,</hi> though <hi>as yet</hi> you cannot prevail with your selves to enter upon it. And why not yet? why for some reason or other forsooth you find your selves averse to it; and do you imagine that if you are averse to it <hi>to day,</hi> you will be less averse to it <hi>to morrow</hi> or <hi>next</hi> day? No, fond Men, do not abuse your
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:106959:168"/>
selves, for if you will not enter upon it <hi>now,</hi> be assured of this you will never find your selves either so <hi>willing</hi> to it, or so <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>able</hi> for it again as long as you live. For your Lusts will grow every day dearer and dearer to you, and so <hi>twine</hi> and <hi>wrap</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by degrees about your Hearts and Affections, that you will every day find your selves more and more unwilling to part with them; and at last they will <hi>cling</hi> so fast, that there will be no pulling them from ye without pulling away your Souls with them. Wherefore talk no more, I beseech you, of repenting <hi>hereafter,</hi> but resolve once for all that you will repent <hi>now or never.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. CONSIDER the <hi>final Success</hi> of this your spiritual Warfare doth very much depend upon your <hi>well beginning</hi> of it. By what hath been said you plainly see there is an absolute Necessity of beginning it <hi>one time or other,</hi> and that you can never begin it so <hi>securely</hi> and <hi>advantagiously</hi> as <hi>now</hi>; but unless you begin it <hi>well</hi> now, that is with a through Preparation of Heart, you were e'en as good sit still and not begin <hi>at all.</hi> For when once you come to the Trial, to encounter the Oppositions of a corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and contend with the Difficulties of a holy Life, you will then quickly find your
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:106959:168"/>
sappy Resolutions sink, and like so many rotten Banks yield and give way at every spring-tide of Temptation. But as the well laying the <hi>Foundations</hi> of a house secures the <hi>Superstructures</hi> against the violences of all future Storms and foul weather, so the first setling of your Resolution upon a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>stedfast</hi> Basis will be a mighty Safeguard to it against all ensuing Storms of Temptation. That well-grounded <hi>Faith</hi> and through <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration</hi> which induced us to it, will go along with it and guard it through the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Quarters with such invincible Reasons as no sinful Motive will be able to disprove or cope with. That hearty <hi>Shame</hi> and bitter <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Regret</hi> which we felt in the forming our Resolution will animate and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it more firm and inexorable against all the Solicitations of sin for the future. Those fervent and earnest <hi>Prayers</hi> which preceded and accompanied it, will not only ingage <hi>us</hi> to take the more <hi>care</hi> and <hi>regard</hi> of it, but ingage <hi>God</hi> also to contribute more <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi> to it in all its ensuing Conflicts and Encounters. And when in the framing of our Resolution we have taken effectual care before-hand not to resolve <hi>upon</hi> any thing but what we have considered the <hi>difficulty</hi> of, or <hi>against</hi> any thing but what we have felt the <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>smart</hi> of, or upon any
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:106959:169"/>
                     <hi>Reason,</hi> but what we have throughly <hi>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi> and do firmly <hi>believe,</hi> and together with all this have ingaged by our earnest <hi>Prayers</hi> the God of all Grace to aid and assist us, we may with some Assurance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise our selves a blessed <hi>Issue</hi> and Success. For now we are <hi>forewarned</hi> of, and <hi>fore-armed</hi> against all that can happen to us in our spiritual Warfare; now there is no Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty can arise in our way which we did not <hi>foresee</hi> and <hi>provide against</hi> when we first set forward to Heaven. So that if from henceforth we do but take an honest care to watch the Motions of our Enemy, and to keep up our own Hearts and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, we cannot miss of a glorious <hi>Victory,</hi> and after that an everlasting <hi>Triumph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT if we make a <hi>rash</hi> Beginning, and resolve <hi>precipitantly</hi> without observing the above-named Rules and Directions, in all probability our <hi>hasty</hi> Purposes will end in a <hi>leisurely</hi> Repentance. So that unless we intend to take a great deal of pains in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to no purpose, to weave a <hi>Penelope</hi>'s web, and <hi>do</hi> and <hi>undo</hi> as long as we live, and only to dance round in an eternal Circle of <hi>sinning</hi> and <hi>resolving against</hi> it, <hi>resolving</hi> and <hi>sinning</hi> again, without ever making a step <hi>forward</hi> but still <hi>wheeling about</hi> to the same Point; let us now at last resolve to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:106959:169"/>
                     <hi>begin</hi> in that <hi>prudent</hi> Method which God hath prescribed us.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. CONSIDER that when once we have <hi>begun</hi> it <hi>well,</hi> we have conquered the <hi>main</hi> Difficulty of this our spiritual Warfare. For though it be an easie matter to begin <hi>ill,</hi> to resolve against our sins in a <hi>sudden</hi> Pet, or <hi>transient</hi> Heat of Passion; yet it must be confessed that to resolve <hi>well</hi> and <hi>wisely,</hi> that is, with that firm <hi>Belief</hi> and through <hi>Consideration</hi> of things, with that <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> and those earnest <hi>Cries</hi> to Heaven for Aid and Assistance, which are necessary to the founding of a <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>lasting</hi> Resolution, is no so easie a matter. For in all those preparatory Exercises, we have a <hi>roving</hi> Mind, a <hi>hard</hi> Heart, and a <hi>perverse</hi> Nature to contend with; and we shall find it a very hard matter to call in our <hi>wandering</hi> Thoughts and unite them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>steady</hi> Consideration of the Evidences of the Truth of Religion, and of the Duties and Motives and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of it. And whilst we are entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with this <hi>unwonted</hi> Argument, there are a thousand Objects with which they are better <hi>acquainted</hi> that will be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them away; so that without a great deal of Violence to our selves we shall never be able to keep them <hi>together</hi> so long, as
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:106959:170"/>
is necessary to the forming a firm <hi>Assent</hi> to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the passing a true and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial <hi>Judgment</hi> upon the <hi>Proposals</hi> of Religion. And when we have fixt our Thoughts into a serious Consideration of the <hi>Evidences</hi> of Religion, we shall find that our <hi>Lusts</hi> will object much more against them than our <hi>Reason</hi>; that <hi>they</hi> will be casting <hi>mists</hi> before our Eyes and <hi>bribing</hi> and <hi>biassing</hi> our Understanding the other way, and that thereupon 'twill be more difficult than we are aware to convince our selves throughly of the truth of a Religion that is so diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically opposite to our vicious Inclinations. But when this is done and we proceed to consider the <hi>Duties</hi> of Religion, and to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Motives with the Difficulties of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order to the obtaining of our selves a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>free</hi> Consent to them; here again we shall find our selves at a mighty Plunge. For though the Motives to our Duty are at first View infinitely <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable</hi> than the Difficulties of it; though it be unspeakably more <hi>intolerable</hi> to lose the Joys of Heaven and incur the Pains of Hell than to endure the <hi>sharpest</hi> Brunts of this spiritual Warfare; yet <hi>these</hi> being <hi>present</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> have a more Immediate Access to us, and consequently are apter to move us than either of those Motives which are
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:106959:170"/>
both of them <hi>future</hi> and <hi>invisible.</hi> So that unless we do earnestly <hi>press</hi> and <hi>urge</hi> our selves with <hi>those</hi> Motives, and imprint them upon our minds in the most <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>real</hi> Characters, we shall find our selves over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled in despight of them by <hi>these</hi> present and sensible Difficulties that are before us. But when we have <hi>effectually</hi> convinced our selves that those Difficulties of our Duty are much less considerable than the Motives to them, we shall find it a hard Task to persuade our Wills into a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>explicit</hi> Consent to all the <hi>Particulars</hi> of it. For now we shall find a strong <hi>Aversation</hi> in our Natures to <hi>sundry</hi> of those Duties that call for our <hi>Approbation,</hi> and there will be a mighty Counterstriving between our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Inclinations.</hi> Our darling Lusts, those bosom Orators within us, will now employ all their Rhetorick to dissuade us from parting with them; they will <hi>clasp</hi> about our Souls, like <hi>departing</hi> Lovers, and use all their <hi>Charms</hi> and <hi>Allurements</hi> to hold us fast and reconcile themselves to us; and under these Circumstances, though we have all the reason in the world on our side, we shall find it will be no such easie matter effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to dispose our Wills to <hi>close</hi> with so many <hi>offensive</hi> Duties, and <hi>part</hi> with so many <hi>beloved</hi> Sins. But when <hi>this</hi> is done,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:106959:171"/>
which to be sure will cost us many a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Struggle</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> with our selves, there are <hi>other</hi> Difficulties to be mastered. For now we must <hi>reflect</hi> upon our past ill Life, and expose it to our own Eyes in all its natural <hi>Horror, Turpitude</hi> and <hi>Infamy,</hi> and never leave <hi>reproaching</hi> our selves with the <hi>Foulness</hi> and <hi>Disingenuity,</hi> the <hi>Madness</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of it, till we find our hearts affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> for and <hi>Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> against it. And for us that have been so long used to <hi>cokes</hi> and <hi>flatter</hi> our selves, to <hi>paint</hi> and <hi>varnish</hi> our Deformities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and crown our Brows with <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> Applauses; for <hi>us</hi> to <hi>condemn</hi> and <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid</hi> our selves, to strip our Actions of all their <hi>artificial</hi> Beauty, and set our selves before our own Eyes in all our <hi>naked, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disguised</hi> Ugliness, and not look off till we have lookt our selves into <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> of our selves, will be, at first especially, a very <hi>ungrateful</hi> Employment; and yet it may be a good while perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>unmalleable</hi> Hearts will yield to the impressions of <hi>godly Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Remorse.</hi> But when this Difficulty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, our Work is not yet <hi>totally</hi> finished. For now we must <hi>come off</hi> from our selves and all our <hi>presumptious</hi> Dependances upon our own Ability and Power, and in a deep
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:106959:171"/>
sense of our own most wretched <hi>Weakness</hi> and <hi>Impotency</hi> throw our selves wholly upon God, and with <hi>earnest</hi> and <hi>importunate</hi> Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries implore his gracious Aid and Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And let me tell ye, to men that have been all along inured to such <hi>glorious</hi> Conceits of themselves, such <hi>mighty</hi> Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences in their own Abilities; that have promised themselves from time to time that at <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi> a time they would repent and amend, as if without Gods Help 'twere in <hi>their</hi> Power to repent when they <hi>pleased</hi>; for such men as these, I say, to come out of themselves and their own <hi>self-confidences,</hi> and wholly cast themselves upon a foreign Help; so sensibly to <hi>feel,</hi> and ingenuously to <hi>own</hi> their own Inability, as to fly to God, and confess themselves <hi>lost</hi> and <hi>undone</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, is a much harder matter than we can well imagine till we come to make the Experiment. And yet this, all <hi>this,</hi> must be done bfore we can be well prepared to <hi>resolve</hi> upon the Christian Warfare.</p>
                  <p>THIS I have the longer insisted on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would deal <hi>plainly</hi> with you, and shew you the <hi>worst</hi> of things. For whether you are told of it or no, you will find it, if ever you make the Experiment, that all your good <hi>Resolutions</hi> without these <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> will soon unravel in the <hi>Execution</hi>;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:106959:172"/>
and that after you have resolved a thousand times over you will be just where you are, and not one step farther in Religion. But for your Encouragement, know that when with <hi>these</hi> necessary Preparations you have <hi>solemnized</hi> your Resolution, you have won the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>toughest</hi> Victory in all your spiritual Warfare; a Victory by which you have <hi>pulled down</hi> your Sin from its Throne, and <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>disarrayed</hi> its Power and Forces; so that now you are upon the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of a <hi>flying</hi> Enemy, and if you do but diligently <hi>follow</hi> your Blow, and <hi>pursue</hi> your brave Resolution through all Temptations to the contrary, and do not suffer your van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished Enemy to <hi>rally</hi> and <hi>reinforce</hi> himself against ye, you will sensibly perceive his Strength decay; and those Lusts which seemed at first <hi>invincible,</hi> will languish away by degrees from <hi>weak</hi> to <hi>weaker,</hi> till at last they expire into the Habits of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Virtues; and so proportionably those Virtues which through our vicious Aversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them seemed at first <hi>impossible,</hi> will grow on by degrees from <hi>possible</hi> to <hi>easie,</hi> and from <hi>easie</hi> to <hi>necessary</hi>; and then the <hi>Sins</hi> will be more impossible to us than the <hi>Virtues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW what a mighty Encouragement is this to make a <hi>good Beginning</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:106959:172"/>
Warfare, that in so doing we are sure to conquer the <hi>main</hi> Difficulty of it; that when we have broke through all those Oppositions that lie in the way to a wise and good Resolution, we are past the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi> of Religion, and having gotten over those steep <hi>Alps</hi> at its Entrance shall be sure to find the Region round about a plain and an easie <hi>Champain,</hi> in which the further we go, the <hi>smoother</hi> 'twill be, and so smoother and smoother till at last 'twill be all <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>delightful,</hi> like the flowry Walks of Paradise. Let us therefore be persuaded, without any farther Delay, to enter <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> upon this our holy Warfare, and by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Consideration,</hi> &amp;c. to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of a religious Resolution; that so when we are <hi>actually</hi> ingaged against our spiritual Enemies we may be able to <hi>stand our ground</hi> against all Temptations, and that having finally <hi>conquered</hi> and <hi>subdued</hi> them we may receive that Immortal Crown which God the righteous Judge hath laid up for the <hi>victorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND so I have done with the <hi>First</hi> Part of our <hi>Christian Warfare,</hi> viz. our <hi>Entrance</hi> into it.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. Concerning the <hi>Second</hi> Part of the <hi>Christian Warfare;</hi> with a particular Account of the Duties thereunto appertaining.</head>
                  <p>I SHALL now proceed to the <hi>Second</hi> Part of our <hi>Christian Warfare,</hi> viz. the <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of it, which consists in <hi>holy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> For when once we have reduced our Wills to a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>well-grounded</hi> Resolution of <hi>entring</hi> into this militant State, that which is next incumbent upon us is to <hi>pursue</hi> our Resolution in the future Course of our Lives and Actions, that is, to <hi>abstain</hi> from all Sin and endeavour to <hi>mortifie</hi> our Inclination to it, and to <hi>practise</hi> all the contrary Graces and Virtues, and endeavour to <hi>improve</hi> them to farther and farther degrees of perfection; or as the Scripture expresses it, to <hi>cease to do evil</hi> and to <hi>learn to do well</hi>; to <hi>strive</hi> against sin and to <hi>die</hi> to it, and to <hi>grow in grace</hi> and <hi>perfect holiness in the fear of God.</hi> In this consists the <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our <hi>Christian Warfare.</hi> In order whereunto it's indispensably necessary that we should still <hi>repeat</hi> the Practice of those Duties by which we were first <hi>prepared</hi> to enter into it; all those means by which our good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106959:173"/>
was <hi>produced,</hi> being naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to <hi>maintain</hi> and <hi>support</hi> it. And therefore we find that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. are not enjoined as <hi>temporary</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that are only to be practised in the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of our Warfare, but as means that will be <hi>always</hi> necessary for us throughout our whole <hi>Progress</hi> to Heaven. For so we are commanded not only to <hi>acquire</hi> a sincere Faith or Belief of the Gospel, but to <hi>continue</hi> and <hi>be stablished in it,</hi> Col. i.2, 3. compared with Cap. ii.7. And so again we are injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only to <hi>admit</hi> the proposals of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into our Consideration, but to <hi>keep them</hi> there, <hi>Luk.</hi> viii.15. and suffer them <hi>to dwell richly in us,</hi> Coll. iii.16. And so for all those other preparatory Duties. For that from a hearty Conviction of our need of Christ we should beg all Mercies of God in his <hi>Name</hi> and for his <hi>sake,</hi> is a standing Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Christian Devotion, <hi>John</hi> xvi.24. and so is also <hi>Confession</hi> of our sins to God, 1 <hi>John</hi> i.9. and <hi>Prayer</hi> for his Grace and Assistance, <hi>Coll.</hi> iv.2. Nor is it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that we should <hi>once</hi> repent or change our bad Resolution for a good one, but that we should also <hi>repeat</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> our good Resolution; that we should <hi>stablish our hearts,</hi> that is, keep our Wills <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>determined</hi> to all good Intentions and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:106959:174"/>
                     <hi>James</hi> v.8. and <hi>stand fast in the Lord,</hi> that is, adhere to the Profession and Practice of Christianity with a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, <hi>Phil.</hi> iv.1. For to <hi>proceed</hi> in our Christian Warfare, is <hi>constantly</hi> to live up to our good Resolution, which will require a continued Application of those means by which we were first <hi>prepared</hi> and <hi>disposed</hi> to enter into it. Thus Faith is no less ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to inable us to <hi>perform,</hi> than it was to prepare us to <hi>make</hi> our good Resolution; and still the more we <hi>believe</hi> our Religion, the more we shall think our selves concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its proposals, and consequently the more firmly we shall be resolved to <hi>close with</hi> and <hi>embrace</hi> them; and so still as our Faith <hi>improves</hi> in degrees of Certainty, our Resolution will proportionably <hi>grow</hi> strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and stronger. Again, if it were necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Birth</hi> of our Resolution that we should first duly <hi>weigh</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and the Difficulties of the Duties we were resolving on, then it will be no less necessary to the <hi>Growth</hi> and <hi>Emprovement</hi> of it that we should frequently consider over these Motives and Difficulties <hi>again,</hi> and ballance them one against another. And at first especially, while our good Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is yet in its <hi>Infancy,</hi> it will be very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that we should every day before we
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:106959:174"/>
go abroad into the World spend some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time in <hi>fore-thinking</hi> of the many Temptations that do lie in wait for us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our <hi>Business</hi> or <hi>Company</hi> or necessary <hi>Refreshments</hi> and <hi>Diversions</hi>; and <hi>fore-arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> our selves against them with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Arguments of our Religion; that so we may have our Weapons ready when ever they shall assault us, and be always provided to resist them. Again, if it were necessary to the <hi>forming</hi> our Resolution, that we should be <hi>convinced</hi> of the Necessity and Reality of our Saviours <hi>Mediation,</hi> then it will be no less necessary to the <hi>performance</hi> of it that our Hope and Fear which are the Springs of our Action should still be excited by the <hi>glorious</hi> Assurance of Mercy and <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid</hi> Prospect of Sin which this <hi>Conviction</hi> implies. Once more, was it necessary to the <hi>well making</hi> of our Resolution that we should affect our selves before-hand with a hearty <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> for our past Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, then will it be no less necessary for the <hi>strengthening</hi> and <hi>confirming</hi> it, that we should ever and anon <hi>revive</hi> this our Shame and Grief, by reflecting on the Filthiness of our <hi>past</hi> State, and the Weakness and Imperfection of our <hi>present,</hi> and by an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous <hi>Confession</hi> of both to the high and holy God; that so our <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> for
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:106959:175"/>
our Sins being digested into <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,</hi> may <hi>sharpen</hi> our Resolution and <hi>animate</hi> it more and more against them. In short, if it be necessary to the <hi>founding</hi> of our Resolution, that we should first ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly <hi>implore</hi> the divine Grace and Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, then it will be no less necessary for the <hi>continuance</hi> of it, that for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we should continually apply our selves to the Throne of Grace; that we should every Morning commit our selves to Gods Grace and Protection, and never presume to venture among the Snares of the World without him; that we should count it as unsafe for us to go out of our Chambers without being armed with Gods Aid, as 'tis to rush <hi>naked</hi> into a Battle amongst Swords and Spears: in a word, that we should every Morning and Evening <hi>at least,</hi> recommend our selves to God, and beseech him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us against all those <hi>Terrors</hi> and <hi>Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which either the <hi>Devil</hi> or our own <hi>Lusts</hi> shall propose to withdraw us from our good Resolution. And if upon all these preparatory Exercises of our <hi>Faith, Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> &amp;c. it was at first necessary for us to enter into a solemn <hi>Resolution,</hi> it will be no less necessary that with the same conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Preparations we should frequently <hi>ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> and <hi>renew</hi> it; especally <hi>at first,</hi> till the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:106959:175"/>
Strength of our bad Inclinations is in some measure <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>abated.</hi> Now we should take care to go every day out of our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>fresh</hi> armed, as men that expect an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy at the Threshold; and not to trust our <hi>weak</hi> Souls among the Temptations of the World till we have first <hi>chained</hi> up our Inclinations with <hi>new</hi> Vows of fidelity. So that you see the Duties of our <hi>Entrance</hi> into the Christian Warfare are not so <hi>peculiar</hi> to to that State, but that they are also to be practised in the <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>BUT then besides <hi>these,</hi> there are sundry <hi>others</hi> that are necessary to our successful <hi>Progress</hi> therein. All which I shall reduce to these following Heads,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we take care to arm our selves with <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> to undergo and encounter the <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Difficulty</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we <hi>propose</hi> to our selves the most excellent <hi>Examples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we apply our selves to our <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guides</hi> for Direction.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That we be very curious of our <hi>Aims</hi> and <hi>Intentions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. That we should possess our minds with a <hi>lively</hi> Sense and <hi>awful</hi> Apprehension of Gods <hi>Presence</hi> with, and <hi>Inspection</hi> over us.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:106959:176"/>6. That we frequently <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view</hi> our own Actions.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That we be very <hi>watchful</hi> and <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect</hi> in the <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Management</hi> of our selves.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That we should betake our selves to some <hi>honest Calling,</hi> and behave our selves <hi>diligently</hi> and <hi>industriously</hi> therein.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. That we should live in the constant use of the <hi>external Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of our Religion.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. TO the <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our Christian Warfare, it is necessary that we arm our selves with <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> to undergo and encounter the <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Difficulties</hi> of it. For so we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>be strong in the Lord,</hi> Ephes. vi.10. and <hi>to be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus,</hi> 2 Tim. ii.1. that is, to <hi>fortifie</hi> our selves with the Grace of God and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Religion against all those <hi>Hardships</hi> and <hi>Oppositions</hi> which may rise up against us in our March to Heaven; for we are assured before-hand that <hi>we have need of patience that after we have done the will of God we
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106959:176"/>
may receive the promise,</hi> Heb. x.36. and therefore we are bid to <hi>strengthen our selves with all patience and long suffering with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> Coll. i.11. and <hi>to run with patience the race that is set before us,</hi> Heb. xii.1.</p>
                  <p>FOR though it is certain that when we have well and wisely <hi>resolved,</hi> the <hi>greatest</hi> Difficulty of our spiritual Warfare is over, yet it cannot be dissembled that even when this is <hi>performed,</hi> and we proceed from hence to <hi>Execution,</hi> there will, <hi>at first</hi> especially, arise such Difficulties and Oppositions in our way as will sufficiently try our <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> And though if when we were forming our Resolution we considered the whole matter, we could not but <hi>foresee</hi> great Difficulties in the Execution of it, and be very sensible what strong Inclinations from <hi>within</hi> and Temptations from <hi>without</hi> we were to <hi>struggle</hi> and <hi>contend</hi> with; yet alas the Difficulties of all Undertakings are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally much less in our <hi>Foresight,</hi> than in our <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of them. For while they are in our Foresight we have only the <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Ideas</hi> of them to encounter, and these being not so stubborn as <hi>the things themselves</hi> are much more easily conquered by us. So that when instead of our own <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>compliant</hi> Notions we come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the Difficulties <hi>themselves,</hi> we
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:106959:177"/>
very often find the Face of things quite <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> and those Difficulties which did so easily <hi>submit</hi> to our <hi>Apprehensions,</hi> do many times make an obstinate <hi>Resistance</hi> to our <hi>Endeavours.</hi> And thus many times it is in the matter in hand. So that when we are <hi>fore-casting</hi> the Difficulties of Religion in our Minds, we must always allow for the <hi>Distance</hi> of them which usually <hi>lessens</hi> their Appearance, and conclude with our selves that when we are <hi>actually</hi> ingaged with them we shall <hi>find</hi> them much more <hi>stiff</hi> and <hi>incompliant</hi> to our <hi>Endeavours</hi> than they are now to our <hi>Thoughts</hi>; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>prepare</hi> and <hi>arm</hi> our selves against them. For when from <hi>considering</hi> we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to <hi>encounter</hi> them, we must expect to find that to <hi>discourse</hi> and <hi>execute</hi> are things of a widely different nature; and that those Difficulties which we so easily <hi>vanquished</hi> in our Thoughts and Discourses, will when we are actually <hi>contending</hi> with them put us to a much harder Trial of our <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Constancy</hi> than we were aware of.</p>
                  <p>FOR if we should have nothing but our own bad Inclinations and the ordinary Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of the World to struggle with, yet even <hi>these</hi> we shall find sufficient to exercise our utmost <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Constancy.</hi> For we must not expect that our bad Inclinations,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:106959:177"/>
especially after they have been <hi>pampered</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> by a long and frequent Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of <hi>forbidden</hi> Enjoyments, will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently <hi>subdued</hi> and <hi>mortified</hi> when there are so many Temptations all around us cotinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>exciting</hi> and <hi>provoking</hi> them. No, you may be assured they will <hi>struggle</hi> for their lives before they give up the Ghost, and if they are deeply radicated, will not be torn from their Roots without a great deal of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Labour.</hi> So that unless you have a <hi>great</hi> stock of Patience and Courage to <hi>endure</hi> and <hi>out-stand</hi> their tedious Resistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to your pious Endeavours, and to deny them those vicious satisfactions which they <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>live</hi> upon, till you have <hi>starved</hi> them out, you will quickly be <hi>weary</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with them, and rather chuse to yield them their <hi>Desires,</hi> than be plagued with their restless <hi>Importunities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT then besides these <hi>ordinary</hi> Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of denying your sinful Desires and Inclinations, it may be your Lot to <hi>take up the Cross</hi> too, and to follow your Saviour through a dark Lane of <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions</hi>; and then you will need a <hi>world</hi> of Patience and Courage to undergo all that <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Reproach, Loss</hi> and <hi>Pain, Fear</hi> and <hi>Suffering,</hi> through which you must fight your way to Heaven if ever you come
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:106959:178"/>
there. Since therefore this <hi>may</hi> happen to ye, and is not altogether <hi>unlikely,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns ye as ye hope for Heaven to <hi>fore-arm</hi> and <hi>prepare</hi> your selves against it. So that our Christian Warfare exposing us, as it doth, to so many <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>probable</hi> Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, it is not without reason that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle exhorts us to be <hi>stedfast and immova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as we know that our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. TO the <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our Christian Warfare it is necessary that we <hi>propose</hi> to our selves the most excellent <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</hi> For Experience tells us that good <hi>Example</hi> hath a stronger Influence upon men than good <hi>Precepts</hi> or <hi>Counsels</hi>; and the reason is plain, because he that only gives others good Advices or Instructions doth not give them that Security that he believes <hi>himself,</hi> as he that <hi>seconds</hi> his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel with his own Example. For they who are instructed do in a great measure depend upon the Judgment and Authority of their Teachers, and therefore must have a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable <hi>Security</hi> that their Teachers do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>themselves</hi> before they will be induced to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>comply</hi> with what they are taught; and such a Security is not to be fetcht so much from their <hi>Words</hi> as from
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:106959:178"/>
their Actions. But when by their Examples they <hi>transcribe</hi> their own Doctrines, it is visible they are <hi>in earnest,</hi> and that is a probable Argument to their Disciples that their Doctrine is <hi>true.</hi> So that good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple teaches with greater <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> than good Doctrine can do, because it more <hi>sensibly</hi> confirms what it teaches, and doth at the same time <hi>direct</hi> us <hi>what</hi> to do, and by a very popular Argument <hi>prove</hi> that we <hi>ought</hi> to do it. Besides when the matter which the Teacher advises or enjoins is <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>difficult,</hi> he ought for the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of those whom he teaches, to give them a full Assurance that 'tis <hi>practicable</hi>; which no Argument will so <hi>effectually</hi> do as his own Example. For when they see that he himself <hi>practises</hi> what he <hi>teaches,</hi> that is an <hi>ocular</hi> Demonstration to them that 'tis <hi>practicable.</hi> So that good Example carries in it this strong Encouragement to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that there is nothing in it but what is <hi>possible,</hi> and that the greatest Difficulties that attend it are such as may be <hi>conquered</hi> by Diligence and sincere Endeavour. And as it gives us the most <hi>sensible</hi> Direction and Encouragement to Virtue, so it also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents it to us to the greatest <hi>Advantage.</hi> For whereas Precepts and Discourses of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue are only the <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>artificial</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:106959:179"/>
of it, a virtuous Example is Virtue <hi>animated</hi> and exposed to our view in all its <hi>living</hi> Charms and Attractions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by how much Nature <hi>exceeds</hi> Art, and the most accomplished Beauties <hi>excel</hi> their Statues and Pictures, by so much is Virtue in Examples more <hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>attractive</hi> than in Precepts and Discourses. Since therefore in good Examples we see Virtue <hi>alive</hi> and <hi>in motion,</hi> exerting it self in the most <hi>comely</hi> Actions and <hi>graceful</hi> Gestures, this must much more effectually <hi>recommend</hi> and <hi>indear</hi> it to our Minds and Affections than the most <hi>pressing</hi> Discourses or <hi>lively</hi> Descriptions of it.</p>
                  <p>THIS therefore is one of those great means of holy living which the Gospel hath prescribed us, <hi>viz.</hi> that we should propose to our selves the best and most excellent Examples; that <hi>we should be followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises,</hi> Heb. vi.12. and that we should be <hi>followers</hi> of the Apostles and Leaders of the Flock of Christ, as <hi>they were of Christ himself,</hi> 1 Cor. xi.1. But because the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the <hi>best</hi> of Men have a great many imperfections in them, and are very often intermixt either with <hi>Excesses</hi> or <hi>Defects,</hi> and tainted with <hi>Superstition</hi> or <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> by reason whereof they frequently mislead
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:106959:179"/>
those that tread too close upon the heels of them; therefore we are more particularly directed to the Example of the great Master of our Religion; which though it consists of an <hi>unspotted</hi> Innocence and <hi>perfect</hi> Virtue, yet is every way <hi>accommodated</hi> to the State and Condition of humane Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. For he conversed among men with a <hi>modest</hi> Virtue, and such as was every way consistent with an <hi>ordinary</hi> Course of life. His Piety was <hi>even</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>unblameable,</hi> but such as fairly <hi>complied</hi> with <hi>civil</hi> Society and a <hi>secular</hi> Conversation. It affected not high <hi>Transports,</hi> and <hi>Raptures</hi> of Devotion, but was such as was both <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> for Mortals to imitate. His Virtue consisted not in <hi>prodigious</hi> Fastings, or <hi>sour</hi> and <hi>unpracticable</hi> Abstractions from Sense, but in a life of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and the like; that is, in such a life as is not only <hi>proper,</hi> but <hi>possible</hi> for us to transcribe. So that in his glorious Example he hath trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us an <hi>imitable</hi> Virtue; for he took care not to <hi>out-run</hi> the Capacities of Men in inimitable Expressions of Sanctity and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but so far as he could <hi>innocently, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi> with our Weakness, and <hi>kept pace</hi> with our Strength; that so he might entertain us all along with the Comforts of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:106959:180"/>
and the Influence of a perpetual <hi>Guide.</hi> And as that Rule of Faith which he hath propounded to us, is fitted to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, being very <hi>short, easie</hi> and <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible</hi>; so, as an excellent Writer of our own hath observed, that Copy of Manners which he hath set before us, is not only fitted with Excellencies <hi>worthy,</hi> but also with Compliances <hi>possible</hi> to be imitated by us.</p>
                  <p>AND as his Example is all <hi>imitable,</hi> so it is all throughout <hi>substantially</hi> good. For it consisted in a <hi>modest</hi> Piety, a <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>unaffected</hi> Goodness. His Devotions to God never affected the <hi>Stage,</hi> nor did they ever evaporate in <hi>enthusiastick</hi> Rants, or <hi>unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable</hi> Raptures of Passion, but were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>secret</hi> and <hi>serious, calm</hi> and <hi>manly,</hi> animated with a <hi>seraphick</hi> Fervour, and yet conducted with <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Sobriety.</hi> His Government of himself was <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> his Affections were always fixt to their proper <hi>Objects,</hi> and never exceeded the just <hi>Limits</hi> of Reason; and his <hi>Appetites</hi> were always moderated by his <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and never transgressed the bounds of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi> His Conversation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men was most <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>candid, free</hi> and <hi>ingenuous</hi>; neither <hi>vain</hi> nor <hi>morose, haughty</hi> nor <hi>sordid,</hi> but equally poised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all Extremes. He was <hi>just</hi> without
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:106959:180"/>
Partiality, <hi>humble</hi> without Affectation, <hi>charitable</hi> and <hi>beneficent</hi> without Noise or Respect of Persons. His Zeal was wise, <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate</hi> and <hi>substantial,</hi> such as did not spend it self in a furious <hi>Contention</hi> for, or <hi>Opposition</hi> to things of an indifferent Nature, but it qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly submitted to the Customs of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and of the Church in which he was born and educated; and all his Invectives were against <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Immorality,</hi> which were the only things to which his noble and generous Temper could never be reconciled. In a word, his whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>serious,</hi> and affected rather to be <hi>seen</hi> than to be <hi>heard,</hi> and to <hi>be</hi> than to be <hi>seen.</hi> His Heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was such as rendred him neither too <hi>sour</hi> nor too <hi>talkative</hi>; and his Patience was always equally distant from <hi>Stupidity</hi> and <hi>Effeminacy.</hi> For so when he endured that miserable Death of the Cross, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered like a Man that was <hi>sensible</hi> of Pain, and yet very well knew how to <hi>undergo</hi> it as <hi>became</hi> him. For as on the one hand he did not breath out his Soul like an <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi> Epicure, in <hi>whining</hi> Complaints and <hi>wretched</hi> Lamentations; so neither on the other hand did he give up the Ghost like a <hi>flanting</hi> Stoick in a <hi>huffing</hi> Contempt of death, or an <hi>affected</hi> Insensibility of Pain
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:106959:181"/>
and Misery. But from the beginning to the end he acted his Part in that bloody Tragedy, as one that was neither <hi>insensible</hi> of Torment, nor <hi>conquered</hi> by it. For the last words which he breathed, which were a hearty Prayer for his Murderers, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested his Soul to be <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>serene</hi> under all the Agonies of his Body. Thus is his great Example intirely composed of those excellent Virtues, that are the proper Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Ornaments of humane Nature. Now though there be some Actions of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Life which were never intended for our <hi>Imitation, viz.</hi> such wherein he either <hi>exercised</hi> or <hi>proved</hi> and <hi>asserted</hi> his divine Authority; yet whatsoever he did of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise <hi>Morality,</hi> and in pursuance to his own <hi>Laws,</hi> he <hi>designed</hi> and <hi>intended</hi> for our Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. So that in all such matters, as his <hi>Law</hi> is to be our <hi>Map</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> so his <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> is to be our <hi>Guide</hi> and <hi>President.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR this is the great End of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to which God hath <hi>predestinated</hi> us. namely, to be <hi>conformable to the Image of his Son,</hi> Rom. viii.29. and in this consists our <hi>putting on of the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> namely, in <hi>imitating</hi> his Manners, and <hi>following</hi> the Garb and Fashion of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; and accordingly our Saviour tells his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> xiii.15. <hi>I have given you
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:106959:181"/>
an example</hi> (that is of Humility and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) <hi>that you should do as I have done to you</hi>; and 'tis one of his great Commands that we should <hi>learn of him who was meek and lowly of heart,</hi> with a promise that in so doing, <hi>we should find rest unto our Souls.</hi> Mat. xi.29.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE if we would lead a holy Life, pursuant to our holy Resolution, we must set holy Examples before our eyes, and especially that most holy one of our blessed Saviour. We must <hi>peruse</hi> the History of his sacred Life, and diligently <hi>observe</hi> his Carriage and Demeanour in all those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and Circumstances wherein he was placed, and closely <hi>apply</hi> it all to our selves as a perfect Pattern of Action. <hi>Thus</hi> and <hi>thus</hi> did my Saviour, <hi>Sic ille manus sic ora— so</hi> he demeaned himself when he was in my Circumstances, after <hi>this manner</hi> he acted and <hi>thus</hi> he suffered; and can I follow a more <hi>glorious</hi> Example, nay would it not be a burning Shame for me <hi>not</hi> to <hi>imitate</hi> his <hi>Manners</hi> whilst I profess my self his <hi>Disciple?</hi> Think, O my Soul, what would he have now done, if he were in <hi>thy</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and had <hi>thy</hi> Temptations before him. Would he have <hi>pawned</hi> his Innocence for such a <hi>Trifle,</hi> or <hi>prostituted</hi> himself to such a <hi>base, infamous</hi> Action, to avoid such an <hi>inconsiderable</hi> Inconvenience? No, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:106959:182"/>
he <hi>would not</hi>; and art thou not ashamed to <hi>comply</hi> with such a Temptation, knowing with what Indignation thy Saviour would have <hi>rejected</hi> it? If we would but thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure our selves to <hi>reflect</hi> upon our Saviours Example, and <hi>apply</hi> it to and <hi>compare</hi> it with our own Actions, we cannot imagine with what a divine <hi>Emulation</hi> 'twould inspire us; how it would <hi>animate</hi> our Weaknesses, and <hi>shame</hi> our Irregularities, and <hi>inamour</hi> our Souls with true Virtue and Goodness.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. TO the <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our Christian Warfare it is also necessary that we should frequently apply our selves for <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi> to our <hi>spiritual Guides.</hi> For it is to be considered that men of a <hi>secular</hi> Life and Conversation are generally so engaged in the Business and Affairs of this World, that they very rarely acquire Skill enough in Religion to conduct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves safely to Heaven through all those Difficulties and Temptations that lie in their way. For before they can be capable to guide themselves safely, they must in all points of great moment be able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood,</hi> and to make a difference between <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> which in many Instances do border so <hi>near</hi> upon one another, that it requires much greater Skill and Knowledge than the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:106959:182"/>
of men are Masters of to discern the <hi>Point</hi> and <hi>Boundary</hi> that parts them. And supposing their <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> to be so well instructed as to be able to resolve them truly in all those doubtful Cases wherein they are or may be concerned, yet still there is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally such a fault in their <hi>Wills</hi> as renders them incompetent Judges for themselves; and that is, that through an Excess of <hi>Self-love</hi> they are prone to be <hi>partial</hi> in their own Concerns, and consequently, unless the Case be very <hi>plain,</hi> to vote that <hi>true</hi> that is most for their Interest, and <hi>determine</hi> on that side they are most inclined to. For when a mans Judgment is before in <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence,</hi> a very <hi>small</hi> weight of Interest on the <hi>wrong</hi> side of the Question usually turns the Scale against the <hi>greater</hi> probability on the <hi>right.</hi> And whilst Interest <hi>fees</hi> mens Affections, and their Affections <hi>bribe</hi> their Judgments, it will be almost impossible for them to secure their Innocence whilst they determine all Cases of Right and Wrong at the Tribunal of their own Reason. For when once they have determined <hi>falsly</hi> (as <hi>many times</hi> to be sure they will) besides the many single Miscarriages in <hi>Practice</hi> that will be consequent thereunto; by practising on upon their <hi>false</hi> Determinations, they will intangle themselves in such evil <hi>Customs</hi>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:106959:183"/>
and <hi>Habits,</hi> as by that time they have <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered</hi> the Error of their <hi>Judgment</hi> will render it very difficult for them to <hi>correct</hi> the error of their <hi>Practice.</hi> And therefore to secure our selves in our Innocence and Duty, it is mighty necessary that in all doubtful Cases we should appeal from <hi>our selves</hi> to the Judgment of <hi>others,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Interest to <hi>biass</hi> them one way or t'other, will be much more <hi>impartial,</hi> and therefore (if they have but <hi>equal</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) more <hi>competent</hi> Judges of our Case than our selves.</p>
                  <p>UPON both which accounts the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion hath wisely <hi>separated</hi> an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Men from the World to be the <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Conducts</hi> of Souls, to <hi>oversee</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> the secular Flock, who upon the above-mentioned accounts cannot be supposed to be in <hi>all</hi> Cases competent Guides of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For 'twas to this purpose that our Saviour before his Ascension commissioned his Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxviii.18, 19, 20. <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you: and lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</hi> And that he did
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:106959:183"/>
not intend this meerly for a <hi>temporary</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission which was to <hi>expire</hi> with the first <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Propagators</hi> of the Gospel, but designed to have it <hi>derived</hi> from their hands to all the <hi>succeeding</hi> Ages of Christianity, is evident not only from the Promise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, that <hi>he would be with them to the end of the world,</hi> which plainly shews that 'twas to continue in force till <hi>then</hi>; but also from hence, that they to whom this Commission was <hi>immediately</hi> given, did <hi>actually</hi> derive it to others, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i.6. with a strict Charge that <hi>these</hi> also should <hi>successively</hi> derive it to others, <hi>Tit.</hi> i.5.</p>
                  <p>AND as by this <hi>perpetual</hi> Commission Christ hath Established a Succession of men to be the <hi>Guides</hi> of Souls to the end of the World, so he hath obliged all Christian People to <hi>attend to</hi> and <hi>respect</hi> them as such. For <hi>he that heareth you,</hi> saith he, <hi>heareth me, and he that despiseth you despiseth me, and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me,</hi> Luk. x.16. and 1 Cor. iv.1. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle injoins all Christians <hi>to account of these spiritual Guides as of the Ministers of Christ, and stewards of the Mysteries of God</hi>; so also 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> v.12, 13. he earnestly <hi>beseeches them,</hi> as a matter of vast importance, <hi>that they would know them which labour among them, and are over them in the Lord, and were to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:106959:184"/>
admonish them, and esteem them very highly in love for their works sake</hi>; and <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii.17. he gives this Injunction, <hi>obey them which have the rule over you, and submit your selves; for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE being therefore an Order of men that are thus <hi>sanctified</hi> and <hi>set apart</hi> from the World, by the Commission of our Saviour, to <hi>consult</hi> the various Necessities of Souls, and <hi>administer</hi> to them in all their religious Concerns; it would doubtless mightily contribute to their successful <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress</hi> in the Christian Warfare, if in all their <hi>streights</hi> and <hi>difficulties</hi> men would <hi>apply</hi> themselves to them for Counsel and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with such Modesty and Sincerity as they ought to do. For besides that they might reasonably expect a greater <hi>Blessing</hi> upon <hi>their</hi> Counsels than <hi>other</hi> mens, they being <hi>commissioned</hi> Guides under the great Shepherd of Souls, who, we must needs suppose, will more especially <hi>cooperate</hi> with the Means of his own Ordination, besides this I say, they being persons that are wholly <hi>devoted</hi> to the Study and Ministries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, must needs be supposed <hi>caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> to have a farther <hi>Insight</hi> into the Cases
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:106959:184"/>
of Souls, into their <hi>Dangers</hi> and <hi>Refuges, Diseases</hi> and <hi>Remedies,</hi> and consequently to be better able to <hi>counsel</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> them than men of a <hi>secular</hi> Life and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If therefore men would be but so kind to themselves, as to apply themselves in all their spiritual Exigencies to a <hi>holy, wise</hi> and <hi>well-instructed</hi> Guide; to <hi>uncover</hi> their Sores, <hi>lay open</hi> their Cases, and <hi>reveal</hi> the Secrets of their Souls to him, so far as is necessary to enable him to make proper Applications; it is not to be expressed what a <hi>vast</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they might make of him. He would be instead of a <hi>good Genius</hi> or <hi>Tutelar Angel</hi> to their Souls, to suggest many a good <hi>Thought</hi> to them, and feed their Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with many an useful <hi>Notion</hi>; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to <hi>extract</hi> from the Articles of their Belief their just and proper Inferences, and <hi>reduce</hi> them to practical Principles; to <hi>rectifie</hi> their Wanderings, and <hi>extricate</hi> them from their Doubts; to <hi>comfort</hi> them in their Sorrows, and <hi>quicken</hi> them in their Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; to <hi>warm</hi> their Indifferencies, and <hi>moderate</hi> their Zeal, so as that they may neither be <hi>becalmed</hi> by the one, nor <hi>over-born</hi> by the too violent Gusts of the other; and in a word, to <hi>direct</hi> them to the proper Methods of <hi>mortifying</hi> their bad Inclinations and <hi>conducting</hi> their Religion so, as to render
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:106959:185"/>
it more <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> to them. These and a great many other good Offices a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>well-experienced</hi> Guide would be able to do men, if they would but take him along with them in their <hi>Journey</hi> to Heaven, and <hi>modestly</hi> submit themselves to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Direction. And in thus doing they would act not only with greater <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> to their Innocence, but with greater <hi>satisfaction</hi> to their Consciences; because then their Actions would be warranted not only by their own <hi>private</hi> Sentiments, which in many Cases they will have just cause to suspect, but also by the <hi>better</hi> and more <hi>impartial</hi> Judgment of an <hi>authorised</hi> Guide. For if under <hi>his</hi> Conduct they should happen in any doubtful Instance to <hi>err</hi> from the way of Truth or Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they will have this Satisfaction, that they have used the <hi>best</hi> Means to <hi>prevent</hi> it, the Means to which God himself hath <hi>remitted</hi> them, to whom alone they are accountable for their Actions, and who, as they may well imagine, will very much <hi>compassionate</hi> such Miscarriages as may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon their Submission to his own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. But if notwithstanding the great Care that he hath taken of their Souls, in appointing them <hi>Pilots</hi> to steer them safely to Heaven, they will <hi>embark</hi> without
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:106959:185"/>
them, and presume so far upon their own Skill as to venture to their eternal <hi>Port</hi> through all those <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Quicksands</hi> that lie in their way; they must needs be in great Danger of miscarrying, which if they do; they may thank <hi>themselves</hi> for it and can expect no <hi>Pity</hi> from God, whose care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful provision for their eternal Safety they have so ungratefully <hi>contemned</hi> and <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. TO our prosperous <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress</hi> in the Christian Warfare it is also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that, as often as we can, we should actually <hi>intend</hi> and <hi>aim</hi> at God in the Course of our Lives and Actions. For it is of mighty Advantage to the Conduct of a mans Life to have his <hi>Intentions</hi> united, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to act with one steady <hi>Drift</hi> and <hi>Aim.</hi> Because while he intends but <hi>one</hi> thing, he unites the whole <hi>Vigour</hi> of his Nature in the pursuit of it, and is continually driving at it with all the <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> of his Faculties. 'Tis an <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, <hi>From the man of one Business good Lord deliver me</hi>; because minding <hi>that</hi> only, he must needs be supposed to be the more <hi>expert</hi> and <hi>saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> in it, and consequently the more able to <hi>exceed</hi> and <hi>over-reach</hi> another man who hath only minded it by the <hi>by</hi>; but when a man acts with a multifarious Intention,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:106959:186"/>
he must needs be <hi>distracted</hi> in his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the force of his Faculties being <hi>divided</hi> by the multiplicity of his Aims must needs be so <hi>weakned</hi> that 'twill be impossible for him to pursue any one of them with <hi>Vigour</hi> and <hi>Activity.</hi> 'Tis one of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Maxims, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a man ought to be one,</hi> i. e. so far as he is able, to fix all his Aims upon one <hi>End</hi> and unite them in one <hi>Center,</hi> and not to suffer himself to be tossed hither and thither by <hi>independent</hi> Designs and Intentions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this will unavoidably <hi>distract</hi> him in his prosecutions, and so <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>weaken</hi> his Principles of Action that he will be able to do nothing to any Purpose. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being the great Object of Religion, it is necessary in order to our progress therein, that we should, as much as in us lies, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> and <hi>aim</hi> at him in the whole Course of our Actions; that we should continually <hi>look up</hi> to him as to the directing Star by which we are to <hi>steer</hi> our Motions and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> our whole Lives under a fixt Intention to <hi>obey</hi> his Will, and <hi>imitate</hi> his Nature.</p>
                  <p>AND indeed unless we do this, we are not good Men in the Sense and Judgment of Religion. For Religion, as such, is a Rule of divine <hi>Worship</hi>; and under this Notion the Christian Religion in particular enjoins
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:106959:186"/>
all its Duties, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Homage</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> to God. For it requires us to <hi>do all as unto God,</hi> Col. iii.23. and <hi>to do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. x.31. that is, to do all in <hi>Obedience</hi> to him, and <hi>Imitation</hi> of him, from a sincere Acknowledgment of the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his Nature, of his sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over us, and immutable Right to rule and command us. Not that an <hi>actual, explicite</hi> Intention of <hi>obeying</hi> or <hi>imitating</hi> God is necessary to every good Action; for our Occasions of doing good, being so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> and so <hi>often</hi> occurring in our secular Affairs, and our Minds being so incapable as they are of attending <hi>many</hi> things <hi>at once</hi>; it is impossible for us actually to intend Obedience to God in <hi>every</hi> good thing we perform; but that in the <hi>general</hi> we should heartily intend it is indispensibly necessary to the consecrating our best Actions, and adopting them into the Family of Religion. For that we must obey God, is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law of Religion, from whence all the particular Commands and Prohibitions of it do receive their Force and Obligation. So that unless we do what he commands with a <hi>general Intention</hi> of Mind to obey him, we do not act upon a religious Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and consequently though our Actions should be <hi>materially</hi> good, yet are they not <hi>formally</hi> religious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:106959:187"/>NOW to the fixing and setling such a <hi>general Intention</hi> in our Minds, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that in the particular Exercises of our Religion we should; so far as we are able, <hi>actually intend</hi> and <hi>aim</hi> at God; that we should throw by all other Ends, so far as we are able, and refer our Actions <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> to him; in a word, that we should <hi>formally devote</hi> and <hi>dedicate</hi> them to his blessed Will and Pleasure, so as to be able to say, <hi>this</hi> and <hi>this</hi> I do <hi>purely</hi> to please God, with a <hi>single Intention</hi> of Soul to <hi>resemble</hi> and please him, to transcribe his Nature and comply with his Will. For which end we must take care as oft as we can to perform our religious Actions in such a manner, as that no <hi>secular</hi> Ends may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose between God and our Intentions; to be as <hi>private</hi> and as <hi>modest</hi> as we can in our Religion, and not expose it any more than needs must to the eye of the World, lest <hi>Applause</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> should intrude themselves upon us, and carry away our <hi>Intention</hi> from God. For thus our Saviour advises in the Case of Charity and Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> vi.1, 7. that <hi>we should not do our alms before men, to be seen of them,</hi> nor <hi>sound a trumpet before them,</hi> to make the Streets ring of our Charity; nay, if possible, <hi>that we should not let our left hand know what our
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:106959:187"/>
right hand doth</hi>; but that our Alms should be <hi>secret,</hi> and known only to God and our selves; and that when we <hi>pray,</hi> we should not affect to make a pompous shew of it, <hi>in the Synagogues and corners of the streets,</hi> but <hi>that we should enter into our closets and shut our door</hi> and in the most <hi>private</hi> manner unbosom our Souls to God; the sense of all which is that should we endeavour, so far as in us lies, so to <hi>circumstantiate</hi> our Charity and Devotion as not to give any Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to secular Ends and Aims to obtrude themselves upon us, to <hi>mingle</hi> with our pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Intentions</hi> and <hi>deflower</hi> the Purity of them.</p>
                  <p>NOT that I think it <hi>unlawful</hi> for a man to intend any thing but God in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Duty, or that our Intention is <hi>bad</hi> when it immediately respects any <hi>worldly</hi> End, such as Pleasure or Profit or Honour, which are proposed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as Arguments to persuade men to their Duty; and what hurt can it be for men to <hi>aim</hi> at that in the discharge of their Duty, which God hath proposed to them as an <hi>Encouragement</hi> to it? 'Tis true if worldly Advantage be the <hi>only</hi> or <hi>chief</hi> End we aim at, our <hi>Intention</hi> is naught, and so are all the <hi>Actions</hi> thence proceeding; but if toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that we do so heartily <hi>intend</hi> and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:106959:188"/>
                     <hi>aim</hi> to please God and conform our selves to his blessed Will and Nature, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue on in the path of our Duty to him not only when we have no prospect of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Advantage to induce us to it, but when outward Evils and Inconveniences lie in our way, we need not doubt but our Intention is truly <hi>good</hi> and <hi>sincere,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing those immediate Respects which it many times hath to <hi>secular</hi> Ends and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements. But yet it is certain that the <hi>more</hi> it respects these, the more <hi>imperfect</hi> it is, and the more liable to be vanquished by outward Temptations. For it's a plain sign that 'tis conscious of its own Weakness, when it dares not stand alone, but is fain to call in to it the Assistance of these worldly Ends to support and defend it; and the less of worldly Aim there is in our religious Intention, to be sure the more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>simple</hi> it is, and the more of <hi>substantial</hi> Piety there is in it; and though it may be truly sincere notwithstanding its being <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded</hi> with secular Aims and Respects, yet the more of these there is in it, the <hi>weaker</hi> and more <hi>instable</hi> it must necessarily be. For, our Mind being <hi>finite,</hi> cannot possibly intend <hi>many</hi> things with <hi>equal</hi> Strength and Vigour, as it can do <hi>one</hi>; and when its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is <hi>dispersed</hi> among various Objects
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:106959:188"/>
it must necessarily be more <hi>languid</hi> than when 'tis <hi>collected, united</hi> and <hi>fixt</hi> upon one; and consequently the <hi>more</hi> a mans Intention respects the World, the <hi>less</hi> in proportion it must respect God, and so on the contrary. And then the less a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects <hi>God</hi> in his Duty, and the more he respects the <hi>World,</hi> the more liable he will be to the Temptations of worldly Loss or Advantage. For when those Advantages which he so much respects lie on the <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site</hi> side to his Duty, to be sure he will be so much the more <hi>inclined</hi> to desert it; and as often as Fortune shifts sides, and carries with it the Advantages of Pleasure, Profit or Honour, from <hi>Virtue</hi> to <hi>Vice,</hi> or from <hi>Vice</hi> to <hi>Virtue,</hi> he will still be ready to <hi>face about</hi> with it, and be always <hi>veering</hi> like a Weathercock to a contrary Point up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Change of Wind. Whereas when a mans Intention <hi>purely</hi> respects God, 'twill be <hi>immovably</hi> fixt among all the Changes and Alterations from without. For there is no outward Change or <hi>Capricio</hi> of Fortune can hinder a man from pleasing God, whose Love to us depends not upon our being <hi>poor</hi> or <hi>rich, pleased</hi> or <hi>pained, depressed</hi> or <hi>advanced,</hi> but upon our being truly <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>religious.</hi> And therefore if our Aim be <hi>purely</hi> to please him, we shall be sure
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:106959:189"/>
to continue so, which side soever Fortune smiles upon.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE to our successful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in Religion it is highly necessary that, so far as in us lies, we should <hi>abstract</hi> and <hi>separate</hi> our religious Intentions from all these <hi>worldly</hi> respects; and this must be done by looking frequently up to God, and actually <hi>referring</hi> and <hi>dedicating</hi> our Actions to him; by shutting our eyes, when we are entring upon any Duty, to all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Considerations, and determining with our selves, <hi>this</hi> I will do purely because 'tis <hi>Godlike,</hi> or because God hath <hi>commanded</hi> it; whether I shall be <hi>commended</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced</hi> for it, whether I shall <hi>get</hi> or <hi>lose</hi> by it I will not now regard, it is sufficient that it is <hi>good,</hi> and that God hath commanded it, and therefore for this Reason <hi>only</hi> I will do it, without any <hi>other</hi> Respect or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. By which means we shall by degrees so <hi>purifie</hi> our Intentions, and <hi>refine</hi> them from worldly Aims, that we shall be able to act <hi>vigorously</hi> in Religion without any other Respect but that of <hi>pleasing</hi> God, and <hi>conforming</hi> our selves to his Will and Nature. And when once we can do thus, we are in a great forwardness in Religion. For now the Will of <hi>God</hi> hath got such an Ascendant over <hi>ours,</hi> that as we can cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:106959:189"/>
obey him without <hi>external</hi> Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so we can freely contemn all Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>to the contrary</hi>; and it being our <hi>great</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> Aim to <hi>please</hi> and be <hi>like</hi> him, the things that are <hi>without</hi> us will have very little Power to move us one way or 'tother. Because now our great Aim is <hi>above</hi> them, and our eyes are so stedfastly <hi>fixt</hi> upon God, that we are not at leisure to <hi>regard</hi> them. And our Mind being thus <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed</hi> to listen to the restless Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>external</hi> Goods and Evils, our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is safe, and we may pass triumphantly through all their Temptations.

For whilst in our religious Intentions we do <hi>too much</hi> respect the things that are without us, we do in a great measure <hi>intrust</hi> them with our Virtue and Religion; and so far as we make them Inducements to our Duty, so far it is in their Power to <hi>secure</hi> or <hi>betray</hi> it. As for Instance, so much as I aim at <hi>Profit</hi> in any <hi>religious</hi> Action, so much <hi>Power</hi> Profit hath over my Religion; and if the same Profit should invite me to a <hi>wicked</hi> Action, it will have as much Power to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi> my Religion, as it had to <hi>secure</hi> it; for the same Gain will have the same Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on me when it tempts me to <hi>sin,</hi> as it hath when it tempts me to <hi>obey.</hi> What a dangerous thing therefore is it for men to intrust such a treasure as their Innocence and Religion in such <hi>irresponsible</hi> hands, and to give those outward things which are the Temptations of <hi>Vice,</hi> a power to dispose of their <hi>Virtue?</hi> What is this but to commit the keeping of our <hi>Sheep</hi> to a <hi>Wolf,</hi> or of our <hi>Chastity</hi> to a <hi>Goat?</hi> Wherefore as we would be safe in our religious <hi>Progress,</hi> it highly concerns us to <hi>purifie</hi> our good Intentions so far as we are able from all <hi>worldly</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, and to level them <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> at God. And in order hereunto,</p>

                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:106959:190"/>V. To render the <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our Christian Warfare successful, it is also necessary that we possess our Minds, with an awful Apprehension of Gods <hi>Presence</hi> with, and <hi>Inspection</hi> over us. Among the many excellent Rules, which the Heathen Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists have given for the Conduct of mens Lives, this is one, that in the whole Course of their Lives they should imagin some <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent person,</hi> for whom they have a great <hi>Veneration,</hi> to be <hi>present</hi> with 'um, as a <hi>Witness</hi> and <hi>Spectator</hi> of all their Actions. And it was wholesome Advice that one gave his <hi>lewd</hi> Friend, that he should hang the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of his <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> Father in the Room where he was wont to celebrate his <hi>Debauches</hi>; imagining that the <hi>severe</hi> eye of the good old Man, though but in <hi>Effigie,</hi> would give a mighty check to the <hi>wanton</hi> Sallies of the intemperate Youth. And if the bare <hi>Fiction</hi> of a Mans being <hi>present</hi> with us, or his being present only in a <hi>dead</hi> Picture, may be rationally supposed to have so strong an Influence on our Actions; of how much greater Force must our firm <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi> of Gods Presence with us be to regulate our Lives and Actions? And that he is thus <hi>present</hi> with us we have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reason to conclude, not only from the infinite <hi>Plenitude</hi> of his Essence, which being

                     <hi>Self-existent</hi> could not be <hi>bounded</hi> or <hi>limited</hi> by any Cause from without, and therefore must necessarily be <hi>boundless</hi> and <hi>immense</hi>; but also from express Assertions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which assures us <hi>that his eyes are in every place beholding the evil and the good,</hi> Prov. xv.3. <hi>That he is a God at hand and not a God afar off; and that no man can hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in secret places that he shall not see him; and that he fills heaven and earth,</hi> Jer. xxiii.23, 24. and that we can go no whither <hi>from his presence,</hi> Psal. cxxxix.7, 8. and that <hi>all things are naked and open to his eyes,</hi> Heb. iv.13. that is, that the World is <hi>surrounded</hi> and <hi>filled</hi> with his Being, which is both the <hi>Womb</hi> that <hi>contains,</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> that <hi>pervades</hi> the Creation; and that being thus <hi>present</hi> with us wherever we are, he must needs be supposed to have a constant <hi>Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> over us, and a clear <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of whatsoever we do.</p>
                  <p>AND he being thus present with us in <hi>Reality</hi> and not in <hi>Fiction</hi> or <hi>Picture,</hi> it must doubtless be of mighty avail to the Well-government of our Lives; to be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inspired with an <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Sense of it. And therefore our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to do good from a lively Sense that Gods eye is upon us, <hi>Matt.</hi> vi.4.6. <hi>That our father who sees us in secret shall
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:106959:191"/>
reward us openly.</hi> And this I conceive to be the meaning of that comprehensive Precept which God gave to <hi>Abraham, Walk before me and be thou perfect,</hi> Gen. xvii.1. <hi>i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have thy self as one that art sensible thou art always in my Presence, and under my eye, and in the sense of this see thou beest <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> and <hi>sincere,</hi> and that thou dost not vainly attempt to impose upon me by any demure <hi>Shews</hi> or hypocritical <hi>Pretences.</hi> And the same is implied in that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Col.</hi> iii.22, <hi>Servants obey in all things your Masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God,</hi> i. e. be not like those Servants that do their Duty for no other end but to ingratiate themselves with their Masters, and accordingly do it no longer than while their Masters eye is upon them; but do you it with all <hi>Sincerity,</hi> out of an awful respect to God, considering that when mans eye is <hi>off,</hi> his eye is <hi>upon</hi> you. The sense of all which is, that after the example of holy <hi>David,</hi> Psal. xvi.8. we should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <hi>to set the Lord always before us,</hi> and to possess our minds with a quick and lively Sense of his being continually <hi>present</hi> with us, wheresoever we are, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are about, and a constant <hi>Witness</hi> and <hi>Spectator</hi> of all our Actions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:106959:192"/>AND this we shall find will be of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Use to us in the whole <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our Christian Warfare. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will mightily restrain us from all sinful Actions. For as St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes, the greatest part of Sin is taken away if a man hath but a <hi>Witness</hi> of his Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and much more if he be sensible that he hath such a Witness as God, with whom he is infinitely more concerned than with all the World besides; who is the <hi>Judg</hi> of all his Actions, the <hi>Rewarder</hi> of Vertue, and <hi>Punisher</hi> of Vice, the eternal Source of all those <hi>Evils</hi> or <hi>Goods</hi> that he can <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>hope for.</hi> And who but a man that is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wicked, dares do an evil Action in the <hi>Presence</hi> and <hi>Sight</hi> of such a formidable Witness? For suppose you beheld this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Being sitting upon a Cloud in some visible Form, with a Thunder-bolt in his hand; and from thence looking down upon you, <hi>curiously</hi> observing how you demean your selves, and <hi>closely</hi> pursuing you with his awful eye through all your dark <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats</hi> and <hi>Privacies</hi>; would not the thought of any Action that is displeasing to him be ready to strike you into <hi>Trembling</hi> and <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror?</hi> Could you imagin your selves to be any where secure in your Wickedness while you saw your selves uncovered to his All-seeing
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:106959:192"/>
Eyes, to which your Closets lie as open as your Halls, and your Hearts as the High-ways? Doubtless you could not. Why now the lively <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of a thing, is equivalent to a <hi>sensible</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. If I were <hi>throughly assur'd</hi> that the King were listening behind the Curtain, and heard every word that is spoken in the Room, I should doubtless be as much afraid of talking Treason against him, though I saw him <hi>not,</hi> as if he stood just <hi>before</hi> me. And so though God be with me in an <hi>invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> manner, and I am not able to see him through that thick Curtain of Matter which is drawn between me and his Spiritual Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, yet if I <hi>firmly believe</hi> that he is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind</hi> it, and am constantly aware that he is <hi>listening</hi> to what I <hi>say,</hi> and <hi>prying</hi> into what I <hi>do,</hi> that he keeps <hi>Intelligence</hi> with my <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and is intimately <hi>acquainted</hi> with all my <hi>Designs</hi> and <hi>Intentions,</hi> it will render me as cautious of my Thoughts and Words and Actions, as if I saw him standing by me in a <hi>visible Shechinah</hi> or <hi>Glory,</hi> to <hi>record</hi> every Passage of my Life, and <hi>enter</hi> into his Debt-books every <hi>Item</hi> of my Guilt against the great Day of Accounts. But how much the want of such a due Apprehension of Gods <hi>Presence</hi> with us, lets men loose to all Wickedness, may be collected from that of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:106959:193"/>
the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> ix.9, <hi>The iniquity of the house of Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness,</hi> and how comes this to pass? Why, <hi>they say, the Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not</hi>; whereas, on the contrary, <hi>David</hi> attributes his <hi>keeping Gods precepts and testimonies,</hi> to the lively Sense he had that his ways were always <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> God, <hi>i. e.</hi> lay open to his <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection,</hi> Psal. cxix.168. But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such a lively Sense of Gods <hi>Presence</hi> with, and <hi>Inspection</hi> over us, will be of mighty Use to keep us <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> in the whole Course of our Actions. For alass to what purpose should we <hi>dissemble</hi> and <hi>conceal</hi> our Wickedness from the eye of the World, so long as we <hi>lye open</hi> to the eye of God? Would you not think it very strange to see a Company of Prisoners that within a few Hours are to be tryed for their Lives, solicitously concerning themselves how to appear lovely and innocent <hi>to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi> hiding their Deformities, and disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing their Crimes with <hi>artificial</hi> Pretexts and Apologies, that so they may <hi>cheat</hi> and <hi>juggle</hi> one another into a mutual good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of themselves; but in the mean time take no notice of their <hi>Judg,</hi> who sits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them upon the Bench, observing all their
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:106959:193"/>
                     <hi>Tricks</hi> and <hi>Impostures,</hi> and holds their Lives in his Hands, being commissionated to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> them according as he finds them <hi>innocent</hi> or <hi>guilty.</hi> And yet just thus do those men act whose Religion is nothing but a vain Ostentation and Ambition of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applause; they <hi>skrew</hi> their Looks, <hi>study</hi> their Actions, <hi>force</hi> their Inclinations, and all to compose themselves into an outward <hi>Semblance</hi> of Religion; they imploy a world of Care and Art to <hi>disguise</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and with the Colours of Sanctity to <hi>varnish</hi> their unhallowed Natures; they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly <hi>deny</hi> themselves their dearest Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and in the view of the world are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times forced to act against the <hi>grain</hi> of their strongest Inclinations; and all this to <hi>mask</hi> their depraved Tempers, that they may <hi>appear</hi> what they <hi>are not,</hi> in the view of the world, and juggle themselves into a <hi>Saintly</hi> Reputation: but whilst they are thus industriously <hi>courting</hi> the good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Fellow-prisoners, their All-seeing <hi>Judg</hi> upon whose final Sentence their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Fate depends, is <hi>present</hi> with them; and, though they take no more notice of him than if he were a <hi>cypher</hi> in the World, is perfectly <hi>conscious</hi> to all their Artifice, and <hi>sees through</hi> all their hypocritical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guizes, and will ere long <hi>unmask</hi> and <hi>expose</hi>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:106959:194"/>
them to the View and Scorn of all the World. And this considered, what a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Folly is <hi>Hyprocrisie,</hi> that <hi>hides</hi> us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from those that have <hi>little</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> to do with us, but leaves us <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>naked</hi> to his eye with whom we are most <hi>concerned.</hi> Alas! what a poor project is it to take so much pains, as we do, to recommend our selves to men, to men that must stand at the <hi>same</hi> Tribunal, and undergo the <hi>same</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with our selves? For what will their <hi>good</hi> Opinion avail us, if the Judg <hi>disaprove</hi> us, in whose hands our Lives and Souls are? If he think <hi>well</hi> of us, we are safe though all the World should <hi>condemn</hi> us; but if he condemn us, though every Creature should <hi>acquit,</hi> they cannot <hi>rescue</hi> us from his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. But alas! how <hi>differently</hi> soever God and Men may think of us <hi>now,</hi> yet when he comes to discover his Thoughts of us, in his publick Judgment and Sentence, all the World will be of <hi>his</hi> Mind; and if we <hi>stand right</hi> in his Opinion, we shall be <hi>applauded</hi> by the whole Universe, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we may be vilified now; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if he <hi>condemn</hi> us, we shall be sure to be <hi>hissed</hi> at throughout all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Spirits, how <hi>gloriously</hi> soever we may be thought of at present. And by how much the better we are esteemed of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:106959:194"/>
                     <hi>now,</hi> by so much the more we shall be hissed at <hi>then,</hi> when the <hi>Cheat</hi> is discovered, and the hypocritical Vizor is pluckt from our Devils faces.</p>
                  <p>THIS if men duly considered, and fixt it in their Minds, would effectually cure them of all their <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> For alas! what Hypocrisie can so <hi>cunningly</hi> disguise them, as to render them <hi>Incognito</hi> to Omniscience? If men will be wicked therefore, they were e'en as good put on a <hi>bold Face,</hi> and be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>openly</hi>; for 'tis to very little purpose for them to <hi>sneak</hi> into Corners, unless they could find one <hi>dark</hi> enough to <hi>conceal</hi> them from God, and <hi>cover</hi> them from his All-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eye. For why should that man be <hi>asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> or <hi>afraid</hi> to let a Boy or Neighbour be <hi>conscious</hi> to his Wickedness, that never scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to commit it in the open <hi>View</hi> of the dreadful Majesty of Heaven, by whose final Sentence his everlasting Fate must be decided?</p>
                  <p>AND so on the other hand, to what purpose should we study to be more <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>temperate, sober</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> in the view of the World, than we are in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements, when we have no other Eye but God's upon us? That which we are mainly concerned in, is to approve our selves to <hi>him,</hi> and if we can do this, what great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:106959:195"/>
is it though our <hi>Closet</hi> be all our <hi>Stage,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> our only <hi>Spectator?</hi> God <hi>hears</hi> the softest Whispers of our Souls, and <hi>sees</hi> through all our honest Intentions, and our most <hi>secret</hi> Vertues are as <hi>legible</hi> to his Eye as if they were written on our Foreheads with a Sun-beam. We need no Trumpet to proclaim our Alms in his <hi>Ears,</hi> for he knows by whom such a poor man was <hi>relieved,</hi> such a starving family <hi>succoured,</hi> though we should not superscribe our <hi>Names</hi> upon our Charity, nor <hi>let our left hand know what our right hand hath done.</hi> And if by the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> Discharg of our Duty we have <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> our selves to God, what need we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our selves any farther? since 'tis not from <hi>Men,</hi> but from <hi>God,</hi> that we expect the <hi>Recompence</hi> of our Obedience. No doubtless, did we but live under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant sense of God <hi>Presence</hi> with, and <hi>Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> over us, we should regard him <hi>much more</hi> in every good Action, and the good Opinion of the World <hi>much less</hi> than we do; and the more <hi>secret</hi> our good Deeds were, the more we should <hi>rejoice</hi> in them, because they would give us a <hi>stronger</hi> Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Sincerity.</hi> For what should move us to be good when God only sees us, but <hi>pure</hi> Respect to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and an <hi>honest</hi> Intention of obeying
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:106959:195"/>
him? And if <hi>Obedience</hi> be our Design, the more <hi>private</hi> our good Deeds are, the more <hi>Pleasure</hi> they will afford us, because those good Deeds have <hi>most</hi> of Obedience in them, that have <hi>least</hi> of the Theatre.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. To prosper our <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> in the Christian Warfare, it is also necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that we should frequently <hi>examin</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view</hi> our own Actions. For this our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on injoins as a necessary Part of the <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> Life of a Christian, So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii.5, <hi>Examin your selves whether you be in the faith, prove your own selves</hi>; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, it is injoined as a proper Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sacrament, <hi>Let a man examin himself, and so let him eat,</hi> 1 Cor. xi.28. So also <hi>Gal.</hi> vi.4. <hi>Let a man prove,</hi> or <hi>examin, his own work,</hi> where the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which in all these Texts we render to <hi>prove</hi> or <hi>examin,</hi> hath two Significations. First, to call our selves to <hi>Account,</hi> to <hi>try</hi> our <hi>past</hi> Actions by the Rule, whether they be good or evil; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to take such a due <hi>Care</hi> of our Actions as that upon a strict Tryal of them we may be able to <hi>approve</hi> them to God and our own Consciences. In the <hi>first</hi> of which Sences the New-Testament doth most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly understand it, namely to call our selves to <hi>Account,</hi> and make a strict <hi>Survey</hi>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:106959:196"/>
of our Actions, and pass an impartial <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon them, whether they are good or evil; and accordingly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi.31. instead of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the 28th <hi>Verse,</hi> i. e. <hi>let a man examin himself,</hi> the Apostle uses as a sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonimous Phrase, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, i. e. if we <hi>judg our selves,</hi> if we <hi>summon</hi> our past acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of our Consciences, and <hi>try</hi> and <hi>examin</hi> them by the Rule whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are good or evil, and according as we find them, to <hi>approve</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> our selves for them.</p>
                  <p>AND this is a Duty of great Necessity to the successful Prosecution of our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Warfare. For unless we do frequently <hi>reflect</hi> upon our selves, and take a <hi>strict</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our past Actions and Behaviour, we shall incur a thousand Errors and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities in the Hurry of our secular Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without taking any <hi>Notice</hi> of them; and those sins which we <hi>heedlesly</hi> commit, and never <hi>think of</hi> afterwards, though at first perhaps they may have little or no <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> in them, do yet leave a <hi>malicious</hi> Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion behind them, and <hi>infect</hi> the will with bad Inclinations, and insensibly <hi>dispose</hi> it to <hi>wilful</hi> and <hi>deliberate</hi> Sins. For the Pleasure of <hi>one</hi> bad Action will be still inviting us to <hi>another,</hi> and that to a <hi>third,</hi> and so we shall be inconsiderately <hi>tolled</hi> on from Sin to Sin
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:106959:196"/>
in the course of a <hi>heedless</hi> and <hi>unreflecting</hi> Life, till, before ever we are aware, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the Sin which we have so heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly <hi>repeated,</hi> becomes too strong for our pious <hi>Resolution.</hi> For when we have <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly</hi> permitted <hi>one</hi> Sin to break through our Fence, that will open a gap for <hi>another</hi> to follow, and if this be not presently <hi>stopt</hi> by Repentance, 'twill make the Breach yet <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> for <hi>others,</hi> and those again for <hi>others,</hi> till at last they have quite <hi>trodden down</hi> our good Resolution, and made a <hi>Through-fare</hi> in our Wills for a Custom of sinning. But if we frequently <hi>reflect</hi> upon, and <hi>examin</hi> our selves, 'tis impossible our Faults should long escape our <hi>Discovery,</hi> and we shall be sure to <hi>see</hi> them time enough to <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>amend</hi> them before they are too <hi>deeply</hi> root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Natures, and have wound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too <hi>far</hi> into our Inclinations; and a wound in our <hi>Innocence,</hi> as well as our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, may be easily cured if it be taken <hi>in time,</hi> but if it be <hi>neglected</hi> too long, it will <hi>rancle</hi> by Degrees into an incureable Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green.</p>
                  <p>AND as frequent <hi>Self-Examination</hi> is a great <hi>Bridle</hi> to our <hi>Sin,</hi> so it is also an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual <hi>Spur</hi> to our <hi>Vertue.</hi> For as when a man reflects upon his Sins and Miscarriages, and considers <hi>how</hi> and <hi>where</hi> he hath done
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:106959:197"/>
amiss, his Conscience will be presently <hi>urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>exciting</hi> him to Repentance and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; so when he reflects upon his own Vertue and Sincerity, his conscience will <hi>smile upon</hi> and <hi>crown</hi> him with Applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and give him such a <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> Relish of his own Actions, as will mightily <hi>incourage</hi> him to <hi>persevere</hi> in Well-doing. For in all our <hi>Self-examinations</hi> we taste the difference between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> the <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of that, and the <hi>Bitterness</hi> of this, and consequently, the oftner we do so, the more we shall be sure to <hi>like</hi> and <hi>approve</hi> of the one, and to <hi>dislike</hi> and <hi>nauseate</hi> the other.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE to secure a good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to this our Christian Warfare, as it is necessary, especially <hi>at first,</hi> that we should every <hi>Morning,</hi> before we go into the World, repeat and inforce our good <hi>Resolution</hi>; so it is no less requisite, especially till we have made some <hi>considerable</hi> Progress, that we should every <hi>Night,</hi> when we are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the World, strictly <hi>examin</hi> the performances of the Day, whether they are such as do comport with our solemn Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And if upon an impartial Survey, it appear that they do, though as yet it be but <hi>weakly</hi> and <hi>imperfectly,</hi> let us <hi>attend</hi> to the Sense of our own Minds, to that silent
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:106959:197"/>
Melody that resounds from our Consciences to our Actions, and so lye down in Peace, <hi>blessing</hi> and <hi>adoring</hi> that Grace, by which we have been <hi>assisted</hi> and <hi>preserved.</hi> Or if it appear that we have been <hi>unwarily</hi> faulty, for want of due Care and Watchfulness, let us resolve to take more <hi>Care</hi> for the future, and thereby to put a timely <hi>Stop</hi> to our Sin before it hath too far <hi>insinuated</hi> into our Will and Inclinations; but if we are consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of any <hi>wilful</hi> Breach upon our Morning Vows of Obedience, let us <hi>lament</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail</hi> it with Shame and Indignation. What have I done, O wretched <hi>Traitor</hi> that I am to God and my own Soul! I have <hi>falsified</hi> my Vows to Heaven, and <hi>broke</hi> those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bands by which I was <hi>tyed up</hi> from my Lusts and my Ruin, What can I <hi>plead</hi> for my self, <hi>base</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> that I am? with what Face can I go into his dreadful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence whom I have so often <hi>mocked</hi> with my <hi>treacherous</hi> Promises of Amendment? Yet go I will, though I am all <hi>ashamed</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,</hi> and <hi>confess</hi> and <hi>bewail</hi> mine Iniquity before him.</p>
                  <p>IF we would but take care thus to call our selves to <hi>Account</hi> every Night, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partialy to <hi>censure</hi> the Actions of the day, it is not to be imagined how fast 'twould set us <hi>forward</hi> in our Christian Warfare; how
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:106959:198"/>
much the <hi>Reflection</hi> on a <hi>well-spent</hi> Day would <hi>chear</hi> and <hi>enliven</hi> us; how the <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Sense of it would <hi>spirit</hi> our Faculties, and <hi>encourage</hi> us to go on against all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions; how much the <hi>Review</hi> of the <hi>Sins</hi> of the Day would contribute to make our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son more <hi>vigilant,</hi> and our Consciences more <hi>tender</hi> for the future; how much the Pleasure of our Sins would be <hi>allayed</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated</hi> by the <hi>stinging</hi> Reflections we should make upon them, and how much the Dread of having the same Reflections <hi>repeated</hi> to us at Night, would secure us against the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the Day.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. TO prosper the <hi>Course</hi> of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Warfare, it is also necessary that we should be very <hi>watchful</hi> and <hi>circumspect.</hi> For this also is one of those <hi>militant</hi> Duties which the Gospel injoins us. Thus <hi>Matt.</hi> xxvi.41. <hi>Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation</hi>; and <hi>Mark</hi> xiii.37. <hi>What I say unto you, I say unto all, watch:</hi> so also, 1 Cor. xvi.13. <hi>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit your selves like men</hi>; and 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> v.6. <hi>Wherefore let us not sleep, as do others, but let us watch and be sober</hi>; where the Nature of the Duty is plainly discovered by its Opposite or Contrary, <hi>let us not sleep, but watch,</hi> i. e. do not behave your selves like men that are <hi>asleep,</hi> that take no Notice or
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:106959:198"/>
Regard of what is done <hi>by, to,</hi> or <hi>about them</hi>; but be sure you exercise a <hi>suitful, prudent</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> Care over your own Actions and those manifold Temptations that <hi>assault</hi> and <hi>surround</hi> you. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore elsewhere 'tis exprest by <hi>walking circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly,</hi> Eph. v.15. <hi>i. e.</hi> looking round about you, <hi>weighing</hi> the nature and circumstances of your Actions, and using all honest Care either to <hi>prevent</hi> the Temptations that threaten you, or to <hi>provide</hi> against them; so that in short the sense of this Duty is this, that we carefully avoid acting <hi>rashly</hi> and <hi>precipitantly</hi> without <hi>considering</hi> before-hand the Nature of our Action whether it be good or evil; that in all <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious</hi> Cases we impartially <hi>consult</hi> our Rule and Conscience, and <hi>look</hi> before we <hi>leap,</hi> and take care to <hi>satisfie</hi> our selves of the Goodness of our <hi>Designs,</hi> before we put them into <hi>Execution</hi>; in a word, that we do not <hi>carelesly</hi> run our selves into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but, if possible, to <hi>avoid</hi> them, if not to be sure to <hi>arm</hi> our selves against them, and keep as <hi>far off</hi> from all sin, especially from that we are most <hi>inclined</hi> to, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with our necessary Occasions; or, in fewer words, 'tis to be always <hi>well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> in what we do, whether it be good or evil; and if it be <hi>evil,</hi> to remove so far as
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:106959:199"/>
we can from all <hi>Occasions</hi> that lead to it, and provide our selves with Considerations <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> it, and to keep them always <hi>awake</hi> in our Minds, that we may not be <hi>surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi> by it unawares.</p>
                  <p>WHICH is a Duty indispensably neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for us in the whole Course of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Warfare, For whilst we accustom our selves to act <hi>rashly</hi> and <hi>inconsiderately,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bethinking before-hand what we say or do, we wander like blind men in a Field that is full of <hi>Pits</hi> and <hi>Quagmires,</hi> and are every moment in Danger of stumbling into one Mischief or other, and shall certainly plunge our selves into many an evil Custom before ever we have bethought our selves of the evil of it; and so instead of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>old</hi> Sins, we shall be ever and anon running our selves into <hi>new</hi> ones, and while we are running away from <hi>one</hi> evil, shall many times stumble into <hi>another,</hi> and to avoid the <hi>Defects</hi> of Vertue leap head-long into the <hi>Excesses</hi> of it. For in most moral Actions the Transition from the <hi>utmost</hi> of what is <hi>lawful</hi> into the <hi>nearmost</hi> of what is <hi>sinful</hi> is indiscernible; and that line which parts <hi>this</hi> Vertue from <hi>that</hi> neighbouring Vice is generally so <hi>small,</hi> that 'tis hard to distinguish where they are <hi>separated,</hi> and to fix the just <hi>Boundary</hi> whitherto we may
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:106959:199"/>
go and no farther. But then considering that almost every Vertue lies in the <hi>Middle</hi> between two sinful <hi>Extremes,</hi> neither of which are separated from it by any <hi>plain</hi> or <hi>visible</hi> Land-mark, how is it possible for us, without great <hi>Care</hi> of our Steps, to keep on stedfastly in the <hi>right</hi> Path, when there are so many <hi>wrong</hi> ones bordering upon it? For when we perceive we have wandred too far towards <hi>either</hi> Extreme, and are indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to <hi>retrieve</hi> our selves, if we do not take great Care of our Steps we shall be apt to wander as far the <hi>other</hi> way, and so stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out of one Extreme into another. For he who lives <hi>heedlesly</hi> and <hi>incuriously,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not how <hi>near</hi> he approaches to any sin, provided he doth but keep himself <hi>out</hi> of it; and when once a man takes the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to go as near to any Sin as he thinks he lawfully <hi>may,</hi> it is a thousand to one but he will be transported by his Inclination a great deal further than he <hi>should.</hi> So true is that of <hi>Clem. Alex. Paedag.</hi> lib. 2. c.1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> they who will do all things that are <hi>lawful,</hi> will quickly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to do what is <hi>unlawful</hi>; especially if they be strongly inclined to it; because the very <hi>Nearness</hi> of what a man loves, doth always render it more <hi>tempting</hi> and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:106959:200"/>
                     <hi>alluring</hi> to him. Thus he that hath a strong inclination to <hi>Lying,</hi> can never be safe so long as he allows himself to be excessively <hi>talkative</hi>; he that is vehemently propense to <hi>fleshly Lust,</hi> must needs indanger his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence if he come too near the farthermost Limits of a <hi>modest</hi> Freedom; and he whose nature is prone to <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but run a mighty Hazard if he indulge to himself the utmost Degree of a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> Resentment. For bad <hi>Inclinations</hi> are never so impatient of Restraint, as when they are within <hi>Prospect</hi> of their proper <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions,</hi> and the objects which attract them are <hi>near</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to be injoyed. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Account it must needs be a very dangerous thing for such as are ingaged in the Christian Warfare to live within <hi>Sight</hi> of the Temptations they are most inclined to; because the <hi>nearer</hi> they are to them the more they will <hi>court</hi> and <hi>importune</hi> them, and while a man comes near a beloved <hi>Lust</hi> and doth not enjoy it, he doth but <hi>Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize</hi> himself, and <hi>inrage</hi> his Appetite after those vicious Satisfactions whose <hi>alluring</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes he had almost <hi>forgotten.</hi> If therefore he would obtain a perfect Victory over his Lust, he must not only forbear to <hi>act,</hi> but also to <hi>approach</hi> it; at least, till he hath so far weaned his Inclination from it, as that
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:106959:200"/>
its <hi>Nearness</hi> ceases to be a <hi>Temptation</hi> to him. For Inclination, like all other Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is always <hi>swiftest</hi> when it is <hi>nearest</hi> its Center, and when once 'tis within the <hi>Reach</hi> and <hi>Attraction</hi> of it, it hurries towards it with <hi>Fury</hi> and <hi>Impatience</hi>; and if in this its violent Rage it happen to break out to its beloved Sin, and to tast the forbidden Pleasure of it, 'twill thereby immediately <hi>recover</hi> all its impaired Strength, and become as <hi>headstrong</hi> and <hi>outragious</hi> as ever; and so all that Ground which we get in a <hi>Months</hi> Abstinence from our sin, we shall lose in a <hi>Moments</hi> Injoyment of it. Upon this account therefore it highly concerns us, if we would succeed in our Christian War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, to be very <hi>watchful</hi> and <hi>circumspect,</hi> to look well to our Steps, and not approach too near to <hi>any</hi> Sin, but especially to any that we are strongly <hi>inclined</hi> to.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. TO give us good Success in this our Christian Warfare, it is also necessary that we be <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi> in our particular <hi>Callings.</hi> This is one of those instrumental Duties which our Religion prescribes throughout the whole <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our Christian Warfare. Thus 1 Thes. 4. x, 2. <hi>We beseech you brethren that you increase more and more, and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:106959:201"/>
work with your own hands, as we commanded ye</hi>; and this 2 Thes. iii.10. he backs with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that <hi>if any would not work, they should not eat,</hi> i. e. that they should not be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in their Sloth and Idleness, and like <hi>Drones</hi> be permitted to dwell at ease in the <hi>Hive,</hi> and devour the Labours of the more industrious <hi>Bees</hi>; and this <hi>verse</hi> xi. he calls <hi>walking disorderly,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> viii. and ix. he tells us that 'twas for this cause that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chose to <hi>work with his own hands</hi> for his Livelihood, than to be maintained by them, as he might justly have demanded; that he might make himself an <hi>Example</hi> of Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for them to <hi>follow.</hi> So also, Eph. iv.28. <hi>Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good,</hi> i. e. imploying himself in some honest Calling, <hi>that he may have to give to him that needs</hi>; the sense of all which is to oblige us to ingage our selves in some honest <hi>Calling</hi> or <hi>Employment,</hi> and to be <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>AND how necessary this is to secure us in the whole <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our Religion, appears from hence, that we are naturally a sort of very <hi>active</hi> Beings, that must be imployed one way or other; that we have a Mind within us, that will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in <hi>Motion,</hi> that being a <hi>spiritual</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:106959:201"/>
and as <hi>such,</hi> of a quite different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>sluggish</hi> Matter, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admit of <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Inactivity</hi>; that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives all its Pleasures from <hi>Action,</hi> and hath nothing to live upon but the grateful relish of its own <hi>Motions.</hi> And this being the state of that <hi>active</hi> Principle within us, that <hi>constitutes</hi> us Men, we had need take great care to keep it <hi>honestly</hi> busied and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. For it being naturally such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>busie</hi> thing, 'twill be sure to find something or other to work upon; and if it be not constantly imployed about <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> things, 'twill quickly divert the current of its Motion another way, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert its Activity upon <hi>dishonest</hi> and <hi>unlawful</hi> ones. And hence it is that, since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy of humane Nature, God hath placed the generality of Men in such Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherein some honest <hi>Calling,</hi> and their <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> therein, is indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly <hi>necessary</hi> to their comfortable Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence. For he wisely considered that such was the <hi>Indisposition</hi> of our <hi>degenerate</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Exercises of Religion, that 'twould be impossible for <hi>us</hi> in this <hi>imperfect</hi> State to keep our Minds <hi>always</hi> intent upon them, to fix our thoughts <hi>continually</hi> upon him, and exert our Powers without any <hi>Pause</hi> or <hi>Interruption</hi> in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:106959:202"/>
Acts of <hi>Love, Adoration</hi> and <hi>Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of him; that there is such a <hi>Repugnance</hi> in our tempers to these blessed Operations, that if we had nothing else to do, they would soon grow <hi>irksome</hi> and <hi>intolerable</hi> to us; and therefore, lest being quite <hi>tired</hi> out with these spiritual Acts of Religion, we should <hi>hate</hi> them, and so turn the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of our Activity into the <hi>contrary</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, he hath placed us in such Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherein we have frequent Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to <hi>rest</hi> our wearied Minds from these <hi>abstracted</hi> Exercises in such <hi>innocent</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments as are necessary to our comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Subsistence in this World. So that by putting us under the necessity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying our selves in secular Trades and Callings, he hath taken care to <hi>intercept</hi> our Minds, that they may not fly off from the <hi>pure</hi> Acts of Religion into the contrary Impieties; and that when they are not <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely,</hi> they may be <hi>innocently</hi> imployed, and by diverting our Activity with <hi>honest,</hi> when it is weary of <hi>spiritual</hi> Exercise, he hath taken a wise Course to <hi>confine</hi> and <hi>bound</hi> it, and leave it less Scope and Liberty to <hi>rove</hi> and make Incursions into <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>prohibited</hi> Actions. And therefore, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> commends <hi>Archytas</hi> for his Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rattles, because Children by playing
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:106959:202"/>
with them are kept from breaking Vessels of <hi>use</hi>; so ought we to admire the Wisdom and Goodness of God, for thus necessitating us to exert our Activity in <hi>secular</hi> Acts and Trades, because by this <hi>innocently</hi> imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>busie</hi> Natures, he hath taken an admirable Course to divert us from <hi>mischievous</hi> Actions.</p>
                  <p>AND he having thus obliged us by our Necessities to follow some <hi>honest</hi> Calling for a comfortable Livelihood, he expects that we should be <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi> in that <hi>particular</hi> Calling wherein his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath placed us. For otherwise he looses his End; which was to restrain us from being <hi>sinfully</hi> active, by necessitating us to be <hi>innocently</hi> so. And now that by putting us into those Necessities by which we are put upon furnishing one another with those several Conveniences of life, for the supply of which our respective Trades and Callings are intended, we by being <hi>diligent</hi> therein approve our selves <hi>faithful</hi> Servants in the great Family of God, and by <hi>industriously</hi> discharging those <hi>particular</hi> Offices wherein he hath placed us, we act as <hi>dutiful</hi> Ministers of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards one another. Because by so doing we supply those Wants and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities which God hath <hi>made,</hi> and which
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:106959:203"/>
he hath made to be supplyed by <hi>our</hi> Office and Ministries; So that now to mind our own <hi>Business,</hi> is a Part of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and 'tis that <hi>particular</hi> Part to which Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath called us. If therefore we are <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>neglective</hi> in this, we are undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Servants to the common Master of the World, how officious soever we may be in <hi>other</hi> matters. For this is the proper Work of our Office, and therefore if we are unfaithful in <hi>this,</hi> we can be faithful in <hi>nothing.</hi> Should the Bayliff of a Family <hi>neglect</hi> letting his Masters Lands and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in his Rents, he would be thought a <hi>bad</hi> servant, how <hi>diligent</hi> soever he might be in the Kitchen or the Stables; and so if we are <hi>remiss</hi> in our <hi>particular</hi> Offices and Employments, we are <hi>bad</hi> Servants to God, how <hi>sedulous</hi> soever we may be either in the Offices of <hi>other</hi> Men, or in the <hi>common</hi> Services which we all owe him; and he that neglects his own Calling to serve God in his Closet or in the Church, is like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Steward that neglects providing for the Family to dress the Garden and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flowers.</p>
                  <p>'TIS true as we ought not to devote to the <hi>common</hi> Service of God, that Time and Attendance which by the rules of Prudence and good Husbandry are appropriated to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:106959:203"/>
our <hi>particular</hi> Callings; so neither ought we to permit our particular Calling so to <hi>ingross</hi> our Time and Attendance as to leave none for our Prayers and those common Services whether <hi>private</hi> or <hi>publick,</hi> which as Creatures and Christians we are obliged to render to our Creator. For as he that to <hi>serve</hi> God <hi>neglects</hi> his Calling is a <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Truant, so he that to <hi>attend</hi> his Calling <hi>neglects</hi> to serve God is a <hi>prophane</hi> Drudge. But for a truly <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi> Man it is not at all difficult so to keep his Business and his Religion <hi>apart,</hi> as that they may not <hi>interfere</hi> with one another; and faithfully to <hi>discharge</hi> whatsoever his <hi>Calling</hi> exacts of him, and yet leave void Spaces enough in his time to do all that his <hi>Religion</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
                  <p>NEITHER are we obliged to be so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious</hi> in our Calling as to deny our selves any <hi>moderate</hi> Refreshments or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, which are not only <hi>useful,</hi> but sometimes <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>breath</hi> our Spirits af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have been almost stifled in a Croud of Business, and <hi>divert</hi> our wearied Thoughts, which like the strings of a Lute by being <hi>slackned</hi> now and then will sound the sweeter when they are <hi>wound up</hi> again. But then we ought to take care that we do not turn our <hi>Physick</hi> into <hi>Food,</hi> and make
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:106959:204"/>
that our <hi>Business</hi> which should be only our <hi>Diversion</hi>; that our Recreations be <hi>short,</hi> and apt to <hi>refresh,</hi> but not to <hi>steal away</hi> our Minds from severer Employments. For <hi>long</hi> Sports and Recreations are like a <hi>large</hi> Entry to a <hi>little</hi> House, they take up so much Room in the <hi>narrow</hi> Compass of our Time, that there is not Space enough left in it for the more <hi>useful</hi> Apartments; and so far as our Sports do exceed the Measures of <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> Recreation, they are <hi>unwarrantable</hi> Encroachments upon our Calling and Religion. 'Tis true, as for the Measures of <hi>Convenience,</hi> they are not alike to <hi>all</hi>; for as for those whose large Fortunes have placed them beyond the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the World, they may <hi>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently</hi> allow themselves <hi>larger</hi> Portions of Recreation than those of meaner Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, who having not yet made a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent provision for their Families, are obliged in Justice to a more <hi>constant</hi> Industry, lest they fall under St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Censure of being <hi>worse than Infidels.</hi> But how plentiful soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our outward Condition may be, it will by no means warrant us either to live <hi>idely,</hi> or to make our <hi>Recreations</hi> our continual Employments; but the more Leisure we have from secular <hi>Business,</hi> the greater Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Time we ought to consecrate
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:106959:204"/>
to Religion, and since our <hi>Bodies</hi> and our <hi>Families</hi> are so liberally provided for, to be so much the more industrious in supplying the Necessities of our <hi>Souls,</hi> that so <hi>these</hi> may not be the only <hi>miserable</hi> things about us. But then our Natures being so <hi>depraved,</hi> as that they cannot dwell long on the severe Exercises of Religion and yet so <hi>active</hi> as that if in the Intervals of our Religion they be not <hi>Innocently</hi> imployed, they will be apt to run into <hi>Mischief</hi>; 'tis in our own Defence necessary, how prosperous soever our outward Condition may be, that we should find out some <hi>honest</hi> Business or other to keep our Activity <hi>regularly</hi> Exercised. And this will be no hard matter for us to do, considering how many <hi>generous, liberal</hi> and <hi>ingenuous</hi> Employments there are, fit for persons of the highest Rank and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. They may dedicate such Portions of their Time to the useful Studies of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi> or <hi>History,</hi> or of the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> of their own Countrey; and such to the <hi>Inspection</hi> of their own Estates, or to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> their Families, and such to <hi>examine</hi> the Complaints of their Tenants, or the Necessities of their Neighbours, or to <hi>reconcile</hi> Differences or <hi>conciliate</hi> Love and good Neighbourhood among those that are near or under them; in these and such like Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:106959:205"/>
they may <hi>innocently</hi> exercise their active Minds, and thereby not only divert themselves from <hi>sinful</hi> Courses, but also render themselves very <hi>useful</hi> to the World.</p>
                  <p>BUT whatsoever our Condition in the World may be, it must doubtless be of very dangerous Consequence to our Religion not to be <hi>innocently</hi> and <hi>usefully</hi> imployd. For as the wise <hi>Cato</hi> hath observed, <hi>nihil agendo, male agere disces,</hi> i. e, by accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your self to do <hi>nothing,</hi> you will most certainly learn to do <hi>ill.</hi> For your <hi>busie</hi> Mind, like Nature, will admit of no <hi>Vacuum</hi> but must be <hi>always full</hi> of one thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and it can no sooner dismiss its <hi>pious</hi> or <hi>honest</hi> thoughts, but <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>unlawful</hi> ones will be swarming about it. For <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, lawful</hi> and <hi>sinful</hi> Objects, are the only Companions our Minds have to converse with, and therefore since they must and will be conversing with <hi>one</hi> thing or <hi>other,</hi> we ought to take great care that as soon as ever they have done entertaining <hi>religious</hi> Objects, they be presently supplyed and presented with <hi>lawful</hi> ones, with some <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi> Business, or <hi>innocent</hi> Diversion; that so we may not be at leisure to attend to those <hi>sinful</hi> Objects, which in the others Absence will be perpetually <hi>crouding</hi> and <hi>thrusting</hi>

themselves upon us. For when we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>honestly</hi> nor <hi>religiously</hi> imployed, we shall be perfectly at leisure to attend to any Invitation to Sin; and since we must still be doing one thing or other, our having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>else</hi> to do, will be a strong inducement to do that which is <hi>evil,</hi> and to spend our restless Activity in some <hi>irregular</hi> Course or other, accordingly as we are <hi>tempted</hi> and <hi>inclined.</hi> If we are of a <hi>busie</hi> and <hi>pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Temper, our leisure will presently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us to be <hi>intermedling</hi> with other Folks Business, to be <hi>tampering</hi> with State Affairs and casting new Models of Government, and <hi>censuring</hi> the Wisdom of those publick Administrations of which we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Reasons: If we are of a <hi>froward peevish</hi> and <hi>untractable</hi> Temper, we shall be apt when we have nothing else to do, to be venting our Activity in <hi>factious</hi> and <hi>turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> Zeal, in <hi>seditious</hi> Pratings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>backbiting</hi> our Adversaries, and <hi>fetching</hi> and <hi>carrying</hi> scandalous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to create Jealousies and Animosities between Neighbour and Neighbour. In a word, if we are of <hi>sanguin</hi> and <hi>jovial</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, our idle hours will be so many tempting Opportunities to <hi>Intemperance</hi> and <hi>Wantonness, Profaness</hi> and <hi>Scurrility,</hi> and all the other Wickednesses of a <hi>lewd</hi> and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:106959:206"/>
                     <hi>dissolute</hi> Conversation. If therefore we mean to be secured from <hi>sinful</hi> Actions, we must allow our selves no leisure from <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> or <hi>honest</hi> ones, which for the above named Reason, we shall find utterly unpra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, if we be not <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> in some honest Calling.</p>
                  <p>BUT whilst mens Minds are <hi>honestly</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, they will not be at leisure to listen to Temptation; and 'twill be difficult for any of those Inducements to Sin, which the Devil and outward Objects do perpetually suggest to us, to obtain Admittance to <hi>speak</hi> with our Thoughts, whilst they are thus taken up with <hi>wiser</hi> and <hi>better</hi> Company. But as soon as we dismiss <hi>these,</hi> we do in effect beckon Temptations to our selves, and <hi>invite</hi> the Devil and the World to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> us to be wicked. For, as we say <hi>Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity makes the Thief,</hi> i. e. it tempts him to steal, and so when we give the Devil the Opportunity of an <hi>idle</hi> Hour, we do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by tempt <hi>him</hi> to tempt <hi>us,</hi> and importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invite him to <hi>steal</hi> away the Treasure of our Innocence, by putting the <hi>Key</hi> of it into his hand, and giving him a free <hi>Access</hi> to it. And though we should be firmly <hi>resolved</hi> not to sin, yet tis impossible we should be <hi>safe</hi> so long as we are at leisure to be <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>; because while we are <hi>at leisure</hi> we
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:106959:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shall be very often <hi>disputing</hi> and <hi>holding</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with the Tempter, who by his <hi>Quirks</hi> and <hi>Sophistries</hi> will many times cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent such <hi>Novices</hi> as we, before we are aware. But when we are not only <hi>resolved</hi> against him, but are also so <hi>imployed</hi> as that we are not at leisure to attend to him, it is past his skill to fasten any Temptation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Wherefore, if we would be secure in the Course of our Christian Warfare, we must follow St. <hi>Jeroms</hi> Counsel to his Friend <hi>Rusticus, Semper boni aliquid operis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cito, ut Diabolus te semper inveniat occupatum,</hi> be always doing one good Work or other, that so the Devil may always find thee busie.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. TO our <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> in the Christian Warfare, it is also necessary that we should indeavour, so far as in us lyes, to keep up a constant <hi>Chearfulness</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> in our Religion. It is doubtless a great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to our Religion to imagin (as too many <hi>superstitious</hi> Christians do) that it is an Enemy to <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Chearfulness,</hi> and a severe Exactor of <hi>Pensive</hi> looks and <hi>solemn</hi> Faces; that men are never serious enough till they are <hi>mope'd</hi> into Statues, and <hi>cloisterd</hi> from all Society, but that of their own melancholy Thoughts; that 'tis a Gospel-Duty to <hi>whine</hi> or to be <hi>silent,</hi> and retire themselves from the most innocent <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:106959:207"/>
and <hi>Festivities</hi> of Conversation; and in a word, that all kind of <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> Humour is to be rankt among those <hi>Idle Words</hi> which our Saviour tells us shall be brought to Judgment. As if Religion were a <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> a heavy, stark, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid thing, that had neither <hi>Heat</hi> nor <hi>Life</hi> nor <hi>Motion</hi> in it; or were intended for a <hi>Medusa</hi>'s Head to transform men into monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Stone. By which <hi>false</hi> Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, they render it much more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome than it is in its <hi>own</hi> Nature. For to make Religion forbid us any thing that is <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> is to render it a real <hi>grievance</hi> unto humane nature; 'tis to make our <hi>Duty</hi> run a tilt at the Principles of our <hi>Being,</hi> and set our <hi>Conscience</hi> and our <hi>Nature</hi> at Variance with one another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, since to be <hi>risible</hi> and <hi>sociable,</hi> is as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to us as to be <hi>reasonable,</hi> to make our <hi>Religion</hi> an Enemy to our <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi> is to represent it as a tyrannical Invader of the essential <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of humane Nature. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though it denies us not the freedom of an <hi>innocent</hi> Humour, nor disallows those little <hi>Plaisances</hi> and inoffensive <hi>Raileries</hi> of Fancy which are somtimes requisite to <hi>sauce</hi> our Conservation, and give it a <hi>quicker</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish; yet hath it taken care to bound our
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:106959:207"/>
Merriments with the necessary Precepts of <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Gravity,</hi> that so by too much whifling up and down in the little <hi>levities</hi> of Fancy, our Minds may not grow <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>light</hi> and <hi>trifling,</hi> and be thereby indisposed to <hi>serious</hi> Thoughts and Reflections: But so long as we keep within the Bounds of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and do not sally out into <hi>malicious</hi> or <hi>scurrilous</hi> or <hi>prophane</hi> Jesting, our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth not only <hi>connive</hi> at our Mirth, but <hi>commend</hi> and <hi>approve</hi> it: and so remote is it from <hi>cramping</hi> those Strings and Sinews of the Mind, <hi>Chearfulness</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> that it <hi>recollects</hi> their scatterd Vigour, and <hi>winds up</hi> their Slackness to a true Harmony.</p>
                  <p>FOR it requires that our <hi>speech should be alway with grace,</hi> Col. iv.6. <hi>i. e.</hi> as some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors understand the Phrase, that it should not be <hi>whining</hi> and <hi>melancholy,</hi> but <hi>sprightly</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi>; it bids us <hi>rejoice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore,</hi> 1 Thes. v.16, and <hi>rejoice in the Lord alway, and again rejoice,</hi> Phil. iv.4. that is, to indeaver to be <hi>chearful</hi> in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and to bear all Events with a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi> and <hi>lightsome</hi> mind. And therefore the Apostle reckons this among the blessed Fruits and Effects of that Divine Spirit which accompanies and animates Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, <hi>viz. Joy,</hi> or <hi>Chearfulness,</hi> Gal v.22. and this is one of the Particulars in which
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:106959:208"/>
the same Apostle makes the <hi>Christian</hi> Laws to consist, as they stand opposed to the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Laws of the Jews; <hi>the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> i. e. the Laws of the Christian Church, <hi>is not meat and drink,</hi> i. e. consist not of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions or Prohibitions of things that are of a <hi>Ritual</hi> or <hi>indifferent</hi> Nature; <hi>but righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. xiv.17. which three Particulars being opposed to things that are <hi>unnecessary,</hi> must by the Law of Oppositions denote things that are <hi>necessary</hi>; and therefore as by <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> must be meant <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Peaceableness,</hi> so by <hi>Joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> must be meant <hi>Chearfulness</hi> and <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity</hi> in doing the will of God; because <hi>Joy</hi> can be in no other Sense Matter of <hi>Necessary</hi> Duty. By all which its evident, that <hi>Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of Temper is so far from being <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced</hi> by our Religion, that 'tis <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> and <hi>injoined</hi> by it, so far as 'tis in our Power and Choice. And indeed it highly becomes us who serve so good a Master, to be <hi>free</hi> and <hi>chearful,</hi> and thereby to express a grateful sense of his Goodness, and of those glorious Rewards which we expect from his inexhaustible Bounty; but as for a <hi>gloomy</hi> Look and <hi>dejected</hi> Countenance, it better beseems a Gally-slave than a Servant of God. And as <hi>Chearfulness</hi> is a Duty that
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:106959:208"/>
very well <hi>becomes</hi> our State, so it is highly <hi>necessary</hi> to support and carry us on in our Christian Warfare.</p>
                  <p>FOR <hi>Chearfulness</hi> is Natures best Friend; it <hi>removes</hi> its Oppressions, <hi>enlivens</hi> its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and keeps its Spirits in a <hi>brisk</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> Motion, and hereby renders it <hi>easie</hi> to it self, and <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>serviceable</hi> to God and Man. It dispels <hi>Clouds</hi> from the Mind, and <hi>Fears</hi> from the Heart, and kindles and Cherishes in us <hi>brave</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and composes our Natures into such a <hi>regular</hi> temper as is of all others the most fit to receive religious Impressions, and the breathings of the Spirit of God. For what the Jews do observe of the Spirit of <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi> is as true of the Spirit of <hi>Holiness,</hi> that it dwells not with <hi>Sadness,</hi> but with <hi>Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>; that being it self of a <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> Nature, it loves not to reside with <hi>black</hi> and <hi>melancholy</hi> Passions, but requires a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> and <hi>serene</hi> Temper to act upon. And hence <hi>Tertul.</hi> in his <hi>de Spectac. Deus praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit Spiritum sanctum, utpote pro Naturae suae bono tenerum &amp; delicatum, Tranquillita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te &amp; Lenitate &amp; Quiete &amp; Pace tractare; non Furore, non Bile, non Ira, non Dolore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietare,</hi> i. e. God hath commanded that the holy Spirit, who is of a tender and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate <hi>Nature,</hi> should be entertained by us
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:106959:209"/>
with Tranquility and Mildness, with Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness and Peace, and that we should take care not to disturb him with Fury and Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or with Anger and Grief. And indeed Melancholy naturally infests the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and disturbs him in all his operations; it overwhelms the Fancy with <hi>black</hi> Reeks and Vapours, and thereby <hi>clouds</hi> and <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens</hi> the Understanding, and <hi>intercepts</hi> the holy Spirits Illuminations; and, like red coloured Glass before the eye, causes the most <hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>attractive</hi> Objects, to look <hi>bloody</hi> and <hi>terrible.</hi> It <hi>distracts</hi> the Thoughts, and renders them <hi>wild, roving</hi> and <hi>incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>; and thereby utterly <hi>indisposes</hi> them to Prayer and Consideration, and renders them <hi>deaf</hi> and <hi>unattentive</hi> to all good Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Inspirations. It <hi>freezes</hi> up the Heart with <hi>dispairing</hi> Fears and Despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, and represents <hi>easie</hi> things as <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult</hi> to us, and <hi>difficult</hi> as <hi>impossible,</hi> and thereby <hi>discourages</hi> us from all those vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Attempts, to which the blessed Spirit doth so importunately <hi>excite</hi> and <hi>provoke</hi> us. In a word, it naturally <hi>benums</hi> and <hi>stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifies</hi> the Soul, <hi>obstructs</hi> its Motions, and makes it <hi>listless</hi> and <hi>unactive,</hi> and so by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposing it to <hi>co-operate</hi> with the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, renders it an <hi>incapable</hi> Subject of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace and Influence. Thus melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:106959:209"/>
you see, by its <hi>sullen</hi> and <hi>malevolent</hi> Aspects, doth obstinately <hi>resist</hi> and <hi>counter-influence</hi> the holy Spirit, without whose Aid and Assistance we can never hope to prosper in our spiritual Warfare.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE if we mean to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this great Affair, it concerns us to use all honest and innocent Means to dispel this <hi>black</hi> and <hi>mischievous</hi> Humour, and to beget and maintain in our Minds a constant <hi>Serenity</hi> and <hi>Chearfulness</hi> of Temper; and when ever our Spirits begin to <hi>droop</hi> and <hi>languish,</hi> to betake our selves to such <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Remedies, such <hi>harmless</hi> Diversions, Refreshments and Recreations, as are fit and proper to <hi>raise</hi> them up again; and not to suffer them to <hi>sink</hi> into a Bog of Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Humours, whilst 'tis in our Power by any honest Art or Invention to <hi>support</hi> them. Which if we can but effect, will be of vast Advantage to us in the whole Course of our Religion. For in an even <hi>Chearfulness</hi> of Temper, our Spirits will be always <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, strong</hi> and <hi>active,</hi> and fit for the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>noblest</hi> Operations; they will give <hi>Light</hi> to our Understandings, <hi>Courage</hi> to our Hearts, and <hi>Wings</hi> to our Affections; so that we shall be able more <hi>clearly</hi> to discern divine and heavenly things, more <hi>resolutely</hi> to practise, and more <hi>vehemently</hi> to aspire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:106959:210"/>
them; and our Considerations will be more <hi>fixt,</hi> our Devotions more <hi>intent,</hi> and all our spiritual Endeavours more <hi>active</hi> and <hi>vivacious.</hi> For a <hi>chearful</hi> Temper will represent every thing <hi>chearfully</hi> to us; 'twill represent God so <hi>lovely,</hi> Religion so <hi>attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> the Rewards of it so <hi>immense,</hi> and the Difficulties of it so <hi>inconsiderable,</hi> and thereby inspire us with so much <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> as that none of all those spiritual Enemies we war and contend against, will be able to withstand our Resolution.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. TO our Course and Progress in this our spiritual Warfare, it is also necessary that we maintain in our Minds a constant <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Expectation</hi> of Heaven; that since the things of the other World are <hi>future</hi> and <hi>invisible,</hi> and consequently less apt to <hi>touch</hi> and <hi>affect</hi> us than these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things which are continually <hi>pressing</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Senses, we should as oft as we have Opportunity, withdraw our Thoughts from these <hi>sensible</hi> Objects, and retire into the <hi>immaterial</hi> World, and there entertain our selves with the close <hi>View</hi> and <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation</hi> of the Joys and Glories it abounds with. For we are a sort of Beings that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compounded of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> are by these <hi>opposite</hi> Principles of our Nature ally'd to two <hi>opposite</hi> Worlds, and placed in the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:106959:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
middle between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> as the common Center wherein those distant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions meet. By our <hi>spiritual</hi> Nature we hold Communion with the <hi>spiritual</hi> World, and by our <hi>corporeal</hi> with this <hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> one; whose Objects being always <hi>present</hi> with us, and <hi>striking</hi> as they do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon our Senses, we lye much more bare and open to them, than to those of the spiritual World. So that unless we now and then <hi>withdraw</hi> our selves from these sensible things, which hang like a Cloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, we can never have a free <hi>Prospect</hi> into that clear Heaven above them. And hence it becomes necessary that we should now and then make a solemn <hi>Retirement</hi> of our Thoughts from <hi>earthly</hi> Objects and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that so we may approach near enough to Heaven to <hi>touch</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> the Joys and Pleasures of it, which while we <hi>transiently</hi> behold in this Croud of worldly Objects, is plac'd at such a Distance from us, that it looks like a <hi>thin, blew</hi> Landskip, next to nothing; and hath not apparent Reality enough in it to raise our Desires and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations.</p>
                  <p>AND hence we are commanded to <hi>set our affections upon,</hi> or as it is in the original, <hi>to mind those things that are above,</hi> Col. iii.2. and that by these <hi>things above,</hi> he means
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:106959:211"/>
the Enjoyments of Heaven, it's plain from <hi>v.</hi> 1. where he expresly tells us that by the <hi>above</hi> in which these things are, he means Heaven, <hi>where Christ sits at the right hand of God.</hi> So that the Sence of the Precept is this, that we should fix in our Minds such <hi>lively</hi> Representations of the Glory and Reality of the Celestial State, as may raise in our Hearts a <hi>longing</hi> Desire and <hi>earnest</hi> Expectation of being made partakers of it. Which <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Expectation</hi> he elsewhere injoyns us to <hi>put on for an Helmet,</hi> i. e. for a necessary Piece of <hi>defensive</hi> Armour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Difficulties and Discouragements of our Christian Warfare, 1 Thes. v.8. and Heb. vi.xix. <hi>this hope which enters into that within the veil,</hi> i. e. into Heaven, is said to be <hi>the Anchor of the soul both sure and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,</hi> i. e. 'tis that which <hi>stayes</hi> and <hi>secures</hi> the Soul in the midst of those many <hi>Storms</hi> of Temptation it meets withall in its <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> to Heaven; and it being so, we are bid to <hi>look to</hi> and imitate our Blessed Lord, <hi>who for the joy that was set before him endured the Cross, despising the shame, and is now sat down at the right hand of God,</hi> Heb. xii.2. The meaning of all which is, that we should earnestly indeavour to <hi>fix</hi> in our minds a <hi>vigorous</hi> Sense and Expectation of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Happiness with which God hath
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:106959:211"/>
promised to crown all that come off Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors from this spiritual Warfare; that all along as we <hi>march</hi> we should keep Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in our <hi>Eye,</hi> and <hi>incourage</hi> our selves with the <hi>Hope</hi> of it to <hi>charge through</hi> all those Difficulties and Temptations that oppose us in the way; in a word, that we should frequently <hi>awaken</hi> in our minds the glorious <hi>Thoughts</hi> of a blessed Immortality, and possess our selves with a lively <hi>Expectation</hi> of injoying it, if we <hi>hold out</hi> to the End.</p>
                  <p>WHICH is a Duty of a vast Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to us in the <hi>Course</hi> of our spiritual Warfare. For Heaven being the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Reward</hi> of our Warfare, must needs be the grand <hi>Encouragement</hi> thereunto; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently if once we <hi>lose Sight</hi> of Heaven, and suffer <hi>earthly</hi> things to <hi>interpose</hi> and <hi>eclipse</hi> the Glory and Reality of it, our Courage will never be able to <hi>bear up</hi> against those manifold Temptations that do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually assault us. But whilst we continue under a <hi>lively Sense</hi> of that blessed Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Reward, <hi>that</hi> will so <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate</hi> our Resolution, that nothing will be able to <hi>withstand</hi> it; and all the <hi>Terrors</hi> and <hi>Allurements</hi> that Sin can propose, will be forced to <hi>fly</hi> before it, and to <hi>retreat</hi> like so many impotent Waves that dash against a Rock of Adamant. For while we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:106959:212"/>
a lively Sense and Expectance of the Happiness above, we live as it were in the <hi>Mid-way</hi> between Heaven and Earth, where we have an open Prospect of the Glories of <hi>both,</hi> and do plainly see how <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>dim</hi> those <hi>below</hi> are in comparison with those <hi>above</hi>; how they are forced to <hi>sneak</hi> and <hi>disappear</hi> in the presence of those eternal <hi>Splendors,</hi> and to <hi>shroud</hi> their <hi>van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht</hi> Beauties, as the Stars do when the Sun appears. And whilst we <hi>interchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> turn our eyes from one to t'other, how fruitlesly do the <hi>Pleasures, Profits</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> below, importune us to abandon the <hi>Joys</hi> and <hi>Glories</hi> above, and with what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation do we listen to the proposals of such a <hi>senseless</hi> and <hi>ridiculous</hi> Exchange? And could we but always keep our selves at this stand, we should be so <hi>fortified</hi> with the Sight of those happy Regions <hi>above,</hi> that no Temptation from <hi>below</hi> would ever be able to <hi>approach</hi> us; and the sense that we are going on to that blessed State would carry us through all the <hi>weary</hi> Stages of our Duty with an <hi>indefatigable</hi> Vigour. For what may a man not do with Heaven in his <hi>Eye,</hi> with that <hi>potent,</hi> I had almost said <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> Encouragement before him? To <hi>pull out</hi> a right Eye, to <hi>cut off</hi> a right hand, to <hi>tear</hi> a darling Lust from his

Heart, even when 'tis <hi>wrapt</hi> about it, and <hi>twisted</hi> with its Strings, what an <hi>easie</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement is it to a man that hath a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of immortal Glories in his <hi>View?</hi> The Hope of which is enough to recommend even <hi>Racks</hi> &amp; <hi>Torments,</hi> and turn the Flames of martyrdom into a Bed of Roses. For 'twas this blessed Prospect that inabled the Good old <hi>martyrs</hi> to <hi>triumph</hi> so gloriously as they did in the midst of their Sufferings; they knew that a few Moments would put an End to their Miseries, and that when once they had <hi>weather'd</hi> those short <hi>storms,</hi> they should arive at a most blessed <hi>Harbour,</hi> and be crowned at their <hi>landing</hi>; and that from thence they should look back with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Joy and Delight upon the dangerous <hi>Sea</hi> they had escaped, and for ever bless those <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Winds</hi> that drave them to that happy <hi>Ports</hi> for as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, <hi>they sought a heavenly Countrey,</hi> Heb. xi.14.16.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. AND lastly, To the successful <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress</hi> of our Christian Warfare, it is also necessary that we should live in the <hi>frequent</hi> use of the <hi>publick Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of our Religion; namely, in the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Observation of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and in frequent <hi>Communion</hi> with one another in the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> both which are of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:106959:213"/>
great Use to us in the <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our spiritual Warfare. For as for the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> it is <hi>instituted,</hi> and ever since the Apostles Time hath been <hi>observed</hi> in the Christian Church, as a Day of <hi>publick</hi> Worship and <hi>weekly</hi> Thanksgiving for our Saviours <hi>Resurrection,</hi> in which the great Work of our Redemption was <hi>consummated.</hi> And certainly it must needs be of vast Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to be <hi>one</hi> day in <hi>seven</hi> sequester'd from the World and imployed in <hi>divine</hi> Offices, in solemn <hi>Prayers, Praises</hi> and <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sgivings,</hi> and be obliged to <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>edifie</hi> one another by the mutual <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Vnion</hi> of our Devotions; to hear the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Religion <hi>explained,</hi> the Sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it <hi>reprehended,</hi> and the Doctrins of it <hi>unfolded</hi> and <hi>reduced</hi> to plain and easie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Practice; what a mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage might we reap from all these blessed <hi>Ministries,</hi> if we would but attend to them with that <hi>Concern</hi> and <hi>Seriousness</hi> which the matter of them <hi>requires</hi> and <hi>deserves?</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if when the <hi>publick</hi> Offices are over, we would not <hi>let loose</hi> our selves all the rest of the Day, as we too frequently do, to our <hi>secular</hi> Cares and Diversions, and thereby <hi>choak</hi> those good Instructions we have heard, and <hi>stifle</hi> those devout and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Affections which have been raised and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:106959:213"/>
excited in us; but instead of so doing, we would devote at least some good Portion of it to the <hi>Instruction</hi> of our Families, and to the <hi>private</hi> Exercise of our Religion, to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> to the <hi>Examination</hi> of our selves concerning our <hi>past</hi> Behaviour, and the <hi>reinforcing</hi> our Resolution to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our selves better for the future; if, I say, we would thus spend our <hi>Lords Day,</hi> we should doubtless find our selves <hi>better</hi> Men for it all the <hi>Week</hi> after; we should go into the World again with much <hi>better</hi> Affections, and <hi>stronger</hi> Resolutions, with our Graces more <hi>vigorous,</hi> and our bad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations more <hi>reduced</hi> and <hi>tamed,</hi> and whereas the Jews were to gather <hi>Manna</hi> enough on their <hi>sixth</hi> Day, to feed their <hi>Bodies</hi> on the ensuing <hi>Sabbath,</hi> we should gather <hi>Manna</hi> enough upon our <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to feed and strengthen our <hi>Souls</hi> all the <hi>six days</hi> after.</p>
                  <p>BUT to this we must also add frequent <hi>Communions</hi> with one another in the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> which is an Ordinance <hi>instituted</hi> on purpose by our blessed Saviour, for the <hi>improving</hi> and <hi>furthering</hi> us in our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Warfare. For besides that herein we have one of the most <hi>puissant</hi> Arguments against Sin represented by <hi>visible</hi> Signs to our Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> the bloody <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:106959:214"/>
blessed Lord to <hi>expiate</hi> and make <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for it; besides that those <hi>bleeding</hi> Wounds of his which are here represented by the <hi>breaking</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>pouring out</hi> of the <hi>Wine,</hi> do proclaim our Sins his <hi>Asassines</hi> and <hi>Murderers,</hi> the thought of which, if we had any ingenuity in us, were enough to <hi>incense</hi> in us the most <hi>implacable</hi> Indignation against them; besides that his Sufferings for our Sins, of which this sacred <hi>Solemnity</hi> is a <hi>lively</hi> Picture, do horribly <hi>remonstrate</hi> Gods <hi>Displeasure</hi> against them, who would not be induced to pardon them upon any <hi>meaner</hi> Expiation than the Blood of his Son, than which <hi>Hell</hi> it self is not a more <hi>dreadful</hi> Argument to <hi>scare</hi> and <hi>terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> us from them; in a word, besides that his so freely <hi>submitting</hi> and <hi>offering</hi> up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us, of which this holy Festival is a solemn <hi>Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is an expression of <hi>Kindness</hi> sufficient to <hi>captivate</hi> the most <hi>ungrateful</hi> Souls, and <hi>extort</hi> Obedience from them; besides all this, I say, as it is a <hi>Feast</hi> upon the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of his Body and Blood, it is a Federal Rite, whereby God and we, by <hi>feasting</hi> together, do accordingly to the antient Customs both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> mutually <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige</hi> our selves to one another; whereby God, by <hi>giving</hi> us the <hi>mystical</hi> Bread and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:106959:214"/>
Wine, and we by <hi>receiving</hi> them, do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <hi>ingage</hi> our selves to one another upon those sacred Pledges of Christs Body and Blood, that we <hi>faithfully</hi> perform each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Part of that everlasting <hi>Covenant</hi> which was purchased by him. And what can be a greater <hi>Restraint</hi> to us when we are solicited to any Sin, than the sense of being under such a dreadful <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>Obligation?</hi> With what face <hi>dare</hi> we listen to any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Evil, when we remember lately we solemnly <hi>ingaged</hi> our selves to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and took the <hi>Sacrament</hi> upon it? And verily I doubt 'tis <hi>this</hi> that lies at the bottom of that seeming <hi>modest</hi> Pretence of <hi>Vnworthiness,</hi> which men are wont to urge in Excuse for their <hi>Neglect</hi> of the Sacrament; namely, that they <hi>love</hi> their Lusts, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not resolve to <hi>part</hi> with them, and therefore are <hi>afraid</hi> to make such a solemn <hi>Abjuration</hi> of them, as the eating and drinking the consecrated Elements implies. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, if <hi>this</hi> be their Reason, they are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi> indeed, the more <hi>shame</hi> for them, but 'tis such an <hi>Vnworthiness</hi> as is so far from <hi>excusing,</hi> that it only <hi>aggravates</hi> their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect. For for any man to plead that he <hi>dares</hi> not receive the Sacrament because he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to <hi>sin on,</hi> is to make that which is his <hi>Fault,</hi> his <hi>Apology,</hi> and to excuse <hi>one</hi> Sin
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:106959:215"/>
with <hi>another.</hi> Wherefore if we are hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>resolved</hi> by the Grace of God to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> and <hi>amend,</hi> let us abstain no longer from this great Federal Rite, upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Vnworthiness.</hi> For 'tis by the use of <hi>this,</hi> among <hi>other</hi> Means; that we are to <hi>improve</hi> and grow more and more <hi>worthy.</hi> For the very <hi>Repetition</hi> of our Resolution, as I have shewed above, is a proper Means of <hi>strengthning</hi> and <hi>confirming</hi> it; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it must needs be much more so, when 'tis <hi>renewed</hi> and <hi>repeated</hi> with the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Sacrament. And therefore it is worth observing, how much Care our Lord hath taken, in the very Constitution of our Religion, to oblige us to a <hi>constant, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi> Repetition of our good Resolutions. For at our first Entrance into <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, we are to be <hi>baptized,</hi> in which Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we do openly <hi>renounce</hi> the Devil and all his Works, and religiously <hi>devote</hi> our selves to his service. But because we are apt to <hi>forget</hi> this our baptismal <hi>Vow,</hi> and the <hi>Matter</hi> of it is <hi>continually</hi> to be performed, and more than <hi>one</hi> World depends upon it, therefore he hath thought fit not to <hi>trust</hi> wholly to this <hi>first</hi> Engagement, but hath so methodized our Religion, as that we are ever and anon obliged to give him <hi>new</hi> Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For which End, he hath instituted
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:106959:215"/>
this <hi>other</hi> Sacrament, which is not like that of <hi>Baptism</hi> to be received by us <hi>once for all,</hi> but to be often <hi>reiterated</hi> and <hi>repeated,</hi> that so upon the frequent <hi>Returns</hi> of it, we might still be obliged to <hi>repeat</hi> over our old Vows of Obedience. For he hath not only injoyned us that we should <hi>do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him,</hi> Luk. xxii.19. i. e. that we should celebrate this sacred Festival in the Memory of his Passion; but by thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apostle tells us we are to <hi>continue</hi> the Memorial of it to the end of the World, or <hi>to shew his death till he comes,</hi> 1 Cor. xi.26. And that this doth not, like the Precept of <hi>Baptism,</hi> oblige us for <hi>once</hi> only and no more, is evident from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words of this last recited Text, <hi>as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup,</hi> which plainly shews that these sacramental Elements are to be <hi>more</hi> than <hi>once</hi> received by us. 'Tis true, how <hi>often</hi> 'tis to be done neither Christ nor his Apostles have any where <hi>defined,</hi> but if we consult <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Example</hi> (which in the Absence of <hi>express</hi> Precept is the <hi>best</hi> Rule to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our selves by) we shall find that it was very <hi>frequently</hi> received. For from some Passages in the Acts of the Apostles, it seems <hi>probable</hi> that Christians did then communicate <hi>every Day</hi>; as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:106959:216"/>
Acts ii.46. where they are said <hi>to continue daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the house,</hi> that is as it seems <hi>probable,</hi> in some upper room of the Temple; though <hi>perhaps</hi> this <hi>daily</hi> may refer only to the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> agreeably to that Acts xx.7. <hi>on the first day of the week when the Disciples came together to break bread,</hi> Paul <hi>preached unto them.</hi> But it's <hi>certain</hi> that whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they assembled to the <hi>publick</hi> Worship, they closed it with the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>; which they did for a great while in the <hi>Western</hi> Churches <hi>every day</hi> in the Week, and in the <hi>Eastern,</hi> as St. <hi>Basil</hi> tells us, Epist. 289. <hi>four times</hi> a Week, besides <hi>Festivals.</hi> So that allowing for our <hi>Declensions</hi> from the <hi>primitive</hi> Zeal and Devotion, one would think that to communicate now <hi>once</hi> in <hi>four</hi> Weeks should be a very <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> Proportion. But as for those that <hi>wholly</hi> neglect this sacred Institution, for my own part I see not how they can <hi>excuse</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from being guilty of a wilful <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> against their Saviour, or with what Confidence they can expect either that he should <hi>assist</hi> them with his <hi>Grace</hi> on the <hi>Way,</hi> or <hi>crown</hi> them with his <hi>Salvation</hi> in the <hi>End,</hi> when they so <hi>perversly</hi> turn their backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Ordinance which he hath solemnly
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:106959:216"/>
instituted for a <hi>Conveyance</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> and a <hi>Seal</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT would we take that Care that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us, to <hi>prepare</hi> our selves for, and <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> this holy Institution, there is no doubt but we should find it of mighty Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us in the whole <hi>Course</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For till we are arived to a <hi>confirmed</hi> State of Good, our holy Fervours will be very apt to <hi>cool,</hi> our good Purposes to <hi>slacken</hi> and <hi>unwind,</hi> and our vertuous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to <hi>languish</hi> and <hi>tire</hi>; and therefore unless we take care frequently to <hi>revive</hi> our Religion with this spiritual <hi>Repast</hi> and <hi>Restorative,</hi> and still to add <hi>new</hi> Fewel to it as the Flame decays, it will quickly <hi>pine away</hi> and <hi>expire.</hi> But if upon the <hi>solemn</hi> Returns of this sacred Festival, we would <hi>constantly</hi> come with due Preparation to our masters Table, and here <hi>renew</hi> our Vows, <hi>re-invigorate</hi> our Resolutions, <hi>repair</hi> our Decays, and put our <hi>sluggish</hi> Graces into a new <hi>Fermentation,</hi> we should find our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion not only <hi>live,</hi> but <hi>thrive,</hi> and be still acquiring <hi>new</hi> Degrees of Strength and Activity. But because this Argument hath been already so fully handled in our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Treatises, particularly by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> in his <hi>Mensa Mystica</hi> and <hi>Christian Sacrifice,</hi> I shall refer the Reader
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:106959:217"/>
thither for the farther Consideration of it.</p>
                  <p>And thus, with all the Brevity I could, I have indeavoured to give an Account of those <hi>Duties</hi> which are necessary in the <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our <hi>Christian War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. IV. Containing certain <hi>Motives</hi> to animate men against the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of these <hi>Duties</hi> which appertain to the <hi>Course</hi> of our Christian Warfare.</head>
                  <p>HOW <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> to us those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed Duties are, in the <hi>Course</hi> of our Christian Warfare, hath been sufficiently shewn. So that now there is nothing that our <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Vnwillingness</hi> can object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, but only this, that they are very <hi>difficult,</hi> and do require more of our <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Pains</hi> than we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently spare from our other necessary Occasions; that the Practice of them is so <hi>unpleasant</hi> and <hi>severe,</hi> and attended with so much <hi>Cumber</hi> and <hi>Trouble,</hi> that we very much doubt we shall never be able to <hi>go through</hi> with them. And therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Objection out of mens way, and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:106959:217"/>
to excite them to the Practice of these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Duties, I shall for a Conclusion of this Argument add, to what hath been said of it, these following <hi>Considerations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That whatsoever <hi>Difficulty</hi> there is in the Practice of them, we may <hi>thank our selves</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in the <hi>Course</hi> of our <hi>Sin</hi> there is a great deal of <hi>Difficulty,</hi> as well as in our Warfare <hi>against</hi> it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That how <hi>difficult</hi> soever this War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare may be, it must be <hi>indured,</hi> or that which is a great deal <hi>worse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That though it be <hi>difficult,</hi> yet there is nothing in it but what the Grace of God will render <hi>possible</hi> to us, if we be not <hi>want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to our selves.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the Practice of these Duties is not so <hi>difficult,</hi> but that it is fairly consistent with all our other necessary <hi>Occasions</hi> and <hi>Diversions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of them is such as will certainly <hi>abate</hi> and <hi>wear off</hi> by Degrees, if we <hi>constantly</hi> practice them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That with the <hi>difficulty</hi> of them there is a World of present <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> intermingled.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That their <hi>Difficulty</hi> is abundantly <hi>compensated</hi> by the final <hi>Reward</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:106959:218"/>I. CONSIDER that whatsoever <hi>Difficulty</hi> there is in the Practice of them, we may <hi>thank our selves</hi> for it. For if we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken our selves to the Practice of Religion as soon as we were <hi>capable</hi> of it, before we had <hi>entered</hi> our selves into sinful Courses, and had <hi>therein</hi> contracted sinful Habits and Inclinations, we might have <hi>prevented</hi> those Difficulties which we now <hi>complain of.</hi> For our Religion was made <hi>for</hi> and adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to</hi> our Nature, and would have sweetly <hi>accorded</hi> with all its Affections and Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, had we not <hi>vitiated</hi> them by our own wilful Sin, and clapt a <hi>preternatural</hi> Biass upon them. But though the Light be <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi> congruous to the Eye, yet if through a Distillation of ill Humours into it the Eye grow <hi>sore</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> there is nothing more <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>offensive</hi> to it. And so it is with Religion, which to the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>uncontaminated</hi> Nature of a Man, is the most <hi>grateful</hi> and <hi>aggreeable</hi> thing in the World; but if by our own ill Government we <hi>disease</hi> our Nature, and <hi>deprave</hi> its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Constitution, it is no wonder that Religion which was so well <hi>proportioned</hi> to it in its <hi>Purity,</hi> should sit <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>uneasie</hi> upon it, in its <hi>Apostacy</hi> and Corruption. For to a man that is in a <hi>Feaver,</hi> every thing is <hi>bitter,</hi> even Honey, which when he
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:106959:218"/>
is <hi>well,</hi> is exceeding <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi>; but the <hi>Bitterness</hi> which he tasts is not in the <hi>Honey</hi> but in the <hi>Gall</hi> which overflows his own Palate; and so to a Nature that is <hi>diseased</hi> with any unnatural Lust, that which is most <hi>congruous</hi> to <hi>it self,</hi> will be most <hi>nauseous</hi> to its <hi>Disease</hi>; and those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which in its <hi>Health</hi> 'twould have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with the greatest <hi>Pleasure,</hi> will in its <hi>Sickness</hi> be the greatest <hi>Burthen</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> to it. And when we have spoiled the <hi>Purity</hi> of our Constitution, and are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated</hi> from the <hi>humane</hi> Nature into the <hi>brutal</hi> or <hi>diabolical</hi> one, it is no great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Religion of a <hi>Man</hi> should be a Burthen to the Nature of a <hi>Beast</hi> or a <hi>Devil.</hi> So that whatsoever <hi>Difficulties</hi> there are in Religion, they arise not out of the Nature of the <hi>things</hi> it requires, but out of the perverse <hi>Indispositions</hi> of our Natures to them; and these were for the most part contracted by <hi>our selves</hi>; so that instead of <hi>complaining</hi> of the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we ought to <hi>strive</hi> and <hi>contend</hi> the more earnestly against it, because we may <hi>thank our selves</hi> for it. When a man hath plaid the Fool, and set his House <hi>on Fire,</hi> the Sense of his own Folly ought to make him more industrious to <hi>extinguish</hi> it; but if instead of so doing, he should sit with his Hands
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:106959:219"/>
in his Bosom and complain of the Mischief, and the Difficulty of <hi>stopping</hi> it, what would Folks say of him? Mischievous, doth it become thee to sit here <hi>idely</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the Effect of thy own Villany, whilst 'tis yet in thy Power, wouldst thou but <hi>bestir</hi> thy self, to <hi>quench</hi> the Flame, and prevent the <hi>spreading</hi> of it? For shame get up and do thy utmost Endeavour to <hi>repair</hi> thy <hi>own</hi> Act, and to extinguish this spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mischief of which thou art the <hi>Author.</hi> Since therefore we have been so obstinately foolish as to <hi>set fire</hi> to our own Souls, and <hi>kindle</hi> in them by our vicious Courses such destructive <hi>Flames</hi> of unnatural Lust, how monstrously <hi>ridiculous</hi> is it, whilst 'tis yet in our Power to extinguish them, to sit <hi>whining</hi> and <hi>complaining</hi> of the Difficulty of it, and in the mean time permit them to <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>burn on</hi> without Interruption? O miserable men, if they are so <hi>hard</hi> to be quench'd, who may ye <hi>thank</hi> for it? Was it not you that kindled them, and do you now sit idly <hi>complaining</hi> of your own Act, when you should be the more industrious to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair</hi> the Mischief of it, because it is <hi>your own.</hi> For shame <hi>arise</hi> and <hi>bestir</hi> your selves, and since you are conscious that the <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> of your Religion are of your own <hi>creating,</hi> and that those Lusts which <hi>indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>

ye to it are the products of your own <hi>Actions,</hi> let this excite ye to a more <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Endeavour to <hi>subdue</hi> and <hi>conquer</hi> them.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. CONSIDER that in the <hi>Course</hi> of your <hi>Sins</hi> there is a great deal of <hi>Difficulty,</hi> as well as in your Warfare <hi>against</hi> them. For I dare appeal to your own Experience whether you have not found a great deal of <hi>Hardship</hi> in Wickedness, especially while you were <hi>educating</hi> and <hi>training up</hi> your Natures to it? Did not your Nature often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>recoil</hi> and <hi>start</hi> and <hi>boggle</hi> at your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Actions; and were you not fain some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>curb,</hi> and sometimes to <hi>spur</hi> it, to commit many <hi>Outrages</hi> and <hi>Violences</hi> upon it, <hi>whilst</hi> you were <hi>backing</hi> and <hi>managing</hi> it, before you could reduce it to a <hi>Through-pace</hi> in Iniquity? How often have you put your <hi>modest</hi> Nature to the <hi>Blush,</hi> at the sense of a <hi>filthy</hi> and <hi>uncomly</hi> Action, whilst your wicked Will hath been dragging it along like a <hi>timorous</hi> Virgin to an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers Bed; and what terrible <hi>Shreiks</hi> have your Consciences many times given in the midst of your sinful Commissions, when you were acting the first <hi>Rapes</hi> upon your Innocence? How many a <hi>pensive</hi> Mood hath the <hi>Review</hi> of your sinful Pleasures cost ye, and what <hi>Swarms</hi> of Horror and dreadful Expectation hath the <hi>Reflection</hi> on
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:106959:220"/>
your past Guilts raised in your Minds? And then with what excessive <hi>Difficulty</hi> have you been fain to practise some Vices, only to get an <hi>Habit</hi> of practising them more <hi>easily?</hi> How often have you been forced to <hi>swallow</hi> Sickness, to drink dead <hi>Palsies</hi> and foaming <hi>Epilepsies,</hi> to render your Intemperances <hi>familiar</hi> to you, and in what <hi>Qualms</hi> and <hi>fainting</hi> sweats, and <hi>sottish</hi> Confusions have you many times awaked, before ever you could Connaturalize your <hi>midnight</hi> Revels to your Temper? And when with so much <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> you have pretty well <hi>trained</hi> and <hi>exercised</hi> your selves in this hellish Warfare, and thereby rendered it <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>habitual</hi> to you, to how many Inconveniences hath it daily <hi>exposed</hi> you, &amp; what <hi>base</hi> and <hi>unmanly</hi> Shifts hath it put you upon, to <hi>extricate</hi> your selves out of those <hi>Difficulties</hi> wherein it hath <hi>involved</hi> you? What violent <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Perturbations</hi> doth it raise in your Minds, and into what <hi>wild</hi> Tumults of Action doth it frequently <hi>hurry</hi> you? In a word, how doth it <hi>perplex</hi> and <hi>intrigue</hi> the whole Course of your Lives, and <hi>intangle</hi> ye in a labyrinth of <hi>Knavish</hi> Tricks and Collusions; so that many times you are at your <hi>Wits end,</hi> and know not which way to <hi>turn</hi> your selves? All <hi>these</hi> Difficulties, and a great many
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:106959:220"/>
                     <hi>more,</hi> which I cannot presently think of, you must have contended with in a <hi>sinful</hi> Course of Action, if you have made any considerable Experiment of it.</p>
                  <p>AND do you complain of the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of persevering in Religion; <hi>you</hi> that have so <hi>couragiously</hi> persevered in a <hi>worse</hi> Way against Difficulties that are as <hi>great,</hi> all things considered, if not <hi>greater; you</hi> that have hitherto sin'd on so <hi>industriously,</hi> that have broke through so many strong <hi>Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes</hi> to come at and injoy your Lusts, are <hi>you</hi> not ashamed to <hi>start</hi> and <hi>boggle</hi> as you do, at the Difficulties of Virtue and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Look but how the <hi>industrious</hi> Sinner <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids</hi> you? His way <hi>leads</hi> directly to <hi>Ruine,</hi> and he <hi>knows</hi> it, and yet he <hi>presses on</hi> coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously, as if he were ambitious to be a <hi>Heroe</hi> in Iniquity, and <hi>charges</hi> through all the <hi>modesty</hi> of Humane Nature, through all his native <hi>sense</hi> of a God and a divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; he <hi>marches</hi> forward through <hi>Infamy</hi> and <hi>Diseases, Dangers</hi> and a world of <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,</hi> and offers a kind of <hi>Violence</hi> to <hi>Hell,</hi> as if he meant to <hi>force</hi> open its brazen Portal, and enter <hi>headlong</hi> into it before 'tis ready to receive him, whilst you in the mean time like a company of <hi>Crest-faln</hi> Creatures, stand <hi>shivering</hi> at a few trifling Difficulties in your Way, though you have
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:106959:221"/>
                     <hi>Heaven</hi> for your <hi>End,</hi> and a <hi>Crown</hi> of Glory for your Reward.</p>
                  <p>IN short therefore, this is the true State of your Case; choose which side you please, whether to march under <hi>Christs</hi> or the <hi>Devils</hi> Banner; you must expect before-hand to encounter <hi>some</hi> Difficulties, yea and perhaps as <hi>great</hi> on the <hi>one</hi> side as on the <hi>other</hi>; and if so, then you have little else to do but to compare their <hi>Ends,</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider which of the two is most <hi>eligible,</hi> a Crown of <hi>Glory,</hi> or eternal <hi>Torment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. CONSIDER that how <hi>Difficult</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this your spiritual Warfare may be, it must be <hi>indured,</hi> or that which is much more <hi>intollerable.</hi> I confess were it not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>necessary,</hi> we might with some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Reason urge the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of it, to <hi>excuse</hi> our selves from <hi>undertaking</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting</hi> it; but when our Case is such, as that we must either <hi>conquer</hi> or <hi>perish, swim</hi> through, or <hi>sink</hi> under the Difficulties we <hi>complain</hi> of, the matter will admit of no further <hi>Debate,</hi> but we must e'en resolve of the <hi>two</hi> Evils to <hi>choose</hi> that which is the <hi>least.</hi> When the Ship hath <hi>sprung</hi> a Leak, 'tis a Madness for the Mariners to sit still and complain of the <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> of pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for in the Extremity they are in, there is no more to be said, they must <hi>pump</hi> or
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:106959:221"/>
                     <hi>perish,</hi> and it is not to be debated where there is so vast an <hi>Inequality</hi> between the Objects of their Choice, which of the <hi>two</hi> they were best to fix upon, whether to <hi>take pains</hi> for the present to <hi>secure</hi> the Ship, or to <hi>sit still</hi> and suffer themselves to be <hi>swallowed up</hi> in the Ocean. And thus it is in the Case before us; our Soul hath sprung a Leak, and let into its <hi>Holds</hi> those <hi>Stygian</hi> Waters of <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>Diabolical</hi> Lust, which will <hi>sink</hi> us down to Hell if they be not pump'd out again; and this is not to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great deal of Labour and Difficulty. But what then; were we not better labour for a <hi>while</hi> then perish <hi>for ever</hi>? do we talk of <hi>Labour</hi> when our Souls are <hi>at stake,</hi> and our immortal Life is upon the Brink of an everlasting <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi>-being? In other Cases we never think much to indure a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Inconvenience for the Prevention of a <hi>future</hi> Mischief; we are content to <hi>fast,</hi> when we perceive it's necessary to <hi>obviat</hi> an approaching <hi>Feaver,</hi> to be <hi>cupp'd</hi> and <hi>scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified</hi> with all the Artifice of Pain to <hi>prevent</hi> or <hi>remove</hi> a dangerous Disease; and in all other Cases are generally willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long our Torment that we may be the longer a dying; except where the <hi>Prescription</hi> is <hi>Virtue,</hi> and the <hi>Death</hi> prescribed against is <hi>eternal</hi>; though <hi>this</hi> be the most formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:106959:222"/>
Mischief of all, as being the utmost <hi>Consummation</hi> of humane Misery, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with which all the <hi>Labours</hi> and <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> of Religion have not the Proportion of a gentle <hi>Flea-biting</hi> to the acutest Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Rack</hi> or <hi>Stone.</hi> For I beseech you to consider, will it not be easier for you to indure the <hi>short</hi> Agonies of a bitter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, than the horrid Despair of a damned Ghost for ever; to thwart a <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> Lust, than to lye <hi>roaring</hi> to Eternity upon the Rack of a guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science? Is there any Proportion between your <hi>abstaining</hi> from the Pleasures of Sin that are but for a <hi>moment,</hi> and your being <hi>excluded</hi> from Heaven and all Hope of Happiness <hi>for ever?</hi> Alass! if it be so <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult</hi> to you to <hi>contend</hi> with an evil Habit, to <hi>struggle</hi> with a stiff and obstinate Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how difficult will it be to <hi>dwell with everlasting burnings,</hi> and suffer the dire Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of an <hi>unappeasable</hi> Vengeance to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Wherefore since we are under an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Necessity of induring the <hi>one</hi> or <hi>th'other,</hi> in the name of God let us act like Men, and of the <hi>two</hi> evils choose that which is most <hi>tollerable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. CONSIDER that though it be <hi>difficult,</hi> yet there is nothing in it but what the Grace of God will render <hi>possible</hi> to us,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:106959:222"/>
if we be not <hi>wanting</hi> to our selves. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the <hi>Necessity</hi> of it would be no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ingage us to undertake it, were it not a <hi>possible</hi> Undertaking; yea, and readily acknowledge, that it very far exceeds <hi>our</hi> poor Possibility <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>nakedly</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So that if we were left to <hi>struggle</hi> with the Difficulty of it in our own single Strength, we might justly <hi>despair</hi> of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and so tamely <hi>lye down</hi> and <hi>yield</hi> our selves <hi>foil'd</hi> and <hi>defeated.</hi> But God be praised this is not our Case; for though when we cast our eyes upon the many <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent</hi> Inclinations to evil that are <hi>within</hi> us, and upon the <hi>numberless</hi> Temptations to evil that are <hi>about</hi> us; when we seriously reflect upon the <hi>Weakness</hi> of our Reason, and the <hi>Strength</hi> of our <hi>Lust,</hi> and the <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Nearness</hi> and <hi>Prevalency</hi> of those Objects from without that are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually <hi>pressing upon</hi> and <hi>assaulting</hi> our good Resolutions; though, I say, when we reflect upon all this, we are ready to cry out as <hi>Elisha</hi>'s Servant did when he beheld the City compassed with Horses and with Chariots, <hi>Alas, Master, how shall we do?</hi> how shall we be able to withstand all this mighty Army of Enemies? yet if we turn our Eyes from our <hi>own</hi> Weakness, and our <hi>Enemies</hi> Strength to those gracious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:106959:223"/>
of <hi>Assistance</hi> which the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies hath made to us, we shall quickly be able to answer <hi>our selves,</hi> as <hi>Elisha</hi> did <hi>him, fear not,</hi> O my Soul, <hi>for they that are with us, are more,</hi> and more powerful, <hi>than they that are against us.</hi> For we have with us not only the <hi>outward</hi> Arguments of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are of infinitely <hi>more</hi> Force than any <hi>outward</hi> Inducement to Vice whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; we have with us not only the holy <hi>Angels</hi> of God, who are as <hi>willing</hi> and more <hi>able</hi> to <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>strengthen</hi> us, than all the infernal <hi>Furies</hi> to <hi>insnare</hi> and <hi>captivate</hi> us; but we have with us also the Almighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, who by the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the <hi>Promise</hi> of our Lord, is obliged to <hi>minister</hi> to us in all our Necessities, and to <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> us against all those Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which would be otherwise <hi>too hard</hi> for us, if we were left to <hi>our selves.</hi> So that if we do but hold true to our own Interest, and take care that we do not drive him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us, by siding wilfully with our Enemies against him, we <hi>shall</hi> not, no we <hi>cannot</hi> miscarry; unless (which is <hi>impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>) some such Temptation should befal us, as neither <hi>we</hi> nor <hi>he</hi> can resist and cope with. For till by our wilful Sin we have forfeited our Title to the promise of his Assistance, we are as sure of <hi>his</hi> Help in all
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:106959:223"/>
things that are necessary, as we can be of our <hi>own</hi> Endeavour; and 'tis not more in our power to do what we <hi>can</hi> by the Strength of our own <hi>Faculties,</hi> than 'tis to ingage him to <hi>inable</hi> us to do what we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> with his <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Assistance.</hi> For by faithfully <hi>indeavouring</hi> to persevere in wel-doing, we intitle our selves to all the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Assistances of his Grace, and so long as this <hi>Title</hi> continues, we are Masters not only of our <hi>own</hi> Strength but of <hi>his</hi> too, and can do not only whatsoever is within our <hi>own</hi> Power <hi>without</hi> him, but also whatsoever is in <hi>his</hi> Power concurring <hi>with ours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SO that though our Warfare be <hi>difficult,</hi> it cannot be <hi>impossible,</hi> unless <hi>we</hi> will have it so. For to be sure there is nothing in it that can be too hard for <hi>Gods</hi> Grace <hi>co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> with the Powers of <hi>our</hi> Nature; and therefore there can be nothing in it too hard for <hi>us,</hi> whilst 'tis in our Power to <hi>secure</hi> our selves of <hi>that</hi> his gracious Co-operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE let us stand <hi>boggling</hi> no longer at the Difficulty of our Progress in Religion, since God be praised, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing required of us beyond what we are <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>; do you but <hi>your</hi> Part which is only what you <hi>can,</hi> and then doubt not but God will do <hi>his</hi>; put forth but your <hi>honest, hearty</hi>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:106959:224"/>
Endeavour, and earnestly <hi>implore</hi> his Aid and Assistance, and if <hi>then</hi> you miscarry, let Heaven answer for it. But if upon a Pretence that your Work is too <hi>difficult,</hi> and your Enemies too <hi>mighty</hi> for you, you lay down your Arms and resolve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with them no longer, let Heaven and Earth judg between God and you, which is to be charged with your ruine; God, that so graciously <hi>offer'd</hi> you his Help, that stretch'd out his Hand to <hi>raise</hi> ye up, tenderd you his spirit to <hi>guard</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> ye through all Oppositions to eternal Happiness, or you, that would not be <hi>persuaded</hi> to do any thing for your selves, but rather chose to <hi>perish</hi> with <hi>Ease,</hi> than take any <hi>Pains</hi> to be <hi>saved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. CONSIDER that the Practice of these Duties is not so <hi>difficult,</hi> but that it is fairly consistent with all your other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Occasions.</hi> When men are told how many Duties are necessary to their successful <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress</hi> in Religion, what <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,</hi> what frequent <hi>Examinations</hi> and <hi>Tryals</hi> of themselves, what lively <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Expectations</hi> of Heaven, &amp;c. they are apt to conclude that if they should ingage to do <hi>all</hi> this, they must resolve to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>else,</hi> but even shake hands with all their <hi>secular</hi> Business and Diversions, and <hi>Cloister</hi>
                     <pb n="401" facs="tcp:106959:224"/>
up themselves from all other Affairs. Which is a very great Mistake, proceeding either from their not <hi>considering,</hi> or not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> the nature of these religious Exercises, the greatest part of which are such as are to be <hi>wholly</hi> transacted in the Mind, whose Motions and Operations are much more <hi>nimble</hi> and <hi>expedite</hi> than those of the Body, and so may be very well <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt</hi> with our secular Employments, withour any <hi>Let</hi> or <hi>Hindrance</hi> to them. For what great Time is there required for a man now and then to revolve a few <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> Thoughts in his Mind, to <hi>consider</hi> the Nature of an Action when it <hi>occurs,</hi> and <hi>reflect</hi> upon an Error when it's <hi>past</hi> and hath <hi>escap'd</hi> him? I can consider a Temptation when it's <hi>approaching</hi> me, and with a Thought or two of Heaven or Hell <hi>arm</hi> my Resolution against it in the twinkling of an eye; I can look up to Heaven with an eye of earnest <hi>Expectance,</hi> and send my Soul thither in a short <hi>Ejaculation</hi> without interrupting my Business; and yet <hi>these,</hi> and such as these, do make up a great Part of those religious Exercises wherein the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Duty of our Christian Warfare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists. And though to the due performance of these Duties, it will be sometimes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that our Minds should dwell <hi>longer</hi>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:106959:225"/>
upon them, yet it is to be considered that when once we are <hi>entered</hi> upon the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them, our Mind will be much more at <hi>Leisure</hi> to attend to them; for then 'twill be in a great measure taken off from its <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> Vagaries, from its <hi>sinful</hi> Designs and <hi>lewd</hi> Contrivances, from its <hi>Phantastick</hi> Complacencies in the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of Sin and <hi>anxious</hi> Reflections on the <hi>Guilt</hi> and Danger of it; and when all this Rubbish is thrown out of the Mind, there will be Room enough for good Thoughts to dwell in it, without <hi>interfering</hi> with any of our necessary <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Diversions.</hi> For would we but give these our <hi>religious</hi> Exercises <hi>as much</hi> Room in our Minds as we did <hi>heretofore</hi> freely allow to our <hi>Sins</hi>; they would ask no <hi>more,</hi> but leave us as much at <hi>Leisure</hi> for our other Affairs <hi>as ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confess there are some of these Duties that exact of us their <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>stated</hi> Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Time, such as our Morning <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> our Evening <hi>Examination</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> our religious Observation of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and our <hi>preparing</hi> for and <hi>receiving</hi> the Holy Sacrament; but all this may be very well spared without any <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> to any of our lawful Occasions. For what great matter of Time doth it ask for
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:106959:225"/>
a man to think over a few good Thoughts in the Morning, and <hi>fore-arm</hi> his Mind with them against the Temptations of the Day; to recommend himself to God in a <hi>short, pithy</hi> and <hi>affectionate</hi> Prayer, and <hi>repeat</hi> his Purpose and Resolution of Obedience; what an easie matter were it for you to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row so many Moments as would suffice for <hi>this</hi> Purpose from your <hi>Bed</hi> and your <hi>Comb</hi> and <hi>Looking-glass</hi>? And as for the Evening, when your Business is over, it's a very hard case if you cannot spare so much time either from your Company or Refreshments as to make a short <hi>Review</hi> of the Actions of the Day; to <hi>confess</hi> and beg <hi>Pardon</hi> for the <hi>Evils</hi> you have faln into, or to <hi>bless</hi> God for the <hi>Good</hi> you have <hi>done,</hi> and the <hi>Evils</hi> you have <hi>avoided</hi>; and then to recommend your selves to his Grace and Protection for the future. And as for your religious Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> it is only the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> Part of your Time; and can you think much to devote <hi>that,</hi> or at least the <hi>greatest</hi> Part of that, to him who gives you your <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Duration</hi>? And lastly, as for your receiving the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> 'tis at most but <hi>once</hi> a Month that you are <hi>invited</hi> to it, and 'tis a hard Case, if out of so great a proportion of Time you cannot afford a <hi>few</hi> Hours to <hi>examine</hi> your <hi>Defects</hi> and to
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:106959:226"/>
                     <hi>quicken</hi> your <hi>Graces,</hi> and to <hi>dress</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Pare</hi> your selves for that blessed Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Alass! how <hi>easie</hi> were all this to a <hi>willing</hi> Mind? and if we had but <hi>half</hi> that Concern for our Souls and everlasting Interest that we have for our Bodies, we should count such things as these not <hi>worth</hi> our mentioning. How <hi>disingenuous</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it for men to make such <hi>tragical</hi> Out-cries as they do of the <hi>Hardship</hi> and <hi>Difficulty</hi> of this spiritual Warfare, when there is nothing at all in it that <hi>intrenches</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on their <hi>secular</hi> Callings or <hi>necessary</hi> Diversions; when they may be going <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> to Heaven while they are doing their <hi>Business,</hi> and <hi>mortifying</hi> their Lusts even in the Enjoyment of their <hi>Recreations,</hi> and so take their Pleasure both <hi>here</hi> and <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. CONSIDER that the Difficulty of these Duties is such, as will certainly <hi>abate</hi> and <hi>wear off</hi> by Degrees, if we <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly</hi> practise them. For in all Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings whatsoever, it is <hi>Vse</hi> that makes <hi>Perfectness,</hi> and that which is exceeding <hi>hard</hi> to us at <hi>first,</hi> either through want of <hi>Skill</hi> to manage, or <hi>Inclination</hi> to practise it, will by degrees grow <hi>easier</hi> and <hi>easier,</hi> as we are more and more <hi>accustomed</hi> and <hi>familiarized</hi> to it. And this we shall find

by Experience, if we constantly exercise our selves in these <hi>progressive</hi> Duties of our Religion, which to a Mind that hath <hi>been</hi> altogether <hi>unacquainted</hi> with them, will at <hi>first</hi> be very difficult. 'Twill go against the grain of a <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>ungoverned</hi> Nature, to be confined from its <hi>extravagant</hi> Ranges by the <hi>strict</hi> Ties of a religious <hi>Discipline</hi>; and to reduce a <hi>roving</hi> Mind to severe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, or a <hi>fickle</hi> one to Constancy and Resolution, or an <hi>unreflecting</hi> one to Self-examination; to raise up an <hi>earthly</hi> Mind to <hi>heavenly</hi> Thoughts and Expectations; and confine a <hi>listless</hi> and <hi>regardless</hi> one to strict Watchfulness and Circumspection; to confine a <hi>carnal</hi> mind to <hi>frequent</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or an <hi>indevout</hi> and careless one to its <hi>daily</hi> and <hi>weekly</hi> periods of Devotion, will at the first no doubt be very <hi>painful</hi> and <hi>tedious</hi>; but after we have <hi>persisted</hi> in and for a while <hi>accustomed</hi> our selves to it, we shall find it will quickly grow more <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to us, and from being <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> it will become <hi>tolerable,</hi> from being tolerable <hi>easie,</hi> and from being easie <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</hi> For when once we come to feel the good Effects of those Duties in our Natures, how fast our Lusts do <hi>decline,</hi> our Dispositions <hi>mend</hi> and all our Graces <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi> in the Use of them, the Sense of this
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:106959:227"/>
will mightily <hi>indear</hi> and <hi>ingratiate</hi> them to us. Just as it is with a <hi>Scholar,</hi> when he first <hi>enters</hi> upon the Methods of <hi>Learning,</hi> they are very <hi>tedious</hi> and <hi>irksome</hi> to him; the Pains of <hi>reading, observing</hi> and <hi>recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting,</hi> the <hi>Confinement</hi> to a Study and the <hi>racking</hi> his Brains with severe <hi>Reasoning</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> are things that he cannot easily away with, till he hath been <hi>inured</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed</hi> to them a while, and then they grow more <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to him; but when he comes to be sensible of the great <hi>Advantages</hi> he reaps by his Labour, how it <hi>raises</hi> and <hi>improves</hi> his Understanding, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges</hi> its prospect and <hi>furnishes</hi> its Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>brave</hi> and <hi>useful.</hi> Notions; then do his Labours which were formerly so <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> become not only <hi>easie</hi> but <hi>delectable</hi> to him. And even so it is with these <hi>spiritual</hi> Exercises of Religion, which to <hi>unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> persons that are yet but newly enter'd upon them will be very <hi>painful</hi> and <hi>trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi>; but if they have but <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> to hold on, Custom will quickly render them more <hi>tolerable,</hi> and when they have practised them so long as to find and perceive the blessed Effects of them, how much they have contributed to the <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their Tempers, <hi>reducing</hi> their Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>filing</hi> and <hi>polishing</hi> their rough and

mishapen Natures; with what <hi>amiable</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>godlike</hi> Dispositions they have <hi>adorned</hi> and <hi>beautified</hi> them; their Sense and Feeling of <hi>this</hi> will convert them all into <hi>delightful</hi> Recreations. Thus as the Custom of them will render them <hi>easie,</hi> so the blessed Fruits of them will make them <hi>delectable</hi>; the former will render them <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> as Nature, the later <hi>eligible</hi> as Reward. And if so, why should we be discouraged, faint-hearted Creatures that we are, at those little <hi>present</hi> Difficulties, which our Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will soon <hi>wear off</hi> and convert into <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Pleasure?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. CONSIDER that with the <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> of them, there is a world of present <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> intermingled. If you <hi>fall back</hi> again to your old Lusts, instead of these <hi>present</hi> Difficulties you <hi>start</hi> at, you must expect to have the <hi>Trouble</hi> of a guilty Soul to contend with; which, if you have any sense of God and of Good and Evil, will be much more <hi>grievous</hi> to you than they. But if you <hi>go on,</hi> you will carry with you a <hi>quiet</hi> and a <hi>satisfied</hi> Mind, a Conscience that will entertain you all along with such <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>calm</hi> Reflections as will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>compensate</hi> you for all the Hardships and Difficulties you encounter on the way; that with innumerable Iterations will be always
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:106959:228"/>
                     <hi>resounding</hi> to your <hi>honest</hi> Endeavours those <hi>best</hi> and <hi>sweetest</hi> Ecchoes, <hi>Well done good and profitable servant,</hi> how <hi>bravely</hi> hast thou acquitted thy self, how <hi>manfully</hi> hast thou stood to thy Duty against all Oppositions, and with what a <hi>Gallant</hi> Resolution hast thou <hi>repulsed</hi> those Temptations that bore up against thee? Now for a man to have his own Mind continually <hi>applauding</hi> him and <hi>crowning</hi> his Actions with the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Conscience, is Encouragement enough to <hi>ballance</hi> a thousand Difficulties; and the Sense that he hath done his Duty, and that the God <hi>above,</hi> and the Vice-god <hi>within</hi> him, are both <hi>satisfied</hi> and <hi>pleased</hi> with him, will give him such a <hi>grateful</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of each Action of his Warfare, that the <hi>Difficulty</hi> will only serve to inhance the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>AND as he will have great <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> whilst he is <hi>contending</hi> with these Difficulties, so when he hath so far <hi>conquered</hi> them as that they are no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>curb</hi> and <hi>with-hold</hi> him from the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Exercise of the heavenly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but in despight of them he can easily <hi>moderate</hi> his Passions and Appetites by the Laws of his Reason, and freely <hi>love, adore</hi> and <hi>imitate, submit</hi> to and <hi>confide</hi> in the ever blessed God, and chearfully exert an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:106959:228"/>
                     <hi>Plainess</hi> and <hi>Simplicity, Good-will</hi> and <hi>Charity, Submission</hi> and <hi>Condescension, Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> towards all men; when, I say, he hath so far <hi>surmounted</hi> the Difficulties of his Warfare, as that with any Measure of Freedom and Vigor he can put forth all these heavenly Vertues, he will find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not only in a <hi>quiet,</hi> but in a <hi>heavenly</hi> Condition. For these heavenly Graces are the <hi>Palat</hi> by which the immortal Mind <hi>tasts</hi> and <hi>relishes</hi> its Heaven, the blessed <hi>Organs</hi> and <hi>Sensories</hi> by which it <hi>feels</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives</hi> the Joys of the World to come, and without which it can no more <hi>relish</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi> them, than the senseless Hive can the sweetness of the Honey that is in it. And consequently the more <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>vivacious</hi> these heavenly Organs of the Mind are, and the more they are disburthened of those <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Lusts that <hi>blunt</hi> their Sense and Perception, the more <hi>accurately</hi> they will, <hi>taste</hi> the Joys and Pleasures of Heaven. So that when by the constant Practice of the <hi>warfaring</hi> Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we have <hi>conquered</hi> those bad Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Natures, which render the heavenly Vertues so <hi>difficult</hi> to us, and do so <hi>clog</hi> and <hi>incumber</hi> us in the Exercise of them, we shall find our selves in a <hi>Heaven</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and each Act of Vertue will
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:106959:229"/>
be <hi>Presention</hi> and <hi>Foretast</hi> of the Joys of a celestial Life. And being arrived at this blessed State in which all heavenly Vertue is so <hi>connaturalized</hi> to us, the sweet Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we shall have of the <hi>unspeakable</hi> Joys and Pleasures it abounds with, will cause us to look back with wondrous <hi>Content</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> upon all those Difficulties we <hi>contended</hi> with in our Way to it, and bless those <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears,</hi> and <hi>Strivings</hi> with our selves, those tedious <hi>Watchings</hi> and <hi>Self-exáminations,</hi> &amp;c. by which we have now at last <hi>conquered</hi> and <hi>subdued</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE since the Practice of these our <hi>warfaring</hi> Duties hath so much <hi>present</hi> Peace going along with it, and since by its natural Drift and Tendency it's lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us <hi>forward</hi> to a State of so much <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> what a Madness is it, for a man to be beaten off from it, by those present <hi>little</hi> Difficulties that attend it! What man that consults his own Interest would ever desist from the prosecuting such a <hi>gainful</hi> Warfare, in which to make him amends for the present Pains it puts him to, he is not only possest of <hi>Peace</hi> of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the <hi>present,</hi> but assured of a happy Life for the <hi>future,</hi> when he hath <hi>conquered</hi> the Difficulties he <hi>contends</hi> with.</p>

                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:106959:229"/>VIII. CONSIDER that the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of these Duties is abundantly <hi>compensated</hi> by the <hi>Reward</hi> of them. A generous Mind will think no <hi>Means</hi> too hard which tend to noble and worthy <hi>Ends</hi>; in the prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which <hi>Opposition</hi> only whets its <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> and <hi>Resolution.</hi> So that doubtless had we any Spark of Generosity in us, the Vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Excellency of the <hi>End</hi> we pursue, would make us despise all Difficulties in the <hi>Way</hi> to it. What a <hi>Meanness</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth it argue in us to stand <hi>boggling,</hi> as we do, at the Difficulties of Religion; to think much of spending a few <hi>Days</hi> or <hi>Years</hi> in this World in <hi>striving</hi> and <hi>contending</hi> with our Inclinations, in <hi>Consideration</hi> and <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> in earnest <hi>Prayer</hi> and severe <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> on our selves, when we are assured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand that at the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of this short <hi>Conflict</hi> we shall be carried off by Angels in Triumph to Heaven, and there receive from the Captain of our Salvation a Crown of everlasting Joys and Pleasures; when after a few <hi>Moments</hi> Pains and Labour, we shall live <hi>Millions</hi> of <hi>Millions</hi> of most happy Ages in the ravishing Fruition of a boundless Good, and after these are expired have as many Millions of Millions more to live. What an unconscionable thing is it for us to complain of any <hi>Difficulty,</hi> who have such
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:106959:230"/>
a vast Recompence of Reward in our <hi>View?</hi> In the name of God, Sirs, what would you have? Why we would have Heaven drop down into our Mouths, and not put us to all this Trouble of <hi>reaching</hi> and <hi>climbing</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. Would you so? 'tis a very <hi>modest</hi> Desire indeed; that is, you would have the God of Heaven <hi>thrust</hi> his Favours upon you while you <hi>scorn</hi> and <hi>despise</hi> them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute his Heaven to a company of <hi>Drones</hi> that don't think it worth their while to go out of their Hives to gather it. O! for Shame look once more upon <hi>Heaven,</hi> and consider again what it is to dwell in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise of the World with God and Angels and Saints, and in their blessed Company to live out an Eternity in the most rapturous <hi>Contemplations</hi> and <hi>Loves</hi> and <hi>Joys</hi>; to <hi>bath</hi> our dilated Faculties in an everflowing <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> of Pleasures, and in perfect <hi>Ease, Health</hi> and <hi>Vigor</hi> of Mind to feed upon a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that is as <hi>large</hi> as our Capacities and as <hi>lasting</hi> as our Beings. Is this a Reward of that <hi>inconsiderable</hi> nature, that we should think much to <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>contend</hi> for it; is not the Hope of being <hi>satisfied for ever,</hi> a sufficient Encouragement to induce us to <hi>deny</hi> our Lusts and Appetites a <hi>few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> or is there not good enough in an everlasting <hi>Rest,</hi> to countervail a few Days

and Years <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Contention?</hi> What though you <hi>pant</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> now while you are <hi>climbing</hi> the everlasting Hills, God be praised 'tis not so far to the Top but that the pleasant <hi>Gales</hi> and glorious <hi>Prospects</hi> you shall everlastingly enjoy there, will so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly <hi>compensate</hi> for the Difficulty of the <hi>Ascent,</hi> that instead of <hi>complaining</hi> of it you will to eternal Ages reflect upon it with <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi> Wherefore when your Courage begins to <hi>shrink</hi> at the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of your Warfare, do but lift up your Eyes to the Recompence of <hi>Reward,</hi> and to be sure, if you have any Heart, that will inspire you with such a brave Resolution, as nothing will be too <hi>hard</hi> for but what is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>impossible.</hi> For how can we be <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned</hi> at any <hi>superable</hi> Difficulty, so long as we are <hi>animated</hi> with this persuasion, that if we have our <hi>Fruit unto holiness, our End shall be everlasting Life?</hi>

                  <p>AND as through an over-weening <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> of our own Strength we <hi>expose</hi> our selves to many needless Temptations, so
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:106959:233"/>
we do also too often provoke God to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi> his Grace and Assistance from us, and to leave us to contend <hi>alone</hi> with those Temptations whereunto we do so <hi>confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> expose our selves. For as he is always ready to <hi>assist</hi> us, so he always expects that we should acknowledge our <hi>Need</hi> of, and <hi>Dependence</hi> upon him, and not presume too much upon our <hi>own</hi> Strength, which without his gracious <hi>Concurrence,</hi> is <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Impotence.</hi> When therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods <hi>Call</hi> and <hi>Warrant</hi> we will needs <hi>rush</hi> into Temptations in Confidence of our own <hi>Ability</hi> to resist and conquer them, he many times leaves us without his <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Assistance,</hi> that so he may chastise our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi> by permitting us to be <hi>defeated,</hi> and convince us by the woful Experiment of our <hi>Fall,</hi> how <hi>unable</hi> we are to stand without his Aid and Support. It is our daily Prayer that God would <hi>not lead us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Temptation</hi>; but if for our Tryal he thinks meet to do so, we have all Assurance that if we be not wanting to our selves, <hi>he will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that we may be able to bear it,</hi> Cor. i.10.13. But if we will lead <hi>our selves</hi> into Temptation, in Confidence of our own Ability to <hi>contend</hi> with and <hi>break</hi>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:106959:234"/>
through it, God is so far from being obliged to <hi>second</hi> us in our <hi>Folly</hi> and unwarrantable <hi>Rashness,</hi> that he is justly <hi>provoked</hi> by it to <hi>abandon</hi> us to our selves, and, as a certain Consequence of that, to permit us to be <hi>vanquisht</hi> and <hi>led captive.</hi> Wherefore as we hope to persevere to the <hi>End</hi> and to bring our Warfare to a happy <hi>Conclusion,</hi> it is highly necessary that we should always keep a <hi>jealous</hi> Eye upon our selves, and not <hi>confide</hi> too much in our own Strength and Ability.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. TO our <hi>final</hi> Perseverance in the Christian Warfare, it is also necessary that if at any time we wilfully <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>miscarry</hi> in it, we should <hi>immediatly arise</hi> again by Repentance. For what is forbidden us as to <hi>one</hi> Sin, equally extends to <hi>all, let not the sun go down upon your wrath,</hi> Eph. iv.26. that is, if you have <hi>wilfully</hi> given the Reins to your Wrath, suffer it not to break forth into <hi>contumelious</hi> Behaviour, but repent of it <hi>immediatly,</hi> before the Sun sets; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that old Practice of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who when at any time they fell into <hi>reproachful</hi> Language out of Anger, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> i. e. before ever the Sun set they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways took care to be <hi>reconciled,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:106959:234"/>
                     <hi>shook hands</hi> with and <hi>embraced</hi> one another; and the reason of the Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which you have in the next verse, <hi>viz. neither give place to the Devil,</hi> that is, by suffering your <hi>Wrath</hi> to grow into invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Malice,</hi> equally extends to all <hi>other</hi> Sins, which if they be not <hi>immediatly</hi> root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by Repentance, will quickly <hi>improve</hi> into Habits. So that we have as much reason to repent of our <hi>Lust</hi> before the Sun <hi>rises</hi> on it, and of our <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> before it hath <hi>run its course</hi> on it, as of our <hi>Wrath</hi> before it <hi>goes down</hi> upon it. And consequently, by a parity of Reason, the Prohibition must extend to all <hi>other</hi> Sins as well as <hi>this,</hi> and oblige us, when ever we have <hi>wilfully</hi> sin'd in any Particular, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi> and <hi>expiate</hi> it by an <hi>immediate</hi> Act of Repentance.</p>
                  <p>FOR he that hath <hi>sin'd</hi> wilfully and not <hi>repented</hi> of it, doth all the while conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue an obstinate <hi>Rebel</hi> against God, and is so far from <hi>persevering</hi> in the <hi>Christian</hi> Warfare, that he is actually listed a <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> in the <hi>adverse</hi> Party. And if after we have <hi>thus</hi> sin'd, Death should <hi>interpose</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and our Repentance, (as who knows but it may if we repent not <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi>) we shall be so far from <hi>consummating</hi> our Christian Warfare in <hi>Victory,</hi> that we
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:106959:235"/>
shall die <hi>Vassals</hi> to the Devil. But then as by sinning <hi>wilfully</hi> we do <hi>desert</hi> God, so by continuing <hi>impenitent</hi> under it we still run <hi>farther</hi> and <hi>farther</hi> from him, and thereby make so <hi>wide</hi> a Gap and Interruption in our religious Progress, as will not be easily <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired</hi> again; and whereas had we <hi>repented</hi> and <hi>come back</hi> without <hi>Delay</hi> as soon as we had <hi>strayed</hi> from our Duty, we might have soon <hi>recovered</hi> the Ground we had lost by it, and by a little more Diligence have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as far <hi>onward</hi> as if we had never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted our Progress at all; by <hi>deferring</hi> our Repentance we set our selves farther and farther <hi>back</hi> and shall every day be more and more <hi>indisposed</hi> to return. For in the Course of our Religion there is no <hi>standing still,</hi> but either we are <hi>progressive</hi> or <hi>retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi> going <hi>backward</hi> or <hi>forward</hi> as long as we live; so that when once we are <hi>out</hi> of our Way, we are still going <hi>farther</hi> out, till such time as we <hi>return</hi> again; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>longer</hi> we are out, the <hi>harder</hi> 'twill be to return, and the <hi>farther</hi> we shall have to the end of our Way. For when I <hi>first</hi> sin, and the Wound of my Innocence is yet <hi>green</hi> &amp; <hi>fresh,</hi> it may easily be cured by the timely Application of a sorrowful <hi>Confession</hi> and new <hi>Resolution</hi> of Amendment; but if I neglect it, 'twill <hi>rot</hi> and <hi>putrifie,</hi> my <hi>Sense</hi>
                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:106959:235"/>
of it will be <hi>hardned,</hi> and my <hi>Inclination</hi> to it grow every day more <hi>inveterate,</hi> and then if it be not <hi>lanc'd</hi> and <hi>corroded</hi> by a <hi>sharp,</hi> a <hi>long</hi> and a <hi>painful</hi> Repentance, it will turn into an incureable <hi>Gangrene.</hi> Hence the Apostle bids us <hi>exhort one another dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while it is called to day,</hi> that is, to <hi>repent</hi> while it is called to day, <hi>lest any of us be hardned through the deceitfulness of sin,</hi> Heb. iii.13. So that when we have <hi>wilfully</hi> sin'd, we run a mighty Hazard of our <hi>final</hi> perseverance, if we don't repent <hi>immediatly.</hi> For all the while we <hi>delay,</hi> our Conscience grows more <hi>sear'd,</hi> and our Lust grows more <hi>confirm'd,</hi> and God knows where it will end, but 'tis fearfully to be <hi>suspected</hi> that <hi>that</hi> neglected Bruise which we got by our Fall will grow <hi>worse</hi> and <hi>worse,</hi> and <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> at last in final <hi>Impenitency.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we intend to <hi>persevere</hi> in wel-doing, it concerns us in the <hi>first</hi> place to take all possible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Care not to give way to any <hi>wilful</hi> Sin, nor suffer our selves by any Hopes or Fears to be tempted from our good <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; but if at any time our wicked Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should prevail against it, to betake our selves <hi>immediately</hi> to a serious Repentance, to make a sorrowful <hi>Confession</hi> of it to our offended God, and solemnly renew our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi> against it, that so we may stop the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:106959:236"/>
growing evil <hi>betime,</hi> before it's capable of indangering our <hi>final</hi> Apostacy.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. TO our final <hi>perseverance,</hi> it's necessary that to <hi>prevent</hi> the like Falls and Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages for the <hi>future,</hi> we should indeavour to <hi>withdraw</hi> our Affections from the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, but more especially from <hi>those</hi> Temptations which were the <hi>Occasions</hi> of our Fall. For thus we are strictly prohibited <hi>to set our affections upon things on the earth,</hi> Col. iii.21. <hi>to love the World and the things that are in the World,</hi> Joh. i, ii.15. <hi>to lay up for our selves treasures upon earth,</hi> Mat. vi.19. and 'tis the proper Character of a true Christian <hi>to be crucified to the World,</hi> Gal. vi.14. and to converse <hi>as a Stranger and a Pilgrim in it,</hi> Heb. xi.13. As on the contrary, <hi>to mind earthly things, and to be lovers of pleasures more than lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of God,</hi> are made the proper Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Infidels and Apostates, Phil. iii.19. compared with Tim. ii. 3.4. And so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent is an inordinate Affection to the World with our <hi>perseverance</hi> in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Warfare, that St. <hi>James</hi> expresly tells us, <hi>that the friendship of the World is enmity with God,</hi> Jam. iv.4. and 'tis to the Excess of our friendship to it that the Scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attributes our Apostacy, <hi>Tim.</hi> ii.4.10. and the Apostle tells us, <hi>that they
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:106959:236"/>
that will be rich,</hi> that is, immoderately covet to be so, <hi>fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in perdition and destruction; and that the love of money is the root of all evil,</hi> 1 Tim. vi.9, 10. From all which it's appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, how necessary it is, in the accounts of Christianity, in order to our <hi>perseverance,</hi> that we should indeavour to <hi>wean</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract</hi> our selves from the World.</p>
                  <p>FOR this world is the <hi>Magazine</hi> of all those Temptations by which our Vertue and Innocence is <hi>importuned</hi> and <hi>assaulted</hi>; and 'tis either the <hi>Hope</hi> of some worldly <hi>Pleasure, Profit</hi> or <hi>Honour</hi> that <hi>allures,</hi> or the <hi>Fear</hi> of some of the contrary Evils which are incident to us in the Course of Religion that <hi>affrights</hi> us from our Duty. Whilst therefore we <hi>immoderately</hi> love those Goods and Evils which are the <hi>Solicitours</hi> of Vice, we are in very great danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>conquered</hi> and <hi>led captive</hi> by it. For 'tis not for the sake of <hi>sinning</hi> that men sin, but for the sake of those <hi>Goods,</hi> or to avoid those <hi>Evils</hi> which are appendent to their <hi>sinning</hi> or <hi>not sinning</hi>; and consequently, the more a man <hi>loves</hi> those <hi>Goods</hi> which cling and adhere to a sinful Action, the more propense he will be to the Commission of it; and the more he <hi>dreads</hi> those <hi>Evils</hi> which
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:106959:237"/>
he can most easily avoid by a sinful Action, the more prone and inclinable he will be to it. Wherefore to secure our <hi>perseverance</hi> in this Warfare against sin, it is absolutely necessary that we <hi>rectifie</hi> our <hi>Opinion</hi> of the Goods and Evils of this World, and <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> and <hi>abate</hi> our <hi>Affection</hi> towards them, especially towards <hi>those</hi> that have been most <hi>prevalent</hi> with us. For the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that prevails upon us <hi>discovers</hi> the <hi>weak</hi> Side of our Nature, and <hi>instructs</hi> the Devil what Good or Evil it is that is most apt to <hi>allure</hi> or <hi>affright</hi> us; and to be sure that <hi>subtil</hi> Tempter, who hath been so many thousand Years <hi>studying</hi> the Arts of <hi>sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> us, will not fail to assault us <hi>again</hi> where he hath been already <hi>successful</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns us to <hi>fortifie</hi> our selves there where we have so much reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Enemy will <hi>assault</hi> us, and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie</hi> our <hi>Opinions</hi> of and <hi>mortifie</hi> our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to those things which have already so much <hi>imposed</hi> upon our Virtue and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. For 'tis our <hi>Imagination</hi> that gives <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> to the <hi>Charms</hi> and <hi>Terrors</hi> of the World, and renders them so successful against us; we <hi>fancy</hi> that to be in them which is not, and so are <hi>affected</hi> not so much with the things <hi>themselves</hi> as with the false <hi>Representations</hi> we make of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="427" facs="tcp:106959:237"/>FOR it's plain the <hi>Goods</hi> of the World are beholden to <hi>our selves</hi> for the greatest part of those <hi>Beauties</hi> with which they <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>allure</hi> us; and 'tis our <hi>Fancy</hi> that gives the <hi>Paint</hi> and <hi>Fucus</hi> with which they <hi>charm</hi> and <hi>inamour</hi> our Affections; and so for the <hi>Evils</hi> of the World, 'tis our own <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> that <hi>disguises</hi> them into such <hi>Bugs</hi> and <hi>Scare-crowes,</hi> and puts those gastly <hi>Vizors</hi> on them with which they <hi>fright</hi> and <hi>amaze</hi> us. If therefore we would but take care to <hi>rectifie</hi> our <hi>Opinions</hi> of them both, and to strip them out of their <hi>imaginary</hi> Terrors and Allurements, we should thereby <hi>disarm</hi> them of their main Strength, and render them much less able to seduce us for the <hi>future.</hi> And this methinks we might easily do, if we would but fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to our selves the present <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Posture</hi> of our Affairs. For we are a sort of Beings, that are every Moment travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from <hi>hence</hi> to an <hi>eternal</hi> World, where an <hi>unexpressible</hi> Happiness or Misery attends us; and all that we <hi>enjoy</hi> or <hi>suffer</hi> in this Life, is only the <hi>Convenience</hi> or <hi>Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of a <hi>short</hi> Journey to a <hi>long</hi> Home, but can have no other Influence upon our <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi> Condition, than as it is the Occasion either of our <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Vice,</hi> which are the only <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> that will accompany
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:106959:238"/>
us to Eternity, and make us <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> there for ever. But as for <hi>Poverty</hi> or <hi>Riches, Pain</hi> or <hi>Pleasure, Disgrace</hi> or <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> they are things which probably with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these ten or twenty Years will be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>indifferent</hi> to us as our last Nights <hi>Dream</hi> was when we awoke in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And this, methinks, duly <hi>consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> were enough to render us very <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned</hi> at any <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> that can happen to us here. For what a mighty Matter is it whether I fare <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> for twenty or thirty Years, who when that is expired must be <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>miserable</hi> for Millions of Millions of Ages; and what will these <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> Goods or Evils signifie to me, when my <hi>Body</hi> is in the Grave, and my <hi>Soul</hi> in Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? When I am <hi>stript</hi> into a naked Spirit, and set <hi>ashore</hi> upon the invisible World, then all these things will <hi>be</hi> as if they never <hi>were,</hi> and in the twinkling of an Eye I shall <hi>lose</hi> Sight of them for ever; and of all that I <hi>enjoyed</hi> or <hi>suffered</hi> in this Life I shall have nothing remaining but my <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Vice,</hi> whose Issues will prove my eternal <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> or <hi>Misery.</hi> Doubtless would we but accustom our Minds to such Reflections as these, they would effectually <hi>restrain</hi> us from the immoderate <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Fear</hi> of the things of this World, and reduce us to a
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:106959:238"/>
                     <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>efficacious</hi> Persuasion, that there is no <hi>Good</hi> in this World <hi>comparable</hi> to that of doing our <hi>Duty,</hi> nor any <hi>Evil</hi> incident to us in this Life that is not infinitely less <hi>formidable</hi> than <hi>Sin.</hi> And when once our <hi>Affection</hi> to this World, and our <hi>Opinion</hi> of the Goods and Evils of it, are thus <hi>modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>rectified,</hi> the Temptations to Sin will quite <hi>lose</hi> their <hi>hold</hi> of us, and be no more able to <hi>fasten</hi> upon our Resolution. So that now we may pass safely through them whilst they are <hi>sparkling</hi> about us, there being no <hi>Tinder</hi> in our Breasts for them to <hi>catch fire</hi> and <hi>kindle</hi> upon. Now they will be no longer capable to <hi>allure</hi> or <hi>affright</hi> us, those bosom Orators being <hi>silenced</hi> that were wont to <hi>contend</hi> for them, and to <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie</hi> their <hi>Charms</hi> and <hi>Terrors</hi>; and when we neither immoderately <hi>love</hi> nor <hi>fear</hi> them, 'twill be no hard matter to <hi>defend</hi> our Virtue and Innocence against all their <hi>Assaults</hi> and <hi>Importunities.</hi>

                  <p n="4">IV. TO our <hi>final</hi> Perseverance, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that we should more <hi>curiously</hi> search into the <hi>smaller</hi> Defects and Indecencies of our Nature in order to our <hi>reforming</hi> and <hi>correcting</hi> them. Hence we are commanded <hi>to hate even the garments spotted by the flesh,</hi> Jude 23. i. e. to take care of the <hi>Beginnings</hi> of Sin, of any thing that hath

the least <hi>Spot</hi> or <hi>Infection</hi> of it; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we are obliged not only to take care to <hi>rub out</hi> the greater <hi>Stains</hi> of our Nature, but <hi>to be diligent that we may be found of our Lord in peace without spot and blameless,</hi> 2 Pet. iii.14. i. e. to indeavour to reform those <hi>smaller</hi> and more <hi>indiscernable</hi> Defects of our Nature, which though they do not totally <hi>stain,</hi> yet very much <hi>spot</hi> and <hi>blemish</hi> it; that so at the coming of our Lord we may be found not only <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>upright,</hi> but, as near as may be, <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>blameless.</hi> For so, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii.15. we are bid <hi>to be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, harmless, and without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, i. e.</hi> to endeavour so to demean our selves in this World as that we may appear not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honest <hi>for the main,</hi> but, so near as is possible, <hi>spotless</hi> and <hi>unreproveable.</hi> And indeed there is nothing doth more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occasion mens <hi>final</hi> Miscarriage in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than their not being <hi>careful</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> in this matter. When they first enter into the Christian Warfare, they very industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously set themselves against that Course of wilful Sin in which they formerly lived, and this were wondrous well, if they did not <hi>stop</hi> here and go no <hi>farther</hi>; but alas, in the mean time, while they are thus industriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly busied in subduing their <hi>old</hi> Sins, there
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:106959:239"/>
are a great many lesser <hi>Flaws</hi> and <hi>Defects</hi> in their Nature. which by a <hi>timely</hi> Care and Inspection they might easily correct; but these they take no Notice of, but quietly permit them to <hi>grow</hi> and <hi>increase,</hi> till at last they become as <hi>hurtful</hi> &amp; <hi>dangerous</hi> to them as their old Sins were, against which they have all this while so zealously contended. As for Instance, when they first entered upon a Resolution of Amendment, they were <hi>profane</hi> it may be, or <hi>sensual,</hi> or vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adicted to <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Oppression</hi>; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these they opposed themselves with great <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Animosity</hi>; and so far they did <hi>well,</hi> but in the mean time perhaps there was <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ostentation, Envy</hi> and <hi>Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness, Self-will</hi> and <hi>Censoriousness</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly <hi>budding</hi> and <hi>sprouting</hi> up in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, all which they might have easily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>timely</hi> Applications; but alas! in the Heat of their Contest against their <hi>other</hi> Sins, they never so much as minded or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded <hi>these,</hi> but e'en left them alone till they <hi>grew up</hi> into obstinate and inveterate Habits, and became every whit as <hi>fatal</hi> and <hi>destructive</hi> to their Souls as <hi>those</hi> were which they have been all this while <hi>subduing</hi> and <hi>mortifying.</hi> So that after all they have only <hi>changed</hi> their Sins, and have been <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring up</hi> one Devil while they have been
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:106959:240"/>

Perhaps whilst you are zealously carrying on your Warfare against your old Sins, you may find your selves too apt to be <hi>tickled</hi> with Applause, and <hi>puff'd</hi> with vain Ostentation; have a Care now, that while you are <hi>starving</hi> one Vice, you do not <hi>pamper</hi> another. For if you do not correct this <hi>little</hi> Irregularity of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>betimes,</hi> 'twill soon be as <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>mischievous</hi> to you, as ever any of those Vices were against which you are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 'twill by degrees so <hi>insinuate</hi> into your good Intentions, and so <hi>sophisticate</hi> the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of them, that at last you will <hi>intend</hi> nothing else but <hi>Applause</hi>; and so your whole Religion will be converted into dead <hi>Shew</hi> and empty <hi>Pageantry,</hi> and your spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Warfare will prove only a passage out of <hi>Profaneness</hi> into <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> It may be whilst you are contending against those <hi>flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Inclinations by which you have formerly been captivated, your Hearts will begin to <hi>swell</hi> with an <hi>over-weening</hi> Conceit of your own Vertue and Godliness, and as a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that to entertain <hi>contemptuous</hi> and <hi>censorious</hi> Thoughts of your Brethren;
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:106959:240"/>
beware now, that whilst you are <hi>struggling</hi> with your old fleshly Lusts, you do not <hi>overlook</hi> these little <hi>Defects</hi> and <hi>Indecencies</hi> of your Nature; lest while you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering <hi>one</hi> Sort of sins, you be captivated by <hi>another.</hi> For if you do not take care to <hi>nip</hi> them in their <hi>Buds,</hi> and to <hi>check</hi> these little <hi>Essays</hi> and <hi>Beginnings</hi> of them, they will soon <hi>spring up</hi> into Habits of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Insolence, Rancour</hi> and <hi>Vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness,</hi> and so your Warfare against Sin will be only a <hi>Transition</hi> from <hi>one</hi> Evil into <hi>another,</hi> from the Pollutions of the <hi>Flesh</hi> into the Pollutions of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and from the Nature of <hi>Beasts</hi> into the Nature of <hi>Devils.</hi> Wherefore if you would be <hi>final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> successful in the Christian Warfare, you must take great Care that while you are contending with the <hi>grosser</hi> and more <hi>inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate</hi> Vices of your Nature, you do not neglect its <hi>lesser</hi> Defects and Irregularities; for whilst they are <hi>lesser</hi> they may be <hi>easily</hi> corrected, but if they are not, they will soon grow <hi>greater,</hi> and in the End prove as <hi>dangerous</hi> as those you are now contending with. For every Vice is <hi>small</hi> in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and <hi>easie</hi> to be cured, but if it be <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,</hi> like a Scratch in the Flesh, it will <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>rancle</hi> into a spreading <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green.</hi>

                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:106959:241"/>V. TO our <hi>Perseverance</hi> to the End in this our Christian Warfare, it is also neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that, so far as <hi>lawfully</hi> we can, we should live in close <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> whereof we are Members. 'Tis true a particular Church may be so <hi>corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as that its Members may be obliged to <hi>disunite</hi> themselves from it. For every man is obliged by Vertue of his being in <hi>any</hi> Society, not to agree to any thing which tends to the apparent <hi>Ruine</hi> of it. Now the main End of <hi>Christian</hi> Society be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> every man that enters into it is thereby obliged in his own Station to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> this End; and consequently as to <hi>join</hi> in all Acts of the Christian Society he is <hi>united</hi> to, so far as they <hi>tend</hi> thereunto, so to <hi>refuse</hi> all <hi>such</hi> Acts of that Society, if any <hi>such</hi> should be injoyned, as do apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>oppose</hi> and are directly <hi>repugnant</hi> to it. So that if any Act that is apparently <hi>sinful,</hi> be injoyn'd by the particular Church whereof I am a Member, as a necessary Condition of my <hi>Communion</hi> with her, I am bound to <hi>abstain</hi> from it, for the sake of the <hi>General</hi> End of Christian Society. As for Instance, suppose the <hi>Church</hi> whereof I am a <hi>Member,</hi> require it as a Condition of my Communion, that I should transgress any
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:106959:241"/>
                     <hi>just</hi> Law of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> whereof I am a <hi>Subject</hi>; in this Case I am bound ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>desert</hi> that Churches Communion, than live in wilful <hi>Disobedience</hi> to the Civil Authority. And this is the Case of those men, who though they live in a Christian Commonwealth, have been <hi>Baptized</hi> into, and <hi>bred up</hi> in the Communion of <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Congregations that contrary to Law have <hi>separated</hi> themselves from the <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht, National</hi> Church; for if in this <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Church there be nothing imposed on them by the Laws of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> that is apparently contradictory to the Laws of <hi>Christ,</hi> they are bound in Conscience to <hi>desert</hi> those <hi>separate</hi> Congregations (allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be <hi>true</hi> Churches) and to <hi>join</hi> themselves with the Church <hi>National</hi>; and if they do not, they are wilful Offenders against the Law of Christ, which requires us to obey all humane Ordinances <hi>for the Lords sake.</hi> And again, supposing <hi>one</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church to be subject to <hi>another,</hi> that which is <hi>subject</hi> is bound to refuse the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that which is <hi>superior,</hi> if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not injoy it without complying with Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions that are apparently <hi>sinful.</hi> Which is evidently the Case between <hi>us</hi> and the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, supposing that <hi>de jure</hi> we were once her <hi>Subjects</hi> and <hi>Members</hi>; for
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:106959:242"/>
had we been so, we should doubtless never have <hi>separated</hi> our selves from her, could we but have separated her <hi>Sins</hi> from her Communion; could we have profest her <hi>Creed</hi> without <hi>implicitly</hi> believing all her Cheats and Impostures, or submitted our selves to her <hi>Guides</hi> without apparent Dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of being <hi>misled</hi> by them into the pit of Destruction, or joyn'd with her publick <hi>Services</hi> without <hi>worshipping</hi> of <hi>Creatures,</hi> or received her <hi>Sacraments</hi> without practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the grossest <hi>Superstitions</hi> and <hi>Idolatries.</hi> But when she had made it necessary for us either to <hi>sin with</hi> or <hi>separate from</hi> her, we could have no other <hi>honest</hi> Remedy but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>withdraw</hi>; and if in this our <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> there had been a sinful <hi>Schism</hi> on either side, we could have appealed to Heaven and Earth <hi>whose</hi> the Guilt of it was; <hi>theirs</hi> that forced us upon it, or <hi>ours</hi> that were forced to it. But yet the Case of <hi>our</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, is vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from that of the Separation of <hi>private</hi> Members from their own <hi>particular</hi> Churches. For we affirm that the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome is but a <hi>particular</hi> Church, whose <hi>Authority</hi> extends no farther than to its own <hi>native</hi> Members, and consequently hath no more Power to impose Laws of Communion upon <hi>us,</hi> than <hi>we</hi> have upon
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:106959:242"/>
                     <hi>her</hi>; our particular Church being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> from <hi>her,</hi> as <hi>she</hi> is from <hi>ours.</hi> So that though the Terms of Communion she imposes upon her own Members were all of them <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> yet do they no more <hi>oblige</hi> us as we are <hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> than the <hi>lawful</hi> Commands of the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> do, as we are <hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT the Case of <hi>private</hi> members, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>ours</hi> or any <hi>other</hi> particular Church, is vastly different. For if we will allow <hi>particular</hi> Churches to be so many <hi>formed Societies</hi> of Christians; (as we must do, or else degrade them into so many <hi>confused multitudes</hi>) we must necessarily allow them to have a just <hi>Authority</hi> (even as all <hi>other</hi> formed Societies have) over their own Members. And that they have so, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent not only from the Nature of the thing, but also from <hi>Scripture,</hi> where the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of particular Churches are said to be constituted by the Holy Ghost <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers</hi> of their particular Flocks, Acts xx.28. which word both in <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>prophane</hi> Writ denotes a <hi>ruling</hi> Power. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly these Overseers are elsewhere call'd <hi>ruling-Elders,</hi> Tim. i.5.17. and the Subjects and Members of their Churches
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:106959:243"/>
are required <hi>to obey them, as those that have the Rule over them,</hi> Heb. xiii.17. and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the Apostle exhorts them to <hi>know,</hi> i. e. <hi>submissively to own</hi> the Authority of those that were <hi>over them in the Lord,</hi> Thes. i.5.12. By all which it's evident, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>particular</hi> Churches are by <hi>divine Institution</hi> subjected to the <hi>Authority</hi> of their <hi>spiritual Governors,</hi> and obliged in <hi>all things</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> them, wherein they are not <hi>countermanded</hi> by Christ himself. So that though <hi>one</hi> particular Church may <hi>refuse</hi> the Impositions of <hi>another,</hi> and that not only as they are <hi>sinful,</hi> but as they are <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi> because the other hath no <hi>lawful Authority</hi> over it; yet is it by no means <hi>lawful</hi> for the Subjects of any <hi>particular</hi> Church to <hi>disobey</hi> their Church-Governors in any <hi>lawful</hi> matter; because being <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> to their <hi>Authority</hi> by Christ the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head of the <hi>Church-Catholick,</hi> they are obliged to submit to them as to his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes</hi> and <hi>Vicegerents</hi> in every thing which he hath not <hi>antecedently</hi> prohibited. And if rather than do so, they shall choose to <hi>revolt</hi> from the Communion of their Church, they are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> or, which is the same thing, they are <hi>Rebels</hi> to Christs Authority in that particular Church they Revolt from. For what <hi>Faction</hi> is in the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:106959:243"/>
                     <hi>State,</hi> that is <hi>Schism</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> viz. an <hi>unjust</hi> Opposition to Authority; the one to Christs <hi>civil</hi> Authority derived upon our <hi>Magistrates,</hi> the other to his <hi>spiritual</hi> Authority derived upon our <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Governors.</p>
                  <p>'TIS true in some Cases, as I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>withdrawing</hi> from the Communion of a Church may be so far from being a <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> against Christ, that it may be an Act of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to him. For where Christ who is my <hi>supreme</hi> Lord, and my <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Governors who are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>under him,</hi> command things that are directly <hi>inconsistent,</hi> I am doubtless bound to obey <hi>him</hi> rather than <hi>them</hi>; yea though their Commands are not inconsistent in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> yet if I am <hi>fully persuaded</hi> they are, it is all one to <hi>me.</hi> Fot when I do what I <hi>falsly</hi> believe Christ hath forbidden, I am in <hi>Will</hi> as much a <hi>Rebel</hi> against his Authority, as when I do what I <hi>truly</hi> believe he hath forbidden. And so by <hi>not complying</hi> with my spiritual Governors out of an <hi>innocent mispersuasion</hi> that what they command is <hi>unlawful,</hi> I do <hi>formally</hi> and in <hi>Will</hi> as much <hi>obey</hi> Christ in so doing, as if it were <hi>really</hi> unlawful. So that in short, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church whereof I am a Member do impose as the Conditions of my
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:106959:244"/>
Communion, things that are either unlawful <hi>in themselves,</hi> or that, after <hi>due Examination,</hi> I verily <hi>believe</hi> are unlawful, I am bound in Obedience to the Authority of Christ, rather to <hi>desert</hi> that Communion, than to <hi>comply</hi> with the Terms and Conditions of it.</p>
                  <p>BUT since to <hi>desert</hi> the Communion of a Church is a matter of <hi>vast</hi> Moment, (as I shall prove by and by) it ought not to be done without the greatest <hi>Caution</hi> and <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.</hi> For he that rejects <hi>sinful Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> without <hi>just</hi> Enquiry and <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Examination, is <hi>formally</hi> as much a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> i. e. he is as much a Rebel in <hi>Will</hi> to Christs spiritual Authority in his Church <hi>Delegates</hi> and <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> as he that <hi>rashly</hi> rejects <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>lawful ones.</hi> For had it been only the <hi>Sinfulness</hi> of the Condition that displeased him, he would have made Conscience before he presumed to <hi>reject</hi> it, <hi>duly</hi> to inform himself whether it were <hi>sinful</hi> or <hi>no</hi>; but by thus rejecting it <hi>at a venture,</hi> without a <hi>due</hi> Enquiry into the nature of it, he plainly shews that 'twas not so much the <hi>Sin</hi> that displeased him, as the <hi>Authority</hi> that imposed it; and that 'twas not his <hi>Conscience</hi> that took offence at it, but his <hi>Humour</hi>; and consequently, that he would have had the same <hi>Dislike</hi> of it,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:106959:244"/>
though it had been <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>innocent.</hi> For <hi>Conscience</hi> being an act of the <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> cannot be offended without <hi>Reason</hi> either <hi>real</hi> or <hi>apparent</hi>; and without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>due</hi> Enquiry into the Nature of the thing we are offended at, we can have no <hi>Reason</hi> that will either <hi>warrant</hi> or <hi>excuse</hi> our Offence.</p>
                  <p>NOW to a <hi>due</hi> Enquiry, it is necessary that we should <hi>impartially</hi> examin <hi>both sides</hi> of the Question; and that while we are doing so, we should keep <hi>both</hi> our Ears open to the Matter in Debate, and <hi>equally</hi> attend to what can be said <hi>for,</hi> as well as to what can be said <hi>against</hi> it; and then that upon a full hearing of <hi>both,</hi> we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin, as near as we can, on which side the <hi>Truth</hi> lies, without <hi>Favour</hi> or <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For he that enquires only what can be said <hi>against</hi> the Matter he is offended at, doth thereby give a plain Indication that he is resolved to be offended at it <hi>right or wrong</hi>; and that the End of his Enquiry is not so much to <hi>satisfie</hi> his <hi>Conscience,</hi> as to <hi>fortifie</hi> his unreasonable <hi>Prejudice.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before we do <hi>reject</hi> the Conditions of our Churches Communion as <hi>sinful,</hi> we are obliged under the Penalty of <hi>wilful Schism</hi> impartially to enquire what is to be said <hi>for</hi> as well as <hi>against</hi> them; and for this End to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:106959:245"/>
                     <hi>apply</hi> our selves to our Spiritual Governours and Pastors, and propose our <hi>Doubts</hi> to them, and attend to their <hi>Resolutions</hi> with an <hi>honest, teachable</hi> Mind that is willing to be informed; and where we are <hi>capable</hi> of judging, faithfully to peruse those <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> that make for the <hi>one</hi> side as well as the <hi>other.</hi> For unless we do thus, its plain that we are <hi>biassed</hi> by a factious Inclination, and that we have a <hi>great Mind</hi> to separate from the Churches Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if we were not <hi>prejudiced</hi> against her Authority by a <hi>schismatical</hi> Temper of Mind, we should be as forward at least to consult what <hi>may be</hi> said <hi>for</hi> her Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as what <hi>is</hi> said <hi>against</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>BUT then if the Matters she imposes are such as a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>illiterate</hi> Communicant cannot <hi>judg of,</hi> nor <hi>comprehend</hi> the Force of the Reasons that make for or against them, <hi>such</hi> Persons in <hi>such</hi> Cases are obliged humbly to <hi>acquiesce</hi> in the Churches Authority, and not <hi>blindly</hi> to separate from her they <hi>know not why.</hi> As for Instance, suppose the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imposed should be such a <hi>Form</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or such <hi>Modes</hi> of Discipline, or <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of Divine Worship as carry no such <hi>apparent</hi> Evil in them, or <hi>express</hi> Contradiction to any Command of our Saviour as to inable an <hi>illiterate</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:106959:245"/>
rationally to pronounce them <hi>unlawful,</hi> and whither they be <hi>unlawful</hi> or <hi>no</hi> is not to be determined perhaps without some Skill in the <hi>Original</hi> Languages and the <hi>critical</hi> Acceptations of Phrases, or Insight into <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical History</hi> or <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Nicities and Speculations; and 'tis by some of <hi>these</hi> that most of the Controversies between <hi>us</hi> and our <hi>dissenting Brethren</hi> are to be <hi>judg'd</hi> and <hi>decided.</hi> Now in such Matters as these, where he cannot judg for <hi>himself,</hi> what should an <hi>unlearned</hi> Communicant do? Why this he knows well enough, that 'tis his Duty in all <hi>lawful</hi> things to <hi>submit</hi> to the Governours of his Church, and <hi>reverence</hi> Christs Authority in them, but whether the above-named matters they impose be <hi>lawful</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> he neither <hi>doth</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> know. So that if upon the score of those Impositions, he <hi>rejects</hi> the Churches Communion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it he <hi>knows not why</hi>; and to <hi>avoid</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which he doth <hi>not know</hi> is a <hi>Sin,</hi> he <hi>refuses</hi> to do that which he <hi>knows</hi> is a <hi>Duty.</hi> So that whether that which the Church im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses be lawful or no, 'tis apparent <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in him to <hi>refuse</hi> it; because for all that he knows it is <hi>lawful,</hi> and though it should be <hi>unlawful,</hi> yet that cannot be the Motive of <hi>his</hi> Non-compliance with it, who doth not <hi>understand</hi> the Reasons that make it so. He
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:106959:246"/>
therefore that <hi>separates</hi> from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church for Causes that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>judg of,</hi> must necessarily separate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cause or Reason; he can have neither <hi>true</hi> nor <hi>false</hi> Pretence for his <hi>Separation</hi>; because the Arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sphere of his Cognizance; and consequently if he thereupon <hi>withdraw</hi> from the Churches Communion, 'tis not because he <hi>cannot</hi> comply with her <hi>sinful</hi> Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but because he <hi>will not</hi> submit to her <hi>just</hi> Authority. Whereas by modestly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>our</hi> Judgment to the <hi>Churches,</hi> in Cases where we cannot judg for <hi>our selves,</hi> we take an effectual Course to secure our Innocence. For though that which the Church injoins us should be <hi>materially</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet to <hi>us</hi> who neither <hi>do</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it to be so, it will be imputed only as an <hi>innocent</hi> Error; because by following the <hi>Churches</hi> Reason where <hi>own cannot</hi> guide us, we take the best Course we can <hi>not to be</hi> mistaken; and if we <hi>should be</hi> mistaken, we have this to <hi>excuse</hi> us, that 'twas by following an Authority which God himself hath set over us; whereas if we are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the <hi>other side,</hi> we are left altogether <hi>inexcusable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT then there may be other Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Church Communion, of whose <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness</hi>
                     <pb n="445" facs="tcp:106959:246"/>
a Communicant may be very <hi>doubtful,</hi> though he be not <hi>confidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded of it</hi>; and what is to be done in this Case? To which I answer; First, that 'tis doubtless our Duty not <hi>Rashly</hi> to determin any thing to be <hi>false</hi> or <hi>unlawful</hi> which our spiritual Governors have determined to be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>lawful.</hi> For we are bound by the Law of Christian <hi>Modesty,</hi> to conclude that they having a <hi>larger</hi> Prospect of things than we, and <hi>greater</hi> Advantages of enquiring into them, are far more <hi>capable</hi> Judges of what is true and lawful; and consequently though we may possibly have some <hi>little</hi> Probability that their <hi>Opinion</hi> is false or their <hi>Command</hi> unlawful, yet we ought not to <hi>determin</hi> it so, unless it be in such <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> Cases as do not only outweigh the <hi>Probability</hi> of their Opinions, but the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of them to. Wherefore in Cases of a <hi>doubtful</hi> Nature, 'tis both <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>safe</hi> to subscribe to the Judgment of our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; because in so doing we have not only our own <hi>Ignorance</hi> to <hi>excuse,</hi> but their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to <hi>warrant</hi> us; and if we should happen to be in the <hi>Wrong</hi> through our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> 'twill be safer for us than to be in the <hi>Right</hi> through our <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-conceit.</hi> But perhaps the <hi>Probability</hi> of our side may be so <hi>great,</hi> or at least <hi>seem

so</hi> to us, that notwithstanding we give all <hi>due</hi> Respect and Deference to her Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we cannot forbear <hi>doubting</hi> of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of her Conditions of Communion. If so, then, Secondly, 'tis to be considered that 'tis as much our Duty to <hi>Obey</hi> her Commands in things that are <hi>lawful,</hi> as <hi>not</hi> to Obey them in things that are <hi>unlawful</hi>; and therefore if we only <hi>doubt</hi> whether her Commands be lawful or no, our Doubt ought to make us as fearful of <hi>disobeying</hi> as it doth of <hi>obeying</hi> them, because the Danger of sinning is on both sides <hi>equal.</hi> And therefore in this Case, wherein I am necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to determin my self <hi>one</hi> way or <hi>t'other,</hi> it is doubtless my Duty to determin on that side which makes most for the Churches <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> which next to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God and the Salvation of Souls ought to be preferred above all things; and which consequently, if it be of any <hi>Weight</hi> with me, must necessarily <hi>turn</hi> the Scale of my Choice when it is before in <hi>Aequilibrio</hi>; and whither to <hi>obey</hi> or <hi>disobey</hi> be most for the Churches <hi>Peace,</hi> is very easie to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd.</p>
                  <p>THE Sum of all therefore is this, that 'tis our Duty to continue in strict <hi>Obedience</hi> to, and <hi>Communion</hi> with that <hi>Particular</hi> Church whereof we are Members, so long
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:106959:247"/>
as it injoyns us nothing that is <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>apparently sinful</hi>; that if either we cannot judg of the <hi>Sinfulness</hi> or <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of her Conditions of Communion, or do only <hi>doubt</hi> of their <hi>Lawfulness,</hi> we are obliged to submit to <hi>her</hi> Judgment and Authority, and not to <hi>separate</hi> from her till upon an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Enquiry into the Reasons of both sides, we are <hi>fully convinced</hi> that they are <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW that this is an indispensable Duty of our Religion, is evident not only from the above-named Scriptures by which the <hi>Bishops</hi> of particular Churches are constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Overseers</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of them, and the Subjects and Members of those Churches are required to yield them <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>; but also from those Texts which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid <hi>Divisions</hi> in the <hi>particular</hi> Churches, such as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i.10, <hi>I beseech you by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that there be no divisions among you</hi>; and which bid us <hi>mark them that cause divisions among us and avoid them,</hi> Rom. xvi.17. and also which <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> to be Fruits of the <hi>flesh,</hi> as particularly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii.3. and St. <hi>Jude</hi> xix. and in a word, which require us <hi>to indeavour to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> Eph. iv.3. <hi>to be of one mind,</hi> 2 Cor. xiii.11. and to <hi>stand fast in
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:106959:248"/>
one Spirit, with one</hi> Mind, <hi>Phil.</hi> i.27. all which was spoke to Christians as they were Members of <hi>particular Churches,</hi> to oblige them by no means to <hi>dissent</hi> and <hi>separate</hi> from those Churches, unless they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it by <hi>just</hi> and <hi>manifest</hi> Reasons; and methinks 'tis a most <hi>pathetical</hi> Conjuration of the Apostle, <hi>If there be any Consolution in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the spirit, if any bowels and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, being of one accord, and of one mind,</hi> 2 Phil. 1, 2. which Exhortation he gives them as they were a <hi>particular Corporation</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians under <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> their <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> by whom he sent this Epistle to them. The sense of all which is, to oblige us not to <hi>disunite</hi> our selves from the Church of which we are Members, so long as we are permitted to continue in her <hi>Communion</hi> without doing any thing that is <hi>apparently unlawful.</hi> Or if we suppose those <hi>Divisions</hi> which the Apostle speaks of and forbids, to be meant of <hi>Factions</hi> within the Church without actual <hi>Separation,</hi> then much more is <hi>Separation</hi> which is the <hi>highest</hi> Faction and Breach of Unity to be lookt upon as <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>unlawful.</hi> So that for men to <hi>separate</hi> from the Churches Communion upon little <hi>Piques,</hi> uncertain <hi>Scruples,</hi> and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:106959:248"/>
blind <hi>Prejudices,</hi> is a very <hi>great</hi> and <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Sin against the Gospel; 'tis a manifest <hi>Violation</hi> of the Laws of <hi>Vnion,</hi> and an open <hi>Rebellion</hi> against Christs Authority in his Church.

For thus the Apostle tells us not only that <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> (or a mutual Agreement among Church-Members) <hi>edifies,</hi> 1 Cor. viii.1. but also assures us that the whole Church or Collection of Members becomes an <hi>holy Temple</hi> and <hi>an Habitation of God,</hi> by being <gap reason="foreign">

For the <hi>separating Party</hi> must in their own Vindication be forced to <hi>accuse</hi> those they separate from of something that may be foul enough to <hi>justifie</hi> their <hi>Separation</hi>; and what they want in <hi>Reality</hi> they must make up in <hi>Pretence</hi>; otherwise they will be lookt upon as <hi>peevish</hi> and <hi>obstinate</hi> Schismaticks; and then the <hi>Party</hi> they <hi>separate from,</hi> will be sure to deem itself <hi>injured,</hi> and in its own Defence be forced to <hi>recriminate,</hi> and this will alarm the Separatists into <hi>greater</hi> Heats and Animosities, and so like two Flints <hi>dash'd</hi> together, they will be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>sparkling</hi> and <hi>spitting fire</hi> at one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, till they have <hi>kindled</hi> the quarrel into an <hi>inquenchable</hi> Flame. Whereas had the Dividers but <hi>continued</hi> their Communion, all this might have been prevented, and they might have easily continued their <hi>Charity,</hi> though they had retain'd the <hi>Opinions</hi> upon which they separated. For had they but exercised that <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> as not to prefer their own <hi>private</hi> Sentiments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of the whole Church, they would either have kept their Opinions to <hi>themselves,</hi> or at least not have <hi>advanced</hi> them into <hi>Principles</hi> of Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and so by <hi>continuing</hi> in Communion with that Party of the Church from whom they <hi>dissented</hi> in <hi>Opinion,</hi> they would have
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:106959:250"/>
declared that they judged their Errors to be <hi>tolerable.</hi> For by <hi>not separating</hi> from them, they would have plainly manifested that they saw Reason enough to <hi>unite</hi> upon the score of those Points in which they were <hi>agreed,</hi> but none to <hi>disunite</hi> upon the score of these in which they <hi>differed</hi>; and consequently that they had a great deal of Reason to <hi>love,</hi> but none to <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi> one another; and whilst they <hi>mutually</hi> retain'd this good Opinion of one another, 'tis very unlikely that their <hi>little Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> should cause any great Breaches in their Charity. Schism therefore being so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to our <hi>Charity,</hi> which is one of the leading Vertues of our Religion, must needs have a very <hi>malevolent</hi> Aspect upon our <hi>Perseverance.</hi> For he that from a <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi> Temper, relapses into a <hi>spiteful</hi> and <hi>rancorous</hi> one, is apostatised from <hi>one half</hi> of the Religion of a Christian, and hath exchanged one of the <hi>fairest</hi> Graces of a <hi>Saint,</hi> for one of the <hi>blackest</hi> Characters of a <hi>Devil.</hi> But then</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Schisms</hi> or unnecessary <hi>Breaches</hi> of Church Communion do naturally lead to the <hi>foulest Hypocrisies.</hi> For he that <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> from a Church is a very bad man, if he hath not a great <hi>Opinion</hi> of, and <hi>Zeal</hi> for those things upon which he separates; which
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:106959:250"/>
                     <hi>Zeal</hi> of his, when once he is <hi>actually</hi> sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, will be much more <hi>inflamed,</hi> and that both by the <hi>Opposition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> he is separated <hi>from,</hi> and the <hi>Instigation</hi> of the <hi>Sect</hi> he is separated <hi>to</hi>; and so by Degrees that <hi>holy</hi> Fervour which should <hi>animate</hi> him in the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>unquestionable</hi> Duties of Religion, will <hi>blaze</hi> into a <hi>fierce</hi> Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for those <hi>little</hi> Opinions that constitute the Sect he is ingaged in. For our Nature being <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> in all its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is impossible we should operate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse ways at once with <hi>equal</hi> Force and Vigour; but whatsoever Time and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we <hi>bestow</hi> upon <hi>one</hi> thing, we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily <hi>substract</hi> from <hi>another.</hi> Now whilst we continue in a <hi>peaceable</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church, we have no other use for our <hi>Zeal,</hi> but to <hi>inspire</hi> our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to <hi>quicken</hi> our Vertues, and to <hi>fight against</hi> our Sins with it, and this all men agree is the best Use it can be put to; but when once we are entred into a <hi>schismatical Separation,</hi> we shall find other Employment for it; namely, to <hi>quarrel</hi> at Ecclesiastical Constitutions, to <hi>wrangle</hi> about Modes and Circumstances of Worship, and <hi>contend</hi> for our <hi>trifling</hi> Speculations and Opinions. Which must necessarily <hi>weaken</hi> it in its <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler</hi> Operations, and render it more <hi>remiss</hi>
                     <pb n="454" facs="tcp:106959:251"/>
and <hi>indifferent</hi> in the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>indispensible</hi> Duties of Religion; and whilst 'tis thus <hi>impertinently</hi> busied in <hi>picking Straws,</hi> and contending about <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> to be sure it must more or less neglect the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi> things of the Law; and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably as it grows <hi>warmer</hi> and <hi>warmer</hi> about <hi>little</hi> Opinions and Circumstances of Religion, it will be continually waxing <hi>cooler</hi> and <hi>cooler</hi> in the <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> Duties of it, till at last 'tis wholly degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into <hi>Peevishness</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi> and dwindled away into a <hi>fierce</hi> Contention about Trifles. That this is the natural Effect of Schism appears by too many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Experiments. For how many Instances of men are there among our selves, who had once an honest Zeal for the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> of Religion, and made great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of <hi>living soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world,</hi> but afterwards becoming <hi>Bigots</hi> to such a <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Party,</hi> have diverted the <hi>Stream</hi> of their Zeal into another <hi>Channel,</hi> where its irregular <hi>Current</hi> hath only made a <hi>Noise,</hi> and fill'd the world with a <hi>loud</hi> and <hi>turbulent</hi> Clamour about <hi>little</hi> things, but as to those <hi>great</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant</hi> Duties upon which their Happiness depends hath been profoundly <hi>mute</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi>; and so their Religion like an
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:106959:251"/>
                     <hi>Hectick</hi> Body, hath by degrees been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by its own <hi>Heats,</hi> whilst that Zeal and Fervour which should <hi>move</hi> and <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> it hath been converted into its <hi>Disease,</hi> and wholly evaporated into <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Turbulency</hi>; and whilst their Zeal is thus misimployed about the <hi>little</hi> Trifles of their Sect, and they are ready to <hi>start</hi> at an <hi>innocent</hi> Ceremony, and to <hi>swoon</hi> at the sight of an <hi>indifferent</hi> Mode and Appendage of Religion, as if they were afraid lest it should <hi>infect</hi> them at a distance, they can <hi>swallow</hi> Camels though they <hi>strain</hi> at these Gnats, and <hi>glibly</hi> digest the <hi>grossest</hi> Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And lastly, <hi>Schisms</hi> and unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <hi>Breaches</hi> of Church Communion do naturally lead to <hi>downright Irreligion.</hi> For when once a man is departed from an <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished</hi> Church without a <hi>just</hi> Warrant, there is nothing can <hi>confine</hi> or set Shores to him, he hath no Principles that can <hi>stay</hi> him any where, or <hi>set</hi> any Measures of <hi>changing</hi> to him. For when upon a meer <hi>Humour</hi> or <hi>Fancy</hi> he hath run from the Church to <hi>such</hi> a Sect, what should hinder him from running from <hi>that</hi> Sect to <hi>another,</hi> and so on from <hi>Sect</hi> to <hi>Sect,</hi> till he hath <hi>run</hi> himself <hi>out</hi> of all Religion? He is <hi>rolling</hi> down a <hi>steep</hi> Hill, and hath no Principles to <hi>stay</hi> him, so
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:106959:252"/>
that 'tis impossible to determine <hi>whither</hi> he will <hi>go,</hi> or <hi>where</hi> he will <hi>stop</hi>; he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps stay at <hi>such</hi> an Opinion, but if he doth, it is <hi>by chance,</hi> and if he doth <hi>not,</hi> he will be <hi>endlesly</hi> rolling from one Opinion to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and shifting his <hi>Church</hi> as oft as his <hi>Almanack.</hi> For Schism is a large <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> that naturally divides and subdivides into <hi>infinite</hi> Paths and Allies, wherein a man may <hi>wander</hi> to Eternity, and the <hi>farther</hi> he goes the more he may <hi>lose himself</hi>; and then when he hath wandred a while out of <hi>one</hi> wild Opinion into <hi>another,</hi> and still perceives that the farther he <hi>goes,</hi> the more he is <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied,</hi> 'tis a thousand to one if he doth not at last <hi>suspect</hi> and <hi>question</hi> all Religion, as if the whole were an <hi>intricate</hi> maze of <hi>absurd</hi> or <hi>doubtful</hi> Opinions, contriv'd on purpose to <hi>amuse</hi> mens Minds, and <hi>intangle</hi> them in endless Perplexities. For the <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,</hi> as I shewed before, doth commonly place a great Part of his Religion in <hi>that</hi> Opinion upon which he <hi>divides</hi> and <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi>; so that if once he be <hi>dissatisfied</hi> with <hi>this,</hi> as in all probability he will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, having begun already to <hi>ring Changes,</hi> he will be under a great Temptation to mistrust the <hi>whole</hi> Religion to be as great an Imposture as he finds this <hi>darling Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is; especially after he hath run through
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:106959:252"/>
several <hi>Sets</hi> of Opinions, and finds them at last to be all <hi>Delusions.</hi> For as <hi>weak</hi> Heads, when they perceive the <hi>Battlements</hi> shake, are apt to suspect that the <hi>Foundations</hi> are <hi>infirm</hi>; so <hi>weak</hi> Understandings will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to suspect even the <hi>fundamental</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, when once they perceive those <hi>darling Notions</hi> totter which they have confidently presum'd to superstruct upon it. Upon this Account therefore I make no doubt, but that the <hi>Atheism</hi> of this present Age, is very much owing to its <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Divisions.</hi> For how many woful Examples have we of persons who had once a great deal of <hi>Zeal</hi> for and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in Religion, that upon their <hi>causless</hi> Defection from the Churches Communion have run from <hi>Sect</hi> to <hi>Sect,</hi> and from one <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> Opinion to another, till being at last convinced of the <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Impostures</hi> of them all, they have discarded <hi>Religion</hi> it self, and made their last Resort into <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Infidelity?</hi> Since therefore <hi>Schism</hi> hath so many <hi>Mischiefs</hi> attending it, and such as do manifestly <hi>endanger</hi> our <hi>Perseverance</hi> in Religion, it highly concerns us, as we would hold out to the End in the Course of our Christian Warfare, to keep close to the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>

                     <pb n="458" facs="tcp:106959:253"/>VI. TO our <hi>final</hi> Perseverance in the Christian Warfare, it is also necessary that we should not <hi>stint</hi> our <hi>Progress</hi> in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (out of a <hi>fond</hi> Opinion that we are good <hi>enough</hi> already) to any determinate <hi>Degrees</hi> or <hi>Measures</hi> of Goodness.

The sense of all which is, that we should not <hi>limit</hi> our selves to any <hi>present</hi> Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, out of a <hi>slothful</hi> Opinion that we are good <hi>enough</hi> already, but that we should still be proceeding on to <hi>farther</hi> and <hi>farther</hi> Degrees of Perfection. For Holiness is every where injoyned in the Gospel in <hi>unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi> and <hi>indefinite</hi> Measures, and our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in it hath no other <hi>Boundary</hi> than the farthermost Degree of <hi>possible</hi> Perfection. An Injunction which will keep us for ever sufficiently <hi>imployed,</hi> and oblige us to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be still <hi>aspiring</hi> beyond our <hi>present</hi> Attainments; and the <hi>Neglect</hi> of this is
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:106959:253"/>
doubtless the Occasion of many a Mans <hi>final</hi> Miscarriage. They aim at no more than what is <hi>absolutely</hi> necessary to <hi>remove</hi> them from the Brink of eternal Perdition, and if they can but so far <hi>prevail</hi> against their <hi>Sin,</hi> as to arrive at the <hi>lowermost</hi> Degree of Sincere <hi>Obedience,</hi> and but just pass the Line which separates between a <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>good</hi> State, that so if they die as they are, they may hope to <hi>escape</hi> Hell and <hi>arrive</hi> at some <hi>Degree</hi> of Happiness, they think they have very fairly acquitted themselves. But now besides that that <hi>Line</hi> which parts those two States of Sin and Grace is not so <hi>easily discernable,</hi> but that you may very probably be <hi>deceived,</hi> and <hi>imagine</hi> that you are got over it into the State of Grace, whilst you are yet upon the <hi>Frontiers</hi> of the Dominion of Sin, and so may perish at last at the very <hi>Mouth</hi> of your <hi>Harbour</hi>; besides that 'tis a fearful Sign that you are <hi>yet in your Sins,</hi> that you design no <hi>farther</hi> but <hi>just</hi> to escape that <hi>everlasting Ruine</hi> that attends them, which plainly shews that the <hi>Fear of Hell</hi> is the <hi>Soul</hi> of your Religion, and that there is not the least Degree of true <hi>Love to God</hi> intermingled with it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which your Religion will be altogether <hi>insignificant</hi>; besides all this I say, while you rest in such an <hi>imperfect</hi> State of <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>

For you must consider that there is vast Distance between a State of <hi>sincere,</hi> and of <hi>confirmed</hi> Goodness, and that all the while you are passing on from the <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>other,</hi> you are more or less in Danger of <hi>relapsing.</hi> For you have been <hi>sincerely</hi> good, ever since your first Entrance into a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> Resolution of Amendment; but alas since <hi>that,</hi> how many times have you been in Danger of relapsing into your old <hi>sinful</hi> Courses again? What strong Contentions have there been between your <hi>Flesh</hi> and your <hi>Spirit,</hi> your <hi>bad</hi> Inclinations, and your <hi>pious</hi> Resolutions? and though the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> hath been most <hi>commonly</hi> victorious, yet

how often hath it been <hi>yielding,</hi> yea, how often hath it been <hi>vanquisht?</hi> Insomuch that if you had not by a <hi>quick</hi> Repentance <hi>revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> it <hi>immediately,</hi> it had been <hi>dead</hi> long since, and you had been as much <hi>enslaved</hi> to your Lusts as ever.

                  <p n="7">VII.

                  </p>
                  <p>AND indeed since to <hi>die well,</hi> is the <hi>last</hi> Act and <hi>final</hi> Consummation of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Warfare, it must needs highly concern us to <hi>arm</hi> and <hi>prepare</hi> our selves for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, lest we lose the blessed <hi>Prize</hi> by <hi>stumbling</hi> just at the <hi>Goal,</hi> and after a long <hi>Voyage</hi> miscarry for ever within <hi>Sight</hi> of <hi>Harbour.</hi> For in the hour of Death we throw our last <hi>Cast</hi> for an Eternity of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness or Misery, and how much are we concerned to throw that <hi>well,</hi> upon which so vast a <hi>Stake</hi> depends? O! 'tis a <hi>serious</hi> thing to <hi>die,</hi> to pass this <hi>dark</hi> Entry of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, through which as we go <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> we are <hi>made</hi> or <hi>undone</hi> for ever.

us,</hi> will serve the turn; O! no, it is an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive</hi> Passage, which we shall never be able to <hi>defray,</hi> unless we carry along with us a <hi>large Stock</hi> of spiritual Preparations. We shall have need of a <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>active</hi> Faith, of a Mind well furnished with <hi>wise</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, of a <hi>deep,</hi> a <hi>large</hi> and a <hi>tried</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, an <hi>unrestrained</hi> Charity, a <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> Patience, a <hi>profound</hi> Submission to the Will of God, and a <hi>well-grounded</hi> Hope of a blessed Eternity. For without all these together, we shall be very <hi>ill-accoutred</hi> to die, and run a dreadful <hi>Hazard</hi> of miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying for ever. And these are such things as do not usually spring up like <hi>Mushromes</hi> in a Night, or in the few <hi>disturbed</hi> Moments of a <hi>dying</hi> Time, but do ask a much <hi>larger</hi> and <hi>serener</hi> Season to <hi>grow</hi> and <hi>ripen</hi> in. So that if we mean to <hi>die well,</hi> and so come off <hi>victoriously</hi> in this <hi>last Act</hi> of our spiritual Warfare, we must now while we are well be frequently entertaining our Meditations in the <hi>Charnel-house,</hi> and read <hi>Lectures</hi> to our selves upon the <hi>Skeletons</hi> and <hi>Deaths-heads</hi> there, those Emblems and Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of our approaching Mortality, and from them take such lively <hi>Pictures</hi> of the King of Terrors, as may render his <hi>grim</hi> Visage and <hi>fearful</hi> Addresses so familiar to us, as that our Thoughts may be before-hand
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:106959:256"/>
accustomed to the manner of his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi>; with what an <hi>Army</hi> of Diseases he is wont to lay <hi>Siege</hi> to the <hi>Fort</hi> of our Life, how in Despight of all the Resistances of Nature he <hi>plants</hi> and <hi>quarters</hi> them in our Veins or our Arteries, our Stomachs or our Bowels, and from thence <hi>infests</hi> us all over with continual Anguish and Pain; how when he hath <hi>tired</hi> and <hi>exhausted</hi> us with his continued <hi>Batteries,</hi> and worn out our Strength with a succession of <hi>wearisom</hi> Nights to <hi>sorrowful</hi> Days, he at last <hi>storms</hi> the Soul out of all the <hi>Out-works</hi> of Nature, and forces it to <hi>retire</hi> into the Heart; and how when he hath marked us for dead with a Baptism of <hi>clammy</hi> and <hi>fatal</hi> Sweats, he summons our weeping Friends to assist him to <hi>grieve</hi> and <hi>vex</hi> us with their <hi>parting</hi> Kisses and <hi>sorrowful</hi> Adieus; and how at length when he is weary of Tormenting us any more, he <hi>rushes</hi> into our Hearts and with a few Mortal Pangs and Convulsions, <hi>tears</hi> the Soul from thence, and <hi>turns</hi> it <hi>out</hi> to seek its Fortune in the <hi>wide</hi> World of Spirits, where 'tis either <hi>seized</hi> on by Devils, and carried away to their <hi>dark</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Despair,</hi> there to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish out its life in a dismal <hi>Expectation</hi> of that dreadful Day wherein it must change its <hi>bad</hi> Condition for a <hi>worse</hi>; or
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:106959:257"/>
be <hi>conducted</hi> by Angels to some <hi>blessed</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, there to remain in <hi>unspeakable</hi> Pleasure and Tranquillity, till 'tis Crown'd with a <hi>glorious</hi> Resurrection. Now since 'tis <hi>most certain</hi> that we must all <hi>one</hi> time or <hi>other</hi> experience these things, but <hi>most uncertain</hi> how <hi>soon</hi>; how much doth it concern us to <hi>think</hi> of them before-hand, and to forecast such <hi>Provisions</hi> and <hi>Preparations</hi> for them, as that whensoever they happen we may not be <hi>surprized.</hi> For besides that the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Meditation of death will <hi>familiarize</hi> its Terrors to us, so that whensoever it comes, our Minds which have been so long accustomed to <hi>converse</hi> with it, will be much less <hi>startled</hi> and <hi>amazed</hi> at it; besides that it will <hi>wean</hi> us from the <hi>inordinate</hi> Desire and <hi>over-eager</hi> Prosecution of the things of this World, which, as I told you before, are the Snares with which our Vices do too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>intangle</hi> us; besides all this, I say, it will put us upon laying in a <hi>Store</hi> of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Provisions</hi> against that great day of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</hi> For he that often considers the <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Approaches, the <hi>concomitant</hi> Terrors, and the <hi>momentous</hi> Issues and Consequents of Death, must be strangely <hi>stupified</hi> if he be not thereby vigorously <hi>excited</hi> to <hi>fore-arm</hi> and <hi>fortifie</hi> himself with all those <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Defences</hi> that are necessary to render it <hi>easie, safe</hi> and <hi>prosperous.</hi>

To our <hi>final</hi> perseverance in the Christian Warfare, it is also necessary that in order to the putting our selves into a good <hi>Posture</hi> to die, we should <hi>discharge</hi> our Consciences of all the <hi>Reliques</hi> and <hi>Remains</hi> of our past <hi>guilt.</hi> For so we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take care <hi>that our hearts be sprinkled from an evil conscience,</hi> Heb. x.22. and <hi>to hold faith and a good conscience,</hi> 1 Tim. i.19. and <hi>to make this our rejoycing, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity we have had our conversation in the world,</hi> 2 Cor. i.12. in a word, <hi>to live in all good conscience,</hi> Acts xxiii.1. and <hi>to have a conscience void of offence, towards God and towards men,</hi> Acts xxiv.16. Which though they are <hi>General</hi> Duties, do necessarily imply this <hi>Particular,</hi> that we should very <hi>nicely</hi> and <hi>curiously</hi> examin our Consciences, those faithful <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Registers</hi> of our Actions, and where-ever we find the least <hi>Item</hi> of an <hi>uncancel'd</hi> Guilt, immediately <hi>cross</hi> it <hi>out</hi> by a hearty <hi>Sorrow</hi> for and moral <hi>Revocation</hi> of it. For notwithstanding we may have in the <hi>general</hi> repented of all our past Sins, yet there are some Siins, which, notwithstanding we react no more, do leave a <hi>lasting</hi> Guilt upon the Mind, which nothing can <hi>cancel</hi> but our <hi>actual</hi> revoking and <hi>unsinning</hi> them. As supposing that I have heretofore either by
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:106959:258"/>
my bad <hi>Counsels</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> seduced other men into wicked Courses; it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Expiation of my Fault, that I <hi>my self</hi> abstain from those wicked Courses for the future, but I must indeavour to <hi>undo</hi> the Mischief which I have done to <hi>others</hi> by them, and by a solemn <hi>Recantation</hi> of my past Follies, by <hi>Persuasion</hi> and good <hi>Counsel,</hi> and the Application of all other <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>prudent</hi> Means, indeavour to <hi>reduce</hi> those whom I have formerly <hi>perverted.</hi> For till I have done this, I <hi>wilfully</hi> permit the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous <hi>Effect</hi> of my Sin to <hi>remain</hi>; and if when I have <hi>wounded</hi> another, I suffer him to <hi>perish</hi> without taking any care of his <hi>Cure,</hi> I am guilty of his <hi>Murder</hi> though I never wound him <hi>more.</hi> Suppose again, that I have injured another by any malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Slander</hi> or <hi>Calumny</hi>; it is not enough to acquit me of the Guilt of it, that I <hi>cease</hi> to <hi>scandalize</hi> him for the future, but I must also indeavour by a free <hi>Retractation</hi> to <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate</hi> his injur'd Name from the ill <hi>Surmises</hi> of those to whom I have <hi>asperst</hi> him; for so long as his <hi>Reputation</hi> suffers through my <hi>not Retracting</hi> the Calumnies I have cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, I wilfully persist to <hi>defame</hi> and <hi>calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate</hi> him, and so long the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it must <hi>stick</hi> and <hi>abide</hi> upon my Conscience. Once more, suppose I have injur'd another in his
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:106959:258"/>
                     <hi>Estate,</hi> either by <hi>Theft,</hi> or <hi>Fraud,</hi> or <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> it will not be sufficient to acquit me, that for the future I <hi>forbear</hi> defrauding, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or stealing from him any more, but, if it be in my Power, I must make <hi>Restitution</hi> of all that I have wrongfully <hi>deprived</hi> him of; and that to <hi>himself,</hi> if he be <hi>living,</hi> or if not, to those that succeed him in his <hi>Rights,</hi> and for want of <hi>such,</hi> to the <hi>Poor,</hi> who by Gods Donation have the Propriety of all such <hi>Wefts</hi> and <hi>Strays</hi> as have no other Owner surviving. For it's certain that my <hi>wrongful</hi> Seizure of what is another Mans, doth not <hi>alienate</hi> his <hi>Right</hi> to it, so that he hath the same Right to it while I <hi>keep</hi> it from him, as he had at first when I <hi>took</hi> it from him; and consequently till I <hi>restore</hi> it back to him, I <hi>continue</hi> to wrong him of it, and my <hi>detaining</hi> it is a continued <hi>Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that <hi>Fraud,</hi> or <hi>Theft,</hi> or <hi>Oppression</hi> by which I wrongfully seized it; and whilst I thus <hi>continue</hi> the Sin, 'tis impossible but the Guilt of it must still <hi>abide</hi> upon me. In these Cases therefore it concerns us to be very <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>curious</hi> in examining our <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,</hi> to see if there be any of these <hi>Scores</hi> yet <hi>uncancel'd,</hi> any of these bad <hi>Effects</hi> of our Sin yet <hi>remaining.</hi> For if any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear in our <hi>Accounts,</hi> it concerns us as much as our everlasting Interest amounts
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:106959:259"/>
to, to use all present Care and Diligence to <hi>discharge</hi> it, that so before Death summons us to give up our Accounts to the great <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor</hi> of the World, all <hi>Scores</hi> between him and us may be <hi>even'd</hi> and <hi>adjusted.</hi> And indeed if we would be safe, it vastly imports us to leave as little as may be to do upon a <hi>Death-bed</hi>; for that is most commonly a very <hi>improper</hi> State for religious Action; since, for all we know, we may be <hi>distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in it by a <hi>Feaver,</hi> or <hi>stupified</hi> by an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy,</hi> or <hi>deprived</hi> of the Use of Reason by the insufferable Torments of a <hi>Stone</hi>; either of which will render us incapable of <hi>every thing,</hi> but <hi>dying.</hi> Or if neither of these should happen, yet to be sure a <hi>dying</hi> State will bring Work <hi>enough</hi> with it; <hi>Sorrows</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> enough, <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Impatiencies</hi> enough, to <hi>exercise</hi> all our Vertue, and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy</hi> all our Reason. So that if we carry with us to our Death-bed any <hi>Item</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> of <hi>uncancel'd</hi> Guilt, 'tis a thousand to one but in the <hi>Hurry</hi> of dying we shall leave it <hi>uncancel'd,</hi> and be <hi>arrested</hi> for it by the Divine Justice when we come into Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Wherefore, as we would prevent this <hi>fatal</hi> Issue of our Christian Warfare, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us now we are <hi>well,</hi> to make a <hi>diligent</hi> Inspection into our Consciences, to see if there yet remains any old <hi>Reckonings</hi> of
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:106959:259"/>
Guilt <hi>undischarged</hi> by us; and if there be, not to give <hi>rest</hi> to our Eyes nor <hi>slumber</hi> to our Eye-lids, till by an actual <hi>unsinning</hi> and Revocation of the Facts, we have totally <hi>cross'd</hi> and <hi>discharged</hi> them. But then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many of these may slip out of our Mind, and so be past Recovery,</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. TO the happy <hi>Conclusion</hi> of this our Christian Warfare, it is also necessary that to <hi>Compensate,</hi> so far as we are able, for these <hi>Reliques</hi> of Guilt in us, we should take care to <hi>redeem</hi> the time we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mispent in <hi>sinful</hi> Courses, by being <hi>doubly</hi> diligent in the Exercise of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Vertues,</hi> and the doing all the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Good</hi> we are able. For of all the <hi>outward</hi> Blessings that God affords us, our <hi>Time</hi> is incomparably the most <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable</hi>; and therefore though he gives us his other Blessings in great <hi>Variety,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for us a <hi>plentiful</hi> Choice of Meats, Drinks and Raiment, yet in the Distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Time he seems to be more <hi>sparing</hi> and <hi>streight-handed</hi>; for he gives it not to us in <hi>Rivers,</hi> but <hi>Drop</hi> by <hi>Drop</hi> and <hi>Minute</hi> after <hi>Minute,</hi> so that we can never injoy <hi>two</hi> Moments <hi>together,</hi> but when-ever he gives us <hi>one,</hi> he always takes away <hi>another.</hi> And yet, good God! what <hi>Wast</hi> do we make of these precious Drops of which thou art so
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:106959:260"/>
                     <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>sparing</hi>? How great a Part of it do we consume in our <hi>Childhood</hi> upon the indifferent Vanities of <hi>Nuts</hi> and <hi>Rattles,</hi> and afterwards upon the much more <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> ones of ous <hi>vicious, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse,</hi> and <hi>extravagant</hi> appetites? So that by that time we come to a <hi>serious</hi> Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great End of our Beings, the <hi>main</hi> Part of our time is usually <hi>elapsed</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond revocation. How much therefore doth it concern us, after we have so <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally</hi> squandered away the <hi>greatest</hi> Part of the Treasure of our Time, to make the best Improvement of the <hi>small</hi> Remainder? that so we may at least <hi>Morally</hi> recover, that which is <hi>Physically</hi> irrecoverable. For though we cannot cause the <hi>past</hi> Minutes we have ill spent to be <hi>present</hi> again, yet we can <hi>redouble</hi> our Diligence for the future, and thereby render every <hi>one</hi> Minute <hi>to come</hi> equivalent to every <hi>two</hi> that are <hi>past.</hi> For by a <hi>double</hi> diligence we may live as much in <hi>one</hi> Day, as we can in <hi>two</hi> by a <hi>single,</hi> and consequently by <hi>doubly</hi> improving that Part of our time which is yet good and <hi>to come,</hi> we may <hi>morally</hi> retrieve that Part which is <hi>lost</hi> and <hi>gone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS therefore the Gospel requires at our hands, that after we have lived out a great Part of our Time to no Purpose, we

should from thenceforth live <hi>much</hi> in a <hi>little</hi> while, and retrieve our <hi>past</hi> Negligence by our <hi>future</hi> Diligence, and <hi>redeem</hi> the Time we have spent upon our Lusts, by exerting the contrary Vertues more <hi>vigorously</hi> for the future; that the more <hi>prophane</hi> we have been for the time past, the more <hi>devout</hi> we should be for the time to come; that the more we have abounded heretofore in <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Oppressions,</hi> the more we should abound hereafter in <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Alms</hi>; that the more <hi>industrious</hi> we have been to <hi>seduce</hi> and <hi>debauch</hi> men, the more <hi>zealous</hi> we should be to <hi>reduce</hi> and <hi>reclaim</hi> them; and by our future <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Charitable</hi> Construction of men, indeavour to <hi>compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate</hi> for the Malice of our past <hi>Slanders</hi> and <hi>Defamations.</hi> Thus Eph. iv.28. <hi>Let him that stole, steal no more</hi>; ay but that is not enough, but he must also indeavour to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem</hi> his past Thefts by a more <hi>vigorous</hi> Exercise of the contrary Vertue for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>but rather let him labour, working with his own hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.</hi> So also, Dan. iv.27. <hi>break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor,</hi> i. e. whereas for the Time past the Course of thy Life hath very much abounded with <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Injustice,</hi> do
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:106959:261"/>
thou now indeavour to <hi>redeem</hi> the Guilt of it, for so the <hi>Hebrew Verb</hi> signifies, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting more <hi>vigorously</hi> the contrary Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> to <hi>all,</hi> and of <hi>Mercy</hi> to the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>afflicted.</hi> And to this Purpose St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Example is proposed to our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, because for the Time past he had been a great <hi>Persecutor</hi> of Christianity, did for the future labour <hi>more abundantly</hi> than any other Apostle to <hi>advance</hi> and <hi>propagate</hi> it, 1 Cor. xv.9, 10. The Observance of which Rule is highly necessary to the reducing this our Warfare to a prosperous Issue. For, as I told you before, there are many Sins which after we have forsaken the Practice of them, do <hi>stick</hi> such a guilt upon the Conscience, as without our <hi>undoing</hi> them so far as we are able, is not to be <hi>wiped off</hi>; such as wicked <hi>Counsel,</hi> malicious <hi>Detraction,</hi> and unjust <hi>Gain,</hi> all which we are bound, so far as 'tis in our Power, not only to <hi>avoid,</hi> but actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>revoke.</hi> But alas! there are many of these which in a long Course of Sin are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>forgotten</hi> by us, and consequently are past <hi>Revocation,</hi> and in this Case all we can do to take off the Guilt of them, is in the general Course of our Lives to <hi>abound</hi> in the Practice of the <hi>contrary</hi> Vertues, and to do the utmost Service we are able to the <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>good Names</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> of men.
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:106959:261"/>
For <hi>Charity,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>shall cover a multitude of sins,</hi> 1 Pet. iv.8. that is, when it appears by the <hi>Abundance</hi> of our <hi>Charity,</hi> that we would <hi>abolish</hi> and <hi>repair</hi> all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries we have done, if it were in our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, God in this Case will accept the <hi>Will</hi> for the <hi>Deed,</hi> and deal as <hi>mercifully</hi> by us as if we had <hi>actually</hi> done it. For if it appear in his Sight that we <hi>would</hi> do it if we <hi>could,</hi> we are in his Account as truly <hi>obedient</hi> to him as if we had actually <hi>performed</hi> it, and consequently shall be dealt with by the same Proportions of Mercy. But 'tis only an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Charity that can evidence this; since what is <hi>ordinary</hi> we are obliged to though we had no past <hi>Injuries</hi> to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish; but to <hi>ensure</hi> our Reconciliation with God, it is requisite that we should evidence to him our <hi>sincere</hi> willingness, to do not only what we <hi>should have</hi> been obliged to if we had <hi>not</hi> been <hi>injurious,</hi> but also what we <hi>are</hi> obliged to since we <hi>have</hi> been inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Now as <hi>actual Reparation,</hi> so far as we are able, is necessary to evidence this, when we <hi>remember</hi> the Injuries we have done, so an <hi>extraordinary Charity</hi> is no less necessary to evidence this, when we have forgotten them. And this I suppose is the meaning of that <hi>Parallel</hi> Passage of St. <hi>James, c.</hi> v. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>he that converteth a sinner
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:106959:262"/>
from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins,</hi> i. e. by such an <hi>illustrious</hi> Act of Charity to the <hi>Soul</hi> of his Brother, he shall obtain Pardon of God for many of those <hi>forgotten</hi> Injuries which he hath formerly done, and is now no <hi>otherwise</hi> able to repair. So that if we would make <hi>sure</hi> Work of our Christian Warfare, and <hi>ascertain</hi> its being <hi>finally</hi> Crowned with Success, as in <hi>general</hi> we must indeavour to <hi>redeem</hi> the past Time we have spent in vicious Courses by <hi>abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the Practice of the <hi>contrary</hi> Vertues; so in <hi>particular,</hi> if for the time past we have lived in any of those <hi>injurious</hi> Courses which do naturally fix a more <hi>lasting</hi> Guilt upon the Mind, we must take care not only to repair, so far as we are able, those Injuries we <hi>remember,</hi> but also to wipe off the Guilt of those we have <hi>forgotten</hi> by an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> Charity and Beneficence, by laying hold of all <hi>Opportunities</hi> to do Good, and indeavouring in our several Stations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God hath inabled us, to <hi>reduce</hi> the Souls, <hi>relieve</hi> the Bodies, and <hi>vindicate</hi> the Reputation of our Brethren.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. AND lastly, To our <hi>final</hi> Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in wel-doing, it is also necessary that we should labour after a <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>wel-grounded Assurance</hi> of Heaven. I put this
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:106959:262"/>
in the <hi>last</hi> Place, because 'tis usually the <hi>last</hi> attain'd, and is not to be presently <hi>expected</hi> and <hi>catch'd at</hi> as soon as we are entered into a religious State. For there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stages of Religion to be past, before we can modestly expect to arrive at <hi>Assurance.</hi> In the <hi>Beginning</hi> of our Religion, when we are just <hi>recovered</hi> out of a vicious State, we cannot but be sensible, if we do at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand our selves, that we are as yet in a great deal of <hi>Danger,</hi> and do <hi>border</hi> so very near upon that <hi>bad</hi> State we are escap'd from, that 'tis almost impossible to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish whether we are <hi>in</hi> or <hi>out</hi> of it. For though we are fully <hi>purposed</hi> and <hi>resolved</hi> against it, yet we cannot well divine what will be the <hi>Issue</hi> of it. Our <hi>Resolution</hi> is yet so <hi>young,</hi> so <hi>raw</hi> and <hi>unexperienced,</hi> and <hi>besieg'd</hi> with so many powerful counter-striving Inclinations, that we cannot <hi>confide</hi> in it without great <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Presumption.</hi> For till sufficient Trial hath been made of it, for all that we know, it may prove to be only a Godly <hi>Mood,</hi> or a short <hi>Lucid Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> between the <hi>raving</hi> Fits of our Lust and extravagant Affections, which in a few days perhaps may <hi>return</hi> again, and utterly <hi>alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> and <hi>distract</hi> us from all our <hi>sober</hi> Counsels, and Purposes. And if it should so happen, that which we now look upon
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:106959:263"/>
as our <hi>Cure</hi> and <hi>Recovery,</hi> will prove but an <hi>Intermission</hi> of our Disease. And when for sometime we have <hi>tryed</hi> our Resolution, and found that hath bravely <hi>resisted</hi> those Temptations that have hitherto assaulted it, yet we cannot <hi>presently</hi> be reasonably <hi>assured</hi> of it, considering the <hi>fickleness</hi> and <hi>Inconstancy</hi> of our Nature. For it may be it hath not been yet assaulted on the <hi>weak</hi> Side, or it hath not been <hi>nick'd</hi> with a <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> Temptation, or it may be we may be more <hi>remiss</hi> and <hi>careless</hi> another time, or more <hi>vehemently inclined</hi> to a vicious Complyance; and then those Temptations which we have <hi>hitherto</hi> conquered, may <hi>captivate</hi> and <hi>subdue</hi> us. And if it thus happen, that which we now look upon as an everlasting <hi>Breach</hi> between us and our Lusts, may prove only a <hi>Pet</hi> or short <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stast,</hi> and like the Fallings out of Lovers end in the renewing of Love. And till we have made some considerable Progress in the <hi>mortification</hi> of our <hi>sinful</hi> Inclinations, and the <hi>Acquisition</hi> of their <hi>contrary</hi> Habits, our Religion will have so many <hi>Flaws, Defects</hi> and <hi>Imperfections</hi> in it, as will give us great Reason, if we have any modesty in us, to be very <hi>fearful</hi> and <hi>jealous</hi> of it. But since without <hi>Sincerity</hi> in Religion we can have no <hi>Title</hi> to Heaven, it hence follows
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:106959:263"/>
that without a <hi>clear Sense</hi> of our Sincerity, we can have no <hi>Assurance</hi> of our Title to it; and such a <hi>clear Sense</hi> as is necessary to found such an <hi>Assurance</hi> on, is not to be acquired, you see, without a <hi>thorough</hi> Tryal of our Resolution in a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Course of Religion. So that for men to be immediatly <hi>snatching</hi> at Assurance, as soon as ever they are <hi>entred</hi> into a good Life, argues them not to be so sensible, as they should be, of their own <hi>Imperfection</hi> and <hi>Frailty</hi>; they ought in Modesty to <hi>expect</hi> a while, and not conclude <hi>too soon</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, till they have made a <hi>through</hi> Tryal of their Resolution; and in the mean time to <hi>strive on,</hi> in Hope that by the Blessing of God concurring with their <hi>Endeavours,</hi> they shall <hi>at last</hi> attain such a certain <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Feeling</hi> of their own <hi>Sincerity,</hi> as will be sufficient to infer a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Assurance. For Assurance being the Top of Christian Attainment, we must ascend to it <hi>gradually,</hi> by the intermediate Staves and Rounds of a <hi>tryed</hi> and <hi>lasting</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and not <hi>leap up</hi> in an Instant before we have taken all the Steps and Degrees that lead thither.</p>
                  <p>BUT though we ought not to be too <hi>forward</hi> in our Assurance, yet we are bound to labour after it in a <hi>due</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> Way;
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:106959:264"/>
that is, to persist in our Obedience till we have reduced our <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>outward</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to such a <hi>Degree</hi> of Conformity to the <hi>Standard</hi> of the Gospel, as that upon comparing <hi>our selves</hi> with <hi>it,</hi> we may be able without <hi>Flattery</hi> or <hi>Presumption</hi> to conclude our own <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> I know there is a much <hi>shorter</hi> Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to Assurance, which some of late have pretended to; and that is, by certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable <hi>Incomes</hi> and <hi>Manifestations</hi> of Gods Spirit, who, as they pretend, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly <hi>whisper</hi> and <hi>reveal</hi> to them their Title and Interest in Heaven. But this alas! is too much like the <hi>North-east</hi> Passage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> which is <hi>shorter</hi> indeed, if it could be found, but so very <hi>dangerous,</hi> that I doubt there are but few that <hi>attempt</hi> it but <hi>miscarry,</hi> and 'tis well if they do not <hi>finally</hi> perish in the <hi>Discovery.</hi> Not that I do in the least doubt but God doth many times <hi>suggest</hi> and <hi>whisper</hi> unspeakable <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> and <hi>Assurances</hi> to the Minds of good men; but then it is to be considered that this is an <hi>arbitrarious</hi> Gift, which he seldom if ever bestows but in <hi>extraordinary</hi> Cases, when 'tis necessary to <hi>encourage</hi> us to some great <hi>Work,</hi> or to <hi>support</hi> us under some extraordinary <hi>Suffering.</hi> For he is a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>careful</hi> Father of his Children, and
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:106959:264"/>
knows 'tis much more necessary for us to be <hi>good,</hi> than to be <hi>ravished</hi> and <hi>transported</hi>; and that such <hi>high</hi> Cordials are neither <hi>proper</hi> nor <hi>safe</hi> for us but in great <hi>Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; and therefore for us to expect that he should make them our ordinary <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Entertainment</hi> is an Argument of our Childish Ignorance and Presumption. But though such immediate <hi>Whispers</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> may serve to good Purposes in a Pinch of Extremity, yet are they by no means to be <hi>built upon</hi> as the Foundations of our <hi>ordinary, standing</hi> Assurance. For so long as there is an evil Spirit <hi>without,</hi> and a disordered Fancy <hi>within</hi> us, that can <hi>imitate</hi> these Whispers, we shall be continually liable, so long as we put Confidence in them, to all the <hi>Cheats</hi> and Impostures of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>Diabolical</hi> Enthusiasm, and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably mistake many an <hi>Injection</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and many a warm <hi>Flush</hi> of Fancy, or brisk <hi>Fermentation</hi> of melancholy Humour, for a <hi>Whisper</hi> and <hi>Testimony</hi> of the spirit of God, and by this means be often <hi>lull'd</hi> into <hi>false</hi> Confidences and Assurances, which like Golden Dreams will <hi>vanish</hi> when we awake, and leave us miserably <hi>disappointed.</hi> That Assurance therefore which we are to aim at, must be <hi>founded</hi> in the Testimony of a good Conscience, and <hi>infer'd</hi> from the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:106959:265"/>
Sense of our own Integrity and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>AND this we are commanded to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after; so Heb. x.22. we are bid <hi>to draw near unto God,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in <hi>Confidence,</hi> or <hi>full assurance of faith,</hi> that is, in a <hi>firm</hi> Persuasion of Gods Love to us and our Interest in his Promises; which Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is to be founded upon an inward Sense of our having <hi>our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies wash'd with pure water</hi>; and accordingly Heb. vi.11. <hi>to be diligent in good works, to the full assurance of hope unto the end,</hi> i. e. to be so <hi>diligent</hi> in our Duty as that we may thereby acquire such a full <hi>Assurance</hi> of our Reward as may inable us to <hi>continue</hi> and <hi>hold out</hi> to the End. For so St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that 'tis by the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of our Vertue, and particularly of our <hi>love to one another,</hi> that we are <hi>to assure our hearts before God,</hi> 1 Joh. iii.14, 19. for, saith he v.21. <hi>if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God</hi>; and for this purpose, among others, the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us he <hi>wrote this Catholick Epistle,</hi> that true Christians might <hi>know and be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that they had eternal life,</hi> 1 Joh. v.13.</p>
                  <p>FROM all which 'tis evident, that 'tis our Duty to labour after such an <hi>Assurance</hi> of Heaven, as naturally ariseth from the
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:106959:265"/>
                     <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> Sense of our <hi>Sincerity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and the <hi>firm</hi> Belief of the <hi>Promise</hi> of eternal Life, to which our Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity intitles us. For when we are so far <hi>improved</hi> in Religion, as that upon an <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Surveigh of our selves we can feel our own <hi>Integrity,</hi> and sensibly perceive that our <hi>Intention</hi> is pure, our <hi>Resolution</hi> fixt, and our <hi>Heart</hi> intirely devoted to God, we may from thence most certainly infer our <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> to the Promise of Heaven. So that to the obtaining this <hi>Assurance,</hi> all that we have to do is, so far to <hi>purifie</hi> our Intentions from sinister Aims, and <hi>subdue</hi> our bad Inclination to our Resolution of Obedience, as that when ever we <hi>reflect</hi> upon and <hi>compare</hi> our selves with the <hi>Rule,</hi> our Conscience may be able without any Diffidence to pronounce us <hi>sincere</hi>; and then we may as <hi>certainly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our Interest in Heaven, as we can that Gods Promises are true; and if after we are thus far improved in Religion, we still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>unassured,</hi> it proceeds not from the Want of <hi>sufficient</hi> Evidence, but either from a <hi>melancholy</hi> Temper, or a <hi>weak</hi> Faith, or a <hi>misinformed</hi> Conscience; and whichsoever of these is the Cause of it, when that is once removed, we shall as plainly <hi>feel</hi> our own Sincerity, and therein our Interest in
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:106959:266"/>
Heaven, as we do now our <hi>bodily</hi> Passions. And having once attained this Assurance, 'twill <hi>animate</hi> our Hearts with an Heroick Courage against all Temptations, and carry us on with unspeakable <hi>Alacrity</hi> through all the remaining Stages of our Duty; it will <hi>invigorate</hi> our Endeavours, and <hi>wing</hi> our Activity, and make us all <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Exercises of our holy <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And as when the Christian Army, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a tedious march towards the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> came within view of the <hi>holy City,</hi> and beheld <hi>afar off</hi> the Towers and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> they were so <hi>Ecstacied</hi> with Joy that they made the Heavens <hi>ring</hi> with triumphant Shouts and Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as if that Sight had given <hi>new</hi> Souls to them, ran on upon their Enemies with a Courage that forced Victory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came; so when a good Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long <hi>Progress</hi> from one Degree of Vertue to another, is got so far as that from a certain <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Feeling</hi> of his own Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity he can discern the <hi>new Hierusalem</hi> above, and his own Interest in it, that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sight will fill him with so much <hi>Joy, Courage</hi> and <hi>Alacrity,</hi> that no Temptation for the future will be able to <hi>withstand</hi> or <hi>interrupt</hi> him. So that his Conscience will be always ringing with Acclamations of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:106959:266"/>
Victory, and the remainder of his March will be all a <hi>Triumphal Progress</hi> to him; and when he comes to the Conclusion of it, to die, and pass the Gate of this blessed City, the firm <hi>Assurance</hi> which he hath of Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, will <hi>dispel</hi> the Fears, <hi>sweeten</hi> the Troubles, and <hi>asswage</hi> the Pangs and Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the <hi>dolorous</hi> Passage. So that he will die not only with <hi>Peace,</hi> but with <hi>Joy,</hi> and go away into Eternity with <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> in his Mouth. If therefore we mean to bring this our spiritual Warfare to a <hi>happy</hi> Conclusion, it concerns us now while we have Opportunity, to labour after a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>well-grounded</hi> Assurance of Heaven.</p>

                  <p>HAVING in the foregoing Section de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed all those Duties which appertain to the <hi>last</hi> Part of our Christian Warfare, to wit, <hi>final Perseverance</hi>; and shewn how ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually they all contribute thereunto, I shall now according to my former Method, conclude with some <hi>Motives</hi> to <hi>press</hi> and <hi>persuade</hi> men to the Practice of them; all which I shall deduce from the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>urgent</hi> Necessity of our <hi>final</hi> Perseverance, to which those Duties are such necessary Helps and Means.

                     <pb n="488" facs="tcp:106959:268"/>
we are carried on <hi>secundo flumine,</hi> with a <hi>full Drift</hi> of Temptation and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. So that if when once we have <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sinn'd</hi> we do not <hi>immediately</hi> check our selves by Repentance, in all Probability we shall be driven farther <hi>back</hi> in a <hi>Day,</hi> than we shall be able to get <hi>forward</hi> in a <hi>Week.</hi> For your Progress in Religion lying <hi>up</hi> Hill, but your Apostacy <hi>down,</hi> you must expect when once you are <hi>falling</hi> to <hi>descend</hi> much <hi>faster</hi> than ever you <hi>ascended,</hi> and to get far sooner to the <hi>Bottom</hi> again than you can to the <hi>Top,</hi> though you should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fall just in the <hi>mid-way,</hi> and have no farther to the <hi>one</hi> than to the <hi>other.</hi> For 'tis hardly to be imagin'd what <hi>Strength</hi> a bad Inclination gets by a short <hi>Repast</hi> and <hi>Gratification</hi>; how when it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>pined away</hi> by a long Abstinence, a Taste of sinful Pleasure will <hi>raise</hi> and <hi>revive</hi> it, and render it as <hi>brisk</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; insomuch that it usually requires a great <hi>many</hi> Acts of Mortification, to re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish that Life and Strength it acquires in <hi>one</hi> short Gratification. For as the fierce <hi>Tyger</hi> after a long Confinement will lye down <hi>tamely</hi> in his Den, and by Degrees loose all his <hi>Fierceness</hi> and grow <hi>manageable</hi> and <hi>obsequious,</hi> but let him take but one warm Draught of Blood and his old <hi>savage</hi>
                     <pb n="489" facs="tcp:106959:268"/>
Nature immediately <hi>revives,</hi> and he grows as <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>outragious</hi> as ever; just so it is with our wicked Inclinations, which being reduced from their Excesses, and kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the close Confinement of a holy Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, will by Degrees grow <hi>tame</hi> and <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and forget the <hi>alluring</hi> Relishes of Sin, but if once we suffer them to <hi>break loose</hi> again, and to come at those sinful Pleasures from which they have been a long while <hi>alienated,</hi> they will soon recover their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Wildness,</hi> and become as <hi>head-strong</hi> and <hi>violent</hi> as ever. Wherefore it mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to have a great Care of all <hi>wilful Apostacies</hi>; for to be sure your <hi>first</hi> Slip will vehemently incline you to a <hi>second,</hi> and that more vehemently to a <hi>third,</hi> and so like men that are running <hi>head-long</hi> down Hill, the <hi>farther</hi> you go the more you will be <hi>prest forward</hi> by your own Weight, and the harder 'twill be for you to <hi>stop</hi> and <hi>reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> your selves. So that if you do not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> stop, you will by a <hi>few Days</hi> Sin lose back all the Ground you have got by <hi>many a Years</hi> Warfare; you will <hi>pull down</hi> more of your Religion by <hi>one</hi> wilful Sin, than you will be able to <hi>repair</hi> again by <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> a vertuous Action; and like some <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Drudges</hi> spend more in one <hi>mad Frolick,</hi> than you have earn'd by many a <hi>hard</hi> Days
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:106959:269"/>
Labour. And if you do thus, 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you should ever <hi>improve</hi>; for what you <hi>do</hi> in a <hi>Week,</hi> you will <hi>undo</hi> again in a Day, and so instead of pressing <hi>forward,</hi> you will dance in a <hi>Circle,</hi> and always <hi>end</hi> where you <hi>begun.</hi> So that unless you <hi>go on</hi> and <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere</hi> in wel-doing, all your Strife and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare against Sin will be but like <hi>rolling</hi> of a <hi>Sisyphus</hi> his Stone, which after you have been a <hi>long while</hi> raising to the Top of the Hill, will in a <hi>moment</hi> tumble down again upon you; so that either you must undergo the <hi>same</hi> Pains to raise it <hi>again,</hi> or <hi>lye down</hi> under it, and tamely suffer your selves to be <hi>crush'd</hi> into eternal Ruine by it.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. CONSIDER, if after we have made some Progress in Religion we <hi>totally Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse,</hi> we thereby forfeit the <hi>Fruit</hi> of all our <hi>past</hi> Labour. For so God himself by the Prophet pronounces in the Case, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xviii.24. <hi>When the Righteous turns away from his Righteousness, and commits iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth, shall he live? all his Righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned, in the trespass that he hath trespassed, and in the sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die,</hi> i. e. how good soever he may have been for the Time <hi>past,</hi> if he doth not <hi>persevere</hi> to the End, but <hi>wilfully relapse</hi>
                     <pb n="491" facs="tcp:106959:269"/>
into Folly and Wickedness, all the <hi>Vertue</hi> he hath exercised, and all the <hi>Good</hi> he hath done, shall be quite <hi>struck off</hi> from his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and never so much as <hi>mentioned</hi> to his Benefit and Advantage, but in that Wickedness wherein he is <hi>faln</hi> he shall as certainly perish as if all his Life had been a <hi>continued</hi> Act or <hi>uninterrupted</hi> Course of Iniquity. So also, <hi>Heb.</hi> x.38. <hi>if any shall draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</hi> And indeed this is a most necessary Effect of our <hi>Apostacy</hi>; for by <hi>falling off</hi> from our Christian Courese, we put our selves <hi>back</hi> into the same State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein we were before we <hi>enter'd</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and the <hi>Effect</hi> of all those good things which we did from the time we <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd upon</hi> to the Time we <hi>deserted</hi> it, will be so <hi>voided</hi> and <hi>abolish'd,</hi> that there will not remain the least <hi>Trace</hi> or <hi>Footstep</hi> of it in our Natures, but our <hi>Will</hi> will become as <hi>obstinate</hi> again, our <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites</hi> as <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>extravagant</hi> as if we had all long permitted them to run on in an <hi>uninterrupted</hi> Course of Iniquity. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus <hi>exinguisht</hi> all the <hi>good</hi> Effects of our past Warfare, and rendered by our <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Apostacy our Natures as <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved</hi> as ever, we shall thereby be exposed again to the <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Displeasure</hi> of God
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:106959:270"/>
For Gods <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> are unvariably determined to the <hi>same</hi> Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and herein consists their <hi>Immutability,</hi> not that he always <hi>loves</hi> or always <hi>hates</hi> the <hi>same</hi> persons, out of a <hi>unreasonable</hi> Prejudice to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that he always <hi>loves</hi> and always <hi>hates</hi> them for the <hi>same</hi> Reasons; and he hath expresly declared taht <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi> are the <hi>contrary</hi> Reasons of this his <hi>Contrary</hi> affection to his Creatures; which if it be, 'twill hence necessarilly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that as his <hi>Hatred</hi> must convert into <hi>Love</hi> to us when from <hi>wicked</hi> we become <hi>good,</hi> so his <hi>Love</hi> must convert into <hi>Hatred</hi> of us when from <hi>good</hi> we <hi>degenerate</hi> into <hi>wicked.</hi> Which Alteration of his Affection towards us, proceeds not from any change in <hi>his</hi> Nature but from a change in <hi>ours</hi>; he always proceeds upon <hi>steady</hi> and <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Priniciples, and is for ever <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> to the Reasons of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>; which he could not be, if he did not alter his <hi>Affection</hi> to us when the <hi>Reason</hi> of it is altered, if he did not <hi>abominate</hi> us when he sees us <hi>fallen</hi> and <hi>degenerated</hi> from that State of <hi>Goodness</hi> for teh sake of which he <hi>loved</hi> us and took <hi>pleasure</hi> in us. So that by wilfully <hi>retreating</hi> from our religious Progress, we do not only Extinguish all
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:106959:270"/>
those good <hi>Effects</hi> which it had <hi>produced</hi> in our Natures, not only <hi>revive</hi> those invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Lusts we had almost <hi>mortified,</hi> and <hi>blast</hi> those tender Graces which we had therein <hi>acquired</hi> and <hi>improved,</hi> but as a Consequence of this, we <hi>run</hi> out of Gods Arms and Embraces; and <hi>throw</hi> our selves <hi>head-long</hi> from those glorious Hopes to which we have been all this while <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> with so much Labour and Difficulty. What a Madness therefore is it for men to think of <hi>retreating</hi> that have once actually <hi>ingaged</hi> in the Christian Warfare, to <hi>surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> themselves back into Captivity to their Lusts, after they have fought so many <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats</hi> against, and obtained so many <hi>Victories</hi> over them! O consider but the great <hi>Pains</hi> you have been at, the many <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears, Abstinencies</hi> and <hi>Self-denials, Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi> and <hi>Convertion</hi> with your selves, that it hath cost you to <hi>retrieve</hi> your selves from the <hi>Dominion</hi> of Sin and the just <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> of God; and is it not a thousand Pities that all this should prove <hi>lost Labour</hi> in the End, and be rebder'd as <hi>fruitless</hi> and <hi>insignificant</hi> to us as if it had <hi>never</hi> been? that after you have taken so much Pains to <hi>stem</hi> the difficult <hi>Tyde,</hi> and are at last got within fight of <hi>Shore,</hi> you should now <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>yield</hi> to the Fury of it, and suffer your

selves to be <hi>born down</hi> by it again into that <hi>Ocean</hi> of Sin and Guilt out of which you were so safely recovered? Wherefore as you would not render <hi>your albour in vain in the Lord,</hi> and utterly defeat your selves of all the <hi>Fruit</hi> of your Religious <hi>Endeavours,</hi> be still persuaded to <hi>struggle</hi> and <hi>contend,</hi> to <hi>strive</hi> and <hi>press forward to the mark of your high-calling.</hi> For if now you <hi>slacken</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> your Endeavourse, <hi>yield</hi> to the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Temptation, you will soon be <hi>dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven down</hi> by it again as far from the <hi>Love</hi> of God and from the <hi>Hope</hi> of HEaven, as ever you were in the most <hi>degenerate</hi> State of your Natures.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. CONSIDER that if by <hi>willfully sinning</hi> we retreat from our Christian War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, we shall forfeit the Fruit of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after we have undergon the <hi>greatest Difficulty</hi> of it. For, as I shewed above, the <hi>main</hi> Difficulty of the Christian Warfare lies in the <hi>Entrance</hi> of it, and this I <hi>suppose</hi> you to have already past. You have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready indured those sharep <hi>Pangs</hi> and <hi>Throws</hi> that are wont to accompany the <hi>Birth</hi> of a new Resolution; you have undergon the hard <hi>Pennance</hi> of a deep and through Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, the sharp <hi>Stings</hi> and <hi>Remorses</hi> of a solemn and sorrowful Repentance; you have <hi>forc'd</hi> your most <hi>Importunate</hi> Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:106959:271"/>
and <hi>withstood</hi> the most <hi>violent</hi> Counter-struggling of a <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>denegerate</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; you have <hi>Conquered</hi> your Will in the Height of all its <hi>Obstinacy</hi> and <hi>Resistance,</hi> and <hi>Rescued</hi> it from the Arms of your Lusts when 'twas most <hi>inslaved</hi> and <hi>captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by them; all <hi>this</hi> you did, if you did any thing to any purpose, when you first <hi>entered</hi> upon this holy Walfare. And ever since, you have been <hi>breaking</hi> the Strength of your evil Inclinations, and <hi>conquering</hi> the Antipathies of your Nature to your Religion; in which if you have made any <hi>Progress,</hi> you must by this Time have <hi>broken the Heart</hi> of the Difficulty of your Warfare, and have much less Opposition to contend with <hi>than ever.</hi> So that now in all Probability, there is nothing so <hi>difficult</hi> between you and Heaven, as that which you have already <hi>ingaged</hi> with and <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted</hi>; and will you now turn your backs upon your Enemy, when his <hi>main</hi> Strength is <hi>spent,</hi> and you have already <hi>sustained</hi> the most violent <hi>Shocks</hi> of his Power? If you had <hi>retreated</hi> at the first <hi>Onset,</hi> when your Sin was seated in its Dominion, and you were yet but <hi>raising</hi> your Forces and <hi>arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> your Resolution against it, it had been much more <hi>excusable</hi>; for then you had the <hi>sharpest</hi> Part of your <hi>Conflict</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:106959:272"/>
being to contend with a <hi>flusht</hi> and a <hi>victorious</hi> Enemy, who having as yet all his Strength about him, could not fail to put your Courage to a mighty <hi>Tryal.</hi> But <hi>now</hi> to retreat, when you are <hi>past the worst,</hi> and have gotten above <hi>half Way</hi> through; when you have <hi>pulled down</hi> your Lust from its Throne and Dominion, and so far <hi>subdued</hi> it to your Religion and your Reason that you have henceforward no more to do but to <hi>pursue a Victory,</hi> which though you got with a great deal of <hi>Toil,</hi> you may finish with a great deal of <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Pleasure; now,</hi> I say, to retreat in such a prosperous <hi>Juncture,</hi> and give up the blessed <hi>Prize</hi> which you have been so long <hi>contending</hi> for, what <hi>des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Madness</hi> is it! If you had never <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun</hi> this Warfare, or yielded in the <hi>first</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of it, what a deal of <hi>Pains</hi> might you have <hi>saved?</hi> How many <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears, Struglings</hi> and <hi>Contentions</hi> with your selves might you have <hi>escaped</hi> and <hi>avoided,</hi> and at last been in as <hi>good</hi> a Condition, if not a <hi>better,</hi> than that wherein your <hi>Apostacy</hi> will certainly leave you? And when a man hath been so long taking Heaven by <hi>Storm</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> when he hath broken through so many <hi>Oppositions</hi> to come at it, and in Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite of all the <hi>Darts</hi> of Temptation from <hi>without,</hi> and of all the <hi>Weights</hi> and <hi>Pressures</hi>

of Inclination from <hi>within,</hi> he is gotten up as it were to the <hi>Top</hi> of the <hi>Scaling-Ladder,</hi> has laid hands on the <hi>Battlements</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and is ready to <hi>leap in</hi> and take <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi> of the Joys of it, what a Madness is it for him now to <hi>let go</hi> his <hi>Hold</hi> and tumble <hi>headlong</hi> down again into that Abyss of Sin and Misery out of which he had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himself with so much <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Difficulty!</hi> Especially considering</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. THAT by this our <hi>Relapse</hi> we shall not only forfeit the Fruit of our past La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but also render our <hi>Recovery</hi> more <hi>hazardous</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> than ever. For what the Apostle pronounces concerning <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states from Christianity,</hi> is in a great Measure applicable to those who having <hi>ingaged</hi> in the Christian Warfare, <hi>fall off</hi> from it again to their old <hi>sinful</hi> Courses; <hi>it is impossible,</hi> i. e. <hi>'tis extreamly difficult, for those that were once enlightned, and have tasted of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the World to come; if they fall away, to renew them again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> Heb. vi.4, 5, 6. For besides that by <hi>falling</hi> from his first Repentance, a man <hi>grieves</hi> and <hi>chases</hi> the Holy Spirit <hi>from him,</hi> without whose Aid he can neither <hi>stand</hi> when he is <hi>up,</hi> nor <hi>recover</hi> when he is <hi>faln</hi>;
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:106959:273"/>
and having <hi>Chased him away,</hi> he cannot well expect that he will be so ready to <hi>return</hi> and <hi>co-operate</hi> with him after he hath treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him so <hi>rudely</hi> by <hi>quenching</hi> his Motions, <hi>unraveling</hi> his Workmanship, and <hi>extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing</hi> all those heavenly Effects which his Grace had produced in his Soul. For how can this blessed <hi>Assistant</hi> of Souls but take it in great <hi>Disdain</hi> to be thus <hi>mock'd</hi> and <hi>disappointed,</hi> when he had been so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously <hi>labouring</hi> for a Wretches Good, to lift him out of the Mire wherein he was <hi>sunk</hi> and <hi>perishing</hi>; and when he had <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded</hi> so far in his Labour as to help him <hi>quite out,</hi> and was <hi>washing</hi> and <hi>cleansing</hi> his polluted Spirit and <hi>dressing</hi> it for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of the Father of spirits, to see this Wretch <hi>turn back</hi> after all, and <hi>plung</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self headlong into the Mire again, how can he but <hi>resent</hi> such an ungrateful Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of his Labour with unspeakable <hi>Grief</hi> and Indignation? And if upon such <hi>Resentment</hi> he <hi>should,</hi> as he justly <hi>may,</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>retire</hi> from him, and <hi>leave</hi> him forever to wallow in his own Hearts Lust, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition will not be only <hi>dangerous,</hi> but <hi>des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</hi> What the blessed Spirit <hi>will</hi> do in this Case, I cannot certainly determine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>may</hi> do as he <hi>pleases,</hi> being totally <hi>released</hi> by the Sinners Apostacy from all
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:106959:273"/>
Obligation of <hi>Promise.</hi> But it makes my Heart <hi>ake</hi> to think, how much Reason there is to <hi>fear</hi> that he will <hi>utterly forsake</hi> and <hi>abandon</hi> him, and not <hi>throw away</hi> any more of his Grace upon a Wretch on whom he hath already spent so much to <hi>no purpose.</hi> And if the heinous <hi>Affront</hi> which the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit receives by your <hi>Apostacy</hi> should put him upon <hi>this</hi> Resolution, you are damn'd <hi>above-ground,</hi> and <hi>everlastingly</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of all Hopes of Recovery. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all <hi>this,</hi> (which one would think should be sufficient to <hi>startle</hi> any sober Man from making such a desperate <hi>Experiment</hi>) by <hi>falling off</hi> from your Repentance, you must needs be supposed to offer a mighty <hi>Violence</hi> to your Consciences; which having been already <hi>awaken'd</hi> into a through Sense of your <hi>past</hi> Sins, must necessarily reflect upon your <hi>present</hi> Apostacy with unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Affrightment</hi>; which if it doth not presently <hi>scare</hi> ye back again to Repentance, will put ye upon more <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> Courses than ever. For now if your Conscience won't be <hi>quiet,</hi> you have no other Remedy but to <hi>ruffle</hi> with it, and <hi>out-brave</hi> its Horrors by being more <hi>couragiously</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as those barbarous Parents that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed their Children to <hi>Moloch</hi> were fain to make Noises round the burning Idol with
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:106959:274"/>
                     <hi>Drums</hi> and <hi>Timbrels</hi> to drown their dying <hi>Shrieks</hi> and <hi>Grones,</hi> least they should move them to Compassion; so when by your <hi>wilful Relapses</hi> you have <hi>sacrificed</hi> your Conscience to your Lust, and it begins to <hi>Shriek out</hi> from among those Flames of Guilt whereinto you have cast it, you have no other Remedy, unless you repent <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi> but to make a <hi>Tophet</hi> round about it, and <hi>drown</hi> its <hi>Out cries</hi> in Excesses of Riot; to put your selves into a <hi>tumultuous Hurry</hi> of Wickedness and Folly, that you may not hear those <hi>ill-boding Shrieks</hi> within, and <hi>sear</hi> over the Wounds of your Conscience with a <hi>thick</hi> Custom of Sinning, that they may neither <hi>bleed</hi> nor <hi>smart.</hi> So that if once you turn <hi>Recreant</hi> to your Christian Warfare, you will be forced, in your own Defence, to plung your selves <hi>deeper</hi> into Sin than ever. For now you must sin not only to <hi>greatifie</hi> your Lusts, but to <hi>stupifie</hi> your Conscience, and this last you can never do without being <hi>excessively</hi> wicked. You must now be <hi>puny</hi> Sinners no longer, if ever you intend to sin <hi>quietly,</hi> but resolve to turn <hi>Heroes</hi> in Iniquity, and <hi>out-sin</hi> your natural Sense of Good and Evil. In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you must give your wounded Spirit <hi>Gash</hi> after <hi>Gash,</hi> and <hi>follow the Blow</hi> till you have left it <hi>past feeling</hi>; you must <hi>heap on</hi>
                     <pb n="501" facs="tcp:106959:274"/>
Loads of Guilt upon your Conscience till with the continued <hi>Pressure</hi> you have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it <hi>callous</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi>; and when by this means you have <hi>sunk</hi> your selves <hi>deeper</hi> into Sin than ever (as you will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>soon</hi> do) how much more <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>hazardous</hi> must your Recovery be? For now you will <hi>need</hi> much <hi>more</hi> Assistance than ever you did in your <hi>first</hi> Repentance, and have much <hi>less</hi> Reason to <hi>expect</hi> it. So that though I dare not say your Condition will be <hi>desperate</hi>; yet I must tell ye 'twill be so <hi>fearfully dangerous,</hi> that unless God out of a <hi>peculiar</hi> Mercy to ye, <hi>awake</hi> ye by some <hi>extraordinary</hi> providence, and at the same time <hi>co-operate</hi> with ye by an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> Grace, you must certainly <hi>miscarry</hi> for ever.</p>

CONSIDER that by your <hi>deserting</hi> of the Christian Warfare, you will not only render your <hi>future</hi> Recovery more difficult, but you will also plung your selves <hi>for the present</hi> into a far more <hi>guilty</hi> and <hi>criminal</hi> Condition than ever. For thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> determines in the Case, 2 Pet. ii.20, 21. <hi>if after they have escap'd the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, through the knowledg of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again intangled therein, and overcome, the later end is worse with them than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:106959:275"/>
For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness; then after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandement</hi>; that is, by <hi>relapsing</hi> into those sinful Pollutions out of which they had been <hi>rescued</hi> by the Belief and Knowledg of Christianity, they have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themselves much more <hi>guilty,</hi> than they were before when they were <hi>Infidels</hi>; so that if they had never been <hi>acquainted</hi> with the Gospel, nor taken <hi>one</hi> Step in the Pathes of its holy Commandements, it had been much <hi>better</hi> for them, and God would have been much less <hi>angry</hi> and <hi>displeased</hi> with them. For by our <hi>Apostacy</hi> into a wicked Life, we do not only return back into as <hi>bad</hi> at least, if not a <hi>worse</hi> Condition than ever; but,</p>
                  <p>First, We do also <hi>make void</hi> all those <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of the Spirit of God, by which we were so <hi>effectually</hi> persuaded to <hi>undertake,</hi> and hitherto to <hi>prosecute</hi> the Christian War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. By <hi>relapsing</hi> into a state of Sin again, we wilfully <hi>undo</hi> all that he hath been <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> we <hi>revive</hi> those Lusts which he hath been <hi>mortifying,</hi> and <hi>root up</hi> those Graces which he hath been <hi>planting</hi> and <hi>watering</hi> within us; and when with great <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> he hath <hi>drest</hi> and <hi>cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated</hi> our Nature, pluckt up the <hi>Weeds</hi> of
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:106959:275"/>
it and planted it with the <hi>Flowers</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we wilfully <hi>spoil</hi> and <hi>lay it wast</hi> again, and turn his growing <hi>Sharon</hi> into a barren <hi>Wilderness.</hi> So that besides all that <hi>Guilt</hi> which arises from those sinful Courses whereinto we are <hi>relapst,</hi> we are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty of the greatest <hi>Outrage</hi> to the Spirit of God; we are guilty of <hi>destroying</hi> the dearest Fruits of his Labour, of <hi>laying wast</hi> his Inclosures, <hi>quenching</hi> his Motions; <hi>extinguishing</hi> his Graces, and <hi>strangling</hi> all those heavenly Effects which he by his powerful Goodness had <hi>produced</hi> in our Natures. And what a <hi>black</hi> Aggravation of our Guilt must it be, thus to <hi>baffle</hi> and <hi>disappoint</hi> the Spirit of God? But then</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As by our <hi>Apostacy</hi> we offer the rudest <hi>Affront</hi> to the Holy Spirit, so we commit the greatest <hi>Violence</hi> both upon our <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Experience.</hi> For in all <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacies</hi> we sin with an <hi>awakened</hi> Conscience, with the <hi>Convictions</hi> of our Guilt <hi>glaring</hi> in our Eyes, and are fain to <hi>contend</hi> and <hi>struggle</hi> with our own Mind, before we can break through those <hi>Checks</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints</hi> it lays upon us, which must needs be a great <hi>Aggravation</hi> of our Guilt. For the more <hi>light</hi> and <hi>persuasion</hi> a man sins against, the more of <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> there is in his Sin, and consequently the more of
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:106959:276"/>
                     <hi>Guilt.</hi> For what can be more <hi>Malicious,</hi> than for a man to <hi>dare</hi> and <hi>defie</hi> his own Convictions, and <hi>charge</hi> into the very Mouth of them, while they are <hi>spitting fire</hi> and <hi>roring</hi> everlasting Ruine against him? This plainly shews him to be acted by a <hi>desperate</hi> Resolution, when for the sake of his Lusts he dares <hi>confront</hi> the <hi>Terrors</hi> of his Conscience, and rather than be <hi>barred</hi> the Enjoyment of them, he will plunge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>headlong</hi> into a <hi>foreseen</hi> Ruine, and <hi>leap</hi> after them into Hell with his <hi>Eyes open.</hi> And yet <hi>thus</hi> we do in all our <hi>wilful Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>; we sin against the <hi>quickest</hi> Sense of our Danger, the <hi>loudest</hi> Warnings of our Conscience, and the <hi>clearest</hi> Convictions of our Reason; which being all most <hi>horrid</hi> Aggravations, must needs <hi>swell up</hi> our Guilt to a <hi>monstrous</hi> Proportion. Neither do we sin only against our <hi>Conscience,</hi> but also against our <hi>Experience.</hi> For it is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that we have made some <hi>Proof</hi> and <hi>Tryal</hi> of Religion, and having done so, we must needs be sensible that there is nothing in it but what is <hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>practicable</hi> and highly for our <hi>Good</hi>; nothing but what tends to the <hi>Tranquility</hi> of our Minds, the <hi>Peace</hi> of our Consciences, and the <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of our Natures; and being throughly <hi>assured</hi> of all this, and that not so much by
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:106959:276"/>
                     <hi>Discourse</hi> as by our own <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> what a <hi>horrid</hi> Baseness would it be, if notwithstanding <hi>this</hi> we should <hi>renounce</hi> and <hi>desert</hi> it? If we had never <hi>tryed</hi> it, we might have urged our <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>Experience</hi> as an Apology for our <hi>Refusal</hi> to submit to it; we might have pretended that for Want of a more intimate <hi>Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> with it, we lookt upon its Commands as <hi>impossible,</hi> or at least as very <hi>difficult</hi> and altogether <hi>fruitless</hi> and <hi>ungrateful</hi> to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and that if we had once <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed</hi> with it, we must have presently <hi>renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> every thing that is <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and from thenceforth have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to <hi>sigh away</hi> our Lives in <hi>unsufferable</hi> Severities and a <hi>melancholy</hi> Retirement from all the <hi>Joys</hi> and <hi>Festivities</hi> of humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; for such <hi>frightful</hi> Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons men that are <hi>unexperienced</hi> in Religion, are apt to make of it; which though it be far from <hi>justifying,</hi> may in some Measure <hi>extenuate</hi> their Enmity to it. But you that have <hi>tryed</hi> Religion, must needs have <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced</hi> that all this is <hi>false</hi>; that its Commands are easie <hi>enough</hi> to a <hi>willing</hi> Mind, and that the many <hi>Advantages</hi> they bring with them do abundantly <hi>compensate</hi> for their <hi>Difficulty</hi>; that they are so far from <hi>barring</hi> men any <hi>innocent</hi> Pleasure, or
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:106959:277"/>
Comfort of humane Life, that they <hi>purifie</hi> the Pleasures of it, and render them more <hi>grateful</hi> and <hi>generous</hi>; that besides this, they bring mighty Pleasures of <hi>their own</hi> along with them, the Pleasures of a <hi>glorious</hi> Hope, a <hi>serene</hi> Mind, a <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>undisturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Conscience, which are such as do far <hi>out-relish</hi> the most <hi>studied</hi> and <hi>artificial</hi> Luxuries; all this you cannot but <hi>know,</hi> if you have made any considerable <hi>Tryal</hi> of a <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>wel-advised</hi> Religion. So that if <hi>now</hi> you <hi>Apostatize,</hi> you will not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front your <hi>Conscience,</hi> but your <hi>Experience</hi> too; and the <hi>past</hi> Sense you have had of the <hi>Goodness</hi> of Religion, will <hi>rise up</hi> in Judgment against ye, and for ever <hi>silence</hi> all the <hi>Excuses</hi> you can urge for your selves, and leave ye nothing to say, but that you were <hi>sick</hi> of your <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>tired</hi> with the <hi>Refreshments</hi> of Religion. But then</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As your <hi>Apostacy</hi> will be a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Affront to the Spirit of God and to your own Conscience and Experience, so 'twill be one of the <hi>foulest Dishonours</hi> that you can cast upon <hi>Religion.</hi> If you had never been <hi>ingaged</hi> in the Christian Warfare, the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of Religion could never have been so nearly <hi>touch'd</hi> by your wicked Courses, and all considering Men would have attributed your <hi>Enmity</hi> to it, to your <hi>Ignorance</hi> and
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:106959:277"/>
                     <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Experience,</hi> and never have thought the <hi>worse</hi> of it when they saw it so <hi>contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously treated</hi> by one that was never <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted</hi> with it. But if <hi>now</hi> you revolt into wicked Courses after you have made <hi>Tryal</hi> of it, what will the World say? Look ye, here is one that hath made an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment</hi> of the Religion you so much <hi>cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate,</hi> and which you <hi>extol</hi> and <hi>cry up</hi> for such a <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> thing; if it <hi>were</hi> what you <hi>pretend,</hi> how comes it to pass that after so long <hi>Tryal</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of it, this man should now at last <hi>renounce</hi> and <hi>forsake</hi> it? Which is such an <hi>Objection,</hi> as can be no otherwise <hi>solv'd</hi> but by <hi>demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> the man whose Apostacy <hi>started</hi> it, to be <hi>forsaken</hi> and <hi>abandoned</hi> of his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For if upon the <hi>Tryal</hi> he hath made of Religion, he had experienced it to be that <hi>good</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> thing it is <hi>represented,</hi> it is not to be imagined he would ever have <hi>revolted</hi> from it, had he been capable to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate</hi> of his own <hi>Choices</hi> and <hi>Actions.</hi> And how can they that are <hi>Strangers</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion forbear <hi>suspecting</hi> the <hi>Goodness</hi> of it, when they see a man, after <hi>Tryal,</hi> and in his <hi>right Senses,</hi> declare by his Actions that Vice is <hi>better</hi> and more <hi>eligible</hi> than Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and do behold the <hi>Pleasures</hi> of Sin <hi>prefer'd</hi> before the <hi>Joys</hi> and <hi>Satisfactions</hi> of
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:106959:278"/>
Religion, by one that hath made a through <hi>Experiment</hi> of them both? So that by <hi>Apostatising</hi> into <hi>sinful</hi> Courses after a through <hi>Tryal</hi> of Religion, we take an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Course to <hi>defame</hi> and <hi>scandalize</hi> it, to render it <hi>a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence</hi> to those that have had but <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no</hi> Acquaintance with it; and if by our <hi>Example</hi> any should be <hi>disheartned</hi> either from <hi>entering</hi> into or <hi>proceeding</hi> in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Warfare, their Blood will be one day required at <hi>our Hands,</hi> and so we shall raise a most <hi>fearful</hi> Cry upon ourselves, and have not only the Spirit of God and our own Conscience and Experience, but also the Blood of all those Souls who have <hi>stumbled</hi> at our Apostacy lifting up their Cries to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Tribunal of God for a <hi>dire</hi> and <hi>speedy</hi> Vengeance against us.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. CONSIDER, if after you have made some <hi>Progress</hi> in Religion you <hi>revolt</hi> into sinful Courses, you will not only ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your selves for the <hi>present</hi> more guilty, but, as a Consequence of that, you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly expose your selves, if you die before your <hi>Recovery,</hi> to a <hi>deeper</hi> and more <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Ruine. For this we may depend upon, that the Judg of all the World will do <hi>righteously,</hi> and consequently, that as on the one hand he will proportion his <hi>Rewards</hi>
                     <pb n="509" facs="tcp:106959:278"/>
to our <hi>Services,</hi> so on the other he will measure his <hi>Punishments</hi> by our <hi>Guilts</hi> and <hi>Demerits</hi>; and if he <hi>thus</hi> proceed (as he most <hi>certainly</hi> will) how horrible is it to think of the <hi>black</hi> and <hi>dismal</hi> Fate that hangs over the Heads of <hi>Apostates,</hi> whose Guilt being <hi>aggravated</hi> by those <hi>above-named</hi> Circumstances to such a <hi>prodigious</hi> Bulk and Magnitude, must be supposed to draw after it a Punishment <hi>proportionable</hi>? And if so, then doubtless the Portion of <hi>Apostates</hi> among <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>miserable</hi> Spirits will be the most <hi>wretched</hi> &amp; <hi>deplorable.</hi> For besides those <hi>supernumerary</hi> Stripes they must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to receive from God, as being Servants that have <hi>known</hi> their Masters Will, and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced</hi> the Goodness of it, and yet have finally <hi>refused</hi> to <hi>comply</hi> with it, their refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on their own <hi>Apostacy,</hi> and the <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Madness</hi> of it will doubtless <hi>gall</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> them a thousand times more than all the other <hi>Stings</hi> of their Conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For how must it <hi>inrage</hi> them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselves, to <hi>ruminate</hi> on their own Follies, as they are <hi>wandering</hi> through the Infernal Shades! O <hi>desperate</hi> Creatures! from what <hi>glorious</hi> Hopes have we <hi>precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated</hi> our selves into this <hi>dismal</hi> State! We had once got a <hi>fair</hi> Way <hi>onwards</hi> to Heaven, and were arived within <hi>Sight</hi> of
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:106959:279"/>
its blessed <hi>Shores</hi>: we had <hi>shaken off</hi> our Lusts, <hi>mastered</hi> our Inclinations and <hi>subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> our Wills to the Will of God; and in so doing had <hi>conquered</hi> the most <hi>difficult</hi> Part of our Voyage; we had weathered the <hi>cross Winds</hi> of Temptation from <hi>without,</hi> and <hi>stem'd</hi> the <hi>Tide</hi> of corrupt Nature <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> so that had we but bore up couragiously a <hi>little farther,</hi> we that are now <hi>howling</hi> among damned Ghosts, might have been <hi>triumphing</hi> with blessed Spirits. But O <hi>abominable</hi> Fools and Traytors to our selves! after all the <hi>successful</hi> Pains we had taken to be <hi>happy,</hi> we have <hi>shipwrack'd</hi> our Souls at the <hi>Mouth</hi> of our <hi>Harbour</hi>; and to <hi>gratifie</hi> a base Lust, have leapt <hi>headlong</hi> from the Brinks of the <hi>Rivers of Pleasure,</hi> into this <hi>Lake of fire and Brimstone.</hi> And have we <hi>thus</hi> undone our selves, <hi>thus</hi> madly, <hi>thus</hi> without Pretence or Temptation! <hi>O! cursed</hi> be our Folly, <hi>cursed</hi> be our Lusts, and <hi>for ever cursed</hi> be <hi>we</hi> for <hi>harbouring</hi> and <hi>entertaining</hi> them! Thus will these misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble People incessantly <hi>rave</hi> against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and with <hi>dire</hi> Reflections on their <hi>desperate</hi> Follies for ever <hi>inrage</hi> and <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> their own Torments. So that were I <hi>descending</hi> to the bottomless Pit, and had but <hi>so much</hi> Time before I came there, as to make <hi>one</hi> Prayer more in my own Behalf,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:106959:279"/>
                     <hi>next</hi> to that of being <hi>wholly delivered</hi> thence, I know none I should <hi>sooner</hi> pitch upon, than <hi>this, O Lord deliver me from that Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hell, which thou hast reserved for Apostates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SO that if now that we have so far <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged</hi> our selves in the Christian Warfare, we should be so mad as to <hi>retreat</hi> into our old sinful Courses, it had been a thousand times <hi>better</hi> for us that we had never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it <hi>at all.</hi> For unless we repent of our <hi>Retreat,</hi> and <hi>come on</hi> again, we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a great deal of <hi>Pains</hi> in Religion to no <hi>other</hi> Purpose, but only to <hi>to treasure up to our selves wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> the <hi>Furnace</hi> of our future Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yet <hi>seven times hotter.</hi> Wherefore since the Matter is now reduced to this Issue, that if we <hi>revolt</hi> from our Christian Warfare we shall not only <hi>defeat</hi> our selves of all the Fruit of our <hi>past</hi> Labour and Contentions, but also <hi>inhance</hi> our <hi>future</hi> Punishment; so that we must either resolve to <hi>win</hi> Heaven by our <hi>Perseverance,</hi> or <hi>sink our selves</hi> into the neithermost Hell by our <hi>Apostacy</hi>; let us pull up our Courage, and mangre all Temptations to the contrary, continue <hi>steadfast</hi> and <hi>immoveable</hi> in our Christian Resolution, remembring what

the <hi>Captain of our Salvation</hi> hath promised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rev. iii.21. <hi>To him that overcomes, will I grant to sit with me in my Throne, even as I also overcame, and am sat down with my Father in his Throne.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V. Containing some short <hi>Directions</hi> for the more profitable reading the preceding Discourse, and also for the Conduct and regular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of our <hi>Closet Religion</hi> in all the different States of the <hi>Christian Life;</hi> together with <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>private Devotion</hi> fitted to each State.</head>
               <p>IN the foregoing Chapter I have indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured a full Account of all those <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Duties</hi> of Christianity by which we are to <hi>acquire, improve</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> the principal Vertues of it, in the Perfection of which Vertues <hi>Heaven</hi> which is the great <hi>End</hi> of Christianity consists. And for the more distinct management thereof, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered men under a threefold State; first as <hi>entering</hi> into the Christian Life; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>actually ingaged</hi> in the Course of it; thirdly as <hi>improving</hi> towards Perfection by Perseverance in it; and gave a distinct account of all those Instrumental Duties that are proper to <hi>each</hi> of these States. And now that what hath been said in that and the preceding Chapters may have its due Effect upon the Readers Mind, I have
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:106959:281"/>
thought fit to reduce it to Practice by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting men,</p>
               <p>First, how to <hi>read</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> the several parts of it to their own particular States;</p>
               <p>Secondly, By furnishing them with some short <hi>Rules</hi> for the more profitable Exercise of their <hi>private Religion</hi> in each of those different States, together with <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>private Devotion</hi> fitted to each State.</p>
               <p n="1">I. AS to the first of these, it is to be considered, that to the making men <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> Christians, it is highly necessary that they should have a right understanding, First, of the Nature of the great and chief <hi>End</hi> which Christianity proposes to them; Secondly, of the <hi>Means</hi> by which that End is to be obtained; Thirdly, of the natural Tendency of all the <hi>Vertues</hi> of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards this <hi>blessed End,</hi> and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Tendency of the opposite <hi>Vices</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their <hi>eternal Misery</hi> and <hi>Ruin.</hi> Of all which I have indeavoured to give an Account in the <hi>three first</hi> Chapters of this Book. Wherefore I would advise the Reader,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Carefully</hi> and <hi>seriously</hi> to peruse those Chapters wherein (because I have been sometimes forc'd by the <hi>sublimity</hi> of my Argument to discourse a little more <hi>abstruse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> than in any of the following Parts) it
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:106959:281"/>
will be necessary for him to imploy more of his <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Consideration,</hi> and not to content himself with a <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>cursory</hi> Perusal. And when by a serious Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what hath been there discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, his Mind is fully convinc'd what a kind of <hi>Heaven</hi> he is to expect hereafter, what kinds of <hi>Means</hi> are necessary to obtain it, how naturally all the <hi>Vertues</hi> of Religion do <hi>raise up</hi> mens Souls to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and how all the contrary <hi>Vices</hi> do as naturally <hi>sink</hi> and <hi>press</hi> them down to <hi>Hell,</hi> it is to be hop'd he will be fully persuaded of the indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Necessity of <hi>entering</hi> into the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Life</hi>; which if he be, I would advise him,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Seriously</hi> to read over and consider the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> Sections of the <hi>fourth</hi> Chapter, wherein are contained the several Duties which are proper to his State of <hi>Entrance</hi> into the <hi>Christian Life,</hi> and also proper <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> to ingage him to the Practice of them; which if he would read to good Effect, he must by no means content himself with a <hi>single Perusal,</hi> but read them over at least <hi>once a week</hi> whilst he continues in that State, till he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehends the <hi>Meaning</hi> and Use of all those <hi>Duties</hi> and the <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Cogency</hi> of those, <hi>Arguments</hi>; which if he do, it is
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:106959:282"/>

Particularly I beseech thee to give me a right understanding of the urgent need I have of a Saviour, and of all those things which he hath done and suffered, and is still doing at thy right hand in order to the cleansing my guilty and polluted Nature, and restoring me to thy Grace and Favour; that so hereby I may be fully convinced how odious my Sins are in thy sight, how base and vile they have rendered me, and at what a mighty Distance they have set me from thee, and that being convinced of this I may put on a holy Shame and Confusion, and abhor my self in dust and ashes before thee. Thou knowest, O Lord, it is not in my power to soften this hard and unrelenting Heart and affect it with that Godly sorrow which is requisite to work a true Repentance. O do thou smite it with such a sharp and piercing sense of my Sins, as may cause the floods of unfeigned
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:106959:285"/>
Grief and Contrition to gush forth from it. Cause me to bleed for my sins now, that I may not bleed for them for ever; and that having felt the Smart and Anguish of them, I may utterly detest and abhor them, and never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to them more. Thus do thou assist me, O good God, in the Exercise of all these Duties, till thou hast throughly conquered my Will by them, and prepared it for a firm Resolution to forsake all ungodliness and worldly lusts and to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world. And now that I am going into the world among those very Temptations that have hitherto so miserably captivated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved me, O let thy blessed Spirit be present with me to keep my drousie Conscience awake, and arm me against them with his holy Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that so those good Thoughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires which thou hast at present excited in me, may stick fast upon my Soul in the midst of my worldly Occasions, and never cease impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning my Conscience, Will and Affections, till they have produc'd in me the happy Effect of a serious and hearty Repentance.

I know, O Lord,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:106959:286"/>
that I am striving for my immortal Life, and accordingly as I succeed I expect to be happy or miserable for ever. I have seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Reasons on both sides, and am fully satisfied in my mind that there is infinitely more Force in thy Promises and Threats, than in all the Difficulties of my Duty and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of my sin. But after all this, I find a law in my Members warring against the law in my Mind, a perverse Will that rejects the counsels of my Reason, that makes obstinate Reservations of some beloved Sins, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to some particular Duties in despite of all the persuasion of my Reason and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. So that after all my Endeavours I am still detain'd in Captivity to the law of sin that is in my Members, and am not able to incline my self to an intire Resolution of Amendment. O wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of Sin and Death! I know, O Lord, though I am weak and impotent, and of my self unable to shake off the Chains and Fetters of my Lusts, yet thy Grace is abundantly sufficient to rescue and deliver me from them; and thou hast promised to assist with it my honest Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and crown them with a blessed Success. Wherefore for thy Truth and Mercies sake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suffer not thy poor Creature who with pitiful and bemoaning Looks cries out for help to thee,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:106959:287"/>
to spend himself in weary and fruitless Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings against this violent Torrent of my sinful Nature, which without thy aid will quickly overcome my poor Endeavours and drive me down into eternal Perdition. My sole Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is upon thee, my Hope of Success is wholly in thee, help, Lord, help or else I perish; stretch forth thy powerful Arm to my sinking Soul, and let not this Deep swallow me up; but do thou so quicken my faint Endeavours, so strengthen my weak and doubting Faith, so enliven my cold and languid Considerations, so clear up my Convictions of my need of a Saviour and of the Danger and Odiousness of my Sins, and thereby so increase my peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Sorrows and Remorses, as that by all these means together my obstinate Will may at last be conquered, and effectually persuaded to part with every Sin, be it never so dear to me, and to comply with every Duty, be it never so cross to my vile Inclinations. Then shall I freely resign up my self unto thee, and with a firm Resolution devote all my Powers to thy Service. And that I may do so, and by so doing be reconciled to thee, O my offended God, before I go hence and be no more seen, receive me I beseech thee into thy protection this Night, that I may yet see the light of another Day, and have a longer space to finish my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.

I adore thy Grace, that after so many heinous provocations I have given thee for which thou mightest have justly shut thine ears against me for ever, thou hast heard my Cries and pitied my Misery, and thus far contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards my Recovery. I acknowledg 'tis by thy Grace that I am what I am, that this stubborn Heart begins at last to relent, this perverse Will to bow and stoop, these lewd Affections to hunger and thirst after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; that now at last my foolish soul is persuaded to part with those sins which are its Plagues and Infelicities, and to imbrace those blessed Duties by which thou hast designed to raise me to immortal Glory. By these good Beginnings thou hast given me some Reason to hope for a happy Success upon my poor Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Praised be thy Grace, I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent heartily willing to be thine, and were I but sure to continue thus minded and disposed, I would immediately make over my Heart and Will to thee by the most solemn Engagement. But, O Lord, I am afraid of my self, I dread my own Inconstancy, and thou knowest I have too much Reason for it. I have mocked thee too often already with my deceitful Promises and Engagements; I have sin'd and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Amendment, I have promised Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and then sin'd again, as if all that I meant by my Promises, were only to ask leave
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:106959:288"/>
of thee to sin against thee anew. Now after so many Falsifications I would not for all the World deal treacherously with thee any more; wherefore before I solemnly resign and devote my self to thee by a new Purpose and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I desire to make some farther Tryal of my own Stedfastness, to see whether this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Inclination of my Will be the effect of Passion or a setled Judgment. In the mean time therefore I do most humbly beseech thee to be present with me in all my ways, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to influence my Mind with thy Grace and Spirit; to strengthen my Faith, to fix my Consideration, to persuade my Will, and feed and cherish these my holy Desires with good Thoughts and Inspirations, that so I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main stedfast and immoveable, and no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation whatsoever may be able to alter the Temper of my mind or divert it from its good Inclination; and that having had a sufficient Experience of the fixed Disposition of my Soul to obey thee, I may devote my self to thee with a chearful Heart and an assured Hope of my own Sincerity and Constancy.

O blessed be thy great Name, that after so many years Rebellion against thee, for which I have long ago deserved to be banish'd into utter Darkness, I do yet behold the light of another Day, and am allowed a farther Space to repent and execute my Purpose of Amendment. And now, O Lord, as thou hast wrought my Will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a good Resolution in despite of all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Inclinations of my Nature, leave not I beseech thee thy Workmanship unfinish'd, but by the mighty Operation of thy Grace excite and inable me faithfully to perform what I have so seriously resolved. It is a mighty Work that I have undertaken, to cleanse a base polluted Nature, and root up all its filthy Lusts and Affections, and plant it with all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Dispositions, and improve them into everlasting Happiness; and thou knowest what strong Oppositions will be made against me, and with what powerful Temptations I must struggle throughout the whole Course of my future Endeavour. So that unless thou wilt still go along with me, and still quicken and animate me by thy blessed Spirit, my Work is so great, and my Strength so little, that it will be in vain for me to proceed any farther.

These importunate Temptations that surround me will quickly conquer my present Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and I shall do, as I have too often done already, resolve and sin, and sin and resolve, and so increase my Guilt by the Treachery of my Vows and Engagements. Wherefore, for Jesus Christ his sake, withdraw not thy self from me, but continue to assist my weak En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours by thy powerful Grace, till thou hast crown'd them with a perfect Victory. For which End, I beseech thee inspire me more and more with Patience and Constancy of Mind, that I may stand fast in my good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in despite of all Temptations to the contrary. Suggest to my Mind those holy Examples thou hast set before me, especially that of my blessed Saviour and incline my Heart to coppy and imitate them. Direct me to some wise and faithful Guide, that may be willing and able to assist me in all my spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Necessities; and by frequently exciting me to dedicate my Actions to thee, do thou purifie my Intentions from sinful and from carnal Aims, that so I may always live to thy Glory. And since thou art present with me wherever I am, and dost always behold me whatsoever I am doing, O do thou inspire me with such a strong continual and actual Sense of it, as may be a constant Check to my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inclinations, and render me afraid of
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:106959:291"/>
offending thee. Let thy blessed Spirit be my constant Monitor, to put me in mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider my Ways, and frequently to examine my Actions, that so whenever I go astray I may be immediatly convinc'd of it, and by my speedy Repentance recover my self before I have wandered too far from my Duty. And grant I beseech thee that the sense of my past Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may still render me more watchful and circumspect for the future ; that whensoever I have been carelesly or wilfully faulty, I may from thenceforth be more cautious of my Actions, and more vigilant against the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that betrayed me. And that I may not run my self unnecessarily into Temptation for the future, preserve me, O Lord, from sloth and idleness, and from intermedling with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that do not belong to me, and do thou still put me in mind to do my own Business, and to be faithful and diligent in the State and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherein thou hast placed me. And that I may always serve thee with Freedom and Alacrity, remove from me I beseech thee all unprofitable Sadness and Melancholy, and help me to acquire an equal Tranquillity of Mind, and a becoming Chearfulness of Spirit. For which end, Good Lord, do thou inspire me with a lively Sense and earnest Expectation of that blissful State towards which I am travelling; that having this glorious Prospect always in my
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:106959:292"/>
Eye, I may go on with Joy and Triumph over all the Difficulties and Temptations that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose me. And that by all these means I may be more and more strengthened and confirmed in the good Resolution I have made, do thou stir up my slothful mind to a dilligent Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on thy publick Ordinances, that so in the solemn Assemblies of thy Saints I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly hear thy Word with Reverence and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, offer up my Prayers with Fervency and Devotion, and approach thy Table with all that Humility and Love, Gratitude and Resignation of Soul that becomes this solemn Remembrance and Representation of my dying Saviour. In these things, and whatsoever else is needful to secure my Resolution of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, assist me, O Lord, for Jesus Christ his sake, to whom with thy self and eternal Spirit be render'd all Honor Glory and Power from his time forth and for evermore.</p>

I acknowledg my self unworthy, infinitely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, to come before thee, and am prompted by my own Horror and Shame to hide my self from thee, but yet I know I must come or I must perish. And therefore here, O Lord, I cast my self at thy Feet, and if thou shalt think meet to tread upon me, and to spurn me from thy Presence for ever, I must own that thou art just and righteous in all thy Ways. For thou hast been wonderfully good beyond what I could modestly have wisht, or am able to express; thou tookest pity upon me when I was all wounded and polluted and weltring in my Blood, when I was sleeping securely upon the brink of Perdition, and had scarce any Sense or Feeling of my Guilt and Misery; in this woful plight didst thou visit my poor Soul, and with thy preventing Grace
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:106959:296"/>
awake me to a sense of my Danger, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually warn me to flee from the wrath to come. And now when thou hadst brought me to my self, and to a through Resolution of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and my Soul was in a fair way of Recovery, like an ungrateful Wretch as I am, I have flown in the Face of my Physitian, I have abused his Goodness, and baffled his Grace, and wilfully and deliberately torn open my Wounds again. And this I have done most treacherously, as well as ungratefully, not only against all the Obligations of thy Goodness, but also against my own repeated Vows and Engagements. For 'twas but this Morning that I solemnly renewed to thee my Promise of Obedience, and therein vow'd not to offend thee wilfully upon any Temptation whatsoever; but O vile Traytor that I am, both to thee and to my own Soul, I have by <note n="*" place="margin">

Had I done it Ignorantly or unawares or under a Surprize, it had been pittiable; but, O my Guilt, my Guilt, 'twas knowingly, wilfully, basely, and maliciously that I did this evil in thy sight; whereby I
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:106959:296"/>
have forfeited my Soul, my Innocence and thy Love, and have got nothing in exchange but the Pleasure of a Minute, and a lasting Shame and Repentance. O vile Wretch, O desperate Fool that I am, what have I done! whither am I fallen! I have grieved thy Spirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd thy Authority, trampled on thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and wounded my own Conscience, and by one base Act have thrown my self headlong from all those glorious Hopes whereunto thou hadst raised me. And now, O God, what can I say in my own behalf, my Sin being so great, my Folly so utterly inexcusable! O I am asham'd, I am asham'd of my self, I lament and abhor the Madness and Wickedness of my own Choice; and O that it were in my power to recall it! But woe is me it is past into Act, and by that Act my Innocence is already stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, my Soul forfeited, and it is no more in my Power to undo what I have done, than to recall the Hours of yesterday. What then shall I do, or whether shall I turn my self! 'Tis against thee, O Lord, against thee I have sinned, and now I have none but thee to flee to. I have nothing of my own to plead in my own behalf, my Conscience condemns me, and my Sin, my Sin, cries aloud against me; so that unless thou wilt be pleased to listen to the interceding Blood of thy Son, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult thine own Bowels and Compassions, and
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:106959:297"/>
from thence to fetch Arguments of Mercy. I am undone for ever by my own Folly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for Jesus Christ his sake, for thy own Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercies sake, have pity, have pity upon me, heal my Soul, for I have sin'd against thee; be merciful to my Sin, for it is great. Thou hast promised to receive returning Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to blot out their Iniquities, and to heal their Backslidings. I desire O Lord to return unto thee, I hate and renounce my Sin, and do here abhor my self for it in Dust and Ashes before thee. Wherefore for thy Praise sake, O try me this once more, and do not presently cast me away from thy Presence nor take thy holy Spirit from me, but restrain me by his Grace from all presumptuous Sins, and suffer them not to have Dominion over me. And quicken me, O Lord, for thy Names sake, that for the future I may watch more carefully, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist more vigorously, and walk more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly than I have hitherto done. And that from henceforth I may be intirely devoted to thee, and serve thee without Interruption, do thou so confirm me by thy Grace in my holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, as that I may choose rather to die than to offend thee any more. And now, O Lord, though by my Rebellion against thee this Day, I have rendered my self most unworthy of thy fatherly Care and Protection, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee to watch over me this Night for

from the neathermost Hell; which hath res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued me from the Snare of the Devil, and the pernicious Bondage of my Lusts, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in my Nature these heavenly Graces and Dispositions, and hitherto improv'd and advanc'd them towards my eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This, O my God, all this, I owe to thy free and undeserved Goodness, that I that was dead am now alive, that I that was lost am found, that I that was a slave to my Lusts am made free from Sin, and translated into the glorious Liberty of the sons of God, is purely the Effect of thy free Grace, and to be intirely ascribed to thy all-powerful Goodness. Go on, O Lord, go on, I beseech thee, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thine own Work, that so the Glory of it may be for ever redounding to thee; and that as I have been hitherto a signal Instance of thy Goodness, so I may be an happy Instrument of thy Praise to eternal Ages. And grant, I beseech thee, that the sense of thy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kindness towards me, may so captivate my Soul and all my Faculties, as that I may be most intirely thine; as that my Reason and Will, my Fear and Hope, and Love and Desire may from henceforth be all resign'd up to thee, and for ever devoted to the Honour and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of thy infinite Glories and Perfections; and this I most humbly beg for Jesus Christ his sake, to whom with thy self and thy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

                                 <hi>O</hi> God, who art unchangeably holy and blessed, who art the same yesterday, to day and for ever, and dost never swerve or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the essential Goodness and Purity of thy own Nature, look down I beseech thee upon me, a fickle, weak and mutable Creature, whom thou hast redeemed to thy self, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto conducted by thy Grace and Spirit. Thou knowest, O Lord, the Weakness of my Nature, and how unable I am without thy Strength and Assistance to finish the Race which thou hast set before me; thou knowest what Temptations I must struggle with, and what Difficulties I must yet overcome, before I am seiz'd of the blessed Prize I am contending for, wherefore, since thou hast hitherto been
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:106959:299"/>
my constant Support and Defence, forsake me not now for thy Names sake, but as thou hast begun a good Work in me, so I beseech thee to finish and compleat it; to uphold my feeble Soul by thy free Spirit under all Temptations and Difficulties, that so by patient continuance in well-doing, I may seek for, and at last obtain, honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and glory, immortality and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. For which end, O Lord, preserve me from being over-confident of my own Abilities, and inspire me with a holy Jealousie of my self, that whilst I stand I may take heed lest I fall. And if at any time I should be so base, and so unhappy, as to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee wilfully (which I beseech thee to prevent for thy Mercy and Compassion sake) O suffer me not to sleep in my Sin, but recal me instantly by the Checks of my Conscience, and the Convictions of thy Spirit, lest while I add Sin to Sin, and one degree of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness to another, my Lusts should regain their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me, and thou shouldest be angry with me and reject me from thy Covenant for ever. And that I may every Day serve thee more freely and stedfastly, wean me, I beseech thee, more and more from those Temptations to Sin that are round about me, and give me such a true understanding of the Nature of all the Goods and Evils of this World, as that neither the Flatteries of the one, nor the Terrors of the other, may ever be able to withdraw me from my Duty. And lest while I am mortifying my old Sins, I should care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly permit new ones to spring up in my Nature, good God, do thou mind me to search and try my own Heart, and take a severe Account even of the smallest Defects and Imperfections within me; that so I may correct and reform them in time, before they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into inveterate Habits. And grant that I may be always so sensible of my own Imperfection, as that
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:106959:300"/>
I may never rest in any present Attainment, but may still be pressing forward to the mark of my high calling in Jesus Christ. Suggest to me, I beseech thee, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Thoughts of my Mortality, that so, while I have Time and Opportunity, I may be preparing for my Departure hence, and making provision for a dying hour. In order whereunto, assist me, O Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, strictly to examin and review my past sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Courses, that so if there be any remains of Guilt abiding upon my Conscience, I may purge them away by proper Acts of Repentance, before I go hence and be no more seen. And grant that as I have formerly abounded in Sin, so I may now redeem that precious Time I have lost, by abounding in the contrary Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; that so, as far as in me lies, I may revoke and undo the multitude of my past Sins, by doing all the Good I am able for the future. And that I may hold out and persevere to the end, preserve and continue me in the Communion of thy Church, and suffer me not to be led away by the errors of the wicked and to fall from my own stedfastness. And finally I beseech thee to grant that in the use of these blessed Means, I may so far prevail over the Infirmities and Corruptions of my Nature, as that at last I may have a clear and certain Feeling of my own Integrity and Vprightness towards thee; that so being from thence assur'd of thy Love, and of my Title to eternal Happiness, I may run the ways of thy commandments more chearfully, and at last finish my Course with unspeakable joy. And now, O Lord, I resign my self to thee, take me I beseech thee into thy Care and Protection this Day, preserve me from all Evil, but especially from Sin, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me by thy Spirit unto every good work, that so I may serve thee with a free and cheerful Mind, and make it my meat and drink to do thy blessed will.

Then shall I always approach thee with Joy, and breath up my Soul to thee in every Prayer; then shall my Heart be firmly united to thee in a devout and chearful Affection, and my Prayers shall come up as incense before thee, and breathe a sweet-smelling savour into thy Nostrils.

Thou knowest, O Lord, my spirit is willing though my flesh is weak; my labouring Soul aspires towards thee, it stretches forth the Wings of its Desires toward thee, and would fain mount up above all earthly things and unite it self with thee in eternal Love; but alas! its Fervours are dampt, and its Endeavours tired by this clog of Flesh that hangs upon it, and perpetually sinks and weighs it down again.

Blessed be thy Name, thou hast conquered me by thy Love, and I resign my self to thee with a chearful Heart.

I am ravisht with thy Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I admire thy Love, and from the bottom of my Soul adore thy Wisdom and Goodness. My heart is ready, O Lord, my Heart is ready, I will sing and give praise. Awake up my Glory, awake all the Powers of my Soul, I my self will awake and celebrate thy praises. Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the God of Glory, praised be the God of Love, praised be the Father of Mercies, praised be the best Friend of Souls, for thy Goodness reaches to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, thy Glory shines throughout the Creation, and thy Mercy is spread over all thy works. Who can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thine infinite Beauties, who can rehearse thy noble Acts, who can shew forth all thy Praise! I do confess my Thoughts are infinitely too short, my Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too narrow, my Expressions too scanty, to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and sufficiently admire and celebrate thy Glory. But, O my God, thou knowest that I love thee, and, blessed be thy Name, I feel infinite reasons so to do. O that I could love thee more, that I could love thee but as much as Angels and glorified Spirits do, who yet cannot love thee as much as thou deservest, because thou deservest to be belov'd infinitely. But my soul thirsts for thee, and longs after thee. O when shall I be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into thy blessed Presence, there to see, and admire,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:106959:304"/>
and love, and adore thee for ever! when shall I shake off this clog of sinful Mortality, that sinks and depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses me, and flee to those happy Regions of perfect Love, where I shall continually feed upon thee with inexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Delight, and be filled with a strong and everlasting Sense of thy goodness. O thou that art the beginner and finisher of every good work, be pleased to assist my holy Endeavours, to withdraw my Mind more and more from these sensible things, that it may have a clearer sight of its heavenly Country from whence it came, and whither it desires to return; that so having my Eye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fixt on that blessed recompence of reward, I may live above this World, and in despight of all its Terrors and Allurements, persevere to the end in a steady and even Course of Obedience. And now, O Lord, since thou hast been graciously pleas'd to inspire my Mind with these delightful Thoughts of thee, and to enlarge my Heart with such sweet Transports of Love to thee; grant, I beseech thee, that they may not only please, but better me; that they may lift me up above all the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of this World, and revive my Strength, and quicken my Endeavours, and compose my distrustful Heart into a stedfast Dependence upon thee, that so I may be fruitful in all good works, and my heart may be establisht unblameable in holiness before thee, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus, Amen, Amen.</p>

                                 <hi>O</hi> God who art the most excellent Nature, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all Beauty, and the Fountain of all Graces, who doest infallibly understand what is best to be chosen, and invariably chuse by the best and purest Reason; look down, I beseech thee, upon me thy poor defective Creature, who am ashamed of my self to see how unlike thee I am; how I am laden with Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and how after all my religious Endeavours, my Nature is still vitiated with unreasonable Lusts and Affections; how much Vanity and Impertinence there yet remains in my Mind, how much Perverseness in my Will, how much spiritual and carnal Iniquity in my Affections and Appetites. Lord, I have been long a contending with this corrupt Nature, and yet upon all Occasions I find my self too too prone to be <note n="*" place="margin">

O my God, have pity upon me, who here lie sighing at thy Feet, under a miserable diseased Nature; and as thou hast begun the blessed Cure in me, so for Christ his sake I beseech thee to compleat it; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intirely recovered, and raised up unto newness of Life, I may, in the perfect Health and Vigour of my Soul, serve and glorifie thee for ever. For which end, I beseech thee, confirm me more and more in the Belief of those immortal Pleasures beyond the Grave, which thou hast treasur'd up for those that love and obey thee; that by the strength of a lively Faith, and vigorous Hope, my Soul may be rais'd above this World, and

learn to despise and trample upon all its gilded Vanities, whensoever they present themselves either to allure or to terrifie me from pursuing the heavenly Enjoyments. Excite in me such a vehement Thirst after those Rivers of Pleasures above, as may every day render me more cool and indifferent towards earthly things, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and satisfied under all the Events and Issues of thy Providence, and more active and vigorous in my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Calling. And I beseech thee to inspire me with such clear and lively Apprehensions of thy essential Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Perfections, and of thy bountiful Love and boundless Benevolence to all thy Creatures, as may eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day more and more raise and improve my Love to thee; that this being the great Spring and Principle of all my Actions, may continually excite me to a chearful Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to thy Will, and a vigorous Imitation of thy Perfections. O cause me to love thee for thy self, and Religion for thee, and the Instruments of Religion in order to thy Glory and my own Happiness; that so founding my Content upon thee, and the blessed Interests of a virtuous Life, I may grow in Grace, and be rich in good Works, and go on with a satisfied and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Spirit from Imperfection to Strength, from Acts to Habits, and from Habits to Confirmation in Grace; and may be still more and more confirmed in all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Graces, till they are finally consummated into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Glory. And when, by thy Grace and Assistance, I have perfectly conquered the corrupt Nature within, and the Temptations without me, and am arrived into the State of everlasting Triumph, I will lay all my Victories at thy Feet, and with Palms in my hand, and Halelujahs on my lips, celebrate thy praises to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hear me, O my God, in this and whatever else thou knowest to be needful for me, even for Jesus Christ his sake, in whose Name and Words I further pray, Our Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
