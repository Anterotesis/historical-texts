         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The like not born on Land, or Seas before.</l>
               <l>Her Face if from their Sea old <hi>Greece</hi> had seen,</l>
               <l>Flat they had Worship'd Love's Almighty Queen.</l>
               <l>Yet, if observ'd Her Mien, Her Conduct, they</l>
               <l>Must have confess'd Her <hi>Pallas</hi> every way</l>
               <l>But had Her Power, and marvelous Might been told,</l>
               <l>What Clouds She gather'd, and what Thunder roul'd;</l>
               <l>What Scepters bow, what boundless Empire waits,</l>
               <l>Whilst She deals forth their Adamantine Fates;</l>
               <l>None to compare, none could they find above,</l>
               <l>But cry, O She! the very Mate of <hi>Iove!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To our bright Theme how look these Legends Vane,</l>
               <l>Aukward their Nymphs, their Goddesses prophane?</l>
               <l>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Muse, their Rapture and their Rage,</l>
               <l>Their streams of Nectar, and their Golden Age,</l>
               <l>All now fulfill'd; That Poetry and Stile</l>
               <l>Gave only blind Prophetick Hints the while.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>No sooner Her fair Influence arose,</l>
               <l>What Glorious Scenes new Light, new Life disclose?</l>
               <l>When plung'd in Night, and black Despair we lay,</l>
               <l>One glympse from Her set open all our Day.</l>
               <l>Vice over-flow'd, and dilug'd all around;</l>
               <l>Injustice ran, disdaining Bank, or Bound;</l>
               <l>The World was lost, no Hospitable Shore,</l>
               <l>All Order gone, and Beauty was no more.</l>
               <l>When drooping Vertue no Retreat could find;</l>
               <l>When no Remains of reasonable kind;</l>
               <l>No Spirit left; no spark of Sense was shown,</l>
               <l>Above the level of a Stock or Stone.</l>
               <l>She strikes the Rock, the rudest Rocks Obey;</l>
               <l>New Life invades, and animates our Clay.</l>

               <l>Our Clods no longer their hard Fates restrain,</l>
               <l>But, out of hand, all scatter into men:</l>
               <l>The Log, the Lumber, and more stupid Race,</l>
               <l>Take Humane Form, and reasonable Face;</l>
               <l>They bless the Hand that does their Sense restore,</l>
               <l>And now resemble the old Block no more.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>She turns the mighty Machine of Affairs,</l>

               <l>The Elements, set free, resume their Place,</l>
               <l>And Nature shines, with Triumphs in Her Face.</l>
               <l>Love shakes his Wings, mad Animosities</l>
               <l>Lye still and husht, beneath the healing Breeze.</l>
               <l>No Discords range; all from the angry heap,</l>
               <l>Charm'd, into Form, and Beauteous Order leap.</l>
               <l>With Godlike State, above Mechanick sway,</l>
               <l>She sits, and sees the second Causes Play;</l>
               <l>Unmov'd Her Self, with an untroubl'd Brow,</l>
               <l>Beholds the Thorns that vex Crown'd Heads below;</l>
               <l>The Active Part Her Mighty Consort takes;</l>
               <l>And, for the Weal of Humane Kind He wakes.</l>
               <l>Beneath Her Eyes His Generous Heart inspir'd,</l>
               <l>His Arm is strengthned, and His Prowess fir'd:</l>
               <l>Cheer'd by Her Rays His Care salutes the Morn,</l>
               <l>The West, and farthest Poles securely turn:</l>
               <l>His Providence, through Stratagem, and Steel,</l>
               <l>Drives on, no Jolt, nor ever cools the Wheel.</l>
               <l>So long, amongst the <hi>Dutch</hi> Her Presence seen,</l>
               <l>For ever stamps that Commonwealth Serene.</l>
               <l>Thence shall the Monarch wave His nice Debates,</l>
               <l>And strike before their Majesty, the States.</l>
               <l>Tho' through the Mass of Things Her Vertue run;</l>
               <l>And all from Her these Miracles are done.</l>
               <l>Her no Ambition moves, nor is She Proud,</l>
               <l>Save, in the Glorious Power of doing Good:</l>
               <l>So may She still above proceed a Queen,</l>
