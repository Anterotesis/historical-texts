            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the book of martyrs was
in high esteem all the
days of Queen</hi> Elizabeth:
All Churches by authority
were injoyned to have it, so
as all that would might read
it. There was scarce a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of note that had it not,
it was usuall to spend the
long winter evenings in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it. By the constancy
of Martyrs therein set out,
people were much encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to stand to that faith
which was sealed by their
bloud. Whether the killing
<pb facs="tcp:37759:10"/>
of the two Witnesses be near
at hand or no, I determine
not, but sure there is likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
enough of troubles and
persecutions to Gods people,
therefore I conceive these
severall Tracts, <hi>Of the
Martyrs in generall,</hi> and
<hi>Concerning our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Martyrs, Of Martin
Luther</hi> a couragious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former,
<hi>Of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

may be very suitable to our

            <p>But some may urge,
that for the first subject
concerning the Martyrs,
<pb facs="tcp:37759:10"/>
there was a book long
since published, stiled,
<hi>The Mirrour of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
usefull that way. I
deny not but that book
might be profitable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Christians, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wanted money to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
or leasure to reade
the large book of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs:
But my drift in this
worke is to excerp onely
(among the many <hi>dicta fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta</hi>
of the Martyrs) those
speeches and acts of theirs,
which were specially obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.

jumbled divers things

consonant to the originall
whence he took it. He hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the same thing twice of

I hope therefore (though I
have many things the same
with <hi>Cotton,</hi> that this work
will be of speciall use to those,
who would not be ignorant of
the living speeches of dying
Christians. The Saints are best
toward their end; so it was

And so doe I now with this ruinous

his said friends in godly talk to their

fire by Gods Ordinance is naturally
hot, but yet I am perswaded by Gods
holy Word, and by the experience
of some spoken of in the same, that
in the flame they felt no heat, and in
the fire they felt no consumption:

I will shortly cause it to be a curse to
be a Papist. A young man about

way of sorcery to bargain with the
devil or a familiar (as they call him)
to yield himself body and soul unto
the devils power, upon condition to
have his wish satisfied with money,
so that upon the same an obligation
was made by the young man, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with his own bloud, and given
to the devil: upon the sudden wealth
and alteration of the young man,
the matter first being noted, began
afterward more and more to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and at length after long and
great admiration he was brought

he had such terrours that he

disputing once about some points
being much amazed, he lay upon a

                  <p>The Covenant in generall may be
described a mutuall compact or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
betwixt God and man,
whereby God promiseth all good
things, specially eternall happinesse
unto man, upon just, equall and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
conditions, and man doth
promise to walk before God in all
acceptable, free and willing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
expecting all good from God,
and happinesse in God according to
his promise, for the praise and glory
of his great name.</p>
                  <p>A Covenant is a solemn compact
or agreement between two chosen
parties or more, whereby with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
free, and full consent they
binde themselves upon select condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
tending to the glory of God
and their common good. It differs
from a promise gradually and in the
formalities of it, not naturally
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37759:53"/>
or in the substance of it.</p>
                  <p>A Covenant usually is the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of many promises, as a constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the collection of many starres,
though it be but one promise, <hi>I will
be thy God,</hi> yet it is such a one as
comprehends many.</p>
                  <p>There is a difference between a
Law and a Covenant. A Superiour
may give a law whether the inferiour
consent to it or no, but a Covenant
is ratified by the consent of both
parties. A Covenant is something
unto which two persons by mutuall
consent doe freely binde themselves.</p>
                  <p>There are divers distinctions of
Covenants.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. A Covenant of nature.</item>
                     <item>2. A Covenant of grace.</item>
                     <item>3. A mixt Covenant consisting of
nature and grace.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Others make these three Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</p>

                     <item>1. <hi>Foedus natura,</hi> the Covenant

                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Foedus gratiae,</hi> the Covenant

                  </list>
                  <p>Others say, there were never any
but two Covenants made with man,
one Legall, the other Evangelicall,
of works or grace, the first in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,

God Covenanteth with man to

                  <p>2. The Covenant of grace which
God maketh with man, promising

to the law of faith, which holds
out as much as the Covenant of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37759:54"/>
works and the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant of works was</p>
                  <p>1. That Covenant wherein God
was the authour and the ground of
it, was Gods free grace, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall
betwixt him and <hi>Adam.</hi>
We call not the second Covenant a
Covenant of grace, because there was
no grace in the first Covenant, but in
opposition to the condition of the
first Covenant which was works, and
because greater grace is manifested in
it then the first,</p>
                  <p>2. It was the same Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which the best of the creatures
the Angels now stand and injoy their
happinesse, and <hi>Adam</hi> should have
been happy by observing this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
if he had stood. Christ was made
under this Covenant.</p>
                  <p>3. The promises of this Covenant
were very glorious.</p>
                  <p>1. For naturall life, in the body
there was perfection without defect,
beauty without deformity, labour
without wearinesse.</p>
                  <p>2. For spirituall life, <hi>Adam</hi>
should not have had terrours in his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37759:55"/>
conscience, sorrow, fear, shame.</p>
                  <p>3. For death, he should have been
translated without dissolution.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Faederati</hi> were God and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
together with all his posterity.
God made a Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi>
as a publick person,<note place="margin">Omnes nos eramus ille unus. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                     </note> which represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all mankinde.</p>
                  <p>The reasons of it may be these,</p>
                  <p>1. From the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi>
sin to all mankinde, <hi>Rom. 5. 12. In
whom,</hi> or <hi>for as much as</hi> all have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
they sinned not all in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
therefore in <hi>Adam,</hi> see <hi>vers.
14. In him all died,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 47.</p>
                  <p>2. Those on whom the curse of
the Covenant comes, they are under
the bond and precept of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
all mankinde is directly under
the curse of the Covenant,<note place="margin">Deut 29. 21.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> did consent to it and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the terms of the Covenant,
for God dealt with him in a rationall
way, and expected from him a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
service. Either he knew the
tenour of the Covenant, or else he
broke it out of ignorance, but the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37759:55"/>
first sin could not be a sin of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
he knew whatsoever was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

                  <p>God dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> not only

                  <p>Answer,</p>
                  <p>It is not an injustice among men
for parents to conclude their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
their acts binde them and their
heirs. 2. God hath reserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a liberty to visit the sins, not only
of the first, but immediate parents
on their children, <hi>Gen. 9. 22. 1 Thes.
2. 26.</hi> The <hi>Sodomites</hi> children were
punisht with their parents. 3. <hi>Adam</hi>
was our parent, there was the will
of the nature, which was enough to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37759:56"/>
inwrap them in originall sin, the sin
of the nature. 4. This Covenant
was made with <hi>Adam</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
out of free grace, therefore
all his posterity was bound by way
of thankfulnesse to consent. 5. They
ought to rejoice in <hi>Adams</hi> exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being so advanced, and to agree
to the Covenant made with him.
6. God made the best choice for
them in the first <hi>Adam</hi> (as he did
in the second) in so doing, seeing he
made him so perfect.</p>
                  <p>The first Covenant consists of three
parts.</p>
                  <p>Gal. 3. 10, 11, 12. 1. <hi>The precept,</hi>
that continueth not in all things. 2. <hi>The
promise, live,</hi> the man that doth them
shall live. 3. <hi>The curse in case of
transgression,</hi> cursed in every one.</p>
                  <p>The precept requires perfect and
personall obedience.</p>
                  <p>The condition of the Covenant on
mans part was</p>
                  <p>1. Perfect obedience.</p>
                  <p>1. The commandment then did
(and still doth as it refers to the
first Covenant) call for perfect
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37759:57"/>
obedience, <hi>Lev. 18. 5. Rom. 10. 5.
Gal. 3. 12. Ezek 20. 25.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Because there is a curse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against the least trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
<hi>Gal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 10.</hi> One sinne

the Angels Covenant, <hi>Rom.
5. 17.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Gods holinesse is such, that
he requires from the creature
perfect obedience, <hi>Job 4. 18.
Heb. 1. 13.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. There are two things in the
law,</p>
                  <p>1. The principall part of it,
the precept.</p>
                  <p>2. The accidentall, the curse:
man is bound to the precept,
<hi>jure creatoris,</hi> to the curse,
<hi>jure judicis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. He gave us a perfect ability
to obey in our creation, <hi>Ephes.
4. 22, 23. Eccles. 7.</hi> ult.</p>
                  <p>6. He requires perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in Christ, <hi>Rom. 8. 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Personall obedience.</p>
                  <p>1. There is a perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence
to the law required of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37759:57"/>
particular man, <hi>Gal. 3. 10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The curse is denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the person, <hi>the soul that
sins shall die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. This was required of Christ
our surety, <hi>Gal. 4. 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It was required for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of our persons and
salvation of our souls.</p>
                  <p>5. The righteousnesse of the

               <p>The Covenant of grace is more

               <p>The first Covenant was made with

power, and also of his mercy, which
was not before discovered, a higher
union, under the first head there was
only a moral union of love, under the
second a mysticall union, we are the
same person with Christ; the second
Covenant brings repentance and
pardon upon repentance. The first
Covenant said, <hi>If thou dost well thou

               <p>Question,</p>
               <p>How can the Covenant of grace

mutuall conditions. Now no
condition can be required to this
covenant, which the covenant it self
doth not work; <hi>For I will write my

               <p>Answer.</p>
               <p>Though God do perform, and in
his Covenant promise to performe
what he requires, yet still there is
something required which man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to, and promising to perform
(though not of himself by his own
power) it is a covenant.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of grace is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
an hundred times directly in
the Scripture, and a thousand times
by consequence.</p>
               <p>In generall it comprehends all the

man in such a way, as should advance
all his glorious Attributes, his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
power, justice, mercy, compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wrath, vengeance.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of grace is the
most free and gracious tender of
Christ, and all his rich purchases to
all the lost and undone sons of <hi>Adam</hi>
that shall believe in him.</p>
               <p>All other particular promises
found in the book of God receive
their confirmation by the promise of
Christ. God promiseth sometimes
to deliver from a particular afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to assure them that that shall be
kept, he makes a promise of Christ,

               </p>
               <p>There are three things in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Christ to confirm all other
promises.</p>
               <p>1. Because there may be made
more objections against the Lords
giving of Christ, then against any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37759:63"/>
promise whatsoever, in that
the great provoked God must come
to be a suter to his vassall, <hi>Jehovah</hi>
must lie in a virgins womb.</p>
               <p>2. More love and compassion is
shewed in that one promise of Christ
then in all other promises whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>3. Because this is the mother pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,

               </p>
               <p>Some say, The conditions of the
Covenant of grace, are repentance,
faith and new obedience. Sincerity
alone (or Evangelicall perfection)
is the only absolute condition of the
Covenant of grace, <hi>Gen. 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> It is
called an upright heart, that is,
straight: It is also called Integrity, a
body that wants no members, a
sound heart, a pure or sincere heart,
a single heart, a simple and honest
heart. Evangelicall perfection is a
work of Gods Spirit whereby the
whole inward man is applied to
God and his waies without the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of strange intentions or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>2. Sincerity of singlenesse, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37759:64"/>
perfection is the whole substance
and mettall of all graces which God
worketh in the soul; it is not any
one grace, as patience, meeknesse,
but the substance of every grace, faith
and love unfeigned, <hi>Praier which
comes not out of feigned lips;</hi> we must
worship God in spirit and in truth,

               <p>It is a matter of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>
                  <hi>Reasons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because it is the covenant

               <p>2. Else we shall never be able to

               </p>
               <p>4. Without knowledge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Covenant we can never

Spirit of Christ, therefore not his
merit.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> deny the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christs death, justice must
have satisfaction. Christ (they say)
came into the world to be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and give us a patern of vertue,
as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> say we have <hi>Adams</hi>
sin by imputation. They deny all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
habits of grace, and would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have moral perswasions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antinomians</hi> also are hence
confuted, there must needs be a work
of grace in a man else the death of
Christ will be ineffectuall, then some
principle of grace must be put into
us. The old rule may stand still,
though there be a new principle put
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37759:67"/>
into the heart, because the holines of
God is not varied.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> the covenant is
with the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and Gods
children born in the covenant are of

               <p>Some say men are miserable two
waies by <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</p>
               <p>1. As we stand under his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and so come short of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Law which requires per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
personal, and perpetuall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>2. As we bear his image, life and
eternall salvation is offered on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
terms, therefore (say they)
in conversion there is required a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
change.</p>
               <p>1. Morall, which is the change of
a mans covenant.</p>
               <p>2. Physical, the change of a mans
image. So that as a mans covenant
is, such is his state, if under the first
covenant, he is in a state of sin, of
bondage and death, if he be under
the second covenant, he is in a state
of grace, of liberty and life, because
he is no longer a son of the bond-woman,

                  </gap>,
great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
               <p>1. God makes them, they are
the Promises of a great God: Great
persons make great promises.</p>
               <p>2. They are made to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
his elect: a King will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
mean things upon his Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites.</p>
               <p>Reasons,</p>
               <p>Why God makes great Promises
to his people.</p>
               <p>1. Hereby God sets forth his love
to them, <hi>Tit. 1. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That we might have ground for
our faith and hope: here in this
world we are in a state of expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Heb. 11. 39, 40.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That hereby he might support
them in their many troubles,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37759:69"/>
                  <hi>Gen. 15. 1. Heb. 10. 35, 36.</hi> This is a
mercifull administration of the Lord,
<hi>Adam</hi> had all his good things in
possession, he soon lost them, by the
Promises they are as certain as if we
had them already, <note place="margin">Though 1. The matter was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, yet God made good his Promise, as in that of Christ, <hi>Gen. 3. 15.</hi> who was more worth than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, yet in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of time Christ came. 2. Though it exceeded all humane reason as the Promise of a childe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> when so old. 3. Though it was a cluster of good things, and that to a nation. 4. Though he hath taken a great time to make it good. 5. Though humane policies have stood in the way, as in the case of the people of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>David.</hi>
                  </note>1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Promises are sure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</p>
               <p>God hath confirmed them,</p>
               <p>1. By the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>2. By oath, the strongest confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
that may be, <hi>Heb. 6. 17, 18.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The faith of Gods people is built
upon two pillars, his power and
faithfulnesse resembled by those two
pillars, 1 <hi>King. 7. 21. Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> in it is
strength, <hi>Jachin,</hi> he will esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish.</p>
               <p>1. Gods power, that is often gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as a prop to uphold our faith in
his Promises, <hi>Mat. 22. 21, 29. Rom.</hi> 4.
20. &amp; 11. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:37759:69"/>
2. His faithfulnesse, <hi>Heb. 10. 23.
1 Pet. 4. 19.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Gods Promises come to be
fulfilled to his people, they finde
twice as much in them as they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
1 <hi>Cor. 2. 9.</hi> The Promise is the
shell wherein the kernell is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Ephes. 1. 20. 2 Pet. 1. 4.</hi> That
Promise in the covenant of grace
That God will be our portion, there
is a great deal more in it then we can
understand; God will put his fear in
his peoples hearts, <hi>Job 28. 16, 17.
Prov. 3. 13.</hi> They shall enjoy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life with him in heaven,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 4 Psal. 16.</note> when
this Promise comes to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
it will be farre greater then
we can now imagine. They finde
the mercies of this life double many
times to what they expect.</p>
               <p>Reasons,</p>
               <p>1. From our weak capacity, we
are not able to understand how
much is laid up in a Promise, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of Gods people is a great
proof of this, the longer they chew
the Promise the sweeter it is.</p>
               <p>2. The infinite goodnes and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37759:70"/>
of God joyned with his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
and all-sufficiency,
because God hath set his heart
on his people he will give them
abundantly more then they think
of.</p>
               <p>The Promises of God are of two
sorts.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Absolute, those which the
Lord hath undertaken to perform
of his own free grace, not only</hi> citra
meritum, <hi>but also</hi> citra conditionem,
<hi>without all supposed or pre-required
conditions in us: of this kinde are
all those great promises of the new
covenant,</hi> Genesis 3. 15. and 17. 7.
Isaiah 43. 25. Ezekiel 11. 19.
Jeremy 31. 33. Hosea 14. 4. Joel
2. 18.<note place="margin">M. <hi>Strong</hi> on 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 30.</hi>
                  </note> I will be thy GOD, I

Thus Gods promise is made absolute to the elect in Christ: some good things are but conditionally good for us, as degrees of grace, comfort and outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings: and concerning these Gods promise is made conditionally, which condition if he break, he is at liberty.

out my Spirit, I, even I am he
who blot out your iniquities for my
Names sake, I will take away the
heart of stone, and I will give an
heart of flesh, I will put my Law
in your inward parts, and write
it in your hearts; I will heal your
backesliding, and love you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37759:70"/>
for mine anger is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>2. Conditional, which shews
what God will do upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of such duties and conditions
by the creature, which conditions
without Gods grace he is never able
to perform; <hi>Ier. 17. 8, 9, 10.</hi> These
are made for the encouragement of
the creature in the waies of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and to shew a mans inability,
that he may flie to Christ for strength,
but they doe not alwaies shew the
purpose of God to give the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or reward.</p>
               <p>When once God makes a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
though it may be a long time
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37759:71"/>
before it be fulfilled, yet it
yeelds comfortable fruit from the
day of his making of it.</p>
               <p>All agree that a Promise is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
pledge of performance in due
time.</p>
               <p>Four other fruits grow from a
Promise before it come to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht.</p>
               <p>1. It is a certain evidence of Gods
love,<note place="margin">Promises are a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, the covenant of love.</note> a declaration of his heart and
good will; outward administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
come all from Gods hand, but
his Promises come all from his heart,
his affection is set on them who
have an interest in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>Reason,</p>
               <p>All the Promises are made in and
thorow Christ, to Christ and then to
those who are united to him.</p>
               <p>2. A Promise from the day of the
date of it is a sufficient pledge to the
soul to whom it is made, that God
will never doe them hurt, but his
purposes and thoughts to them are
alwaies good, notwithstanding the
outward administrations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:37759:71"/>
3. It brings preservation to the
soul, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 5.</hi> It will preserve it

               <p>4. It brings present consolation

               </p>
               <p>An ingagement of God in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is a speciall means to support
Christians in times of distresse.</p>
               <p>God was ever wont to bear up
the spirits of his people rather by
Promises then providences.</p>
               <p>First, A great part of the Bible is
spent in reporting Gods ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to his people by promise, and
the exemplification of his people in
performing his Promises.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Saints of God were
wont to live by faith, <hi>Ps. 56. 4.</hi> They
ever fetcht consolation from the
Promises, as <hi>Jacob, Hast thou not said?</hi>
and <hi>Jehosaphat, 2 Chron. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reasons,</p>
               <p>1. The end of God in making the
Promises was to give security.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:37759:72"/>
2. They are a ray of his power for
the creating of help: he that hath a
promise hath a blessing in the root
of it.</p>
               <p>3. Promises issue from the love,
the grace and goodnesse of God,
and are as unchangeable as his love,
they are founded upon the truth and
Allsufficiency of God.</p>
               <p>That in <hi>Heb. 13. 5.</hi> is as full a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
as any is in the Bible, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to particular cases, made in
the hazards of warre and difficulties
of reformation, it is double to shew
it is a fixed truth, and for time to
come in the future tense, in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews
there is more said then is to
<hi>Ioshua.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Josh. 1. 5.</note> God saith, <hi>He will not leave
him nor forsake him,</hi> Heb. 13. 5. there
are five negatives in that little sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>All the subjects of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of grace inherit all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Covenant, they are their
portion.</p>
               <p>1. It is a great priviledge to be
the heirs of Gods Promises, and the
Saints have gloried in it, <hi>David</hi> saith,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:37759:72"/>
                  <hi>Thy Promises have I claimed as mine
heritage,</hi> by faith they imbraced the
Promises, <hi>Heb. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Every childe of God hath a
right to all the promises, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 8.
Gal. 3. 16. Rom. 9. 4. 2 Pet. 1. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. They are all made in and through
Christ, as branches of the Covenant
of grace.</p>
               <p>Objection,</p>
               <p>Particular Promises were made to
this or that man in a speciall case.</p>
               <p>Answer,</p>
               <p>No particular Promise was ever
made to any for his own sake,
but for Christs; Therefore those
Promises which at first uttering of
them were made to some particular
person on a particular occasion, were
after pressed on all Gods people, as
that, <hi>Josh. 1. Heb. 13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a peculiar priviledge to
Gods people, none but those under
Christs dominion have interest in the
Promises.</p>
               <p>We should therefore,</p>
               <p>1. Study the Promises, and know
for what use and time they serve.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:37759:73"/>
2. Beware of weighing them by
our own carnall sense and reason.</p>
               <p>3. Set faith awork, let the heart
rest on Gods Alsufficiency, his truth,
wisdome, faithfulnesse.</p>
               <p>A good man fetcheth contentment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and satisfaction to his soul in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>1. From the Covenant of grace in
generall, 2 <hi>Sam. 23. 5.</hi> This Covenant
of grace, which God hath made with
his people is Gods assurance office,
and the Saints in all their fears may
and ought to go to the Covenant to
assure all things to them, to assure
their estates and their lives.</p>

this life but the Saints of God,
a Promise from God is sufficient for
faith to rest upon against all impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities
whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Many reasons might be given why
we should rather live upon Gods
Word then any thing else.</p>
                  <p>The first reason may be taken from
Gods Alsufficiency.</p>
                  <p>Consider 3. Attributes in God.</p>
                  <p>1. His Almighty power, he can as
easily perform as promise. God
urged this to his people when they
were weak at any time, <hi>Numb. 11. Is
the Lords hand shortened?</hi> Gen. 18.
<hi>Is any thing too hard for the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The goodnesse and love of God,
his promises are given to his people
as fruits of his love, <hi>Jer. 31. 3.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. His truth, faithfulnesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse,
<hi>Mal. 3. 6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second reason may be drawn
from the interest which Christ hath
in him that makes the promise, and
in him to whom the promise is
made.</p>
                  <p>1. All the Promises are yea and
Amen in Christ, Consider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:37759:75"/>
1. Christs interest in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who makes the Promise, his
Father makes them all for the
Sons sake, all the Promises are
called the sure mercies of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
Isa. 55. He being a type of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. Christ hath bought all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Father with his own
hearts bloud.</p>
                  <p>2. The interest Christ hath in
his people,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. So is Christ, that is, the Church.</note> he is one with them,
and they one with him.</p>
                  <p>A third reason may be taken from
the nature of faith, the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it is a Promise from God,
<hi>Heb. 11. 1.</hi> Faith sees things clearly,
infallibly, strongly.</p>
                  <p>Motives to living by faith.</p>
                  <p>First, The necessity of it.</p>
                  <p>1. Take away this and you
take away the only principle
which distinguisheth the life of a
man as a Christian from the life
of other men.</p>
                  <p>2. The only cause of all heart-breaking
and uncomfortable
sorrows which Gods people
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37759:76"/>
meet with in any condition is
the want of this, <hi>Psal. 42.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The want of this is one
great cause, if not the only cause
of the unevennesse found in the
conversation of Gods people.
<hi>Rebecca</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> had a direct
Promise that <hi>Jacob</hi> should have
the blessing, yet because <hi>Esau</hi>
was great with his father they
used unjust means.</p>
                  <p>4. Without this we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no benefit from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
(though they be precious)
unlesse we rest our selves upon
them, <hi>Isa. 26. 3.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a very becoming,
amiable, fitting thing that we should
rather live upon a word of God,
then any other help whatsoever. No
creature on earth ever attains to a
self sufficiency, one must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for his support, therefore it is
better to take a Promise from God,
then to depend upon the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of creature-comforts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The wonderfull gain which
comes by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:37759:76"/>
1. The soul which hath but
once learnt to make the Word
of God a sufficient stay to it self,
such a one will live the easiest
life that any man in the world
lives. It is not easily learnt
(for much grace is required to
it) but when thou hast once
got it, it is comfortable. Such
a one lives as a childe when he
is in his fathers house, he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
troubled with care for meat,
drink, or cloathes: the soul is
at quiet when it hath learn'd to
center it self upon the word.</p>
                  <p>2. It is the greatest ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as I may say) to God
to help them, we cannot put a
greater obligation upon him,
then by trusting in him, God
will never fail such as trust in
him, <hi>Isa. 26. 3. Psal. 91. 9, 14.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Means to attain this life of faith.</p>
                  <p>How may a soul learn to pick a
living out of the word, to live by
faith.</p>
                  <p>The life of faith is to fetch the
counsell, the portion and comfort
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:37759:77"/>
of his life out of the word.</p>
                  <p>Ten directions how the soul may
attain to live this life of faith.</p>
                  <p>First, Nothing but a sound, true,
living faith is a principle of this life,
all the Schoolmasters in the world
cannot teach any creature to live by
reason, till it hath a reasonable soul.
Labour to understand the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of faith, and get it wrought in
thy soul, the just man will live by his
faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Every degree of saving
faith will not serve a man to live
comfortably and free from distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
one must have a sound faith,
and a pleropho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, and a great deal
of faith for that end, the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of saving faith will serve for
justification, sanctification, adoption,
salvation, but not for consolation:
Every blast of temptation overthrew
the Disciples while they were
weak beleevers, they questioned the
truth of all, Christ therefore rebukes
them for it, and saith, <hi>Why are your
hearts troubled? Paul</hi> when he could
say, <hi>I know whom I have beleeved,</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:37759:77"/>
though after he was told he should
be whipt, he said, none of these things
troubled him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He gets acquaintance
with some things in the covenant of
grace which may take off those ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
that usually trouble belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
which are four, and these doe
hinder Gods people from living by
faith.</p>
                  <p>1. They finde corruption in
their hearts, this should no way
hinder their comfort, if they
hate it and strive against it.</p>
                  <p>2. Temptations trouble them,
whereas Gods own people are
liable to temptations of all
sorts.</p>
                  <p>3. Afflictions, God breeds
them up which are in covenant
with him under divers and great
afflictions.</p>
                  <p>4. Desertions, They finde not
the working of Gods Spirit, nor
the assurance of his favour, God
many times leaves his best chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to great and sad deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:37759:78"/>
Fourthly, Thou must get sound
acquaintance with the Promises of
the Gospel, else thou wilt be to seek
in time of trouble. Some generall
Promises concern all estates we can
be in, all things shall work for good
to them that fear God, and no good
thing shall be wanting to such.
2. There are excellent promises in
the Scripture for any condition ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, As the exigents or occasions
require, whether to bear afflictions
or go through temptations, act thy
faith upon that Promise which sutes
thy present need.</p>
                  <p>A good man having all taken from
him, and his wife desiring to know
how he and his family would live,
he said he would now put his bond
in suit. Think on Gods power, truth,
love, and Christs interest in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to incourage thy soul.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, As a Promise from God
must be measured by faith, so only
by faith, not by carnall sense or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
doe as <hi>Abrahaem</hi> did, he never
told his wife <hi>Sarah</hi> when he was to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:37759:78"/>
go cut his childes throat and offer
him a sacrifice to God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Faith must be helped
with a use of all other means which
God hath appointed to attain the
blessing, 2 <hi>Sam. 7.</hi> later end. <hi>Psal. 5.
3. Psal. 119. Deal well with thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
according to thy word.</hi> Faith
made <hi>Noah</hi> to build him an Ark,
work belongs to us, successe to
God.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Resolve to wait the Lords
leasure in all thy beleeving, limit him
not to the time or manner of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
thee, resolve God shall do it
in his own time, if thou hast an able
good paymaster thou wilt be willing
he should pay thee how and when
he will. <hi>He that beleeves will not
make haste.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Get thy will so far sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
to Gods will, that his will may
be thine, as near as it is possible for
poor sinners to attain it: learn to say
Gods will is the best will, <hi>Rom. 12.
3. 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Study the life of holines,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:37759:79"/>
let <hi>David</hi> be an example to thee, he
had great communion with God,
and knew how to improve a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
Some think one ought to
beleeve whatever corruptions he
gives way to, they say men are duty-mongers,
merit-mongers. Others
of Gods people are too much deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with the remainders of their
own corruption.</p>

               <p>A young man may die, an old man

<hi>In</hi> Golgotha <hi>are to be seen sculs of all

               <p>There are three speciall reasons

               <p>1. Because God hath so decreed

as it takes away the power of

               <p>Death is then certain, because no

               <p>1 Cor. 15. 51. <hi>We shall not all sleep,

               <p>Others say that change shall be a

               <p>Secondly, The misery that comes
to the wicked by death.</p>
               <p>Every man in an unregenerate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
lies under the fear of death.<note place="margin">Death is the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists fear, and the christians desire.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Scripture thus frequently
sets forth naturall men.</p>
               <p>Heb. 2. 15. And deliver them who
through fear of death were all their life
time subject to bondage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job 18. 14.</hi> Death is called <hi>The
King of terrours,</hi> an ordinary hebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme,
as the Lord of glory, that is,
most glorious, death hath a dominion
over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luk. 1. 79.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tenebrae metum mortis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutientes.</note> 
                  <hi>The shadow of death,</hi> that
is, such darknesse as strikes men with
fear of death.</p>
               <p>2. All unregenerate men hate the
very thoughts of death, <hi>Isa. 28. 15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>France</hi> straitly
charged his servants, that when they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:37759:82"/>
saw him sick they should never dare
to name that bitter word, Death, in
his ears.</p>
               <p>3. Thoughts of death often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter
all the comforts of this life.</p>
               <p>The reasons of this truth may be
these.</p>
               <p>1. Because death is contrary to
nature it self, and to that inseparable
desire of its own preservation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a dissolution of the whole man,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 26.</note>
and a separation of two most loving
companions, the soul and body, by
vertue of that ancient curse, <hi>Gen. 2.
17.</hi> Yet it is not an enemy to the
godly mans person, though it be to
his naturall estate, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 22.</hi> Christ
did <hi>maledictionem benedicere, pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertatem
ditare, ignominiam glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
saith <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Because they die in their sins
they must themselves conflict with
the terrours of death,<note place="margin">Lies down with the sins of his youth.</note> 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 55.
John. 8. 44.</hi> Sin in every man brings
with it a secret guiltinesse, which
makes him fear something worse will
follow after death.</p>
               <p>3. It puts an end to all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37759:83"/>
and comforts of this life. <hi>Son
remember that in thy life time thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivedst
good things.</hi> It deprives him
of friends, goods, pleasures, credit.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>It puts an end to all his hopes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A great man wrote thus a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, <hi>Spes &amp; fortuna valete.</hi>
                  </note>
Job 11. <hi>ult.</hi> Their hope shall be as the
giving up of the ghost.</p>
               <p>5. His conscience shall then be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened,
this is the worm.</p>
               <p>6. It brings him to the barre of
judgement, <hi>Heb. 9. 27.</hi> He must go to
God to give an account, in whom he
hath no interest.</p>
               <p>7. All offers of grace shall be at
an end.</p>
               <p>8. It is the inlet to eternity and
puts them into an unchangeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>In the next place I shall resolve
some questions about death.</p>
               <p>1. Question,</p>
               <p>Whether it be lawfull to desire
death?</p>
               <p>We have examples of both kindes,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23</note>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> desired to be dissolved, but
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> mourned, and prayed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
against it, so did <hi>David,
Psal. 102.</hi> yet he rashly wished to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:37759:83"/>
die for <hi>Absolom,</hi> 1 Sam. 18. 33. The
Israelites offended this way, <hi>Would
God we had died in Egypt,</hi> and would
God we had died with our brethren.
<hi>Elisha,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> were to
blame this way,<note place="margin">Jonah 4. 3.</note> O that I had never
been born,<note place="margin">Job 7. 15. and 6. 9.</note> said <hi>Job,</hi> O that I had

I might die out of hand, for these
are the three parts of his desperate

and I would I were out of the world.

                     </gap>as diem nec optes.</note> who being
wearied with his burden of sticks,
lay down and called for death, but
when death came indeed to take
him, and said, <hi>What shall I doe man?
thou calledst me: I pray thee,</hi> said
he, <hi>help me up with my burden of
sticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To answer this question, we must
distinguish, 1. Of desire, there is
<hi>Desiderium carnale, spirituale, heros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
a carnall, spirituall, and heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
desire. If this desire ariseth,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:37759:84"/>
1. From diffidence of Gods help
and succour.</p>
               <p>2. From impatience under crosses.<note place="margin">Mors non est simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer &amp;, absolutè optanda, quia habet in seratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem mali, sed primò tanquam medium ad finem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, secundò propter consecutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> majoris boni.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Or 3. From shunning of those la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and pains which are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
for Gods glory and the
Churches good, it is very sinfull, but
if it arise from a holy desire to injoy
the presence of Christ, and to be
freed from sin, it may be lawfull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We must distinguish of
the manner in desiring, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
absolute or conditionate, if it
be a conditionate one with submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Gods will, as long as the
Church hath need of him, it may be
lawfull, <hi>Domine si adhuc populo tuo

               </p>
               <p>2. Question,</p>
               <p>Whether a godly man may fear
to die?</p>
               <p>Answer,</p>
               <p>He may.</p>
               <p>1. For some sin that he is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
humbled for.</p>
               <p>2. For want of the clear evidence
of pardon and assurance of interest
in Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:37759:84"/>
3. Question,</p>
               <p>Whether may one pray against a
sudden and violent death?</p>
               <p>Answer,</p>
               <p>A violent and sudden death chiefly
by some immediate hand of God, is
redious to mans nature: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
themselves in a tempest made
bold to waken Christ with some what
a reproving speech, <hi>Master, carest
thou not that we perish?</hi> Christ told
<hi>Peter</hi> (foretelling a violent death)
that he should be led to it as to that
which he would not, meaning by the
naturall inclination of his will, this
gives us just ground and warrant to
pray against sudden and violent
death.</p>
               <p>4. Question,</p>
               <p>Whether may we mourn for the
dead?</p>
               <p>Answer,</p>
               <p>Yes, Because</p>
               <p>1. Death is a fruit of sin, <hi>In the
day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e the death,</hi> and a sign of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
against it.</p>
               <p>2. It is a separation of friends, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37759:85"/>
they should not part without some
grief, onely we must look that our
mourning in such cases, be</p>
               <p>1. Serious, not counterfeit.</p>
               <p>2. Moderate, not excessive, either
for quantity or continuance, which
may shew want of hope and excesse
of love, both naught.</p>
               <p>3. Holy, turning our sorrow from
the death of our friends to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
of our sins, the only procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of that and all other crosses.<note place="margin">Egredere, quid times? egredere anima mea quid dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas? septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginta propè an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos servisti Christo &amp; mortem times?</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the last place I shall lay down
directions how to die well, and shew
the benefits that come to the godly
by death.</p>
               <p>1. What a Christian should do that
would die comfortably.</p>

it, behold the mortality of others
and consider thine own, do not think
to die all at once, the Apostle saith,
<hi>I thank God I die daily,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So seriously meditate on death, as
to draw from thence some whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and profitable conclusions and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37759:86"/>
resolutions for the well ordering of
thy life, and that in respect of four
things chiefly; sin, the things of the
world, our own persons, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of others.</p>
               <p>For sin, this conclusion must follow,
therefore sin is a most hatefull thing
to God, and a most harmfull thing to
man, for it alone hath provoked God
to inflict this heavy punishment of
death, yea of eternall death after
this upon the sons of men, unlesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
come betwixt. Sinne is the
parent and sting of death, sin brought
it into the world and makes it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,<note place="margin">Moriantur ante te vitia <hi>Sen.</hi>
                  </note>
therefore I must hate sinne, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sin, resist and mortifie sin, and
must make it my chiefest and in a
manner my only care to get my sins
forgiven,<note place="margin">Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our being at a great feast at <hi>Bethanie,</hi> sell into meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and speech of his death and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>2. In respect of the world, we must
conclude and resolve, that wealth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
pleasure, friends, are but very
vanities, trifles and toies, poor petty
short and vanishing goods, therfore I

                  </note> and by Gods grace will resolve
to pull mine heart from off these
things, not rejoice in them, trust in
them, boast of them, seeing I brought
nothing into the world and must car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nothing out, use the present world
as if we used it not. 2. Diligently
prepare for the life to come, every
man must be for ever in heaven or
hell (there is no middle place as
<note n="*" place="margin">Nemose decipiat fratres, duo enim loca sunt, &amp; tertius non est visus. Qui cum Christo regnare no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meruit, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diabolo absque ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. <hi>Aug.</hi> serm. 1. de ebrietate.</note> pargatory) so soon as his soul and

to get good assurance of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

Christ alone, and his mediation
and obedience and the sprinkl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng of
his bloud for pardon of sin and help
against damnation, and lastly labour
and study to reform your hearts and
lives more and more.</p>
               <p>3. Concerning our own persons,
we must thus conclude that we are
but mean and contemptible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that must die and turn to dust
and be made food for worms, why
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:37759:87"/>
should I then be proud, or think my
self better then others because of my
strength, beauty, wit, learning, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,
titles, offices, attendances?
of all which death will strip me and
teach me to know they were but
borrowed things.</p>
               <p>4. For other men we ought to
to conclude thus, they also must die
as well as my self, my husband, wife,
my dear and faithfull friend, who
knows how soon? therefore it is a
great weaknesse to trust on such, to
place my happinesse in them. <hi>Cease
from man whose breath is in his nostrils,</hi>
therefore use al persons as well as all
things, as if thou didst not use them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Let the Saints of God take
great comfort in the contemplation
of the good that death will bring
them, it concludes all their sorrows
and evils and is a beginning of all
joies, pleasures, comfort, glory and
happinesse. Death is to such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
from their labours, <hi>Rev. 14. 14.</hi> A
happy change, <hi>Phil. 3. 21. Job 14. 14.</hi>
cals death a change, it is not an anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation
or extinction, but a muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37759:87"/>
and that by way of eminency,
<hi>My change.</hi> It is the last change we
shall meet with till the resurrection.
2. A lasting, nay an everlasting change,
it puts us into an eternall condition
of happinesse or misery. 3. An uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
change, 1. in respect of persons
all must meet with it. 2. In regard of
the whole man, body and soul, makes
the body a stinking carkasse, and puts
the soul into heaven or hell. 4. A dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
change according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the person changed, terrible to
a sinner, comfortable to the godly.
Death is their bodies seed-time, 1 <hi>Cor.
15.</hi> the crowning day to the soul,
2 <hi>Tim. 4. 7, 8.</hi> the funerall of all their
sins and sorrows, <hi>Rom. 6. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall in the last place mention
some of the chief benefits that come
to the godly by death.</p>
               <p>By it he is freed</p>
               <p>1. From sin, not only the destroying
power, but the being of it is then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away.</p>
               <p>2. From those miseries which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

               </p>
               <p>3. From the temptations of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,

               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:37759:88"/>
               <p>4. From the troubles of the world,
and vexations of the flesh, <hi>Rev. 14. 13.
Eccles. 4. 1, 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There is nothing in his death but
what conduceth to make him happy.</p>
               <p>1. A godly man dies in Gods love,
and mercy,</p>
               <p>2. He never dies til he be prepared,<note place="margin">See Ioh. 11. 44.</note>
till his graces be perfected and work
finished,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 7</note> 
                  <hi>Job. 5. 26.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. He shall in some measure be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of a better life, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1.</hi>
               </p>
