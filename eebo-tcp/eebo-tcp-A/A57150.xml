            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That which they were called from the rest of the world unto, was to <hi>know,</hi> to <hi>serve,</hi> and to <hi>enjoy</hi> God: <hi>Know</hi> him they could not, but as he had <hi>revealed</hi>; serve him they may not, but as he had <hi>injoyned.</hi> Gods service was prescribed both <hi>quoad modum,</hi> and <hi>quoad locum,</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> how, the <hi>place</hi> where he would be worshipped, the manner delivered to <hi>Moses</hi> from <hi>Sinai,</hi> the <hi>place</hi> promised to be in due time revealed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.11, 14.</p>

Thus we see that from the making of the <hi>Ark,</hi> till its placing in <hi>Shiloh</hi> (where it continued about 350. years) and from the times of its <hi>captivity</hi> till <hi>David</hi> brought it into <hi>Sion,</hi> which was about <hi>fifty years,</hi> it was <hi>unsettled</hi> and itinerant. But after it was fixed

by <hi>David</hi> in the City of <hi>David, Ierusalem,</hi> or the South of the City, which he wan from the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busites,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.7, 9. (though it were <hi>removed</hi> from that part of the City to <hi>Mount Moriah,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Northward, where <hi>Solomon</hi> built the <hi>Temple</hi>) then it was in the City which God had chosen to place his name in, from whence, it was not to be by them removed, though God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to do to that place, as to <hi>Shiloh, Ier.</hi> 7.12, 14.</p>
            <p>This Psalm seemeth to have been compiled by <hi>David</hi> upon occasion of his setling the <hi>Ark</hi> in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> which he had made for it in the <hi>City of David,</hi> after the <hi>Iebusites</hi> were ejected, the wall built, the place fortified, the Palace and political Government there setled. And the <hi>use of it</hi> was (as it may seem) to be sung by the people when they went up solemnly unto <hi>Ierusalem</hi> according to the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.17. as an <hi>expression of joy</hi> that the <hi>Ark</hi> was <hi>fixed</hi> in one certain place, and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in one certain family (as visible te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of <hi>Gods presence,</hi> and of the <hi>promised Messiah</hi>) and as an <hi>excitation unto prayer</hi> for the continuance of so great a mercy, unto all pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endeavours to promote the welfare of that City.</p>
            <p>The parts of the Psalm are three. First, An <hi>expression of Davids joy</hi> for the House of God, the resort of the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the publick Worship there celebrated, <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A <hi>commendation of Ierusalem.</hi> 1. From the <hi>Unity of it,</hi> before it was a City
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53208:5"/>
               <hi>divided,</hi> for the <hi>Iebusites</hi> dwelt with the children of <hi>Iudah</hi> there till <hi>Davids</hi> time, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 15.6.3. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 1.21. That part of it which was called the <hi>City of David,</hi> was divided from the other part of the City, untill <hi>Solomons</hi> time, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 11.27. yet notwithstanding that separation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the City is here said to be <hi>compacted</hi> in one, because the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busites</hi> being cast out, though the <hi>buildings</hi> were divided, yet the <hi>affections</hi> were united, and that made them a beautiful City.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>solemn worship of God,</hi> when the Tribes came up thither thrice a year, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which God gave <hi>that City</hi> above any other in <hi>Iudea,</hi> or in the world, to place his name there, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 14.21. forbidding them to seek to any other place, <hi>Bethel, Gilgal,</hi> or <hi>Beersheba, Hos.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the <hi>Civil Government</hi> there setled, which from thence derived welfare into all parts of the Kingdom.

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>An Exhortation,</hi> that inasmuch as such glorious things belong to this City of God, therefore men would <hi>pray</hi> for the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> thereof, <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 9.</p>

It might seem no wonder if <hi>David</hi> pray for the peace of that place where his <hi>own Pâlace</hi> and Throne was: But he doth it not for his <hi>own</hi> but for his <hi>peoples</hi> sake, whose welfare was bound up in the peace of that place: Nor so much, for his <hi>own house,</hi> as for <hi>Gods House,</hi> (who had placed his name and presence there,) would he seek the good thereof.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now more particularly let us consider first, The <hi>Subject</hi> to be praised for, <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; though that whole land be called the <hi>Lords Land,</hi> yet that City was more peculiarly esteemed <hi>holy,</hi> as being the seat of <hi>Religion,</hi> the place of Gods <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and presence, towards that place they were to <hi>pray, Dan.</hi> 6.10.

For such places then, where the <hi>Ark</hi> and the seats of <hi>Iudgement</hi> are, we ought specially to pray that the Lord would protect his Ordinances, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>his truth,</hi> continue his glorious and holy <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> with his people, have a <hi>defence,</hi> and spread a covering upon all his <hi>glory.</hi> That he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper <hi>fundamentall Laws,</hi> the beauty and stability of Religious Government; that he would keep out Blasphemies, Heresies, Schisms, Idolatry, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, Pollution, Prophaneness out of his <hi>Church</hi>; Oppression, Violence, Injustice, Disorder, Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, Confusion out of the <hi>State.</hi> That the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> and the <hi>Tribunals, Religion</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> may joyntly flourish,<note n="c" place="margin">

            <p>Next let us consider <hi>what peace</hi> we are to pray for. There is a <hi>sinful peace,</hi> of  which we are not to seek after. <hi>David</hi> was a man of peace, yet a great
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53208:7"/>
               <hi>Warrior. Solomon</hi> a King of peace, yet made <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets</hi> for War; <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a vision of peace, yet therein were shields and bucklers. <hi>Christ</hi> a Prince of peace, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6. yet a <hi>Captain,</hi> a <hi>Leader,</hi> a <hi>man of Warre,</hi> with a <hi>Sword</hi> girt on him,<note place="margin">

The Church must so pray for <hi>peace,</hi> as to remember still, that she <hi>is Militant,</hi> and hath still <hi>Iebusites</hi> to conflict withall. Here we may not have peace. We must <hi>contend earnestly</hi> for the faith, <hi>Iude</hi> vers. 3. <hi>There must be no agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Temple and Idols,</hi> 2 Cor, 6.16. <hi>No Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with the unfruitful works of darknesse, Ephes.</hi> 1.11. no reconciliation between <hi>Dagon and the Ark.</hi> As Christ is King of <hi>Salem,</hi> so of <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi> too, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2. therefore <hi>peace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> must go together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Israelites</hi> and <hi>Canaanites</hi> must not agree, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> peaceable and holy men, had no small <hi>dissention</hi> and <hi>disputation</hi> with Pharisaicall and Judaizing Christians.</p>
            <p>The <hi>peace</hi> which consists with <hi>holinesse</hi> is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. <hi>Heavenly</hi> with God. 2. <hi>Internal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the members of the Church within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 3. <hi>External</hi> in civil conversation with all men. These we are to pray for, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Heavenly,</hi> to enjoy the <hi>favor of God,</hi> and to be in <hi>Covenant</hi> with him. For if he be our Enemy, all the <hi>Creatures</hi> are his <hi>Souldiers,</hi> he can set in order the <hi>Stars, hiss</hi> to the <hi>Fly,</hi> muster up <hi>Caterpillers</hi> and Canker-worms, <hi>arm Frogs, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Dust,</hi> turn the hands of his enemies to destroy

one another. Above all things therefore we must keep peace with God; for if he be not with us, all other helps will fail, <hi>Isa.</hi> 31.3.</p>
            <p>You will say, We are <hi>sure of this,</hi> for God hath promised to be with his Church, and never to <hi>fail</hi> it, the <hi>gates of hell</hi> shall not prevail against it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20.16.18.</p>

We have tasted of <hi>War</hi> both <hi>domestick</hi> and <hi>forain,</hi> but the Lord hath mingled it with much mercy. If our eyes had seen the fruits thereof, as other people have felt, <hi>Cities</hi> burned with fire, <hi>Children</hi> wallowing in blood, <hi>Virgins</hi> perishing under the lust of Villains, <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> mourning for their dead, and dying for dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mourn; <hi>Towns</hi> turned into heaps, a Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> into a Wilderness, no <hi>cattle</hi> in the Field, no <hi>Flocks</hi> in in the Fold, no <hi>Heard</hi> in the Stalls, no <hi>Inhabitant</hi> in the City, no <hi>child</hi> to the Father, no <hi>Husband</hi> to the Wife, no <hi>Money</hi> to the rich, no <hi>cloathing</hi> to the delicate, no <hi>Mercy</hi> in the Enemy, no <hi>Liberty</hi> in the miserable to bewaile his misery; Children howling for bread, the honourable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing dunghils, <hi>Death</hi> creeping in at Windows, overtaking them that flie, and finding out those that hide themselves, we would <hi>learn to prize a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered peace,</hi> and to pray for the continuance of it.</p>
            <p>Weighty are the Reasons in the Text to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53208:10"/>
and press this Truth upon us. First, The <hi>condition of the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epes.</hi> 4.4, 5.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Iud. ver.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.21.</note> a <hi>City compacted,</hi> and knit together by many strong bands, one <hi>Father,</hi> one <hi>Head,</hi> one <hi>Family,</hi> one <hi>Rule,</hi> one <hi>Faith,</hi> one <hi>Love,</hi> one <hi>Baptisme,</hi> one <hi>Spirit,</hi> one <hi>Common salvation.</hi> No where is peace so natural, so <hi>amiable</hi> as in the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>celebrity of Gods Worship,</hi> which is the <hi>glory</hi> of a people; let the <hi>Ark</hi> be gone, and the <hi>glory</hi> is departed: No so doleful a sight as the desolations of the Temple, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74.3.79.1. <hi>Isa.</hi> 64.10, 11, 12. <hi>All our foundations</hi> and <hi>springs</hi> are here, <hi>Psal.</hi> 87.1, 7. the wells of salvation, the Fountain of the Gardens, the Graces and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Gods Spirit, which make our souls like a watered Garden.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Thrones of David,</hi> the <hi>Towers, Bulwarks,</hi> and <hi>seats of judgements,</hi> in which things stand the externall happiness of a Nation. <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> are the foundations of the Earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.7. When they were <hi>corrupted</hi> with inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and violence, the Lord threatned that <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> should become heaps, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.11, 12. Great reason therefore to pray for <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that it may be a <hi>City of Righteousness, a faithfull City,</hi> Isai. 1.26.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Benefits</hi> of this <hi>Peace.</hi> 1. To our <hi>selves,</hi> they shall <hi>prosper that love it.</hi> God will not onely hear the prayer by giving peace to the Church, but by giving prosperity to him that made it. Such a <hi>prayer</hi> is like to <hi>Noahs Dove,</hi> turns back again to him that sent it out, with an Olive branch
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53208:10"/>
in the mouth. Yea, if the prayer should be denied <hi>as to the body</hi> of the people, yet such a man should be heard for himself. He should be <hi>marked</hi> for safety, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 5, 14, 14. there should be a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place provided for him-<hi>Isai.</hi> 62.20. and a book of remembrance should be written for him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. He shall have peace, though the <hi>Assyrian</hi> be in the land, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Isai.</hi> 43.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To our <hi>Brethren,</hi> Such a Prayer shall be like the <hi>Beams of the Sun</hi> which diffuseth light and heat upon thousands at once.

To the <hi>House of God.</hi> The conservation and propagation of his holy <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> is so dear to all that are of <hi>Davids</hi> mind, that they are <hi>willing</hi> not onely to purchase it with their <hi>prayers,</hi> but with their <hi>blood.

to be bound, but to die at Ierusalem for the name of the Lord Iesus,</hi> Acts 20, 24.21.13. They <hi>preferre Ierusalem</hi> above their <hi>greatest joy.</hi> And this is an high honour that God doth confer upon the <hi>prayers</hi> of his servants, that whereas all their good and comfort flows from the house of God, the very house of God it self doth reap benefit by their prayers. Though it be <hi>his Rest,</hi> the place wherein he delighteth, the place which he filleth with his <hi>glory</hi>; yet the <hi>glory of his own house</hi> shall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon it, <hi>in answer to his servants pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have considered the <hi>Duty:</hi> Before we make Application, let us consider the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> of the Duty, which is <hi>Love. They shall prosper that love it.</hi> The <hi>love of the Church,</hi> is the <hi>foundation of all our prayers</hi> and endeavours for the prosperity of the Church: A man will not very hastily seek the good of those whom he doth not love, and therefore when Christ requireth that we should love our Enemies, he addeth as a fruit of it, that we should pray for them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44. Love made <hi>Ionathan</hi> intercede with his Father for <hi>David,</hi> even then when he knew his displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. Much more will it move us to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with God for his beloved people, the Spouse of his own Son.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Love is a fundamental Passion,</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all the rest:<note place="margin">

               <hi>Prayer</hi> is nothing else but the affection of <hi>desire sanctified</hi> and presented unto God for the things we need, <hi>Love natural</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fountain of <hi>natural Desires; Love sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53208:11"/>
must consequently be the fountain of <hi>Prayers,</hi> which are <hi>Sanctified desires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Love</hi> is a special <hi>Root</hi> of obedience, <hi>Faith worketh by love,</hi> love hath a constraining <hi>vertue,</hi> is as the <hi>sail</hi> to the ship, the <hi>wing</hi> to the Bird, the <hi>spirits</hi> to the blood, the <hi>wheele</hi> to the chariot that keeps all in motion. The <hi>more love</hi> the more <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> ever; the more we love the Church, the more sollicitous we shall be for her peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Love</hi> hath a very great <hi>interest in God,</hi> it is <hi>of him,</hi> and <hi>from him,</hi> and therefore it can finde the way unto him, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.7, 16. as water which comes from the Sea, runs to the Sea, the Lord <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hear the voice of his own work in us.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that loves, is <hi>born of God</hi>; and a Fathers ear is open to a loving child: This is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prayer, that we can call <hi>God Father, Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. Every one that <hi>loves, knows God.</hi> Other things are known by <hi>knowledge,</hi> but <hi>God is known by love.</hi> Come taste and see how gracious the Lord is. Experimental, comfortable knowledge of God we can have none but in the face of Christ, in whom he is <hi>all love.</hi> When <hi>Moses</hi> desired <hi>to see Gods glory,</hi> he answered him by causing his <hi>goodness</hi> to pass before him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.15.</note> 
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18, 19. The more we love God, the more he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his <hi>goodness</hi> to us; which knowledge of him is the ground of our <hi>calling upon him. God is love,</hi> as things of a nature move to each other; Earth to Earth, Water to Water; so <hi>love in us,</hi> moves to <hi>love in God.</hi> Now as if you <hi>binde a piece of wood to steel,</hi> the Loadstone draws the wood for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53208:12"/>
the sake of the steel to which it is joyned, so when our prayer is joyned with love, it is thereby drawn up unto God, who is love. Love is the <hi>Key of Heaven.</hi> As love to the Church made <hi>Esthers</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, so love to <hi>Ester</hi> made the Kings answer: God will hold out the <hi>Scepter</hi> of his love to those prayers which proceed from love. <hi>Love of the Brethren</hi> is an evidence of <hi>Gods dwelling</hi> in us by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is a <hi>Spirit of Love,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7. and the Lords ears are readily open to those pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which are made by the help of the Spirit of love in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.24. Lastly, where there is love, there is <hi>confidence</hi> towards God, and <hi>confidence</hi> hath <hi>free accesse</hi> to the throne of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.21, 22.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Love</hi> hath an excellent <hi>vertue</hi> in it to <hi>season all duties,</hi> is as <hi>salt</hi> in the Sacrifice; it makes the duty <hi>hearty,</hi> and God loves <hi>chearfulness</hi> as well in <hi>praying</hi> as in <hi>giving.</hi> It makes a man urgent and importunate, <hi>quicquid agit valde agit,</hi> puts up <hi>strong cries.</hi> It is strong as death, whch will take no denial; It keeps the minde <hi>intent</hi> upon prayer. Love turned <hi>Maries thoughts</hi> from a meer civil entertaining of Christ into desires of hearing him. Love stirs up <hi>Faith</hi> to eye and fix on ptomises, <hi>&amp; quae valde volumus facile cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus.</hi> Love <hi>facilitates</hi> duty, and makes the heart constant in it: <hi>Ruth</hi> loved <hi>Naomi</hi> and so went thorow with her. <hi>Weak</hi> things by the strength of love will venture on hard things; A Hen will fly upon a Dog out of love to her Chickens. One man with an <hi>engine</hi> may move more then ten
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53208:12"/>
men with their own strength; <hi>Love</hi> is an <hi>Engine,</hi> makes the soul able to manage hard duties, to shoot a prayer as high as Heaven. Lastly, <hi>Love is full of arguments,</hi> no man will ever want some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to plead in behalf of what he loves. All the strength of the minde, and powers of nature wait upon <hi>Love</hi> to contrive and cast about for the good of the thing loved. How <hi>witty</hi> was the <hi>love</hi> of the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> to her daughter, who could pick out an <hi>Argument</hi> out of a <hi>Repulse,</hi> and turn that which seemed a <note n="g" place="margin">

The Lord looks not to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> but to <hi>truth,</hi> and will answer every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>love,</hi> or to the <hi>Idols</hi> of his own heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.1-5. A man may pray for the Church of God only <hi>out of self Love</hi> (as the Jews were to pray for <hi>Babylon, Ier.</hi> 29.7.) because his own safety is involved in it, as the life of the Ivy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the standing of the Oak; but true prayer for the Church is that which is grounded upon <hi>love of the Church</hi> it self; upon zeal for Gods truth and worship, upon delight in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and presence, because here onely the means of salvation, and the word of life is dispensed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53208:13"/>
in the distresses of the Church Gods name is blasphemed, the Blood and Spirit of Christ is injured, the glory of the Gospel is eclipsed, the Enemies of God are comforted. What wilt thou do, said <hi>Ioshua,</hi> to <hi>thy great name? Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Esther</hi> were great enough themselves, but the afflictions of the Church made them mourn and pray.</p>
            <p>And as no duties are acceptable unto God which do not proceed out of <hi>Love,</hi> so no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of love is acceptable unto him, which doth not put forth it self into <hi>duty.</hi> This was the proof of <hi>Davids</hi> love, <hi>I love the Lord, I will call upon him,</hi> Psalm 116.1, 2. This the proof of <hi>Pauls</hi> love My hearts <hi>desire and prayer</hi> for <hi>Israel</hi> is that they <hi>might be saved, Rom.</hi> 10.1. when God is angry we find <hi>Moses in the gap, Psal.</hi> 106.23. When <hi>Israel</hi> flies, <hi>Ioshua</hi> prayes; when the <hi>plague</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people, <hi>David</hi> is at the <hi>Altar,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.25. When Enemies are in <hi>Arms, Iehoshaphat</hi> and <hi>Asa</hi> are upon their <hi>knees</hi>; when <hi>Rabshekah</hi> is railing, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is intreating the Lord. Here is the proof of <hi>Love,</hi> it draws out the soul into all zealous <hi>endeavours</hi> for the peace of the Church; where there is no other ability, yet <hi>love will pray,</hi> and as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of a <hi>poor wise man,</hi> we may say of a <hi>poor praying man,</hi> that he hath a great hand in delivering the City, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.15. The meanest Christian may pray for the peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>But I must apply my Exhortation in the use of this Doctrine unto those who must do <hi>more then

pray,</hi> who have <hi>hands,</hi> as well as <hi>knees; power</hi> as well as <hi>prayer</hi> to put forth for God.

               <hi>That Magistrates have a care and duty lie upon them to look after the interest of the Church of Christ,</hi> and to see that that may be preserved from <hi>pernicious</hi> and <hi>destructive evils,</hi> that the <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Members</hi> thereof do in their several stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the several duties belonging unto them (though I doubt not but you are setled in so wholesome a perswasion) give me leave in three words to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate unto you.</p>
            <p>First, the Lord did expresly <hi>command</hi> that <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters</hi> and <hi>Inticers</hi> to Idolatry, <hi>Blasphemers, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous</hi> and prophane despisers of Gods Law, should be punished. <hi>He that sacrificeth unto any God, save unto the Lord onely, he shall be utterly destroyed,</hi> Exod. 22.20. <hi>He that blasphemeth, the Name of the Lord, shall surely be put to death, and all the Congregation shall certainly stone him; as well the stranger, as he that is born in the Land, when he blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the name of the Lord shall be put to death,</hi> Levit. 24.16. <hi>The soul that doth ought presumptuously whether he be born in the Land or a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord, and that soul shall be cut off from among his people,</hi> Numb. 15.30, 31. See Deut. 13.5 — 16. Now these punishments could not be dispensed but by those who did bear the <hi>Sword,</hi> therefore they that bear the Sword have a care upon them to preserve the Church of God from destructive evils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53208:15"/>Secondly, Princes are commanded to <hi>kisse the Son,</hi> whereby is noted their <hi>Love, Duty, Care</hi> of him and his interests, not to suffer any to <hi>disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> him, or to prophane his Worship, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.12. And for this purpose the <hi>Law was put into the hand of the King,</hi> Deut. 17.18. not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in order to his private conversation (for so it was common to all) but as a keeper and <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of it,</hi> that he might cause others to keep it too.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In conformity hereunto <hi>Godly Magistrates</hi> in the Scripture have from time to time been <hi>zealous</hi> to vindicate the Church of God <hi>from all subversive and dangerous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,</hi> and to command that all things should be done in the Church according to the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God in his Word. <hi>Ioshuah</hi> commanded the Priests to take up the Ark and bear it before the people, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>David</hi> took special order for bringing home the Ark, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.2. In the first Book of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> in many Chapters, we read of his singular care in setting in order the Worship of God. And if it be said, That he did this by <hi>special direction</hi> and <hi>inspiration</hi> from God. It is true he did so; But its probable that God would have <hi>singled out a King</hi> for that service, if his purpose had been that Kings should have attended onely <hi>Civil Affairs</hi>? But to shew that this care was not <hi>extraordinary</hi> to one Prince one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we read of others taking the same course. We find <hi>Asa purging</hi> the Church from <hi>Strange Gods, High-places, Images,</hi> and <hi>Groves,</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53208:15"/>
the people <hi>to seek the Lord,</hi> and to doe the Law: and this was so far from unsetling the State, that it is said, <hi>The Kingdom was quiet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.2—5. And after, upon the perswasion of the Prophet, it is said, he <hi>took cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> to do the like; Yea, he <hi>put away his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from being Queen, because she had made an Idol in a Grove,</hi> and cut it down and stamped it, and burnt it, Chap. 11.8, 16. and presently it follows, <hi>there was no more war,</hi> &amp;c. verse 19. and the very same <hi>Blessing</hi> followed the very same <hi>zeal</hi> in the reign of <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> his Sonne, <hi>He took away the High-places, and commanded the people to be taught: and the fear of the Lord fell upon all the Kingdoms that were round about</hi> Judah, <hi>so that they made no war against him,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.6—10. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> began his reign the first year and first moneth with reforming the Church, and restoring Gods Worship, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.3—11. and so continued to do, Chap. 30.1—3.12.22.31.1—11.21. So <hi>Manasserh</hi> after his repentance, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.15, 16. Of <hi>Iosiah</hi> this testimony is given, <hi>that like unto him there was no King before him nor after him,</hi> 2 Reg. 23.25. and except only the <hi>unhappy action</hi> wherein he died, there is <hi>nothing recorded of him, but his care to purifie the Church of God,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.35. The like holy care we find in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> for the <hi>House of God, and the Officers thereof,</hi> Nehem. 13.9-14.22. And in <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> to build the Temple, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.7, 10. And we find when <hi>Idolatrous corruptions</hi> crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the house of <hi>Michah,</hi> and into the Tribe of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53208:16"/>
               <hi>Dan,</hi> it is imputed to this, <hi>because there was no King in Israel,</hi> no Civil power to restrain men from doing every one what was good in his own eyes, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17.5, 6.18, 1.</p>
            <p>I know what will be said to all this, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed <hi>to the Church of the Iews onely,</hi> whose Kings possibly were herein types of Christ; but that now the people of Christ are a <hi>willing people,</hi> and therefore not to be under any coercion.</p>
            <p>Hereunto I answer, First, That what is written, is written for our learning; The examples of good Princes in the old Testament are recorded for the instruction and incouragement of Magistrates now. Otherwise by this pretence we might cast off all the holy examples unto any good work, which are given us in the <hi>Old Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Though Christs people be a <hi>willing people,</hi> yet so far as they have <hi>flesh,</hi> they are <hi>weak</hi> as well as <hi>willing,</hi> Matth. 26.1. and being subject unto <hi>sinne,</hi> they must needs be subject unto <hi>Government</hi> too; for weresoever there is a body of men, who are, through sinful weakness, subject to miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, there is a necessity of some Government, and superinspection, to prevent, and to heal such miscarriages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where there are the same <hi>Reasons</hi> of a practice, the same <hi>practice</hi> ought to continue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we find abrogation and repeal: But the same reasons remain still. The <hi>Truth and Worship of God</hi> ought to be as <hi>dear</hi> to <hi>Magistrates</hi> now as then; <hi>leaven and corruption</hi> creeps into the Church as well now as then. God is as much <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53208:16"/>
the <hi>Souls</hi> of men as much <hi>endangered,</hi> Satan as busie an adversary now as then; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same means ought to be used now as then.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the Church as well as a <hi>willing people</hi> against whom we find <hi>severity</hi> used <hi>by Christ himself</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; Christ made a <hi>scourge</hi> and drove the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and sellers out of the Temple, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Peter</hi> pronounced a doelful sentence upon <hi>Ananjas</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> Acts 5.4, 5, 9. These indeed were <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary acts</hi>; but they teach us that an <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Estate</hi> hath need as well of a <hi>Rod</hi> as of a <hi>spirit of meeknesse,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.21.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is prophesied of the <hi>times of the Gospel,</hi> that <hi>Kings should be nursing Fathers unto the Church,</hi> Isa. 49.23. And of them the Apostle saith, that <hi>they are for a terror unto evil doers, and a praise to those that do well,</hi> Rom. 13.3, 4. which words are comprehensive,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14.</note> respecting good and evil as well in the first Table as in the second. Again, the Apostle exhorteth that <hi>Prayers be made for Kings and all in Authority,</hi> that under them we may lead <hi>quiet and peaceable lives in all godlinesse and honesty</hi>; that which is the end of <hi>our prayer,</hi> is likewise the end of <hi>their power</hi> and government;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col. de sum. Trin. &amp; fid. Catholale Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticis Manichaeis Iudaeis, Paganis Acta Concil. Ephes. Yo.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.19.</note> and if it be their <hi>duty</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for <hi>quiet, peace, honesty,</hi> it is also to provide for <hi>godlinesse</hi> too, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. And accordingly we find the great <hi>l</hi> care of <hi>Constantine, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius, Valentinian, Iustinian</hi> and other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperours in making Edicts, calling Councels,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53208:17"/>
inhibiting Heresies, as we read in the Histories of their times.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whatever things are <hi>per se, subversive</hi> and dangerous to the <hi>prosperity of States</hi> and Nations, come under the <hi>proper cognizance</hi> of the <hi>civil Magistrate</hi> to prevent; but <hi>Heresies, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Idolatries, Impieties</hi> against God, do as well endanger the prosperity of States as sinnes against the second Table. 1. Because <hi>God is as much provoked by the one as the other,</hi> and it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the great sin mentioned in the case of the captivity of <hi>Iudah,</hi> was their despising of the <hi>Messengers of God,</hi> 2 Chron. 36.16.2. Because such sins do more exceedingly divide and unty the bonds of love and amity which Christian truth doth preserve, then other more civil differences, and so loosen the hearts of men from one another.</p>

Since therefore such a <hi>charge</hi> doth evidently lye upon <hi>Magistrates</hi> to use their <hi>power</hi> for the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>prosperity</hi> of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53208:17"/>
Church, the Lord doth accordingly expect from them the <hi>discharge</hi> thereof. Where he gives <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> he will call for accompt.</p>
            <p>But it may be <hi>objected,</hi> Is not this to abridge and annul that <hi>liberty</hi> which ought to be indulged to the consciences of men?</p>
            <p>I answer, First in general, and by way of concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God forbid that any should assume <hi>dominion</hi> over the <hi>consciences</hi> of men. The Apostle himself said, <hi>We are not Lords over your faith, we are but help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of your joy,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.24. It would be a <hi>high</hi> and withall a <hi>vain</hi> attempt. <hi>An high attempt</hi>; for no man can give <hi>Law</hi> further then he can <hi>reward,</hi> and <hi>punish, accuse</hi> and <hi>convince.</hi> But no man can either <hi>search,</hi> or <hi>reward,</hi> or <hi>punish</hi> the <hi>conscience</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man can give Law unto it. And upon the same reason it would be a <hi>vain attempt</hi>; for none but a <hi>divine eye can see</hi> the conscience, therefore none but a <hi>divine Law</hi> can bind it. If such <hi>words</hi> or such <hi>writings</hi> be blasphemous and subversive to Church or State, or both, and highly derogatory to the honor of Christ, civil restraint can reach them; But thoughts it cannot reach; they are unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by an humane eye, and therefore unreducible to a humane power. And again, God forbid we should straighten liberty which Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for us. Let every man <hi>stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made him free</hi>; whom Christ hath made <hi>free,</hi> cursed be that man who shall go about to intangle him in any such yoke <hi>of bondage</hi> as is contrary to that <hi>freedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In particular we say, 1. Where men
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53208:18"/>
agree in the main <hi>fundamental Doctrines</hi> of truth and godliness, in the <hi>Substantials of Faith, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> there ought to be a <hi>mutual love, toleration</hi> and <hi>forbearance</hi> of one another in <hi>differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which are not <hi>subversive</hi> unto Faith &amp; godliness. So long as we <hi>walk by the same rule,</hi> and <hi>mind the same things,</hi> wherein in other things we differ, we are to wait upon God to <hi>reveal</hi> even the same unto us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We say Christ did never either purchase or permit to any man, professing himself a Christian, a <hi>liberty</hi> to subvert, or endeavour to subvert, by <hi>blasphemous, heretical, idolatrous,</hi> or <hi>irreligious</hi> and <hi>impious Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>foundations of Faith, Worship,</hi> and <hi>holy obedience</hi> which he hath laid in his Church, or to <hi>remove,</hi> if I may so speak, the ancient <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> of Christian Religion. The great <hi>Truths of God,</hi> the great <hi>interests</hi> of the Gospel ought to be dearer to us then the <hi>liberty</hi> of any blasphemous or impious tongue or pen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Magistrates are wisely and cautelously to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguish between <hi>weak brethren,</hi> and <hi>wicked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious</hi> disturbers of the doctrines of salvation and peace of the Church, as the Apostle doth between the <hi>bewitched Galatians,</hi> and those that <hi>bewitched</hi> them, concerning whom he saith, <hi>I would they were even cut off that trouble you,</hi> Gal. 5.12. Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation he would not sure have uttered against them, if in sowing their false Doctrines they had onely made use of a lawful liberty.<note n="o" place="margin">

So an effectual means may be used to keep the <hi>leaven</hi> from the <hi>lump</hi>; use what mercy and lenity you judge most consonant unto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian meekness, towards the persons themselves; but above all things, be <hi>zealous</hi> for the <hi>purity and peace of the Church,</hi> wherein divisions and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisions exceedingly tend to weaken, to distract, to betray it.

And I believe if the new things which are broached were duly examined, you would find in most of them, if not <hi>legible characters</hi> (as in the doctrines which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or diminish <hi>Original sin,</hi> and affirm <hi>free Will</hi>) yet a secret aspect and tendency towards <hi>Rome.</hi> They cry down our <hi>Ministers</hi> as no Ministers of Christ,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53208:19"/>
and so did <hi>Champney,</hi> and <hi>Kellison,</hi> and the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists heretofore. They cry down our <hi>Ordinances</hi> as polluted, and impure, and not to be joyned in; and so the Pope forbad the English Papists in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time to joyn in the same Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Ordinance with Protestants. they cry down <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Schools of Prophets</hi>; and what greater advantage can a learned Papist have then to have none but unlearned Adversaries to dispute withall? They teach <hi>Adoration of Christ in a sinful man</hi> at his feet, a plain manuduction to adoration of Christ in an <hi>hoast.</hi> They tell you they dare not limit <hi>Christs body to Heaven,</hi> an handsome step towards <hi>corporal presence</hi> in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> They press to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a <hi>light within,</hi> secretly intimating <hi>imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> in the Scripture, unto which, why may not as well Ecclesiastical <hi>Traditions</hi> be added, as an imagininary light? They say we must follow the commands of that light, a shrewd preparation to any desperate attempt when season and advantage calls for it. The Lord give you wisdom to foresee evils, they are better prevented then suppressed. And for that purpose be pleased.</p>
            <p>To encourage Orthodox, godly, and learned <hi>Ministers,</hi> and the <hi>Schooles</hi> of <hi>learning,</hi> vindicate and protect them from reproch and contempt. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great sent Ambassadors unto <hi>Athens,</hi> requiring them to deliver up their Orators into his hands; <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereupon to the people,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plutarch in Demost</hi>
               </note> tells them a fable out of <hi>Esop,</hi> that the Wolves being at war with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53208:19"/>
the Sheep sent a Message unto them, that if they would live at quietness, and have a firm peace concluded, they should yeeld up their Dogs unto them: which as soon as they had done they were devoured by the Wolves. The like Artifice use our Adversaries now; That they may make a prey of the people, their principal care is to pull down our Ministery, and Schools of Learning, that so the Watchmen being removed, the sheep may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to ruine.</p>
            <p>To take care that all who own Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion amongst us be required to attend upon the Ministry and dispensation of the Gospel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Aug.

            <p>To endeavor to heal and close up <hi>breaches</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <hi>Brethren, that men agreeing in Faith, Worship and Obedience,</hi> may be no longer strange to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but joyn hand in hand against the dangers which are threatned from a Common Adversary, who at those unhappy breaches hath let in these little enemies to open the door unto him.</p>
            <p>To secure and set mounds about <hi>fundamental Doctrines,</hi> and for that purpose to take care for <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>private</hi> Catechising.</p>
            <p>To provide that <hi>Ministers</hi> may be known to be <hi>Orthodox</hi> in the great and weighty <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> between us and <hi>Rome,</hi> that Wolves may never

privily creep in under sheeps cloathing.</p>
            <p>To hinder the <hi>printing</hi> and <hi>spreading</hi> of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and infectious Books either from Ports or Presses; or any other way of diffusing leaven into the people.</p>
            <p>I conclude with this profession, that I have not pressed this Doctrine of the <hi>peace</hi> of the Church to the straitning or grieving of any who love our Lord Jesus in sincerity. I know the best men <hi>know but in part,</hi> and must mutually bear with, and <hi>pray</hi> for one another, that wherein they differ God will reveal himself unto them. My aym and desire hath been to preserve the <hi>foundations,</hi> to keep <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> from such incroachments as may insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly make way for the endangering of it. We see what we could hardly have believed, how facile and flexible the minds of many people are to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and carried into opinions, which some years since they would as hardly have been perswaded to believe that they should live to imbrace, as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael</hi> was that he should rip up women with child.</p>
            <p>The Lord make you tender of his people, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant against his enemies, zealous for his Church, valiant for the Truth.</p>
