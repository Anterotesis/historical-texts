            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE benefits no doubt are great and manifold which almightie God of his large bountie &amp; exceeding goodnes of late yeeres hath plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully bestowed vppon this little ſoile of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſince the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reigne of our most gratious Souereigne, wherein the Goſpell hath ſincerely and freely beene preached<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whoſe time many &amp; ſtrange euents haue happened, to the great benefit of this countrie. For who haue not in admiration our long continuance of peace and tranquillitie, our neighbours all round about vs being in continual wars? Who doth not maruell at our plentie and
<pb facs="tcp:15683:3"/>
abundance of all things? It is miraculous in the indgement of the world, that ſo manie ſtrange ſtratagems practiſed by euill diſpoſed perſons, as well to ſubuert our quiet estate, as to take from vs our most Souereigne Ladie and Queene, far beyond the capacitie of man, as it were with Gods finger and power onely, haue beene from time to time ouerthrowen &amp; brought to nought. Infinite more tokens may particularly be recited, by the which men may iustly gather arguments of Gods well pleaſed mind with the gouernment of our most gratious Queene; amongst the which the bathes and medicinall waters of late yeeres diſcouered in ſundrie parts of England, are not of least moment: for most men yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing can witnes of many rare and ſtrange cures done by ſundrie wels heeretofore vnknowen: which may make manifest to the world that God is well pleaſed, and in that reſpect hath bleſſed this our countrie far more than other nations: and are as it were plaine arguments, to bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther princes to imbrace the Goſpell, to roote out all ſuperstition and idolatrie, to plant in their countries true religion out of Gods booke, and aboue all things, to ſeeke Gods glorie and his kingdome. And it is not altogither a vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, to thinke that God in theſe daies mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly reuealed wels and ſprings of medicinall waers neuer knowen before, to worke effects
<pb facs="tcp:15683:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtrange and maruellous in our ſights, thereby to induce all men to for ſake ſuch puddle pits which mans deuiſe hath digged, and drinke onely of the cleere fountaines of his word, thence onely to fetch remedy for our diſeaſed ſoules. The bathes of Bathe and Buckstan for their antiquitie and long proofe in times past, are of great fame, and no doubt as of more efficacie than others, may iustly most be accounted of: neuertheles manie other waters in England of late yeeres diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, haue the testimonie of experience by ſundry effects, and rare cures done by them, to haue no ſmall medicinall power, as by the euents in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie diſeaſed people receiuing remedie by them, hath beene made manifest. Amongst the which the wels in Warwickeſhire nigh a village called Newnam Regis, haue had most credite, by the vſe of which great numbers of people haue found helpe beyond their expectation, which yet liuing, do and will beare testimonie thereof: and no doubt many and rare vertues and qualities are in them far beyond common waters, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere by diligent ſearch of their minerals. If any ſhall obiect or ſeeke cauſe, why ſo many and ſo ſtrange euents ſuppoſed to be done at the first by theſe waters, the like are not now, nor haue not of late yeeres beene performed. Surely this came not by meanes of defects in the nature of the waters, but rather by the great abuſe of them,
<pb facs="tcp:15683:4"/>
For at my being there, I found great concurſe of alſorts of people affected with ſundry and diſſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſeaſes, which all in one maner vſed theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, both inwardly and outwardly, without coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell or any iust conſideration, carried away with opinion, as it ſeemed, that the faculties and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of them, were ſupernaturally giuen from God without any ordinarie meanes, and ſo the vſe of the ſame not to depend of any order or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of Phyſicke, but that it was ſufficient by any means to vſe them. Much like vnto the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of our forefathers, which in old time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted their pilgrimages, and the vowing of a penie to ſome one ſaint or other, or the dipping of a cloth in bathe waters, to be ſufficient for the curing of any of their maladies. And by theſe means the natures and qualities of theſe bath waters not conſidered, nor the constitutions and temperaments of the parties weighed, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued more hurt than good. For in truth euerie medicinall water doth not cure euery infirmitie, nor euerie man is to vſe euerie bathe: but theſe things are to be distinguiſhed, and ſo conſidered of by the learned, that the bathe may be apted to the diſeaſe, and be agreeable to the partie diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And amongst our countrimen, this is in truth a great fault: that when a thing is knowen to do good to many, we ſtraightwaies generally proceede in the vſe of it, without reſpect of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="tcp:15683:4"/>
of parties or of affects, as if one ſhoe might ſerue for euery mans foote, that we ceaſe not from abuſing of the ſame, vntill many bad ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes haue bred diſcredit to the thing: as of late hath appeered by the abuſe of Mechoacan and diuers other Indian and forren medicines. The conſideration heerof occaſioned me to thinke it not altogither a vaine labor, to write ſomewhat of the moſt famous bathes and medicinal waters in England, wherein I trauelled as well in thoſe of Bathe &amp; Buckstan, as in others. And haue an intent to publiſh the ſame, But vpon occaſion of the maruellous effects a few yeeres past done by thoſe wels in Warwickeſhire, not only heard but alſo ſeene by my ſelfe, through perſuaſion of ſome of my friends, I ſpent more time in triall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of them, than in the others, and ſo did wholy put mine endeuors for the diſcouerie of their minerals, natures, and properties, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to ſet foorth in what diſeaſes and bodies the ſame are most conuenient, not omitting the true vſe of them, when they are either inwardly to be droonken, or outwardly to be applied. Which in very deed I did accompliſh, euen when theſe wels were first reuealed, but I did forbeare to impart that I had done to any my friends, for that I was certainly informed, that an ancient learned man of my familiar acquaintance, intended to write and publiſh the ſame argument: who for his deep
<pb facs="tcp:15683:5"/>
learning graue iudgement, and long experience, would no doubt haue performed it in a far better ſort, had not thoſe his endeuors been preuented with vntimely death it herefore the expectation of that promiſed intent now void and made fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, I hauing of late occaſion to peruſe againe thoſe my trauels, and notes of my meditation of the aſore ſaid wels in Warwickeſhire, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame to ſome of my friends learned in the art of phyſicke, was by them perſuaded to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest in order theſe my conceits, and greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to communicate the ſame to many, whereby they which heerafter meane to vſe theſe bathes, may the better be informed how with iudgement and diſcretion to proceed in the true vſe of them, and the learned may be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned further to examine the minerals and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their effects, whereby I doubt not but that the fame of them may be restored to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer credit. In regard and conſideration heerof, and the rather that I may by this my enterpriſe be an occaſion and means to ſtir vp the deuotion and liberalitie of ſuch well diſpoſed perſons as are forward and zealous in furthering all ſuch good intents and purpoſes, I thought it not amiſſe by publiſhing this briefe diſcourſe, to ſignifie how good a deede it may be that ſome coſt were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed about theſe welles, that the ſame may be more commodious to ſuch as haue occaſion to
<pb facs="tcp:15683:5"/>
vſe them. For at the firſt, all medicinall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines are as naked ſprings, vnhandſome to vſe, vntill ſome ſuch perſonages haue by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence been ſtirred vp charitably to adorne the ſame with all conueniencie. And as in other countreys, men are greatly to be commended for their diligent cares in making all things about the bathes conuenient for the bathers, ſo truely ſome defect heereof is and may iustly be found in this our realme of England. For they which haue trauelled, do find the bathes in Italy and in diuers parts of Germany farre better ordered, than any heere in England, and do find fault that euen theſe our auncient bathes of Bathe and Buckstan are ſo ſlenderly left without any great addreſſing of things neceſſary. Much more ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe new diſcouered ſprings which are yet vtterly vnfurniſhed, do require the helpe of ſome able and well diſpoſed, for their ornament and good deuiſes meete for them which ſhall vſe them. And for as much as the purpoſe of mine attempt in this little pamphlet, tendeth onely to the publike benefite of my countrey, I moſt humbly requeſt, that as that mighty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian diſdained not a cup of common water offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him by a meane perſon, ſo your L. will vouchſafe to accept as a teſtimonie of dutiful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection this little treatiſe of medicinall waters, which I preſent to your L. at this time, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is well and trulie ſaid, and vpon very ſufficient ground &amp; reaſon, by <hi>Aristotle</hi> the chiefeſt learned of all the heathen Philoſophers, that Philoſophy procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and tooke his beginning from woonder and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For wheras in truth it is alwaies ſeene that we doubt, and are altogither igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the hidden cauſes of ſuch euents and things, which aſtoniſh and amaze vs, the wit of man being naturally indued with an vnſatiable deſire of knowledge, bendeth all his force and induſtrie to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the perfect diſcouerie of all ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret matters, neuer ceaſing or ſurceaſing painfull trauels with earneſt ſearch and inquirie, vntill he be fully ſatisfied and thoroughly reſolued touching al cauſes &amp; circumſtances belonging to ſuch effects
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15683:7"/>
as ſeemed ſtrange, whereunto when he hath attained, the woondring ceaſeth, the minde being ſatisfied with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion of the cauſes. Wherfore that aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that <hi>The beginning of Philoſophie is to woonder at nothing,</hi> as <hi>Scheg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius</hi> reporteth, doth not carrie ſo good probabilitie: the veritie of that affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather taketh place after Philoſophie is attained, than in the beginning. For we are not occaſioned to ſearch out the cauſes and grounds of things knowne which are not ſtrange vnto vs. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boreth about ordinary matters, ech man trauelleth to learne, heare, and know the cauſes of ſtrange euents, and of haps vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſual. So that we may iuſtly conclude with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that admiration and wondring gaue occaſion of Philoſophy, without the which no man is ſtirred with deſire of knowledge: and after the wit of man is ſatisfied with vnderſtanding of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which breed aſtoniſhment, the woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ceaſeth, and the minde is maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſlie pleaſed and delighted with the knowledge thereof. And as the veritie of this poſition is aboundantly confirmed in great varietie of naturall effects, which by meanes of their ſtrangenes haue been
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15683:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
occaſion to the learned in all ages to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their wits for the vnderſtanding &amp; apprehenſion of them: ſo amongſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things naturall bathes by meanes of their diuers operations and vertues in curing of ſundrie maladies and diſeaſes, haue vehemently incenſed &amp; ſtirred vp all dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtudents which beſtow their times in inquirie and ſearch of naturall cauſes, earneſtly to purſue the knowledge of their myſteries, not ceaſing vntill they haue thoroughly conceaued and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all ſuch intricate difficulties as vnto them appertaine. And of this very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular matter we haue had a domeſtical fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar example offered vnto vs within theſe fewe yeers heer in England. For it hapned not long ſince in Warwickſhire, neer vnto a Village called <hi>Newnam Regis,</hi> that a certaine husbandman occupied in lopping of trees, chaunced to receiue a greeuous wound in his hand, whereupon he repaired preſently to a fountain which was not far off: after he had waſhed and clenſed the wound very well with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he preſently found al pains of his hurt aſſwaged, and in ſhort time the wounde thoroughly cloſed &amp; healed, that he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no further helpe by the art of ſurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15683:8"/>
which effect he imparted to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, as a ſtrange ſucceſſe: and it ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the hearers, that after, another hauing a deepe wound in his heele with a ſieth, came to the ſame fountaine &amp; recouered &amp; was made hole onely with the lotion of the ſame water. Theſe and ſuch rare cures done by theſe wels, aſtoniſhed all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereabout. And the fame here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of occaſioned great concourſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of diſeaſed people to run into thoſe parts, and many receiued helpe of their infirmities, as is verefied by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the worſhipfull. So that the fame heerof confirmed now by often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was at length ſo far ſpread, that ſuch as were diſeaſed, almoſt out of all parts of this land, came to thoſe waters for reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: wherupon all men hauing the nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the matter in admiration, many in that they had not obſerued ſuch ſtrange things to be done by common water, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſome ſecret vertue to be imparted from God to theſe wels, whence ſuch rare cures were miraculouſly performed farre beſide and beyond the ordinary courſe of nature. The learneder and wiſer ſort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with the grounds of natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, after they vnderſtood the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

to be indeed not altogither fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and vaine, but to carrie much truth; to ſatisfie their woondering cogitations gaue themſelues to a farther ſearch, to finde out the true and naturall cauſes of theſe euents. For as it may be accounted meere impietie to detract any thing from the omnipotent power of God, to thinke his hand ſo ſhortened, that he is not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well able to produce things miraculouſly now in theſe our daies, without the mean of naturall cauſes, as he did often in times paſt: ſo without derogation of Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer I truſt, we may affirme, that in theſe our latter daies, God for the moſt part doth in his actions put natural meanes as inſtruments, of which the Philoſophers do conſider as naturall and inferior cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For if we ſhall ſay that God without any naturall courſe, ſupernaturally doth produce all things, we ſhall ſubuert all the grounds of Philoſophy and ſpoile nature of all actions. Rather in mine opinion we are to imbrace that ſaying in Geneſis, that God doth ceaſe from newe creation of things, hauing giuen to them a nature and power, by the which they ſtande and fall. For if theſe ſecond cauſes, as barren in themſelues, ſhould continually receiue
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15683:9"/>
facultie and power from the almightie, that otherwiſe they might not be meanes in Gods works: beſides that, we ſhal take away all generation and corruption in this world, we muſt imagine that there is daily a new creation of things, from the which God long ſince hath ceaſed, as we reade in the holie ſcriptures, when he did put all things created vnder a lawe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them a vertue and facultie, that the ſame might increaſe and multiply. This conſidered, I hope it will not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted impietie, by reaſonable diſcourſe to ſearch out the naturall means which God hath placed as cauſes of euents. Heerup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hauing heard the credible reports of rare and ſundry cures done in diuers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by thoſe Warwickſhire wels, the ſtrangeneſſe and woonder thereof cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to repaire thither, the better to learne the veritie &amp; truth of that I heard. And after I had a fewe daies obſerued the ſucceſſe and euent of things, and ſeene as much with mine eies as I had before hard with mine eares, I was in truth induced to beleeue that there was in thoſe wels ſome more ſecret and hidden qualities than are found in common waters, and ſo was ſtirred vp to inquire and to find out
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15683:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſome naturall cauſe of ſuch effects. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſurely I was at the firſt greatly diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, conſidering how hard a matter it hath alway been accounted amongſt the learned, to finde out the minerals of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall waters. For where many learned men haue written of Bathes, &amp; beſtowed much labor to finde out their ſecret na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and miſteries, they haue left in their monuments ſo diſſident and diuers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that hardly two writers do deliuer like iudgement: ſuch repugnancie of one matter, doth argue the hardnes and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of the ſame. And indeed the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of all fountaines, ſpecially of thoſe which are medicinall, are deepely ſeated and ſituated in the bowels of the earth, and the deepe caues of hils, that nature may ſeeme thereby to haue an intent to hide the myſteries of them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man, which happily may be cauſe that after men haue much labored to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and explaine all cauſes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances appertaining to Bathes, yet alwaies ſome thing happeneth, whereof ſufficient cauſe was not giuen, whereby the authors haue daily added to that, which was firſt expounded, and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcourſes, other euents haue fallen
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15683:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out, wherein mans wit coulde not in all points be ſatisfied, which hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſe to many of all ages to attribute the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of bathe waters vnto the diuine powers. For we read much written of the Bathes of Iupiter in Lybia, &amp; of the Baths dedicated to the ſun as of a diuine nature amongſt the Troglodites, the Bathes of Hercules accompted alſo a god, are much ſpoken of. The like ſuperſtition hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in amongſt Chriſtians, for in the late ignorant age, men haue dedicated ſome bathe waters to S. Anne, others to S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, others to S. Nicolas, others to S. Wynefride, others to S. Rumboll, and ſo others to diuers other ſaints, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance vnskilfull of the cauſes of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of ſuch waters, they ſuppoſing the effects doone by them to come by the grace of ſom ſaint, did yeeld diuine names vnto the bathes. Wherfore ſeeing it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the ſerch of the ſecret natures of Bathes in all ages hath been found ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie harde, and much hath troubled the learned, I truſt men in this our time will not take occaſion to carpe and reprehend my labors, if I now in this diſcourſe hap to pronounce of theſe late inuented foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, aſſertions contrary to ſome others
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15683:10"/>
opinions, or if I ſhall not now in this little pamphlet ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly explane the true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of theſe bathes, or elſe ſhall with ſome ſhew of probabilitie eſtabliſh ſome things which herafter may be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other wiſe. For we find that where many writers in ancient time haue largely diſcourſed of ſundrie bathes in Italie, yet the natures and cauſes of the ſame do ſeeme not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſcuſſed, but that in this our time late writers do diſallow of many poſitions of the former authors, and brag of better explanations found out, that a man may ſuppoſe it to bee an impoſſible matter throughly to diſcourſe of the conditions &amp; circumſtances of bathe waters. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let it not be accounted ſtrange if learned men do differ in opinion in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe Warwickſhire ſo late knowen bathes: and the indeuors of men are to be allowed though many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections appeere in a thing not yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently tried, which happily heereafter in time may be better eſtabliſhed. And vpon this ground truſting of the well accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my good meaning in this treatiſe, I haue taken incouragement to deliuer mine opinion and knowledge of theſe Warwickſhire waters as followeth.</p>

               <p>FOr the better diſcouerie of the ſecret faculties of theſe waters, I haue taken certaine quantities of them, and diſtilled them: I haue likewiſe examined them by filtrings and euaporations, and haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies obſerued and found in the end, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfect ſeparation of all the wateriſh parts, that there remaineth a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, in color whitiſh, and in taſte ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſalt, which being put vpon a glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hote iron, doth foorthwith become cleerer and whiter. And although this be a propertie common to the Limeſtone, Plaiſter, and Alabaſter, when they are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in bath waters, yet I am perſuaded,<note place="margin">Limeſtone</note> that onely the Limeſtone, and neither of the other two, entreth the mixture of theſe waters, bicauſe neither Plaiſter, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alabaſter are commonly found neer vnto theſe wels, but the Limeſtone is there frequent euery where. And furthermore Plaiſtrie waters are accounted vnwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to be droonken, but theſe are found healthfull, and very commodious in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15683:11"/>
affects for them which ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe them. I haue alſo farther probabilitie heereof, for that there is in theſe waters ſom ſtone iuice: for it is ordinarily obſerued, that if there be drowned, in them either wood, or any other ſuch like ſolide ſubſtance, it is after a ſhort time couered and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne with a kinde of hard cruſt like a ſtone: for in very truth ſuch things are not made ſtonie, but outwardly imbrued with a ſtonie cruſt. Moreouer, wheras the aforeſaid reſidence or grounds is found in taſte to be ſalt, it is to be ſurmiſed that either ſalt or Niter haue place in this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But bicauſe it is the propertie of ſalt, if it be put to the fire to crackle and leape, and this reſidence being ſo vſed, doth onely ſparkle without any noiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, I would thinke it more probable, to refer it vnto Niter, than vnto ſalt, and for<note place="margin">Niter.</note> this cauſe the rather, for that I haue often noted it to haue greater acrimonie, &amp; to pearce the toong deeper, than ſalt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wont to do: ſo that it is euidant, that Limeſtone and Niter are in ſubſtance in theſe waters: The coniectures of other things ſuppoſed to be mingled are not ſo manifeſt, yet there is great probabilitie, that ſome portions of Allum are in theſe <note place="margin">Allume.</note>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:15683:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
waters: for that it is obſerued, that if the water of theſe wels being heate, and caſt vpon new pewter veſſels, they will yeelde to them the colour or tincture of Allum. Moreouer, if you die common water with any blacke colour, and powre the ſame vpon the ſediment of this bath, the darke colour of that water will waxe brighter and more cleere; and this effect by al wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is accounted proper to Allum. There<note place="margin">Iron.</note> is no ſmall ſuſpicion, that ſome parts of iron alſo are mixed with theſe waters. For daily much iron ore is founde euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in places neer adioining. And hard by theſe fountains, a kind of clay is found of colour like to ruſtie iron. Likewiſe if you caſt ſtrong vineger vpon the grounds of theſe waters, being ſeparated by ſuch meanes as is aforeſaid, you ſhall ſee the droſſe floting in the top to reſemble iron. But beſides all theſe probabilities I am the rather induced to credite, that this mettall hath place in theſe waters, for that the vſe of them is daily ſeene to be very profitable in affects of the Splene, Reines, and Bladder: for I my ſelfe being there preſent, am an eie witnes, that one, which by long obſtruction had a ſcirrous ſplene manie yeeres, by the vſe of theſe

Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I did ſee another, which being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to a ſtrangurie, by means of a ſtone in his bladder, when no other helpe could ſerue, the drinking of this water brake the ſtone, and the man was in ſhort time hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The like ſucceſſe haue I there ſeene in diuers other affects, as namely in womens whites, in the gonorrhaicall paſſion, and in all inward exulcerations, both of the reins and the bladder, ſo that I may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that theſe baths are not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void of iron: and I could hartily wiſh that they did more abound with this met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, for manie excellent effects which were conſequently to be expected heerof.</p>

For the Limeſtone (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola</hi> writeth in his booke of minerals) hath a drieng qualitie, which is increaſed by the mixture of the Niter, Iron, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, which all haue force to drie, ſo that I may reaſonably conclude, that this bath drieth to the fartheſt of the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, how beit the cooling and refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extendeth not ſo far, for that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of this qualitie is mitigated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the heate of Niter.

Touching the ſecond faculties of the minerals of theſe waters, we find iron to haue an aſtringent and corroborating force, very conuenient in diſeaſes of the liner and ſplene: Niter, to be abſterſiue, reſoluing, diſcuſſing, extenuating and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of groſſe and clammiſh humors: and Allume not only to be aſtringent, but alſo to haue force to abſterge and clenſe: ſo that heereof the diſcreete phyſition may plainly ſee the cauſes why theſe waters do

Concerning the firſt, the diſcreet phyſition is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red withall, whether the vſe of theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be conuenient for the preſent affect and diſeaſe or no: bicauſe euery bathe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not a remedie for euerie ſicknes: but the learned phyſition will eaſily ſatisfie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man in theſe points, by comparing the nature and conditions of the diſeaſe, with the faculties of the water. The phyſition likewiſe is to be conſulted, whether the partie himſelfe which purpoſeth to vſe theſe medicinall waters, be for other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects in caſe apt to receiue them: for they are not without good conſideration to be offered either vnto children, or vnto olde perſons. The habite alſo and ſtate of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15683:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the bodie is to be regarded, for it fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſometimes that ſome one part may receiue good by the bathe, &amp; others may be hurt: as if a man hath hot kidneies, to temper them with theſe waters may be thought conuenient, yet if the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his bodie togither with his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke be colde and weake, in ſuch caſe theſe waters are not raſhly to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. Likewiſe if the patient haue an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, we may not but with great warines cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell theſe waters. And where it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that the partie which drinketh of them, do in reaſonable ſort exerciſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himſelfe, during the time hee drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it is not conuenient to aduiſe the ſame to one which can by no meanes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his bodie. It is alſo diligently to be prouided, that ſuchas vſe the Bathes be not inwardly ſubiect to obſtructions, and that the veins be large, and the waies open. For if the veines be verie little, that the bathe water cannot paſſe, many inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences therof may inſue: therfore dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent care is to be had, that the veines be large, and the paſſages open. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the time to drinke bathe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is not of leſt moment. For albeit ſom are of opinion that medicinall waters
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15683:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may at al times be dronken, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is of the beſt learned concluded, that the winter ſeaſon is altogither vnfit to drink any medicinal water. And where all ſuch waters are found in their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains actually, either hot or cold, it is beſt to vſe the ſprings actually hot in tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſeaſons, as in the ſpring and the fall of the leafe. They which are actually cold are taken with beſt ſucceſſe, in hotter weather. So experience hath taught vs that theſe Warwikſhire wels, which are both actually and potentially colde, are dronken with moſt commoditie in the hotteſt time of the ſommer, and that the hotter and drier the ſommer time is, the more holeſome, and of the better effecte theſe waters are. I am not ignorant that in conſideration of the time to vſe bathe waters, the learned do diſpute whether the ſame may be miniſtred in the leape yeere, for that our authors heerin haue written diuerſely, and pronounced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinions, it ſeemeth to me not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie by long diſcourſe heerof, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the reader: onely this I ſay, as I do not thinke but medicinall waters may be vſed in leape yeares, when great occaſion vrgeth, ſo for my part I would not raſhly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15683:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
counſel any to vſe them in the leap yeers, vnleſſe great cauſe do vrge the vſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is an olde obſeruation that in rainie weather bath waters are not ſo wholſom: whereby we are to thinke that the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the ayre preſent for this our purpoſe is not to be neglected, wherin the Italian writers are ſo curious, that they do admoniſh that no man ſhould drinke bath waters in moiſt ſeaſons, nor in moiſt places: in which reſpect they do diſſwade the drinking of the waters of Aponum at the fountaines. Much more then, we ought to be carefull heerof, in taking of theſe Warwickſhire waters, for that this our countrie is much more ſubiect to bluſtering winds, raine, and ſtormes, and alſo bicauſe theſe waters are actually cold in their fountaines. Wherefore I do in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nywiſe aduiſe my countryme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue in purpoſe to vſe theſe wels, to forbeare them in wet and rainy ſeaſons: for the rain water being compounded and mixt with the other, maketh them either altogither vnholſome, or at the leaſt leſſe profitable, and effectuall, than otherwiſe they would be. Laſt of all, this precept is general, that before the drinking of any medicinall waters, they which are to vſe them, ought

to haue their bodies well prepared and purged: ſurely I thinke it moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that we in England omit not the like practiſe vpon the like occaſion. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we do abound commonly with manie and corrupt humors in our firſt veines, we muſt diligently ſee that theſe be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remooued: and heer in this place I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſſe ouer with ſilence the ordinarie practiſe of ſome of our phyſitions, which think it ſufficient to ſend their patients to the Bathes with ſome one ſleight purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where as in truth we are not to ſtand vpon, once, twiſe, or thriſe purging of ſuch which are to drinke medicinall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but to ſee that their bodies be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged. And where this precept is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted moſt neceſſarie in all Bathes and countries, we ought verie religiouſly to obſerue the ſame heer in England, and the rather when theſe waters are dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which do ſpring actually cold, and for that cauſe with more difficultie do paſſe thorough their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which receiue them.</p>

               <p>FIrſt in the morning let the patient af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is riſen, before he taketh this drinke, vſe ſome light exerciſe, as wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or ſuch like, vntill his inward heate be well ſtirred vp, and then let him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge himſelfe of all excrements, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as he can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being done, let him take his drinke, but in ſuch ſort, that he quaffeth not vp all the whole quantity which he is to take, at once: but let him diuide it into diuers draughts, &amp; ſo drink it by little and little, walking ſomewhat betweene euery draught, and yet hauing this regarde, that within the ſpace of an houre and a halfe, the whole quantitie which is preſcribed vnto him be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For by theſe meanes his ſtomack wil not be ouercharged, but will be well able to digeſt the whole quantitie of water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in ſuch ſort, that it will be the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perfectly diſpatched through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and the partie apt and readie to take freſh at his ordinarie ſeaſon.</p>

               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, I thinke it very neceſſarie, that after the water is all dronken, the ſicke man haue good regard for the houre and time, when he is to take his meate. And whereas this cannot be certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and ſet downe, bicauſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and vnknowne varietie of diuers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it is diligently to be conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the greateſt part of the water recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that morning be already paſt thorow him, for if either the whole or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the water be rid out, he may ſecurely take his meat. The like he may do alſo although neither of theſe two hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, if he finde his vrine which at the firſt came from him waterie and whitiſh, to be nowe ſomewhat citrin and of higher co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, for this is an euident ſigne that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath reſerued the reſidue of theſe waters vnto certain vſes, &amp; that ſhe wil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them either the next night or the day following. In like maner if nature disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening hirſelfe of theſe waters by ſiege, doth manifeſtly ceaſe from ſo doing, the partie which receiueth them may ſafelie take meate.

               <head>The quantitie of water which is to be dronken, and how in diuers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it is diuerſly to be vſed.</head>
               <p>IN drinking of medicinall waters no certaine quantitie can be ſet downe which may ſerue generally for al men, but the diſcreet phyſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which knoweth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly the qualities of the bath, the conſtitution of the ſicke partie, and the nature of the diſeaſe: may eaſily preſcribe a fit and conuenient quantitie. After that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15683:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this is determined, ancient authors wold haue this to be obſerued, that the ſicke partie ſhould begin his drinking in leſſer quantitie, and ſo proceede increaſing it daily vntill the firſt portion be doubled, at what time he is to diminiſh it againe, vntill he returne by little and little vnto the quantitie, which he receiued the firſt day: as for examples ſake, if ſixe pintes be appointed, the greateſt quantitie to be drunken, they would haue the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent drinke the firſt day three pintes, the ſecond day foure pints, the thirde daie fiue pints, and the fourth day, ſixe pints, and to proceed no further, but to returne by detracting from this quantity daily by little and little, as by drinking the fift day fiue pints, the ſixt day foure, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day three, and ſo to giue ouer. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this was the cuſtome among the ancient, yet in this our country &amp; in theſe bathes, I thinke it not conuenient ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly to obſerue this order. For where as we are not accuſtomed to drinke wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we are not to charge our ſtomackes with ſuch great quantities of the ſame: How beit our diſeaſes oftentimes require ſuch quantitie of it, that if we ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe to drinke of theſe waters, after we
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15683:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue riſen to the doubling of the firſt dais quantitie, we ſhould reape either litle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie by the ſame, or none at al. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vſe and experience hath taught vs to begin heerin, with a leſſe quantitie, and to increaſe it daily, not only to the doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the firſt portion, but far beyonde, vntill we come to that which the nature of the diſeaſe exacteth. For as I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes obſerued in the drinking of theſe Warwikſhire waters, when the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt quantitie which we purpoſe to giue for one day, is eight pints, ſo we begin not with foure: for almoſt no man is able at the firſt to brooke ſo much, but rather we begin with two pints, or at the moſt with three, and ſo go forwarde euery day, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one pint, vntill we come to eight, (not ſtanding vpon the proportion of doubling) beyond the which quantitie, I will not counſell any man to aduenture. If there be any man that hath ſo ſtrong a ſtomacke, that he is able to receiue foure pints the firſt day: I do not diſlike, but that he may begin the firſt daie with foure, and ſo following the maner of the ancient writers, proceede vntill he come to the double quantitie: but bicauſe I haue obſerued that the moſt part of men
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15683:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are not able to receiue ſo great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, my aduiſe is, rather that they take a leſſe portion the firſt day: as namely two or three pints, and ſo from thence aſcend vntill they come to eight. And this haue I found to be the ſafeſt kind of vſing theſe waters: which although it paſſeth ſlowly through the bodie, ſo that in many daies it is not rid out of diuers, before they come to the drinking of foure or fiue pints in a morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet do I find no great inconuenience to follow hereof, bicauſe thoſe parties purging in the night ſeaſon verie liberally by vrine, do no doubt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge great quantitie of this water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And for that I noted alwais, that theſe waters do eaſily pas thorough mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, when they are dronken to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of foure or fiue pints in a morning: I haue oftentimes appointed ſuch as haue had ſtrong ſtomackes, to begin the firſt day with foure pints, and ſo according to the cuſtome of the ancient, to double, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they come to eight, and from thence by little and little to deſcend, vntill they returne to foure. I muſt confeſſe, there haue been diuers, wherof I haue knowne ſome, to haue dronken ten pintes in a morning, and ſome twelue: but for my
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15683:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
part I can not in any wiſe either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend, or like of theſe exceſſiue quantities. For wheras theſe waters are both actually and potentially cold, ſuch ouer liberall drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them hath brought many to ſuch extreeme coldnes of ſtomacke, that they haue been driuen for a long time after to vſe Aqua vitae and hot things to recouer their former heate and ſtrength againe. Wherefore it is ſafeſt to conſiſt in a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocritie, and neuer to aduenture to drink aboue ſixe, or at the vttermoſt eight pintes: &amp; when the diſeaſed party is come to the greateſt portion, it is not good to perſiſt any time in the ſame, but ſtraight, euen the next day, to deſcend to a leſſer quantitie: and when by an orderly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending he is come to foure, or to three pintes, let him by and by giue ouer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he began the firſt day with two pintes, for otherwiſe nature will hardly be able to auoid thoſe leſſe quantities which are laſt take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wheras <hi>Fallopius</hi> would haue vs to drinke all medicinall waters actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hote, and would haue ſuch for that purpoſe to be heat, which in their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines are found cold, I can not in any wiſe like of this his aduiſe: for all men for the moſt part can better both receiue and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15683:22"/>
conteine theſe waters cold, then hote, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when any great quantity of the ſame is taken. Furthermore in heating of ſuch bath waters, many of the minerall ſpirits are altered and euaporated. I do better therefore allow of drinking theſe waters actually cold as they are taken out of the ſprings.</p>
               <p>It ſhall not be amiſſe to mingle for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers purpoſes, ſome things with theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when they are to be drunken: as for example, when we will haue them eaſily to paſſe through the liuer and the reines, the adding of ſugar, or ſome conuenient iulep, by meanes of their ſweetnes, will be occaſion of their ſpeedier conueyance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the farther diſtant places of the bodie. So likewiſe, when we will haue theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to haue free paſſage thorough the guts, we may adde ſome little quantity of ſalt vnto them, for heereby they will the better looſe the belly: heereof I haue had in theſe waters good experience. For at my being at theſe fountaines, a certayne man well knowne vnto me, comming to theſe welles for the cure of a Strangurie, cauſed by a ſtone in his bladder, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was long time troubled, and drinking dayly great quantities of this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15683:22"/>
water, he fell into a looſenes, auoiding the water by his belly: which when I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, I cauſed him to mingle ſugar to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery draught of the water, by which meanes, the water had paſſage by vrine, and ſo the partie receiued cure of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, it fortuned another man to drinke plentifully of this water, and auoiding the ſame by vrine onely, grew to be very coſtiue and much bound in his belly, who requiring of me remedie for the ſame, I aduiſed him to adde to euery draught, ſuch a portion of ſalt, as might make the water a little brackiſh, whereby his belly was well looſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of any other meanes. So that for theſe aforeſaid reſpects, it ſhall be alwayes expedient to ſeaſon this water with one or both of theſe two condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and ſurely the ſtomacke doth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like and endure theſe waters by theſe mixtures. Notwithſtanding ſuch men which haue their conduits ſo open, that they need no ſuch helpe, for the eaſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance or paſſage of the water through their bodies, we may preſcribe this water ſincere and ſimple without any ſuch mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, except either the party affected, or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15683:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the diſeaſe ſhall require the ſame. How long and how many dayes the diſeaſed perſon is to continue the drinking of theſe waters, it is eaſily knowne by the quantitie which is preſcribed: for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie dayes onely are to be ſpent therein, as by increaſing and diminiſhing the whole preſcribed quantitie of the water (according to the manner aforeſayd) may be receiued, which is accompliſhed for the moſt part in tenne or twelue dayes.</p>
               <p>There is no man ſo rude and ignorant, which knoweth not that thoſe which minde to reape any benefite by theſe bathes, ought for the preſent time eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to feed vpon ſuch meates as yeeld good iuice, and are of eaſy concoction, whereof there are diuers ſorts in dayly vſe, which to rehearſe in this place were ſuperfluous. But one precept of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Fallopius I can not but heere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, who aduiſeth vs in this caſe to feed more liberally at dinner, then at ſupper, becauſe (ſaith he) an ouerlarge ſupper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in the night following ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth the ſtomacke, and ſo the next morrow leaueth ſuch crudities in that part, that the partie is vnreadie to receiue the water at his due houre: for thoſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15683:23"/>
muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cocted or auoided before the party may drinke the bathe water the day following: ſo neceſſary it is to make a light ſupper. Wherefore the vſage and manner of our countreymen in England is vtterly to be condemned, which whiles they are vſing the bathes, haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to frugality of diet, but both in their dinner and ſupper ſo farre exceed, and ſwarue from this former rule, that it is not to be maruelled at, that there be ſo few in our countrey, which ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue any commoditie or health by meanes of the bathes. I admoniſh them therefore to be more ſparefull in their dyet, and ſo they ſhall gayne health to their bodies, and comfort to their purſſe.</p>

               <p>IT oftentimes falleth out that the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſons which haue vſed medicinall waters, do not preſently finde the profite and commoditie acquired by them, but long after when they haue left the vſe of them, and are gone from the bathes; ſo that many times they go thence with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15683:24"/>
harts, ſuppoſing that they haue not receiued that goodnes which they hoped for, yet many daies after, perhaps not before the ſpace of a moneth be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they feele what good the bathes haue done to them: whereby we are to coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the vertues and qualities, of the bath waters do remain a long time in the members and parts of the body, yeelding ſtrength vnto them, by which meanes the commodities obtained by the bathes do appeere long time after the vſe of them: in which conſideration it is requiſite, that they which haue vſed medicinall waters, do for a good ſeaſon after, carefully and orderly gouerne themſelues, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and properties of the waters may be reſerued in the body, vntil they haue don their effects and operations. Therefore it is to be wiſhed, that all bathers, after the vſe of the bathes, for a good ſeaſon doe keepe a good diet in feeding vpon meats which are eaſie to be digeſted, &amp; do breed a good iuice: as after the taking of the bathe waters the partie may not feed too ſparefully, ſo he muſt beware of ouergor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: let him therefore keepe a meane in his feeding, giue himſelfe to pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and not ouermuch to expoſe his

bodie to colde aier, but keepe himſelfe reaſonably warme. And aboue all things he muſt eſchue laſciuious and venerious ſports, which the learned do forbid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the vſe of bathes by the ſpace of a moneth, as a thing moſt pernitious.</p>
