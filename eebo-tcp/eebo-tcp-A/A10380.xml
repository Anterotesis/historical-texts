            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

but there is a greater and worſe, in mixing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
trueth with errour in the worſhip of <hi>GOD,</hi>
for they have joyned with the word <hi>GOD,</hi> their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,

with the adoration of the Creator the adoration of

out with the feet of our body,<note place="margin">What it is to come out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</note> but three wayes

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16065:6"/>
forſakeing them, and that with reſolution never

(which was three hundred yeares before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>)
was in myſtick <hi>Babylon</hi> the <hi>Romane</hi> church:
But though it was in it, it was not of it; for if it
had beene of it (as <hi>John</hi> ſayeth) it had not went
from out of it: It was in it, and with it as a maſſe
of metall conſolidat of gold, ſilver, and tinne,
wherein though the gold and ſilver be mixed with
the tinne, they are no part of the tinne, and by
the melting of the skilfull founder, are ſeparate
and diſtinguiſhed one from another. So were the
good and the bad mixed together in the Romane
church, till <hi>GOD</hi> by the Reformers, as ſo many
skilfull founders, did ſeparate and divide his own
Elect from the reprobate. If it bee further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,

out the vials of his wrath upon <hi>Rome,</hi> is her corrupt
doctrines and hereſies: for ſhee is loaden not with
one hereſie only but heaps of hereſies. For clearing
of this, hereſie is to be conſidered materially and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally:
A materiall hereſie is an erronious doctrine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

A formall hereſie, when a doctine everting the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grounds of Truth, is maintained with obſtinacie.
Materiall errours was received into the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
when the doctrine of <hi>the reſurrection of the dead</hi>
was called in queſtion: The like befell the churches
of <hi>Galatia</hi> when <hi>circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>works of the law</hi>
was thought neceſſare ſupplements to <hi>Faith</hi> to make
up our <hi>justification before. GOD:</hi> Yet becauſe theſe
foreſaid errours was not defended with obſtinacie,
the maintainers were not formally hereticks. But in
the <hi>Romane</hi> church doctrines everting <hi>Ground trueths</hi>
are defended with obſtinacie, and the opponents
perſecuted with fire and ſword; wherefore ſhee is
juſtlie charged with hereſies,<note place="margin">Hereſies againſt Faith.</note> and that both againſt
faith, and the dueties commanded in the law; as
followeth. It is an hereticall doctrine maintained
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16065:10"/>
in the church of <hi>Rome</hi> with obſtinacie, that <hi>the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

and myſtically, by certaine degrees unknown
at the firſt, till they did ſhow themſelves in their

Invocation of Saints had its originall from
the feſtivall dayes dedicat to Saints, firſt in the church
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> for the commemoration of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome
of <hi>Polyearpus</hi> biſhop there; but it did not
ſtay at a bare commemoration of the death of the
martyre, and thankſgiving to God; but this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
grew from a commemoration to publick ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting
in the annuall feſtivities of Saints, and from
publick banqueting to nomination in Church pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
from nomination to Rhetorick compellation,
and from that to invocation, and conſequentlie to
idolatrie. Likewiſe the ſigne of the croſſe was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for a ſymbole of gloriation, that Chriſtians were
not aſhamed, but did glorie in the croſſe of Chriſt;
then it became impetrative as a virtuall prayer for
ſanctification,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Cruce.</note> thereafter operative for expelling of
divels and diſeaſes; and from aeriall croſſes they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16065:22"/>
came to materiall croſſe, and from a relative wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of them to a terminative inferiour worſhip, and
from that to a divine worſhip. Images was alſo firſt
received as ornaments to beautifie the church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
as books to teach the unlearned, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
conduits only to convoy worſhip to the Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
till at laſt they were adored. Prayer for the
dead is not founded upon ſcripture, (as <hi>Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

that there was then no ſacrifice of the body of
