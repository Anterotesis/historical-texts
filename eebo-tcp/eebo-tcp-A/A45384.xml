            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Believe we have been a Table-talk in moſt parts of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> theſe three Years paſt; but much more ſince our Divident of <hi>Indigent Money</hi> hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted us: not ſix Weeks Pay for ſix Years Service, and ſixteen years Sufferings; many Cenſures and Judgments hath been caſt upon many Men in the handling of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: For my part I ſhall reflect upon none, but declare the truth of what I have ſeen, and heard, and know in it; The <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> did intend a better Gratuity than it fell <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57211:4"/>out to be. And ſo it would have proved, had it been ſhared to none but thoſe that were truly quallified according to the Act; but who would not lay Claim to have an Intereſt in the Act, when there was neither Penalty nor Puniſhment for the breakers of it? If any could procure a Certificate from any Colonel or Captain, that he was a Commiſſion Officer, that Certificate (with the aſſiſtance of ſome Friends, to any one or more of the Commiſſioners) would produce Five of their Hands and Seals, they believing the Party quallified according to the Certificate that is ſo produced from the ſaid Officers, which Officers, it is poſſible, are to go ſharers with them they ſo certifie for, when they receive their Money; as I believe too many hath (with Impudence) gone clearly off with that Cheat; Others have Ride up and down the Country, and for ſome Money in hand, and ſo much in the pound (when they receive their Devident) they would ſecure their buſineſs, and warrant them they ſhall ſtand right or wrong; and if they would but conceit themſelves Officers, they would perſwade them they were ſo; and let the Royal Party that (knew they were no ſuch men) prove it, and by Oath maintain it and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them out; yet thoſe Men were brought in again, and have received part of this Money, and it is not known which way; &amp; if it were, we cannot help it: It hath been proved that ſome hath been dead ſix years, ſome ten years, and ſome ſixteen years; yet thoſe men hath been raiſed again, not to receive their Money becauſe they are inviſible and not to be ſeen, but to make over Letters of Attourneys to have their Monies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for them by ſuch as are not to learn to Cheat us now, as well as they could the King formerly, by their dead Muſters, and ſo make him a great Army of Officers now, as they did Souldiers then; but when they were to do him Service, there could not the Fourth part be found, no more there will be of theſe <hi>Indigent Officers</hi> if the King ſhould call them for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or to have a ſtrict Accompt whether they be quallified according to the Act.</p>
               <p>Another ſort there is of <hi>Indigent Officers</hi> that carried their Commiſsions in their Pockets, that either could not Raiſe <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57211:4"/>their Regiments Companies, or Troops, or elſe would not; yet theſe made all or moſt part of their Officers, eſpecially Quarter-Maſters, which muſt provide their Captains quarter for a Troop, though he had never a Man beſides his Officers and their Pedee's and Baggage Hotſes: theſe would lye upon the Out quarters of the Army if there were no Danger; elſe in one Regiment or other: Theſe would ſerve themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under no Command; never venturing their Lives unleſs it were to Plunder, making the Army odious by their actions; ſo that civil and gallant Fighting-men were look'd upon by the Country where they march'd, as our Indigent Party is here in the City, all a like; ſo that a truly Loyal and Indigent Officer now is aſhamed to own himſelf in regard of ſo many Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits which hath abuſed both the King and Country, and is rank'd in amongſt us, and received as much as any of the beſt of us; whether it be their Due or no, I leave that to thoſe in time may pleaſe to Conſider of it, if <hi>this Book</hi> come to their hands; which I hope it will.</p>
               <p>Others there is (that hath had a great ſhare in this Money) that may be termed Indigent Officers, but whether quallified according to the Act, that I ſhall not judge of; and they are ſuch as never ſerved the King (if they did) not as Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Officers till after 1646, which was at the Riſing in <hi>Kent,</hi> about a Week ſtanding; or at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> or in Duke <hi>Hamble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Engagement, two or three Months ſtanding; or in Sir <hi>George Boothes</hi> buſineſs; and all theſe petty Riſings and Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Rand Officers, that never went out of their own County or Garriſons where they lived, that were only in a readineſs to help to ſave themſelves, not being able to endure the ſcent of a light Match upon Service; yet theſe are brought in for Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Officers too.</p>
               <p>And then for <hi>Colonels,</hi> to make their Serving-men and Grooms Officers, to put in for the Money; and Captains to appoint Lievtenants, Cornets, Enſigns and Quarter-maſters, (in a Tavern or an Alehouſe) and go half ſnips with them; this they counted no Cheat if the Officers were dead: Others if they ſerved the <hi>Parliament</hi> (after the <hi>King</hi> was Murdered) <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57211:5"/>till the Reſtauration of our Soveraign that now is: nay, ſome of them proved great <hi>Trappaners</hi> to the King's Friends now in theſe times; yet theſe are rank'd with the truly Loyal and Indigent Officers, ſuch as were in Pay, when we were in Priſon, and could March the ſtreets, when we were forced to hide our heads: If theſe be not Grievances (which we have cauſe to lay open) let Friends and Enemies both be our Judges; When it was proved upon Oath before Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that ſome never had <hi>Command</hi> in their lives: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others, that there was no ſuch Men known, not ſo much as Troopers, or Souldiers, which claimed to be Captains and Commiſsion Officers, and many of them never appeared to anſwer for themſelves, if there were any ſuch, as I believe it will be made appear there was not: To be ſhort, When we thought there had been 1500 at leaſt turned out by <hi>Inſpection,</hi> there was 300 more then the firſt Number taken in; ſo that we were ſenceable it was but a folly to ſtrive againſt the ſtream, being driven more and more backward.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe <hi>Indigent Officers</hi> that leapt from Corporals to Quarter-Maſters, and from Cornets to Captains, Majors, and Lievtenant-Colonels, to put themſelves in Colonels; and to make their Brothers or Kindred Lievtenant-Colonels and Majors under them, that was accounted nothing, though it were within a Week or a Fortnight before the laying down of Arms; and ſome too that never did the King Service ſince, nor I believe will never be Chronicled for their Service they did his Father formerly; for their Loyalty, it may be they are clear; for I believe they were like a Chip in Pottage, never did hurt nor good, neither for the King nor his Friends, but all for their own Ends: Indigent they may be termed, but by their Inſinuating, they have gotten good Gifts and Rewards that hath been given by the King (and others) intended for thoſe that was deſerving, and poor; but the Proverb ſaith, <hi>Kiſsing goes by favour;</hi> and Rewards beſtowed upon them that can make beſt Friends, when Service and Deſarts either lyes in Priſon, or dare not peep out for fear; as by ſome 'tis too openly known, that through Want and Grief together, being <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57211:5"/>aſhamed to make their wants known, eſpecially ſince the King came in, have broke their hearts to ſee ſome of their Friends ſlighting them for their Poverty: And others, that would willingly Relieve them, but not able, the more is their grief, and to be pittied.</p>
               <p>Now there is another ſort of truly Loyal, but not Indigent; which ſome of them I much honour, having been much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed in Eſtate by their Service for the King, and never yet had any Reward, that hath put in for a Part of this Money, that are not ſo Indigent; but if they had thought to what a pittiful ſum it would amount to, they would have left it to them that had more need: But there are ſome again that hath had good Rewards and Offices (under the King) given them, ſome more then their Commands, their Service, or their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings ever merited, yet hath put in, and taken ſhare of this Money too, being ſo covetous as to rob the ſpittle (as I may term it) being ungrateful to his Majeſty for his Favour to them formerly, and abuſing his Charity in this which was now intended for them that were Really in Want for the preſent: I believe there are ſome that hath taken of this Money, that if the truth were known (as it may be made appear) that they have gotten (beſides their Places) near a Thouſand pounds a man, and ſome have Three-ſcore, ſome an Hundred, nay, Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a year; yet all theſe have put in for Indigent Officers; ſo what I have here Related concerning our Greivancees is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth; and much more can be proved by the truly Loyal and Indigent Party, to the ſhame of ſome Perſons (that ſhall be nameleſs) if once called to an account: our Wants and Neceſsities hath been ſo great, that it is not unknown upon what Rates ſome men hath been fain to borrow Money, as at Five ſhillings in the pound, and a Gratuity to ſome to help them to it: Some indeed borrowing ſo much, I believe they will never come to look for more, knowing they have no right to any of our Money, if all things had been rightly carried: Beſides, there hath been abundance of honeſt Tradeſ-men and Houſe-keepers undone by Truſting and Helping us in the time we waited for this Money, not any of them thinking but <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57211:6"/>it would amounted in ſome meaſure to a ſatisfied every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate mans Debts; but falling out as it hath done, it hath undone them, and us too; for ſome of them are not able to Relieve themſelves now, that formerly Relieved us, that of neceſsity if God doth not raiſe Friends for ſome, they muſt want Lodging, Food, and Rayment, unleſs it be provided them in a Priſon, as too many can witneſs ſince they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Indigent Money; many being caſt into Priſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, others having neither Money nor Credit, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity either beg, ſteal, or ſtarve, unleſs God be pleaſed to raiſe them Friends, to move His <hi>Majeſty</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> to provide for them, as they out of their Mercy and Wiſdom ſhall think fit; which will not be (of the truly Loyal and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Party, that can prove themſelves quallified according to the Act, not) the Fift part of thoſe that have gotten their ſhare of this laſt Money, which I ſhall more clearly make out how they may be proved at the latter end of this <hi>Book.</hi>

               <p>AS the Complaints are great of the Indigent Party, to the grief of many civil men (their Friends) ſo their griefs hath been as great to hear the Complaints againſt them, which I confeſs is not without a cauſe: And give me leave to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to you thoſe faults which are too openly ſeen, and heard, to our ſhame in the World; that makes many ſay, We can ſee the <hi>Moats</hi> in others eyes, but perceive not the <hi>Beams</hi> that are in our own. Our Sufferings was great before his Majeſty was Reſtored, you will ſay 'tis greater now: 'Tis true our ſins was great before, they are far greater now; God hath Reſtored us to our Peace and Liberty, which we ſo long prayed for, and <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57211:6"/>wiſh'd for, what Returns have we made to him for that Mercy? Inſtead of ſending new Praiſes and Thankſgivings to preſent him from our hearts and lips for thoſe Mercies, we have Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted New Oathes and Curſes to ſend him: He that cannot Swear and Swagger, Drink, Rant, and Rogue, is look'd upon (by ſome) as a pittiful Fellow, and not worth their keeping Company; and if he cannot Vapour, he is not look'd upon to have any Valour: Theſe Vices have got ſuch a cuſtome of late, that they are look'd upon to be the only <hi>Badge</hi> to diſtinguiſh a <hi>Cavalier</hi> from a <hi>Sectary,</hi> that you ſhall find in Court and Camp, in City and Country, that thoſe that are crept into places of profit and preferment by their Purſes (which I believe ſerves the King more for lucre of Pay, then love to his Perſon) theſe now are become as abſolute <hi>Dam-me Boys</hi> as the beſt (or the worſt I may ſay) which formerly would as ſoon cut a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers throat as ſwear an Oath, and eſteemed it a leſs ſin, unleſs it had been the <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Engagement;</hi> but I have no more to ſay to them: but how can we look for Mercies from God, or Favour from the King, when we (who ſhould ſhew ſuch good Examples for the Glory of God who hath delivered us, and the Honour of our King, whoſe <hi>Cauſe</hi> we fought for) are now ſo accuſtomed to theſe odious Sins, that we neither feat God's Judgements, nor the Kings Laws, which are both Enemies to ſuch counterfeit <hi>Cavaliers</hi> (I can term them no other, nor ever did) who hath done the King more harm by their deboyſtneſs, then ever they can do him good by their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice if He ſhould have occaſion to uſe them; therefore, you that can make your Service and Sufferings out for His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> ſhew it in your Carriage and Behaviour, for your future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and His Majeſties Honour: We have Enemies enough, we had need make God our Friend, and that can never be with ſuch courſes: I believe, if ſome thought there was a God, they would not call upon him to damn them ſo often as they do; it is an Oath ſo common, it is grown a cuſtome by Rich and Poor, Men and Women, Old and Young; we can talk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pride of the Gentry, the Covetouſneſs of the Clergy, the Deceipt of the Citizens, and the Corruption of <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57211:7"/>the Lawyer; but Swearing, Curſing, Lying, Back-biting, and Inſinuating is counted no ſins amongſt us; and that I muſt be bold to tell you, That thoſe that profeſs themſelves the <hi>Indigent Party,</hi> are greatly Guilty in this, and by Jarring and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling one with another, every one thinking his own wit beſt, till at laſt ſome out-witted all thoſe thar are truly <hi>Indigent;</hi> and well they may, having Four to One againſt us, and good backers to ſecond them: Theſe, and ſuch like, are the <hi>Faults</hi> of the <hi>Indigent Party,</hi> which I have here declared, not out of Envy or Hypocriſie, but out of the Love to them that are of the right Party, hoping you will better accept of it from a <hi>Friend</hi> then from an <hi>Enemy;</hi> for others, let them think what they will, and ſpeak what they liſt, I have done what I can to make it appear who are the <hi>truly Loyal and Indigent Party,</hi> and who the <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> that the <hi>Cheat</hi> may be found though the Gameſters be hid) for the ſatisfaction of our Friends, which are grieved for us; and likewiſe for our Enemies which rejoyceth at our Poverty, and would work upon our Neceſſity if they could; but I hope they ſhall find us more contented with our Rags of Loyalty, with a quiet <hi>Conſcience,</hi> then they can be in their Robes of <hi>Sedition,</hi> which they have gained by our <hi>Ruine,</hi> not doubting but God's Mercy, and the Kings Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency in time may relieve us, when its clearly known who hath faithfully ſerved and ſuffered for him; in the mean time, I deſire all them that fear God, and honour the King, not to let their Grievances and Poverty move their Paſſion ſo much by their Curſing and Swearing, which makes us ſtink in the noſtrils of God, and odious in the company of civil perſons, and become a laughing ſtock to our Enemies, that hath nothing elſe to look for, but the Judgements of God to fall upon us, ſuch like ſins, which are too much uſed by thoſe that profeſs themſelves the Kings Friends.</p>

               <p>WE can plead no cauſe we have for our ſins, or Faults, but what produceth them, we may; and that I ſhall declare, which is Pride, Poverty, and Paſſion; you will ſay 'tis ſtrange that the Indigent Party ſhould be tainted with Pride, for they have cauſe enough to be humbled: Yes, but the Counterfeits are proud in conceit, that they have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted, out-vapoured, and can out-ſwear the truly Loyal and Indigent Party, as by woful experience we have found; I muſt tell you, that they take ſuch pride in their ſwearing, that they think they are not look'd upon as <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi> unleſs they can ſwear to all they ſpeak, whether it be truth or lyes;

               <p>THe <hi>Remedies</hi> that I ſhall produce, are but few; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied with the help of theſe, we look for Relief and Redreſs from, which are theſe Honourable Perſons (the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> I mean) that (under God) hath already, and will heal (I hope) our tottered and once almoſt ruined <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which we may juſtly claim to be Members of;

ſome things that are paſt I ſhall not propound, which were to recover a thing unpoſſible, which is the Money that was alloted amongſt us, it being diſperſed into ſo many greedy and needy hands, which I believe (and 'tis thought by not raſh, but rational men) that a good handſome part of the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcor thouſand pounds will fall into the hands of but a few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that will be <hi>made</hi> by our <hi>undoing;</hi> but the Letters of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourney will skin over that ſore, and it can hardly be remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the Office-Money, how that hath been handled, none <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57211:9"/>can juſtly tell, though give a ſhrewd gueſs; but if the Raters and Receivers were but throughly purged and ſearched, that Corruption may be fetched out, and a <hi>Remedy</hi> in time may be procured; but I muſt confeſs it is but a folly in me (or any other of our poor Party) to propound any Remedies for ſuch old ſores that are too deep for us to ſearch into: therefore I ſhall leave thoſe things that is paſt my finding out, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a few Remedies that may do well for the future, to help thoſe that are the truly Loyal and Indigent Party, that if ever the King or Parliament (or any other) ſhould be willing to help heal us; that thoſe may be look'd on whoſe ſervice, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and deſerts deſerves pitty, and that ſhould be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by a <hi>new Certificate</hi> from the Hand or Hands of the <hi>Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Officer</hi> of the <hi>Regiment</hi> now living, that is known himſelf to be a Deſerving Gallant man, and it was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat fighting <hi>Regiment,</hi> and then to Certifie that he knew ſuch a man, and he had a real <hi>Command</hi> ſo long, as he can teſtifie of his own knowledge, and of his <hi>behaviour</hi> and <hi>carriage</hi> while he was under his <hi>Command;</hi> and thus to certifie the truth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſerts upon his Credit;

for then they ſhould not a been ſo well provided (as they are now) with our Money: Next Remedy is, if for the future there ſhould any proviſion be made either by Offices or Places, either Martial or Civil, or any Money given by his Majeſty (or any others) that it may be put into the hands of impartial men to be diſtributed, ſuch as <hi>Jethro</hi> preſcribed to <hi>Moſes, Men fearing God and hating Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs;</hi> that Rewards intended for deſerving men and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers that wants, may not be diſtributed to particular perſons <pb n="18" facs="tcp:57211:10"/>in Private, by Letters from Ladies (or Great men) to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-men, Foot-men, or Porters, or to ſuch as hath had more already then ever their Service deſerved, being a cluſter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating Impudent (more then Indigent) Officers, that runs up and down (hearkening after ſuch Gifts) either fawning with the Favourites, or Feeing them (and the Clerks that belongs to ſuch perſons, that hath the diſtributing of ſuch Gifts) that when their own turn is ſerved, if there be any thing left, (gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a part with you) they will make you acquainted with it;

ſome being brought to that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through want, that now they are paſt want; ſuch as could not make their caſe known to none but ſuch as could not help themſelves, but only with hopes, which keeps their hearts from breaking, thinking they are now at the worſt;

Another <hi>Remedy</hi> would be deſired for the truly Loyal and Indigent Souldiers that ſerved his Majeſty as well as Officers, which are or ſhould be provided for by Penſion according to the Act, which I believe if they were clearly purged, and none to have it but ſuch as could produce (from their Officers, and the places where they have lived or been ſince the Wars) ſuch Certificates as I preſcribed for our Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Officers before, I believe then there would be a good ſubſiſtance for all true Pentioners, Widows (or others) which I believe is not many more then they have made Indigent Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, if they were carefully examined; but there is as great Complaints from them as there is juſtly from us; ſome that never ſerved the King, ſome that ſerved a while and run home, <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57211:10"/>others that ſerved the <hi>Rebells</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> till the <hi>King</hi> came in; Yes, and received their Wounds in their ſervice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>King</hi> (ſome of them) and had Penſion for it from them; yet making Friends, and getting ſome Officers Hand (like themſelves) or to keep them from the Pariſh charge, hath gotten in to be Penſioners, when (to my knowledge) there are thoſe that hath been ſtout Souldiers, and ſerved as Corporals and Sergeants (and continued till the end of the Wars) lame and wounded too, and have been faithful ever ſince; ſome can get nothing, ſome Forty ſhillings or Three pounds a year, when Four pounds (or more) ſhall be allotted ſome that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as unworthy Raſcals againſt the Kings Friends (in the time of Rebellion) as thoſe that were alwayes againſt us, and worſe too, and would be as ready ſtill to ſtand for Rebellion if they thought it would prove the ſtronger ſide; thus hath the Kings and Parliaments Clemency in the Act been abuſed, which I hope God will put into the hearts of ſome of the Nobility and Clergy to move his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in our behalf, that he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſome noble Perſons to hear our <hi>Grievances,</hi> and in ſome way relieve us, that ſuch whom God in Mercy, hath preſerved their lives, and ſhifted for their Liberty and Livelihood in the worſt of times, as we thought, ſhould not now complain for want of Food, Raiment, and Liberty, and to ſee (both in <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Camp, Sea</hi> and <hi>Land</hi>) places of profit and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beſtowed upon them that hath enough to live on beſides, which they gain'd when we loſt all; when able men, and civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as ever ſerved his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> only branded with <hi>Poverty,</hi> muſt be look'd upon by theſe perſons as unworthy men, and not fit to have any Employment, by reaſon of the deboyſtneſs of ſome that hath made themſelves the <hi>Cavalier Party.</hi>

               <p>I muſt of neceſſity <hi>Conclude,</hi> and leave theſe <hi>Remedies</hi> (and what elſe is wanting) to be remedied by thoſe whom God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects and appoints, not only to hear us, but what they ſhall ſee (in their Wiſdom) is wanting for the Advancement of His Majeſty, the Peace and Preſervation both of Church and People under his Majeſties Dominions, which ſhall be the <pb n="20" facs="tcp:57211:11"/>Prayers of him, which for this time takes his leave, deſiring what you ſee in <hi>this Book</hi> writ out of <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Paſſion,</hi> judge favourably of it, and let that <hi>real Intention</hi> which I <hi>aim</hi> at, without <hi>ſineſter ends,</hi> plead for my <hi>Infirmities,</hi> which you diſcover here, reflecting upon your ſelves, knowing there is none free from ſome or other.</p>

            <p>I Know there is many will wonder, that I ſhould preſume to take upon me, to write this <hi>Book,</hi> being there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>our Party</hi> that were far more able to have undertook the handling of it: I muſt confeſs it might have come from a <hi>better Pen,</hi> but not a <hi>truer Heart;</hi> It grieved me to ſee what Confuſion there hath been amongſt us from the beginning: ſome drawing up <hi>Remonſtrances,</hi> and <hi>Grievances,</hi> and ſetting of <hi>Hands</hi> to <hi>this Thing,</hi> and <hi>that Thing;</hi> then Chuſing of <hi>Truſtees,</hi> appointing of <hi>Meetings</hi> at ſeveral places, and ſo ſpend our <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> too (them that had it) ſome ſiding for <hi>one Party,</hi> ſome for <hi>another;</hi> every one crying out they are wrong'd, when ſome of them are as much tainted themſelves as the worſt, yet take upon them to Right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when they have done the moſt Wrong, and think their pretended <hi>high Commands</hi> that they have had, will bear them out.</p>
            <p>Some of thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that we Choſe for <hi>Truſtees,</hi> I much honour; whoſe <hi>aim</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> I believe were <hi>right;</hi> but for <hi>ſome</hi> amongſt them, I cannot underſtand that how they can be clearly for our Good, that cannot clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Muſt not they wink at others, for fear themſelves ſhould be brought to light? I ſhould deſire every one to reſt themſelves contented, and not hearken after the Fancies of every ſiniſter-ended Party, that are more for their own end, then for the general Good of us (if they ſhould bring <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57211:12"/>their purpoſes to paſs) For my part, the writing of <hi>this Book</hi> was intended (from me) only to give Satisfaction to all Loyal Subjects, how His Majeſties, and the Parliaments Clemency hath been abuſed, and we wronged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced; having ſuch a Company of pittiful Fellows lay Claim to be Commiſſion Officers; ſome (I believe) knows not a <hi>Rank</hi> from a <hi>File,</hi> nor a <hi>Counter-march</hi> from a <hi>Wheell;</hi> that never look'd as if they had either Wit or Valour in them (and wanting both, they were very unfit to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) for I believe the King was never in ſuch need of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; and ſome that were more fit for a Rod, than wear a Sword in his late Majeſties Service, being twenty ſix or thirty years of Age, hath had this Divident too; ſo that what long of ſuch (and your <hi>Roaring, Dam-me, Counterfeit Cavaliers)</hi> hath rendered <hi>our Party</hi> ſo ridiculous in the Eyes of ſome People, that they ſlight and ſcorn all <hi>civil Cavaliers</hi> for their ſakes: but I muſt tell them, there was, and is, as gallant and as civil men in the Kings Army, which hated, and doth hate ſuch Courſes as much as the greateſt Zealot of them all, not out of Hypocriſie, or fear of the Law, but out of the fear of God, which we ſhould all live in; perhaps ſome may cenſure 'tis out of Envie, or vain Glory, that I have ſo often touch'd upon <hi>Swearing;</hi> it is ſo often in my Ears (againſt my will) which makes me mind it ſo often to you, that you may bend your mind to leave it.</p>
            <p>For Envie or vain Glory, how much I have heen guilty of theſe two Sins, I leave thoſe to cenſure that knows me now, or formerly in the Kings Service; which I was conſtantly in <hi>one Army,</hi> and in <hi>one Regiment,</hi> though under <hi>Four Collonels:</hi> Firſt the Lord <hi>Mehuns,</hi> then Sir <hi>Charles Mehuns,</hi> afterwards Col. <hi>John Digbys,</hi> and laſt Sir <hi>Chicheſter Wrays;</hi> my ſervice being moſt in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Corniſh Army;</hi> and now ſince his <hi>Majeſties Reſtoration.</hi> I have ſerved in his <hi>Majeſties Regiment of Gaurds</hi> (as a Souldier) in the Right Honourable Col. <hi>John Ruſſels</hi> own <hi>Company:</hi> What my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and carriage hath been (from the firſt to the laſt) I leave to the cenſure of thoſe that are able to Report of both, either <pb n="23" facs="tcp:57211:12"/>for my Credit or Shame, deſiring them to give no better nor worſe a Character then I have deſerved; which I know can never redound to my diſhonour for my ſervice (and I hope as little for my Carriage and Behaviour to every man) which I ſhall endeavour to continue with the utmoſt of my power, hoping in time to ſee ſuch men countenanced, if not provided for; whoſe ſervice and carriage hath never diſhonoured that juſt Cauſe they ever Fought for, which was for Gods Glory, and his Majeſties juſt Rights; which is the Deſire of him, that for preſent leaves you, and remains your Friend to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power, ſo far forth as you are <hi>Loyal Subjects:</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>this Book</hi> may light into the <hi>Hands</hi> of ſome near the <hi>King,</hi> that may Reflect upon their <hi>own Sufferings</hi> formerly; and to <hi>do now,</hi> as they would be <hi>done unto,</hi> if they were in <hi>our Condition.</hi>
