            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE Wishes and Desires of all good Men, which have attended your Lordship from your First appearance in the World, are at length accomplish'd in your obtaining those Honours and Dignities, which you have so long deserv'd. There are no Factions, tho irreconcilable to one another, that are not united in their Affection to you, and the Respect they pay you. They are equally pleas'd in your Prosperity, and wou'd be equally concern'd in your Afflictions. <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi> was not more the Delight of Human-kind. The Universal Empire made him only more known, and more Powerful, but cou'd not make him more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd. He had greater Ability of doing Good, but your Inclination to it, is not less; And tho' you could not extend your Beneficence to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Persons, yet you have lost as few days as that Excellent Emperour; and never had his Complaint to make when you went to Bed, that the Sun had shone upon you in vain, when you had the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of relieving some unhappy man. This, My Lord, has justly acquir'd you as many Friends, as there are Persons who have the Honour to be known to you: Meer Acquaintance you have none: You have drawn them all into a nearer Line: And they who have Convers'd with you, are for ever after inviolably yours. This is a Truth so generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowedg'd, that it needs no Proof: 'Tis of the Nature of a first Principle, which is receiv'd as soon as it is propos'd; and needs not the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:62894:4"/> which <hi>Descartes</hi> us'd to his: For we doubt not, neither can we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly say, we think we admire and love you, above all other men: There is a certainty in the Proposition, and we know it. With the same Assurance I can say, you neither have Enemies, nor can scarce have any; for they who have never heard of you, can neither Love or Hate you: And they who have, can have no other notion of you, than that which they receive from the Publick, that you are the best of Men. After this, my Testimony can be of no farther use, than to declare it to be Day-light at High-Noon: And all who have the benefit of sight, can look up, as well, and see the Sun.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, I have one Priviledge which is almost particular to my self, that I saw you in the <hi>East</hi> at your first arising above the Hemisphere: I was as soon Sensible as any Man of that Light, when it was but just shooting out, and beginning to Travel upwards to the Meridian. I made my early Addresses to your Lordship, in my Essay of Dramatick Poetry; and therein bespoke you to the World: Wherein, I have the right of a First Discoverer. When I was my self, in the Rudiments of my Poetry, without Name, or Reputation in the World, having rather the Ambition of a Writer, than the skill; when I was Drawing the Out-Lines of an Art without any Living Master to Instruct me in it; an Art which had been better Prais'd than Study'd here in <hi>England,</hi> wherein <hi>Shakespear</hi> who Created the Stage among us, had rather Written happily, than knowingly and justly; and <hi>Iohnson,</hi> who by studying <hi>Horace,</hi> had been acquainted with the Rules, yet seem'd to envy to Posterity that Knowledge, and like an Inventer of some useful Art, to make a Monopoly of his Learning: When thus, as I may say, before the use of the Loadstone, or knowledge of the Compass, I was sailing in a vast Ocean, without other help, than the Pole-Star of the Ancients, and the Rules of the <hi>French</hi> Stage amongst the Moderns, which are extreamly different from ours, by reason of their opposite taste; yet even then, I had the presumption to Dedicate to your Lordship: A very unfinish'd Piece, I must Confess, and which only can be excus'd, by the little Experience of the Author, and the Modesty of the Title, <hi>An Essay.</hi> Yet I was stronger in Prophecy than I was in Criticism: I was Inspir'd to foretell you to Mankind, as the Restorer of Poetry, the greatest Genius, the truest Judge, and the best Patron.</p>
                  <p>Good Sence and good Nature, are never separated, tho' the Ignorant World has thought otherwise. Good Nature, by which I mean Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and Candor, is the Product of right Reason: Which of necessity will give Allowance to the Failings of others, by considering that there is nothing perfect in Mankind; and by distinguishing that which comes nearest to Excellency, tho not absolutely free from Faults, will certainly produce a Candor in the Judge. 'Tis incident to an Elevated Understanding, like your Lordships, to find out the Errors of other men: But 'tis your Prerogative to pardon them; to look with Pleasure on those things, which are somewhat Congenial, and of a remote Kindred to your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: And to forgive the many Failings of those, who with their wretched Art, cannot arrive to those Heights that you possess, from a happy, abundant, and Native Genius. Which are as inborn to you, as they were to <hi>Shakespear;</hi> and for ought I know to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> in either of whom we find all Arts and Sciences, all Moral and Natural Philosophy, without knowing that they ever Study'd them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:62894:4"/>There is not an English Writer this day living, who is not perfectly convinc'd, that your Lordship excels all others, in all the several parts of Poetry which you have undertaken to adorn. The most Vain, and the most Ambitious of our Age have not dar'd to assume so much, as the Competitours of <hi>Themistocles:</hi> They have yielded the first place, without dispute; and have been arrogantly content, to be esteem'd as second to your Lordship; and even that also, with a <hi>Longo, sed proximi Intervallo.</hi> If there have been, or are any, who go farther in their Self-conceipt, they must be very singular in their Opinion: They must be like the <hi>Officer,</hi> in a Play, who was call'd Captain, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and Company. The World will easily conclude, whether such unattended Generals can ever be capable of making a Revolution in <hi>Parnassus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not attempt in this place, to say any thing particular of your <hi>Lyrick-Poems,</hi> though they are the Delight and Wonder of this Age, and will be the Envy of the next. The Subject of this Book confines me to Satire: And in that, an Author of your own Quality,
(whose Ashes I will not disturb,) has given you all the Commendation, which his self-sufficiency cou'd afford to any Man: <hi>The best Good Man, with the worst-Natur'd Muse.</hi> In that Character, methinks I am reading <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s Verses to the Memory of <hi>Shakespear:</hi> An Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, Sparing, and Invidious Panegyrick: Where good Nature, the most God-like Commendation of a Man, is only attributed to your Person, and deny'd to your Writings: for they are every where so full of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, that like <hi>Horace,</hi> you only expose the Follies of Men, without Arraigning their Vices; and in this excel him, That You add that pointedness of Thought, which is visibly wanting in our Great <hi>Roman.</hi> There is more of Salt in all your Verses, than I have seen in any of the Moderns, or even of the Ancients: But you have been sparing of the Gaul; by which means you have pleas'd all Readers, and offended none. <hi>Donn</hi> alone, of all our Countrymen, had your Talent; but was not happy enough to arrive at your Versification. And were he Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into Numbers, and English, he wou'd yet be wanting in the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Expression. That which is the prime Vertue, and chief Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Virgil,</hi> which distinguishes him from the rest of Writers, is so conspicuous in your Verses, that it casts a shadow on all your Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries; we cannot be seen, or but obscurely, while you are present. You equal <hi>Donn,</hi> in the Variety, Multipicity, and Choice of Thoughts; you excel him in the Manner, and the Words. I Read you both, with the same Admiration, but not with the same Delight. He affects the Metaphysicks, not only in his Satires, but in his Amorous Verses, where Nature only shou'd reign; and perplexes the Minds of the Fair Sex with nice Speculations of Philosophy, when he shou'd ingage their hearts, and entertain them with the softnesses of Love. In this (if I may be pardon'd for so bold a truth) Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> has Copy'd him to a fault: so great a one, in my Opinion, that it throws his Mistress infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Pindariques, and his latter Compositions; which are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the best of his Poems, and the most Correct. For my own part, I must avow it freely to the World, that I never attempted any thing in Satier, wherein I have not study'd your Writings as the most perfect Model. I have continually laid them before me; and the greatest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, which my own partiality can give to my Productions, is that they are Copies, and no farther to be allow'd, than as they have

                     <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:62894:5"/>True it is, that some bad Poems, though not all, carry their Owners Marks about 'em. There is some peculiar aukardness, false Grammar, imperfect Sense, or at the least Obscurity; some Brand or other on this Buttock, or that Ear, that 'tis notorious who are the Owners of the Cattel, though they shou'd not Sign it with their Names. But your Lordship, on the contrary, is distinguish'd, not only by the Excellency of your Thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by your Stile, and Manner of expressing them. A Painter judging of some Admirable Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e, may affirm with certainty, that it was of <hi>Holben,</hi> or <hi>Vandyke:</hi> But Vulgar Designs, and Common Draughts, are easily mistaken, and misapply'd. Thus, by my long Study of your Lordship, I am arriv'd at the knowledge of your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner. In the Good Poems of other Men, like those Artists, I can only say, this is like the Draught of such a one, or like the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring of another. In short, I can only be sure, that 'tis the Hand of a good Master: But in your Performances 'tis scarcely possible for me to be deceiv'd. If you write in your strength, you stand reveal'd at the first view; and shou'd you write under it, you cannot avoid some Peculiar Graces, which only cost me a second Consideration to discover you: For I may say in, with all the severity of Truth, that every Line of yours is precious. Your Lordship's only fault is, that you have not written more: Unless I cou'd add another, and that yet greater, but I fear for the Publick, the Accusation wou'd not be true, that you have written, and out of a vicious Modesty will not Publish.</p>

                     <hi>Virgil</hi> has confin'd his Works within the compass of Eighteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Lines, and has not treaced many Subjects; yet he ever had, and ever will have the Reputation of the best Poet. <hi>Martial</hi> says of him, that he cou'd have excell'd <hi>Vasius</hi> in Tragedy, and <hi>Horace</hi> in Lyrick Poetry, but out of deference to his Friends he attempted neither.</p>

What has been, may be again: Another <hi>Homer,</hi> and another <hi>Virgil</hi> may possibly arise from those very Causes which produc'd the first: Though it wou'd be impudence to affirm that any such have yet appear'd.</p>
                  <p>'Tis manifest, that some particular Ages have been more happy than others in the production of Great Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all sorts of Arts and Sciences: As that of <hi>Eurypides, Sophocles, Aristophanes,</hi> and the rest for Stage-Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try amongst the <hi>Greeks:</hi> That of <hi>Augustus,</hi> for Heroick, Lyrick, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, Elegiaque, and indeed all sorts of Poetry; in the Persons of <hi>Virgil, Horace, Varius, Ovid,</hi> and many others; especially if we take into that Century the latter end of the Commonwealth; wherein we find <hi>Varro, Lucr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wherein Painting was reviv'd, and Poetry flourish'd, and the Greek Language was restor'd.</p>
                  <p>Examples in all these are obvious: But what I wou'd infer, is this; That in such an Age 'tis possible some Great Genius may arise, to equal
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:62894:5"/> any of the Antients; abating only for the Language. For great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries whet and cultivate each other: And mutual Borrowing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Commerce, makes the Common Riches of Learning, as it does of the Civil Government.</p>
                  <p>But suppose that <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> were the only of their Species, and that Nature was so much worn out in producing them, that she is never able to bear the like again; yet the Example only holds in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Poetry: In Tragedy and Satire I offer my self to maintain against some of our Modern Criticks, that this Age and the last, particularly in <hi>England,</hi> have excell'd the Ancients in both those kinds; and I wou'd instance in <hi>Shakespear</hi> of the former, of your Lordship in the latter sort.</p>
                  <p>Thus I might safely confine my self to my Native Country: But if I wou'd only cross the Seas, I might find in <hi>France</hi> a living <hi>Horace</hi> and a <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> in the Person of the admirable <hi>Boileau:</hi> Whose Numbers are Excellent, whose Expressions are Noble, whose Thoughts are Just, whose Language is Pure, whose Satire is pointed, and whose Sense is close; What he borrows from the Ancients, he repays with Usury of his own: in Coin as good, and almost as Universally valuable: For setting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Partiality apart, though he is our Enemy, the Stamp of a <hi>Louis,</hi> the Patron of all Arts, is not much inferiour to the Medal of an <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> Let this be said without entring into the interests of Factions and Parties; and relating only to the Bounty of that King to Men of Learning and Merit: A Praise so just, that even we who are his Enemies, cannot refuse it to him.</p>
                  <p>Now if it may be permitted me to go back again, to the Consideration of <hi>Epique</hi> Poetry, I have confess'd, that no Man hitherto has reach'd, or so much as approach'd to the Excellencies of <hi>Homer</hi> or of <hi>Virgil;</hi> I must farther add, that <hi>Statius,</hi> the best Vers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>French</hi> have perform'd nothing in this kind, which is not far below those two <hi>Italians,</hi> and subject to a thousand more Reflections, without examining their Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> their <hi>Pucelle,</hi> or their <hi>Alarique:</hi> The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> have only to boast of <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> who neither of them wanted either Genius, or Learning, to have been perfect Poets; and yet both of them are liable to many Censures. For there is no Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the Design of <hi>Spencer:</hi> He aims at the Accomplishment of no one Action: He raises up a Hero for every one of his Adventures; and endows each of them with some particular Moral Virtue, which renders them all equal, without Subordination or Preference. Every one is mot Valiant in his own Legend; only we must do him that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to observe, that Magnanimity, which is the Character of Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> shines throughout the whole Poem; and Succours the rest, when they are in Distress. The Original of every Knight, was then living in the Court of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> And he attributed to each of them that Virtue, which he thought was most conspicuous in them: An Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious piece of Flattery, tho' it turn'd not much to his Account. Had he liv'd to finish his Poem, in the six remaining Legends, it had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly been more of a piece; but cou'd not have been perfect, because the Model was not true. But Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> or his chief Patron, Sir <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Sidney,</hi> whom he intended to make happy, by the Marriage of his <hi>Gloriana,</hi> dying before him, depriv'd the Poet, both of Means and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to accomplish his Design: For the rest, his Obsolete Language, and the ill choice of his Stanza, are faults but of the Second Magnitude: For notwithstanding the first he is still Intelligible, at least, after a little practice; and for the last, he is the more to be admir'd; that labouring under such a difficulty, his Verses are so Numerous, so Various, and so Harmonious, that only <hi>Virgil,</hi> whom he profestly imitated, has sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd him, among the <hi>Romans;</hi> and only Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> among the <hi>English.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> whom we all admire with so much Justice, his Subject is not that of an Heroique Poem; properly so call'd: His Design is the Losing of our Happiness; his Event is not prosperous, like that of all other <hi>Epique</hi> Works: His Heavenly Machines are many, and his Humane Persons are but two. But I will not take Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi>'s Work out of his Hands. He has promis'd the World a Critique on that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; wherein, tho' he will not allow his Poem for Heroick, I hope he will grant us, that his Thoughts are elevated, his Words Sounding, and that no Man has so happily Copy'd the Manner of <hi>Homer;</hi> or so copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously translated his <hi>Grecisms,</hi> and the Latin Elegancies of <hi>Virgil.</hi> 'Tis true, he runs into a flat of Thought, sometimes for a Hundred Lines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but 'tis when he is got into a Track of Scripture: His Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted words were his Choice, not his Necessity; for therein he imitated <hi>Spencer,</hi> as <hi>Spencer</hi> did <hi>Chawcer.</hi> And tho', perhaps, the love of their Masters, may have transported both too far<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the frequent use of them; yet in my Opinion, Obsolete Words may then be laudably reviv'd, when either they are more Sounding, or more Significant than those in practice: And when their Obscurity is taken away, by joining other Words to them which clear the Sense; according to the Rule of <hi>Horace,</hi> for the admission of new Words. But in both cases, a Moderation is to be observ'd, in the use of them: For unnecessary Coynage, as well as
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:62894:6"/> unnecessary Revival, runs into Affectation; a fault to be avoided on either hand. Neither will I Justifie <hi>Milton</hi> for his Blank Verse, tho' I may excuse him, by the Example of <hi>Hannibal Caro,</hi> and other <hi>Italians,</hi> who have us'd it: For whatever Causes he alledges for the abolishing of Rhyme (which I have not now the leisure to examine) his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reason is plainly this, that Rhyme was not his Talent; he had neither the Ease of doing it, nor the Graces of it; which is manifest in his <hi>Iuvenilia,</hi> or Verses written in his Youth: Where his Rhyme is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways constrain'd and forc'd, and comes hardly from him at an Age when the Soul is most pliant; and the Passion of Love, makes almost every Man a Rhymer, tho' not a Poet.</p>
                  <p>By this time, My Lord, I doubt not but that you wonder, why I have run off from my Biass so long together, and made so tedious a Digression from Satire to Heroique Poetry. But if You will not excuse it, by the tattling Quality of Age, which, as Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi> says, is always Narrative; yet I hope the usefulness of what I have to say on this Subject, will qualifie the remoteness of it; and this is the last time I will commit the Crime of Prefaces; or trouble the World with my Notions of any thing that relates to Verse. I have then, as You see, observ'd the Failings of many great Wits amongst the Moderns, who have attempted to write as <hi>Epique</hi> Poem: Besides these, or the like Animadversions of them by other Men, there is yet a farther Reason given, why they cannot possibly succeed, so well as the Ancients, even tho' we cou'd allow them not to be Inferiour, either in Genius or Learning, or the Tongue in which they write; or all those other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Qualifications which are necessary to the forming of a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd Heroique Poet. The fault is laid on our Religion: They say that Christianity is not capable of those Embellishments which are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded in the Belief of those Ancient Heathens.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis true, that in the severe notions of our Faith; the Fortitude of a Christian consists in Patience, and Suffering for the Love of God, what ever hardships can befall him in the World; not in any great Attempt; or in performance of those Enterprises which the Poets call Heroique; and which are commonly the Effects of Interest, Ostentation, Pride and Worldly Honour. That Humility and Resignation are our prime Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and that these include no Action, but that of the Soul: When as, on the Contrary, an Heroique Poem requires, to its necessary Design, and as its last Perfection, some great Action of War, the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some Extraordinary Undertaking; which requires the Strength and Vigour of the Body, the Duty of a Souldier, the Capacity and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a General; and, in short, as much, or more of the Active Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, than the Suffering. But to this, the Answer is very Obvious. God has plac'd us in our several Stations; the Virtues of a private Christian are Patience, Obedience, Submission, and the like; but those of a Magistrate, or General, or a King, are Prudence, Counsel, active Fortitude, coercive Power, awful Command, and the Exercise of Magnanimity, as well as Justice. So that this Objection hinders not, but that an Epique Poem, or the Heroique Action of some Great Commander, Enterpris'd for the Common Good, and Honour of the Christian Cause, and Executed happily, may be as well Written now, as it was of old by the Heathens; provided the Poet be endu'd with the same Talents; and the Language, though not of equal Dignity, yet as near approaching to it, as our Modern Barbarism will allow, which is all that can be expected from
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:62894:7"/> our own or any other now extant, though more Refin'd, and therefore we are to rest contented with that only Inferiority, which is not possibly to be Remedy'd.</p>
                  <p>I wish. I cou'd as easily remove that other difficulty which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.
'Tis Objected by a great <hi>French</hi> Critique, as well as an Admirable Poet, yet living, and whom I have mention'd with that Honour, which his Merit exacts from me, I mean <hi>Boileau,</hi> that the Machines of our Christian Religion in Heroique Poetry, are much more feeble to Support that weight than those of <hi>Heathenism.</hi> Their Doctrine, grounded as it was on Ridiculous Fables, was yet the Belief of the Two Victorious Monarchies, the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman.</hi> Their Gods did not only interest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Event of Wars (which is the Effect of a Superiour Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) but also espous'd the several Parties, in a Visible Corporeal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, mannag'd their Intrigues, and Fought their Battels sometimes in Opposition to each other: Tho' <hi>Virgil</hi> (more discreet than <hi>Homer</hi> in that last Particular) has contented himself with the Partiality of his Deities, their Favours, their Counsels or Commands, to those whose Cause they had espous'd, without bringing them to the Outrageousness of Blows. Now, our Religion (says he) is depriv'd of the greatest part of those Machines; at least the most Shining in Epique Poetry. Tho' St. <hi>Michael</hi> in <hi>Ariosto</hi> seeks out <hi>Discord,</hi> to send her amongst the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and finds her in a Convent of Friars, where Peace should Reign, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is fine Satire; and Satan, in <hi>Tasso,</hi> excites <hi>Solyman,</hi> to an Attempt by Night on the Christian Camp, and brings an Host of Devils to his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; yet the Arch-Angel, in the former Example, when <hi>Discord</hi> was restive, and would not be drawn from her belov'd Monastery with fair Words, has the Whip-hand of her, Drags her out with many stripes, sets her, on Gods-name, about her business; and makes her know the difference of Strength betwixt a Nuncio of Heaven, and a Minister of Hell: The same Angel, in the latter Instance from <hi>Tasso</hi> (as if God had never another Messenger, belonging to the Court, but was confin'd like <hi>Iupiter</hi> to <hi>Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi> to <hi>Iris,</hi>) when he sees his time, that is, when half of the <hi>Christians</hi> are already kill'd, and all the rest are in a fair way to be Routed, stickles betwixt the Remainders of God's Host, and the Race of Fiends; Pulls the Devils backward by their Tails, and drives them from their quarry; or otherwise the whole business had miscarri'd, and <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> remain'd untaken. This, says <hi>Boileau,</hi> is a very unequal Match for the Poor Devils; who are sure to come by the worst of it in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; for nothing is more easie, than for an Almighty Power to bring his old Rebels to Reason, when he Pleases. Consequently, what pleasure, what Entertainment can be rais'd from so pitiful a Machine? Where we see the Success of the Battel, from the very beginning of it? Unless that, as we are <hi>Christians,</hi> we are glad that we have gotten God on our side, to maul our Enemies, when we cannot do the work our selves. For if the Poet had given the Faithful more Courage, which had cost him nothing, or at least have made them exceed the <hi>Turks</hi> in Number, he might have gain'd the Victory for us Christians, without interessing Heaven in the quarrel; and that with as much ease, and as little Credit to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, as when a Party of a Hundred Souldiers defeats another which consists only of Fifty.</p>
                  <p>This, my Lord, I confess is such an Argument against our Modern Poetry, as cannot be answer'd by those Mediums, which have been us'd. We cannot hitherto boast, that our Religion has furnish'd us
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:62894:7"/> with any such Machines, as have made the Strength and Beauty of the Ancient Buildings.</p>
                  <p>But, what if I venture to advance an Invention of my own, to supply the manifest defect of our new Writers: I am sufficiently sensible of my weakness, and 'tis not very probable, that I shou'd succeed in such a Project, whereof I have not had the least hint from any of my Predecessors, the Poets, or any of their Seconds, and Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the Critiques. Yet we see the Art of War is improv'd in Sieges, and new Instruments of Death are invented daily. Something new in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy and the Mechanicks is discover'd almost every Year: And the Science of Former Ages is improv'd by the Succeeding. I will not detain you with a long Preamble to that, which better Judges will, perhaps, conclude to be little worth.</p>
                  <p>'Tis this, in short, That <hi>Christian</hi> Poets have not hitherto been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their own Strength. If they had search'd the Old Testament as they ought, they might there have found the Machines which are proper for their Work; and those more certain in their effect, than it may be the New-Testament is, in the Rules sufficient for Salvation. The peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of one Chapter in the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and Accommodating what there they find, with the Principles of <hi>Platonique</hi> Philosophy, as it is now Christianis'd, wou'd have made the Ministry of Angels as strong an Engine, for the Working up Heroique Poetry, in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that of the Ancients has been to raise theirs by all the Fables of their Gods, which were only receiv'd for Tuths by the most ignorant, and weakest of the People.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a Doctrine almost Universally receiv'd by Christians, as well Protestants as Catholicks, that there are Guardian Angels appointed by God Almighty, as his Vicegerents, for the Protection and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Cities, Provinces, Kingdoms, and Monarchies; and those as well of Heathens, as of true Believers. All this is so plainly prov'd from those Texts of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that it admits of no farther Controversie. The Prince of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and that other of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> are granted to be the Guardians and Protecting Ministers of those Empires. It cannot be deny'd, that they were opposite, and resisted one another. St. <hi>Michael</hi> is mention'd by his Name, as the Patron of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and is now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Christians, as the Protector General of our Religion. These Tutelar <hi>Genij,</hi> who presided over the several People and Regions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Charge, were watchful over them for good, as far as their Commissions cou'd possibly extend. The General Purpose, and Design of all, was certainly the Service of their Great Creatour. But
'tis an undoubted Truth, that for Ends best known to the Almighty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of Heaven, his Providential Designs for the benefit of his Creatures, for the Debasing and Punishing of some Nations, and the Exaltation and Temporal Reward of others, were not wholly known to these his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; else why those Factious Quarrels, Controversies, and Battels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, when they were all United in the same Design, the Service and Honour of their common Master? But being instructed only in the General, and zealous of the main Design; and as Finite Beings, not admitted into the Secrets of Government, the last resorts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or capable of discovering the final Purposes of God, who can work Good out of Evil, as he pleases; and irresistably sways all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Events on Earth, directing them finally for the best, to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in General, and to the Ultimate End of his own Glory in Particular:
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:62894:8"/> They must of necessity be sometimes ignorant of the Means conducing to those Ends, in which alone they can jarr, and oppose each other. One Angel, as we may suppose the Prince of <hi>Persia,</hi> as he is call'd, judging, that it would be more for God's Honour, and the Benefit of his People, that the <hi>Median</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy, which deliver'd them from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, shou'd still be uppermost: And the Patron of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> to whom the Will of God might be more particularly Reveal'd, contending on the other side, for the Rise of <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Successors, who were appointed to punish the Backsliding <hi>Iews,</hi> and thereby to put them in mind of their Offences, that they might Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and become more Virtuous, and more Observant of the Law Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd. But how far these Controversies and appearing Enmities of those glorious Creatures may be carri'd; how these Oppositions may best be manag'd, and by what Means conducted, is not my business to shew or determine: These things must be left to the Invention and Judgment of the Poet: If any of so happy a Genius be now living, or any future Age can produce a Man, who being Conversant in the Philosophy of <hi>Plato,</hi> as it is now accommodated to Christian use; for (as <hi>Virgil</hi> gives us to understand by his Example) that is the only proper of all others for an <hi>Epique</hi> Poem, who to his Natural Endowments, of a large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, a ripe Judgment, and a strong Memory, has join'd the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Liberal Arts and Sciences, and particularly, Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, the Mathematicks, Geography and History, and with all these Qualifications is born a Poet; knows, and can practice the variety of Numbers, and is Master of the Language in which he Writes; if such a Man, I say, be now arisen, or shall arise, I am vain enough to think, that I have propos'd a Model to him, by which he may build a Nobler, a more Beautiful and more Perfect Poem, than any yet extant since the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>There is another part of these Machines yet wanting; but by what I have said, it wou'd have been easily supply'd by a Judicious Writer. He cou'd not have fail'd, to add the opposition of ill Spirits to the good; they have also their Design, ever opposite to that of Heaven; and this alone, has hitherto been the practice of the Moderns: But this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect System, if I may call it such, which I have given, will infinitely advance and carry farther that Hypothesis of the Evil Spirits contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Good. For being so much weaker since their Fall, than those blessed Beings, they are yet suppos'd to have a permitted Power from God, of acting ill, as from their own deprav'd Nature they have always the Will of designing it. A great Testimony of which we find in Holy Writ, when God Almighty suffer'd <hi>Satan</hi> to appear in the Holy Synod of the Angels, (a thing not hitherto drawn into Example by any of the Poets,) and also gave him Power over all things belonging to his Servant <hi>Iob,</hi> excepting only Life.</p>
                  <p>Now what these Wicked Spirits cannot compass, by the vast dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their Forces, to those of the Superiour Beings: They may by their Fraud and Cunning carry farther, in a seeming League, Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy or Subserviency to the Designs of some good Angel, as far as consists with his purity, to suffer such an aid, the end of which may possibly be disguis'd, and conceal'd from his finite Knowledge. This is indeed to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a great Errour in such a Being: Yet since a Devil can appear like an Angel of Light; since Craft and Malice may sometimes blind for a while a more perfect Understanding; and lastly, since <hi>Milton</hi> has given
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:62894:8"/> us an Example of the like nature, when <hi>Satan</hi> appearing like a Cherub, to <hi>Vriel,</hi> the Intelligence of the Sun, Circumvented him even in his own Province, and pass'd only for a Curious Traveller through those new Created Regions, that he might observe therein the Workmanship of God, and praise him in his Works.</p>
                  <p>I know not why, upon the same supposition, or some other, a Fiend may not deceive a Creature of more Excellency than himself, but yet a Creature; at least by the connivance, or tacit permission of the Omniscient Being.</p>
                  <p>Thus, my Lord, I have as briefly as I cou'd, given your Lordship, and by you the World a rude draught of what I have been long labouring in my Imagination. And what I had intended to have put in practice,
(though far unable for the attempt of such a Poem) and to have left the Stage, to which my Genius never much inclin'd me, for a Work which wou'd have taken up my Life in the performance of it. This too, I had intended chiefly for the Honour of my Native Country, to which a Poet is parcicularly oblig'd: Of two Subjects, both relating to it, I was doubtful, whether I shou'd chuse that of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> Conquering the <hi>Saxons;</hi> which being farther distant in Time, gives the greater Scope to my Invention: Or that of <hi>Edward</hi> the Black Prince in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing <hi>Spain,</hi> and Restoring it to the Lawful Prince, though a Great Tyrant, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> the Cruel: Which for the compass of Time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding only the Expedition of one Year: For the greatness of the Action, and its answearable Event; for the Magnanimity of the <hi>English</hi> Hero, oppos'd to the Ingratitude of the person whom he restor'd; and for the many Beautiful Episodes, which I had interwoven with the principal Design, together with the Characters of the chiefest <hi>English</hi> Persons; wherein, after <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Spencer,</hi> I wou'd have taken occasion to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent my living Friends and Patrons of the Noblest Families, and also shadow'd the Events of future Ages, in the Succession of our Imperial Line. With these helps, and those of the Machines, which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; I might perhaps have done as well as some of my Predecessors; or at least chalk'd out a way, for others to amend my Errors in a like Design. But being encourag'd only with fair Words, by King <hi>Charles</hi> II, my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sallary ill paid, and no prospect of a future Subsistance, I was then Discourag'd in the beginning of my Attempt; and now Age has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken me; and Want, a more insufferable Evil, through the Change of the Times, has wholly disenabl'd me. Tho' I must ever acknowledge, to the Honour of your Lordship, and the Eternal Memory of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that since this Revolution, wherein I have patiently suffer'd the Ruin of my small Fortune, and the loss of that poor Subsistance which I had from two Kings, whom I had serv'd more Faithfully than Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to my self; then your Lordship was pleas'd, out of no other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but your own Nobleness, without any Desert of mine, or the least Sollicitation from me, to make me a most bountiful Present, which at that time, when I was most in want of it, came most seasonably and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to my Relief. That Favour, my Lord, is of it self sufficient to bind any Grateful Man, to a perpetual Acknowledgment, and to all the future Service, which one of my mean Condition, can be ever able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. May the Almighty God return it for me, both in Blessing you here, and Rewarding you hereafter. I must not presume to defend the Cause for which I now suffer, because your Lordship is engag'd against it: But the more you are so, the greater is my Obligation to you: For

                     <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:62894:11"/> your laying aside all the Considerations of Factions and Parties, to do an Action of pure disinteress'd Charity. This is one amongst many of your shining Qualities, which distinguish you from others of your Rank: But let me add a farther Truth, That without these Ties of Gratitude, and abstracting from them all, I have a most particular Inclination to Honour you; and if it were not too bold an Expression, to say, I Love you. 'Tis no shame to be a Poet, tho' 'tis to be a bad one. <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> of old, and Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> of late, wou'd willingly have been such; and <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> were such. You, who without Flattery, are the best of the present Age in <hi>England,</hi> and wou'd have been so, had you been born in any other Country, will receive more Honour in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages, by that one Excellency, than by all those Honours to which your Birth has intitl'd you, or your Merits have acquir'd you.

                        <l>Ne, forte, pudori,</l>

                        </l>
                     </q> I have formerly said in this Epistle, that I cou'd distinguish your Writings from those of any others: 'Tis now time to clear my self from any imputation of Self-conceipt on that Subject. I assume not to my self any particular lights in this Discovery; they are such only as are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every Man of Sense and Judgment, who loves Poetry, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands it. Your Thoughts are always so remote from the common way of thinking, that they are, as I may say, of another Species, than the Conceptions of other Poets; yet you go not out of Nature for any of them: Gold is never bred upon the Surface of the Ground; but lies so hidden, and so deep, that the Mines of it are seldom found; but the force of Waters casts it out from the Bowels of Mountains, and exposes it amongst the Sands of Rivers; giving us of her Bounty, what we cou'd not hope for by our search. This Success attends your Lordship's Thoughts, which wou'd look like Chance, if it were not perpetual, and always of the same tenour. If I grant that there is Care in it, 'tis such a Care as wou'd be ineffectual, and fruitless in other Men. 'Tis the <hi>Cariosa felicitas</hi> which <hi>Petronius</hi> ascribes to <hi>Horace</hi> in his <hi>Odes.</hi> We have not wherewithal to imagine so strongly, so justly, and so pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: In short, if we have the same Knowledge, we cannot draw out of it the same Quintessence; we cannot give it such a Turn, such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and such a Beauty. Something is deficient in the Manner, or the Words, but more in the Nobleness of our Conception. Yet when you have finish'd all, and it appears in its full Lustre, when the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond is not only found, but the Roughness smooth'd, when it is cut into a Form, and set in Gold, then we cannot but acknowledge, that it is the Perfect Work of Art and Nature: And every one will be so vain, to think he himself cou'd have perform'd the like, till he attempts it. 'Tis just the Description that <hi>Horace</hi> makes of such a Finish'd Piece: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears so easie, <hi>Vt sibi quivis speret idem, sudet multum, frustraque labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, ausus idem.</hi> And besides all this, 'tis Your Lordships particular Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to lay your Thoughts so close together, that were they closer, they wou'd be crouded, and even a due connexion wou'd be wanting. We are not kept in expectation of two good lines, which are to come after a long Parenthesis of twenty bad; which is the <hi>April</hi> Poetry of other Writers, a mixture of Rain and Sun-shine by fits: You are always bright, even almost to a fault, by reason of the excess. There is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:62894:11"/> abundance, a Magazine of Thought, and yet a perpetual Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Entertainment; which creates such an Appetite in your Reader, that he is not cloy'd with any thing, but satisfy'd with all. 'Tis that which the <hi>Romans</hi> call <hi>Coena dubia;</hi> where there is such plenty, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all so much Diversity, and so good Order, that the choice is difficult betwixt one Excellency and another; and yet the Conclusion, by a due Climax, is evermore the best; that is, as a Conclusion ought to be, ever the most proper for its place. See, my Lord, whether I have not studi'd Your Lordship with some Application: And since You are so Modest, that You will not be Judge and Party, I appeal to the whole World, if I have not drawn Your Picture to a great degree of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, tho' 'tis but in Meniature: And that some of the best Features are yet wanting. Yet what I have done is enough to distinguish You from any other, which is the Proposition that I took upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate.</p>
                  <p>And now, my Lord, to apply what I have said, to my present Business; the Satires of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Persius,</hi> appearing in this New <hi>English</hi> Dress, cannot so properly be Inscrib'd to any Man as to Your Lordship, who are the First of the Age in that way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Your Lordship, amongst many other Favours, has given me Your Permission for this Address; and You have particularly Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd me by Your Perusal and Approbation of the <hi>Sixth</hi> and <hi>Tenth Satires of Iuvenal,</hi> as I have Translated them. My fellow Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, have likewise Commission'd me, to perform in their behalf this Office of a Dedication to you; and will acknowledge with all possible Respect and Gratitude, your Acceptance of their Work. Some of them have the Honour to be known to your Lordship already; and they who have not yet that happiness, desire it now. Be pleas'd to receive our common Endeavours with your wonted Candor, without Intitleing you to the Protection of our common Failings, in so difficult an Undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And allow me your Patience, if it be not already tir'd with this long Epistle, to give you from the Best Authors, the Origine, the Antiquity, the Growth, the Change, and the Compleatment of Satire among the <hi>Romans.</hi> To Describe, if not Define, the Nature of that Poem, with it's several Qualifications and Virtues, together with the several sorts of it. To compare the Excellencies of <hi>Horace, Persius</hi> and <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> and shew the particular Manners of their Satires. And lastly, to give an Account of this New Way of Version which is attempted in our Performance. All which, according to the weakness of my Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the best Lights which I can get from others, shall be the Subject of my following Discourse.</p>
                  <p>The most Perfect Work of Poetry, says our Master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> is Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. His Reason is, because it is the most United; being more severely confin'd within the Rules of Action, Time and Place. The Action is entire of a Piece, and one, without Episodes: The Time limited to a Natural Day: And the Place Circumbscrib'd at least within the Compass of one Town, or City. Being exactly Proportion'd thus, and Uniform in all it's Parts, The Mind is more Capable of Comprehending the whole Beauty of it without distraction.</p>
                  <p>But after, all these Advantages, an Heroique Poem is certainly the greatest Work of Human Nature. The Beauties and Perfections of the other are but Mechanical; those of the Epique are more Noble. Tho' <hi>Homer</hi> has limited his Place to <hi>Troy,</hi> and the Fields about it; his Actions
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:62894:12"/> to Forty Eight Natural Days, whereof Twelve are Holy-days, or Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from business, during the Funerals of <hi>Patroclus.</hi> To proceed, the Action of the Epique is greater: The Extention of Time enlarges the Pleasure of the Reader, and the Episodes give it more Ornament, and more Variety. The Instruction is equal; but the first is only Instructive, the latter Forms a Hero, and a Prince.</p>
                  <p>If it signifies any thing which of them is of the more Ancient Family, the best and most absolute Heroique Poem was written by <hi>Homer,</hi> long before Tragedy was Invented: But, if we consider the Natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and acquir'd Parts which are necessary to make an accomplish'd Writer in either Kind, Tragedy requires a less and more confin'd Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: moderate Learning, and Observation of the Rules is sufficient, if a Genius be not wanting. But in an Epique Poet, one who is worthy of that Name, besides an Universal Genius, is requir'd Universal Learning, together with all those Qualities and Acquisitions which I have nam'd above, and as many more as I have through haste or negligence omitted. And after all, he must have exactly Study'd <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> as his Patterns, <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> as his Guides, and <hi>Vida</hi> and <hi>Bossu,</hi> as their Commentators, with many others both <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Critiques, which I want leisure here to R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>commend.</p>
                  <p>In a Word, what I have to say, in Relation to This Subject, which does not Particularly concern Satire, is, That the greatness of an Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Poem, beyond that of a Tragedy, may easily be discover'd by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, how few have attempted that Work, in comparison of those who have Written Drama's; and of those few, how small a number have Succeeded. But leaving the Critiques on either side to contend about the preference due to this or that sort of Poetry; I will hasten to my present business, which is the Antiquity and Origine of Satire, according to those Informations which I have receiv'd from the Learned <hi>Casaubon, Heinsius, Rigaltius, Dacier</hi> and the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s <hi>Iuvenal;</hi> to which I shall add some Observations of my own.</p>
                  <p>There has been a long Dispute amongst the Modern Critiques, whether the <hi>Romans</hi> deriv'd their Satire from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> or first Invented it themselves. <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Heinsius,</hi> are of the first Opinion; <hi>Casaubon, Rigaltius, Dacier,</hi> and the Publisher of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s <hi>Iuvenal</hi> maintain the Latter. If we take Satire in the general signification of the Word, as it is us'd in all Modern Languages, for an Invective, 'tis certain that it is almost as old as Verse; and tho' Hymns, which are praises of God, may be allow'd to have been before it, yet the defamation of others was not long after it. After God had Curs'd <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in Paradise, the Husband and Wife excus'd themselves, by laying the blame on one another; and gave a beginning to those Conjugal Dialogues in Prose; which the Poets have perfected in Verse. The Third Chapter of <hi>Iob</hi> is one of the first Instances of this Poem in Holy Scripture: Unless we will take it higher, from the latter end of the second; where his Wife advises him to curse his Maker.</p>
                  <p>This Original, I confess, is not much to the Honour of Satire; but here it was Nature, and that deprav'd: When it became an Art, it bore better Fruit. Only we have learnt thus much already, that Scoffs and Revilings are of the growth of all Nations; and consequently that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Greek Poets borrow'd from other People their Art of Railing, neither needed the <hi>Romans</hi> to take it from them. But considering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire as a Species of Poetry; here the War begins amongst the Criticks.
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:62894:12"/> 
                     <hi>Scaliger</hi> the Father will have it descend from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives the word Satyre, from <hi>Satyrus,</hi> that mixt kind of Animal, or, as the Ancients thought him, Rural God, made up betwixt a Man and a Goat; with a Humane Head, Hook'd Nose, Powting Lips, a Bunch, or Struma under the Chin, prick'd Ears, and upright Horns; the Body shagg'd with hair, especially from the waste, and ending in a Goat, with the legs and feet of that Creature. But <hi>Casaubon,</hi> and his Followers, with Reason, condemn this derivation; and prove that from <hi>Satyrus,</hi> the word <hi>Satira,</hi> as it signifies a Poem, cannot possibly descend. For <hi>Satira</hi> is not properly a Substantive, but an Adjective; to which, the word <hi>Lanx,</hi> in English a Charger, or large Platter, is understood: So that the Greek Poem made according to the Manners of a Satyr, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his Qualities, must properly be call'd Satyrical, and not Satire: And thus far 'tis allow'd, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> had such Poems; but that they where wholly different in Specie, from that to which the <hi>Romans</hi> gave the Name of Satire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> divides all Poetry, in relation to the Progress of it, into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without Art: Art begun, and Art Compleated. Mankind, even the most Barbarous have the Seeds of Poetry implanted in them. The first Specimen of it was certainly shewn in the Praises of the Deity, and Prayers to him: And as they are of Natural Obligation, so they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of Divine Institution. Which <hi>Milton</hi> observing, introduces <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> every Morning adoring God in Hymns and Prayers. The first Poetry was thus begun, in the wild Notes of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the invention of Feet, and Measures. The <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> had no other Original of their Poetry. Festivals and Holydays soon suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Private Worship, and we need not doubt but they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd by the true God to his own People; as they were afterwards imitated by the <hi>Heathens;</hi> who by the light of Reason knew they were to invoke some Superiour Being in their Necessities, and to thank him for his Benefits. Thus the <hi>Grecian</hi> Holydays were Celebrated with Offerings to <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> and other Deities, to whose Bounty they suppos'd they were owing for their Corn and Wine, and other helps of Life. And the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> tells us, paid their thanks to Mother Earth, or <hi>Vesta,</hi> to <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and their <hi>Genius,</hi> in the same manner. But as all Festivals have a double Reason of their Institution; the first of Religion, the other of Recreation, for the unbending of our Minds: So both the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> agreed, after their Sacrifices were perform'd, to spend the remainder of the day in Sports and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments; amongst which, Songs and Dances, and that which they call'd Wit, (for want of knowing better,) were the chiefest Entertainments. The <hi>Grecians</hi> had a notion of Satyres, whom I have already describ'd; and taking them, and the <hi>Sileni,</hi> that is the young Satyrs and the old, for the Tutors, Attendants, and Humble Companions of their <hi>Bacchus,</hi> habited themselves like those Rural Deities, and imitated them in their Rustick Dances, to which they join'd Songs, with some sort of rude Harmony, but without certain Numbers; and to these they added a kind of Chorus.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> also (as Nature is the same in all places) though they knew nothing of those <hi>Grecian</hi> Demi-Gods, nor had any Communication with <hi>Greece,</hi> yet had certain Young Men, who at their Festivals, Danc'd and Sung after their uncouth manner, to a certain kind of Verse, which they call'd <hi>Saturnian;</hi> what it was, we have no very certain light from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:62894:13"/> to discover; but we may conclude, that, like the <hi>Grecian,</hi> it was void of Art, or at least with very feeble beginnings of it. Those Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> at these Holydays, which were a mixture of Devotion and Debauchery, had a Custom of reproaching each other with their Faults, in a sort of <hi>Extempore</hi> Poetry, or rather of tunable hobling Verse; and they answer'd in the same kind of gross Raillery; their Wit and their Musick being of a piece. The <hi>Grecians,</hi> says <hi>Casaubon,</hi> had formerly done the same, in the Persons of their petulant Satyrs: But I am afraid he mistakes the matter, and confounds the Singing and Dancing of the Satyrs, with the Rustical Entertainments of the first <hi>Romans.</hi> The Reason of my Opinion is this; that <hi>Casaubon</hi> finding little light from Antiquity, of these beginnings of Poetry, amongst the <hi>Grecians,</hi> but only these Representations of <hi>Satyrs,</hi> who carry'd <hi>Canisters</hi> and <hi>Cornucopias</hi> full of several Fruits in their hands, and danc'd with them at their Publick Feasts: And afterwards reading <hi>Horace,</hi> who makes mention of his homely <hi>Romans,</hi> jesting at one another in the same kind of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, might suppose those wanton <hi>Satyrs</hi> did the same. And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially because <hi>Horace</hi> possibly might seem to him, to have shewn the Original of all Poetry in general, including the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as well as <hi>Romans:</hi> Though 'tis plainly otherwise, that he only describ'd the beginning, and first Rudiments of Poetry in his own Country. The Verses are these, which he cites from the First Epistle of the Second Book, which was Written to <hi>Augustus.</hi>

                  <p>Yet since it is a hard Conjecture, that so Great a Man as <hi>Casaubon</hi> shou'd misapply what <hi>Horace</hi> writ concerning Ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Manners of Ancient <hi>Greece,</hi> I will not insist on this Opinion, but rather judge in general, that since all Poetry had its Original from Religion, that of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> had the same beginning: Both
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:62894:13"/> were invented at Festivals of Thanksgiving: And both were prosecuted with Mirth and Raillery, and Rudiments of Verses: Amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by those who Represented <hi>Satyrs;</hi> and amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> by real Clowns.</p>
                  <p>For, Indeed, when I am Reading <hi>Casauban,</hi> on these two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, methinks I hear the same Story told twice over with very little alteration. Of which <hi>Dacier</hi> takeing notice, in his Interpretation of the <hi>Latine</hi> Verses which I have Translated, says plainly, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Poetry was the same, with a small variety in both Countries: And that the Mother of it in all Nations, was Devotion. But what is yet more wonderful, that most Learned Critique takes notice also, in his Illustrations on the First Epistle of the Second Book, that as the Poetry of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> had the same beginning at Feasts of Thanksgiving, as it has been Observ'd; and the old Comedy of the <hi>Greeks</hi> which was Invective, and the Satire of the <hi>Romans</hi> which was of the same Nature, were begun on the very same Occasion, so the Fortune of both in process of time was just the same; the old Comedy of the <hi>Grecians</hi> was forbidden, for its too much License in exposing of particular Persons, and the Rude Satire of the <hi>Romans</hi> was also Punish'd by a Law of the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> tells us, in these Words,

                  <p>But to return to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> from whose Satyrick Drama's, the Elder <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Heinsius,</hi> will have the <hi>Roman</hi> Satire to proceed, I am to take a View of them first, and see if there be any such Descent from them as those Authors have pretended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thespis,</hi> or whosoever he were that Invented Tragedy, (for Authors differ) mingl'd with them a Chorus and Dances of <hi>Satyres,</hi> which had before been us'd, in the Celebration of their Festivals; and there they were ever afterwards retain'd. The Character of them was also kept, which was Mirth and Wantonness: And this was given, I suppose, to the folly of the Common Audience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who soon grow weary of good Sense; and as we daily see, in our own Age and Country, are apt to forsake Poetry, and still ready to return, to Buffoonry and Farce. From hence it came, that in the <hi>Olympique-Games,</hi> where the Poets contended for Four Prizes, the Satyrique Tragedy was the last of them: for in the rest, the <hi>Satyrs</hi> were excluded from the Chorus. Amongst the Plays of <hi>Eurypides,</hi> which are yet remaining, there is one of these Satyriques, which is call'd the <hi>Cyclops;</hi> in which we may see the nature of those
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:62894:14"/> Poems; and from thence conclude, what likeness they have to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Satire.</p>
                  <p>The Story of this <hi>Cyclops,</hi> whose Name was <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> so famous in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Fables, was, That <hi>Vlysses,</hi> who with his Company was driven on that Coast of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where those <hi>Cyclops</hi> Inhabited, coming to ask Relief from <hi>Silenus,</hi> and the <hi>Satyres,</hi> who were Herdsmen to that One-ey'd Gyant, was kindly receiv'd by them, and entertain'd; till being perceiv'd by <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> they were made Prisoners, against the Rites of Hospitality, for which <hi>Vlysses</hi> Eloquently pleaded, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put down into the Den, and some of them devour'd: After which, <hi>Vlysses</hi> having made him Drunk, when he was asleep, thrust a great Firebrand into his Eye, and so Revenging his Dead Followers, escap'd with the remaining Party of the Living: And <hi>Silenus</hi> and the <hi>Satyrs,</hi> were freed from their Servitude under <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> and remitted to their first Liberty, of attending and accompanying their Patron <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the Subject of the Tragedy, which being one of those that end with a happy Event, is therefore by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> judg'd below the other sort, whose Success is unfortunate. Notwithstanding which, the <hi>Satyrs,</hi> who were part of the <hi>Dramatis Personae,</hi> as well as the whole <hi>Chorus,</hi> were properly introduc'd into the Nature of the Poem, which is mix'd of Farce and Tragedy. The Adventure of <hi>Vlysses</hi> was to entertain the Judging part of the Audience, and the uncouth Persons of <hi>Silenus,</hi> and the Satyrs, to divert the Common People, with their gross Railleries.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordship has perceiv'd, by this time, that this Satyrique Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Satire have little Resemblance in any of their Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The very Kinds are different: For what has a Pastoral Tragedy to do with a Paper of Verses Satirically written? The Character and Raillery of the Satyres is the only thing that cou'd pretend to a likeness: Were <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Heinsius</hi> alive to maintain their Opinion. And the first Farces of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which were the Rudiments of their Poetry, were written before they had any Communication with the <hi>Greeks;</hi> or, indeed, any Knowledge of that People.</p>
                  <p>And here it will be proper to give the Definition of the <hi>Greek</hi> Satyrique Poem from <hi>Casaubon,</hi> before I leave this Subject. The Satyrique, says he, is a Dramatick Poem, annex'd to a Tragedy; having a Chorus, which consists of Satyrs: The Persons Represented in it, are Illustrio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Men: The Action of it is great; the Stile is partly Serious, and partly Jocular; and the Event of the Action most commonly is Happy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grecians,</hi> besides these Satyrique Tragedies, had another kind of Poem, which they call'd <hi>Silli;</hi> which were more of kin to the <hi>Roman</hi> Satire: Those <hi>Silli</hi> were indeed Invective Poems, but of a different Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from the <hi>Roman</hi> Poems of <hi>Ennius, Pacuvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, Lucilius, Horace,</hi> and the rest of their Successors. They were so call'd, says <hi>Casaubon</hi> in one place, from <hi>Silenus,</hi> the Foster-Father of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> but in another place, bethinking himself better, he derives their Name <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from their Scoffing and Petulancy. From some Fragments of the <hi>Silli,</hi> written by <hi>Timon,</hi> we may find, that they were Satyrique Poems, full of <hi>Parodies;</hi> that is, of Verses patch'd up from great Poets, and turn'd into another Sence than their Author intended them. Such amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> is the Famous <hi>Cento</hi> of <hi>Ausonius;</hi> where the words are <hi>Virgil</hi>'s: But by applying them to another Sense, they are made a Relation of a Wedding-Night; and the Act of Consummation fulsomly describ'd in the very words of the most Modest amongst all Poets. Of the same manner are our
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:62894:14"/> Songs, which are turn'd into Burlesque; and the serious words of the Author perverted into a ridiculous meaning. Thus in <hi>Timon</hi>'s <hi>Silli</hi> the words are generally those of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the Tragick Poets; but he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies them Satyrically, to some Customs and Kinds of Philosophy, which he arraigns. But the <hi>Romans</hi> not using any of these <hi>Parodies</hi> in their Satyres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sometimes, indeed, repeating Verses of other Men, as <hi>Persius</hi> cites some of <hi>Nero</hi>'s; but not turning them into another meaning, the <hi>Silli</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be suppos'd to be the Original of <hi>Roman</hi> Satire. To these <hi>Silli</hi> consisting of <hi>Parodies,</hi> we may properly add, the Satires which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against particular Persons; such as were the lambiques of <hi>Archil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cus</hi> against <hi>Lycambes,</hi> which <hi>Horace</hi> undoubtedly imitated in some of his <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Epodes,</hi> whose Titles bear sufficient witness of it: I might also name the Invective of <hi>Ovid</hi> against <hi>Ibis;</hi> and many others: But these are the Under-wood of Satire, rather than the Timber-Trees: They are not of General Extension, as reaching only to some Individual Person. And <hi>Horace</hi> seems to have purg'd himself from those Sple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etick Reflections in those <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Epodes,</hi> before he undertook the Noble Work of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires; which were properly so call'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus, my Lord, I have at length disengag'd my self from those Antiquities of <hi>Greece;</hi> and have prov'd, I hope, from the best Critiques, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Satire was not borrow'd from thence, but of their own Manufacture: I am now almost gotten into my depth; at least by the help of <hi>Dacier,</hi> I am swimming towards it. Not that I will promise always to follow him, any more than be follows <hi>Casaubon;</hi> but to keep him in my Eye, as my best and truest Guide; and where I think he may possibly mislead me, there to have recourse to my own lights, as I expect that others should do by me.</p>

<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:62894:15"/> and at the same time were nothing sparing of it to their Audience. Somewhat of this Custom was afterwards retain'd in their <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> or Feasts of <hi>Saturn,</hi> Celebrated in <hi>December;</hi> at least all kind of freedom in Speech was then allow'd to Slaves, even against their Masters; and we are not without some imitation of it in our <hi>Christmas Gambols.</hi> Souldiers also us'd those <hi>Fescennine</hi> Verses, after Measure and Numbers had been added to them, at the Triumph of their Generals: Of which we have an Example, in the Triumph of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> over <hi>Gaul,</hi> in these Expressions. <hi>Caesar Gallias subegit, Nicomedes Caesarem: Ecce Caesar nunc triumphat, qui subegit Gallias; Nicomedes non triumphat, qui subegit Caesarem.</hi> The vapours of Wine made those first Satyrical Poets amongst the <hi>Romans;</hi> which, says <hi>Dacier,</hi> we cannot better represent, than by imagining a Company of Clowns on a Holyday, dancing Lubberly, and upbraiding one another in <hi>Extempore</hi> Doggrel, with their Defects and Vices, and the Stories that were told of them in Bake-houses, and Barbers Shops.</p>
                  <p>When they began to be somewhat better bred, and were entring, as I may say, into the first Rudiments of Civil Conversation, they left these Hedge Notes, for another sort of Poem, somewhat polish'd, which was also full of pleasant Raillery, but without any mixture of obscenity. This sort of Poetry appear'd under the name of Satire, because of its variety: And this Satire was adorn'd with Compositions of Musick, and with Dances: but Lascivious Postures were banish'd from it. In the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Language, says <hi>Livy,</hi> the word <hi>Hister</hi> signifies a Player: And therefore those Actors, which were first brought from <hi>Etruria</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> on occasion of a Pestilence; when the <hi>Romans</hi> were admonish'd to avert the Anger of the Gods by Plays, in the Year <hi>ab Vrbe Condita,</hi> cccxc. Those Actors, I say, were therefore call'd <hi>Histriones:</hi> And that Name has since remain'd, not only to Actors <hi>Roman</hi> born, but to all others of every Nation. They Play'd not the former <hi>extempore</hi> stuff of <hi>Fescennine</hi> Verses, or Clownish Jests; but what they Acted, was a kind of civil cleanly Farce, with Musick and Dances, and Motions that were proper to the Subject.</p>
                  <p>In this Condition <hi>Livius Andronicus</hi> found the Stage, when he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted first, instead of Farces, to supply it with a Nobler Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tragedies and Comedies. This Man was a <hi>Grecian</hi> born, and being made a Slave by <hi>Livius Salinator,</hi> and brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> had the Education of his Patron's Children committed to him. Which trust he discharg'd, so much to the satisfaction of his Master, that he gave him his Liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Andronicus</hi> thus become a Freeman of <hi>Rome,</hi> added to his own Name that of <hi>Livius</hi> his Master; and, as I observ'd, was the first Author of a Regular Play in that Commonwealth. Being already instructed in his Native Country, in the Manners and Decencies of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Theater, and Conversant in the <hi>Archaea Comaedia,</hi> or old Comedy of <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poets; he took from that Model his own designing of Plays for the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage. The first of which was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the Year 514. since the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Tully,</hi> from the Commentaries of <hi>Atticus,</hi> has assur'd us; it was after the end of the first <hi>Punick</hi> War, the year before <hi>Ennius</hi> was born. <hi>Dacier</hi> has not carry'd the matter altogether thus far; he only says, that one <hi>Livius Andronicus</hi> was the first Stage-Poet at <hi>Rome:</hi> But I will adventure on this hint, to advance another Proposition, which I hope the Learned will approve. And though we have not any thing of <hi>Andronicus</hi> remaining to justifie
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:62894:16"/> my Conjecture, yet 'tis exceeding probable, that having read the Works of those <hi>Grecian</hi> Wits, his Countrymen, he imitated not only the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, but also the manner of their Writing. And how grave soever his Tragedies might be, yet in his Comedies he express'd the way of <hi>Aristophanes, Eupolis,</hi> and the rest, which was to call some Persons by their own Names, and to expose their Defects to the laughter of the People. The Examples of which we have in the foremention'd <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> who turn'd the wise <hi>Socrates</hi> into Ridicule; and is also very free with the management of <hi>Cleon, Alcibiades,</hi> and other Ministers of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Government. Now if this be granted, we may easily suppose, that the first hint of Satirical Plays on the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage, was given by the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Not from their <hi>Satyrica,</hi> for that has been reasonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded in the former part of this Discourse: But from their old Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which was imitated first by <hi>Livius Andronicus.</hi> And then <hi>Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> must be cautiously Interpreted, where they affirm, that Satire is wholly <hi>Roman;</hi> and a sort of Verse, which was not touch'd on by the <hi>Grecians.</hi> The reconcilement of my Opinion to the Standard of their Judgment, is not however very difficult, since they spoke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, not as in its first Elements, but as it was form'd into a separate Work; begun by <hi>Ennius,</hi> pursu'd by <hi>Lucilius,</hi> and compleated after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>Horace.</hi> The Proof depends only on this <hi>Postulatum,</hi> that the Comedies of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> which were imitations of the <hi>Greek,</hi> were also imitations of their Railleries, and Reflections on particular Persons. For if this be granted me, which is a most probable Supposition, 'tis easie to infer, that the first light which was given to the <hi>Roman Theatrical</hi> Satire, was from the Plays of <hi>Livius Andronicus.</hi> Which will be more manifestly discover'd, when I come to speak of <hi>Ennius:</hi> In the mean time I will return to <hi>Dacier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The People, says he, ran in Crowds to these New Entertainments of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> as to Pieces which were more Noble in their kind, and more perfect than their former Satires, which for some time they neglected and abandon'd. But not long after, they took them up again, and then they joyn'd them to their Comedies: Playing them at the end of every Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; as the <hi>French</hi> continue at this Day to Act their Farces; in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a separate Entertainment, from their Tragedies. But more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly they were joyn'd to the <hi>Atellane</hi> Fables, says <hi>Casaubon;</hi> which were Plays invented by the <hi>Osci.</hi> Those Fables, says <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> out of <hi>Livy,</hi> were temper'd with the <hi>Italian</hi> severity, and free from any note of Infamy, or Obsceneness; and as an old Commentator on <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi> affirms, the <hi>Exodiarii,</hi> which were Singers and Dancers, enter'd to entertain the People with light Songs, and Mimical Gestures, that they might not go away oppress'd with Melancholly, from those serious Pieces of the Theater. So that the Ancient Satire of the <hi>Romans</hi> was in Extemporary Reproaches: The next was Farce, which was brought from <hi>Tuscany:</hi> To that Succeeded the Plays of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> from the old Comedy of the <hi>Grecians:</hi> And out of all these, sprung two several Branches of new <hi>Roman</hi> Satire; like different Cyens from the same Root. Which I shall prove with as much Brevity as the Subject will allow.</p>
                  <p>A Year after <hi>Andronicus</hi> had open'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage, with his new Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's, <hi>Ennius</hi> was Born: who, when he was grown to Mans Estate, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seriously consider'd the Genius of the People, and how eagerly they follow'd the first Satires, thought it wou'd be worth his Pains, to refine upon the Project, and to write Satires not to be Acted on the Theater, but
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:62894:16"/> Read. He preserv'd the Ground-work of their Pleasantry, their Venom, and their Raillery on particular Persons, and general Vices: And by this means, avoiding the danger of any ill Success, in a Publick Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he hop'd to be as well receiv'd in the Cabinet, as <hi>Andronicus</hi> had been upon the Stage. The Event was answerable to his Expectation. He made Discourses in several sorts of Verse, vari'd often in the same Paper; Retaining still in the Title, their Original Name of Satire. Both in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Subjects and the variety of Matters contain'd in them, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires of <hi>Horace</hi> are entirely like them; only <hi>Ennius,</hi> as I said, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ines not himself to one sort of Verse, as <hi>Horace</hi> does; but takeing Example from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and even from <hi>Homer</hi> himself, in his <hi>Margites,</hi> which is a kind of Satire, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> observes, gives himself the License, when one sort of Numbers comes not easily, to run into another, as his Fancy Dictates. For he makes no difficulty, to mingle Hexameters with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ambique Trimeters; or with Trochaique Tetrameters; as appears by those Fragments which are yet remaining of him: <hi>Horace</hi> has thought him worthy to be Copy'd; inserting many things of his into his own Satires, as <hi>Virgil</hi> has done into his <hi>Aeneids.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we have <hi>Dacier</hi> making out that <hi>Ennius</hi> was the first Satyrist in that way of Writing, which was of his Invention; that is, Satire abstracted from the Stage, and new modell'd into Papers of Verses, on several Subjects. But he will have <hi>Ennius</hi> take the Ground-work of Satire from the first Farces of the <hi>Romans;</hi> rather than from the form'd Plays of <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi> which were Copy'd from the <hi>Grecian</hi> Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. It may possibly be so; but <hi>Dacier</hi> knows no more of it than I do. And it seems to me the more probable Opinion, that he rather imitated the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine Railleries of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which he saw in the Pieces of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> than the Coursness of his old Country men, in their Clownish Extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary way of jee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But besides this, 'tis Universally Granted, that <hi>Ennius</hi> though an <hi>Italian,</hi> was excellently Learn'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> Language.

                  <p>Thus, both <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Quintilian,</hi> give a kind of Primacy of Honour to <hi>Lucilius,</hi> amongst the Latin Satirists. For as the <hi>Roman</hi> Language grew more Refin'd, so much more capable it was of receiving the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Beauties in his time: <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> cou'd mean no more, than that <hi>Lucilius</hi> writ better than <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius:</hi> And on the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we prefer <hi>Horace</hi> to <hi>Lucilius:</hi> Both of them imitated the old <hi>Greek</hi> Comedy; and so did <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius</hi> before them. The polishing of the Latin Tongue, in the Succession of Times, made the only difference. And <hi>Horace</hi> himself, in two of his Satires, written purposely on this Subject, thinks the <hi>Romans</hi> of his Age, were too Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in their Commendations of <hi>Lucilius;</hi> who writ not only loosely, and muddily, with little Art, and much less Care, but also in a time when the Latin Tongue was not yet sufficiently purg'd from the Dregs of Barbarism; and many significant and sounding Words, which the <hi>Romans</hi> wanted, were not admitted even in the times of <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Cicero;</hi> of which both complain.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, <hi>Dacier</hi> justly taxes <hi>Casaubon,</hi> for saying. That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires of <hi>Lucilius</hi> were wholly different in <hi>Specie,</hi> from those of <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius. Casaubon</hi> was led into that mistake, by <hi>Diomedes</hi> the Grammarian, who in effect says this. Satire amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> but not amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was a biteing invective Poem, made after the Model of the Ancient Comedy; for the Reprehension of Vices: Such as were the Poems of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> of <hi>Horace,</hi> and of <hi>Persius.</hi> But in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, the Name of Satire was given to Poems, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of several sorts of Verses; such as were made by <hi>Ennius,</hi> and <hi>Pacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius;</hi> more fully expressing the Etymology of the word Satire, from <hi>Satura,</hi> which we have observ'd. Here 'tis manifest, that <hi>Diomedes</hi> makes a Specifical Distinction betwixt the Satires of <hi>Ennius,</hi> and those of <hi>Lucilius.</hi> But this, as we say in <hi>English,</hi> is only a Distinction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Difference; for the Reason of it, is ridiculous, and absolutely false. This was that which cozen'd honest <hi>Casaubon,</hi> who relying on <hi>Diomedes,</hi> had not sufficiently examin'd the Origine and Nature of those two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires; which were entirely the same, both in the Matter and the Form. For all that <hi>Lucilius</hi> perform'd beyond his Predecessors, <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> was only the adding of more Politeness, and more Salt; without any change in the Substance of the Poem: And tho' <hi>Lucilius</hi> put not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the same Satire several sorts of Verses, as <hi>Ennius</hi> did; yet he compos'd several Satires, of several sorts of Verses; and mingl'd them with Greek Verses: One Poem consisted only of Hexameters; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was entirely of lambiques; a third of Trochaiques; as is visible by the Fragments yet remaining of his Works. In short, if the Satires of <hi>Lucilius</hi> are therefore said to be wholly different from those of <hi>Ennius</hi> because he added much more of Beauty and Polishing to his own' Poems, than are to be found in those before him; it will follow from hence, that the Satires of <hi>Horace</hi> are wholly different from those of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius,</hi> because <hi>Horace</hi> has not less surpass'd <hi>Lucilius</hi> in the Elegancy of his Writing, than <hi>Lucilius</hi> surpass'd <hi>Ennius</hi> in the turn and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his.

                  <p>Having thus brought down the History of Satire from its Original, to the times of <hi>Horace,</hi> and shewn the several changes of it. I shou'd here discover some of those Graces which <hi>Horace</hi> added to it, but that I think it will be more proper to defer that Undertaking, till I make the Comparison betwixt him and <hi>Iuvenal.</hi> In the mean while, following the Order of Time, it will be necessary to say somewhat of another kind of Satire, which also was descended from the Ancient: 'Tis that which we call the <hi>Varronian</hi> Satire, but which <hi>Varro</hi> himself calls the <hi>Menippean;</hi> because <hi>Varro,</hi> the most Learn'd of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was the first Author of it, who imitated, in his Works, the Manners of <hi>Menippus</hi> the <hi>Gadarenian,</hi> who profess'd the Philosophy of the <hi>Cyniques.</hi>

                  <p>This sort of Satire was not only compos'd of several sorts of Verse, like those of <hi>Ennius,</hi> but was also mix'd with Prose; and Greek was sprinkl'd amongst the Latin. <hi>Quintilian,</hi> after he had spoken of the Satire of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> adds what follows. <hi>There is another and former kind of Satire, Compos'd by</hi> Terentius Varro, <hi>the most Learn'd of the</hi> Romans: <hi>In which he was not satisfy'd alone, with mingling in it several sorts of Verse.</hi> The only difficulty of this Passage, is, that <hi>Quintilian</hi> tells us, that this Satire of <hi>Varro</hi> was of a former kind. For how can we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly imagine this to be, since <hi>Varro,</hi> who was contemporary to <hi>Cicero,</hi> must consequently be after <hi>Lucilius?</hi> But <hi>Quintilian</hi> meant not, that the Satire of <hi>Varro</hi> was in order of Time before <hi>Lucilius;</hi> he wou'd only give us to understand, that the <hi>Varronian</hi> Satire, with mixture of several sorts of Verses, was more after the manner of <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> than that of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> who was more severe, and more correct; and gave himself less liberty in the mixture of his Verses, in the same Poem.</p>
                  <p>We have nothing remaining of those <hi>Varronian</hi> Satires, excepting some inconsiderable Fragments; and those for the most part much corrupted. The Titles of many of them are indeed preserv'd, and they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally double: From whence, at least, we may understand, how many various Subjects were treated by that Author. <hi>Tully,</hi> in his Academicks, introduces <hi>Varro</hi> himself giving us some light concerning the Scope and Design of these Works. Wherein, after he had shewn his Reasons why he did not <hi>ex professo</hi> write of Philosophy, he adds what follows. Notwithstanding, <hi>says he,</hi> that those Pieces of mine, wherein I have imitated <hi>Menippus,</hi> though I have not Translated him, are sprinkled with a kind of mirth, and gayety: Yet many things are there inserted, which are drawn from the very intrails of Philosophy, and many things severely argu'd: Which I have mingl'd with Pleasantries on purpose, that they may more easily go down with the Common sort of Unlearn'd Readers. The rest of the Sentence is so lame, that we can only make thus much out of it; that in the Composition of his Satires, he so temper'd Philology with Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, that his Work was a mixture of them both. And <hi>Tully</hi> himself confirms us in this Opinion; when a little after he addresses himself to <hi>Varro</hi> in these words. <hi>And you your self have compos'd a most Elegant and Compleat Poem; you have begun Philosophy in many Places: Sufficient to incite us, though too little to Instruct us.</hi> Thus it appears, that <hi>Varro</hi> was one of those Writers whom they call'd <gap reason="foreign">

All that we know farther of <hi>Menippus,</hi> and his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which are wholly lost; is, that by some he is esteem'd, as, amongst the rest, by <hi>Varro:</hi> By others he is noted of Cynical Impudence, and Obsc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This is what I have to say in General of Satire: Only as <hi>Dacier</hi> has observ'd before me, we may take notice, That the word Satire is of a more general signification in Latin, than in French, or English. For amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> it was not only us'd for those Discourses which decry'd Vice, or expos'd Folly; but for others also, where Virtue was recommended. But in our Modern Languages we apply it only to invective Poems, where the very Name of Satire is formidable to those Persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who wou'd appear to the World, what they are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For in English, to say Satire, is to mean Reflection, as we use that word in the worst Sense; or as the <hi>French</hi> call it, more properly, <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance.</hi> In the Criticism of Spelling, it ought to be with <hi>i</hi> and not with <hi>y;</hi> to distinguish its true derivation from <hi>Sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ra,</hi> not from <hi>Satyrus.</hi> And if this be so, then 'tis false spell'd throughout this Book: For here 'tis written Satyr. Which having not consider'd at the first, I thought it not worth Correcting afterwards. But the <hi>French</hi> are more nice, and never spell it any other ways than Satire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:62894:18"/>I am now arriv'd at the most difficult part of my Undertaking, which is, to compare <hi>Horace</hi> with <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Persius:</hi> 'Tis observ'd by <hi>Rigaltius,</hi> in his Preface before <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> written to <hi>Thuanus,</hi> that these three Poets have all their particular <hi>Partisans,</hi> and Favourers: Every Commentator, as he has taken pains with any of them, thinks himself oblig'd to perfer his Author to the other two: To find out their Failings, and decry them, that he may make room for his own Darling. Such is the partiality of Mankind, to set up that Interest which they have once espous'd, though it be to the prejudice of Truth, Morality, and common Justice. And especially in the productions of the Brain. As Authors generally think themselves the best Poets, because they cannot go out of themselves, to judge sincerely of their Betters: So it is with Critiques, who, having first taken a liking to one of these Poets, proceed to Comment on him, and to Illustrate him; after which they fall in love with their own Labours, to that degree of blind fondness, that at length they defend and exalt their Author, not so much for his sake as for their own. 'Tis a folly of the same Nature, with that of the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, in their Games of the <hi>Circus;</hi> the Spectators were divided in their Factions, betwixt the <hi>Veneti</hi> and the <hi>Prasini:</hi> Some were for the Charioteer in Blue, and some for him in Green. The Colours themselves were but a Fancy; but when once a Man had taken pains to set out those of his Party, and had been at the trouble of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Voices for them, the Case was alter'd: He was concern'd for his own Labour: And that so earnestly, that Disputes and Quarrels, Animosities, Commotions, and Bloodshed, often happen'd: And in the Declension of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>erence of Colours, when the safety of their People was in question. I am now, my self, on the brink of the same Precipice; I have spent some time on the Translation of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> and <hi>Persius:</hi> And it behoves me to be wary, lest, for that Reason, I shou'd be partial to them, or take a prejudice against <hi>Horace.</hi> Yet, on the other side, I woul'd not be like some of our Judges, who wou'd give the Cause for a Poor Man, right or wrong: For though that be an Errour on the better hand, yet it is still a partiality: And a Rich Man, unhear'd, cannot be concluded an Oppressor. I remember a saying of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, on Sir <hi>Matthew Hales,</hi> (who was doubtless an Uncorrupt and Upright Man) That his Servants were sure to be Cast on any Trial, which was heard before him: Not that he thought the Judge was possibly to be brib'd; but that his Integrity might be too scrupulous: And that the Causes of the Crown were always suspicious, when the Priviledges of Subjects were concern'd.</p>
                  <p>It had been much fairer, if the Modern Critiques, who have imbark'd in the Quarrels of their favourite Authors, had rather given to each his proper due; without taking from another's heap, to raise their own. There is Praise enough for each of them in particular, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching on his Fellows, and detracting from them, or Enriching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Spoils of others. But to come to particulars: <hi>Heinsius</hi> and <hi>Dacier,</hi> are the most principal of those, who raise <hi>Horace</hi> above <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Persius. Scaliger</hi> the Father, <hi>Rigaltius,</hi> and many others, debase <hi>Horace,</hi> that they may set up <hi>Iuvenal:</hi> And <hi>Casaubon,</hi> who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most single, throws Dirt on <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> that he may exalt <hi>Persius,</hi> whom he understood particularly well, and better than any of

I will begin with him, who in my Opinion defends the weakest Cause, which is that of <hi>Persius;</hi> and labouring, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> professes of his own Writing, to divest my self of partiality, or prejudice, consider <hi>Persius,</hi> not as a Poet, whom I have wholly Translated, and who has cost me more labour and time, than <hi>Iuvenal;</hi> but according to what I judge to be his own Merit; which I think not equal in the main, to that of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> or <hi>Horace;</hi> and yet in some things to be preferr'd to both of them.</p>
                  <p>First, then, for the Verse, neither <hi>Casaubon</hi> himself, nor any for him, can defend either his Numbers, or the Purity of his <hi>Latin. Casaubon</hi> gives this point for lost; and pretends not to justifie either the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, or the Words of <hi>Persius:</hi> He is evidently beneath <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> in both.</p>
                  <p>Then, as his Verse is scabrous, and hobbling, and his Words not every where well chosen, the purity of <hi>Latin</hi> being more corrupted, than in the time of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> and consequently of <hi>Horace,</hi> who writ when the Language was in the heighth of its perfection; so his diction is hard; his Figures are generally too bold and daring; and his Tropes, particularly his Metaphors, insufferably strain'd.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, notwithstanding all the diligence of <hi>Casaubon, Stelluti,</hi> and a <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentleman (whom I have hear'd extreamly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his Illustrations of him:) yet he is still obscure: Whether he affected not to be understood, but with difficulty; or whether the fear of his safety under <hi>Nero,</hi> compell'd him to this darkness in some places; or that it was occasion'd by his close way of thinking, and the brevity of his Style, and crowding of his Figures; or lastly, whether after so long a time, many of his Words have been corrupted, and many Customs, and Stories relating to them, lost to us; whether some of these Reasons, or all, concurr'd to render him so cloudy; we may be bold to affirm, that the best of Commentators can but guess at his Meaning, in many passages: And none can be certain that he has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin'd rightly.</p>
                  <p>After all, he was a Young Man, like his Friend and Contemporary <hi>Lucan:</hi> Both of them Men of extraordinary Parts, and great acquir'd Knowledge, considering their Youth. But neither of them had arriv'd to that Maturity of Judgment, which is necessary to the accomplishing of a form'd Poet. And this Consideration, as on the one hand it lays some Imperfections to their charge, so on the other side 'tis a candid excuse for those Failings, which are incident to Youth and Inexperience; and we have more Reason to wonder, how they, who Dyed before th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Thirtieth Year of their Age, cou'd write so well, and think so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; than to accuse them of those Faults, from which Humane Nature, and more especially in Youth, can never possibly be exempted.</p>
                  <p>To consider <hi>Persius</hi> yet more closely: He rather insulted over Vice and Folly, than expos'd them, like <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>venal</hi> and <hi>Horace.</hi> And as Chaste, and Modest as he is esteem'd, it cannot be deny'd, but that in some places, he is broad and fulsom, as the latter Verses of the Fourth Satire, and of the Sixth, sufficiently witness. And 'tis to be believ'd, that he who commits the same Crime often, and without Necessity, cannot but do it with some kind of Pleasure.</p>
                  <p>To come to a conclusion, He is manifestly below <hi>Horace;</hi> because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e borrows most of his greatest Beauties from him: And <hi>Casaubon</hi> is so far from denying this; that he has written a Treatise purposely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:62894:21"/> it; wherein he shews a multitude of his Translations from <hi>Horace,</hi> and his imitations of him, for the Credit of his Author; which he calls <hi>Imitatio Horatiana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To these defects, which I casually observ'd, while I was Translating this Author, <hi>Scaliger</hi> had added others: He calls him, in plain terms, a silly Writer, and a trifler; full of Ostentation of his Learning; and after all, unworthy to come into Competition with <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Horace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After such terrible Accusations, 'tis time to hear what his Patron <hi>Casaubon</hi> can alledge in his Defence. Instead of answering, he excuses for the most part; and when he cannot, accuses others of the same Crimes. He deals with <hi>Scaliger,</hi> as a Modest Scholar with a Master. He Compliments him with so much Reverence, that one wou'd swear he Fear'd him as much at least as he Respected him. <hi>Scaliger</hi> will not allow <hi>Persius</hi> to have any Wit: <hi>Casaubon</hi> Interprets this in the mildest Sense; and confesses his Author was not good at turning things into a pleasant Ridicule; or in other words, that he was not a laughable Writer. That he was <hi>ineptus,</hi> indeed, but that was, <hi>non aptissimus ad jocandum.</hi> But that he was Ostentatious of his Learning, that, by <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi>'s good Favour, he denies. <hi>Persius</hi> shew'd his Learning, but was no Boaster of it; he did <hi>ostendere,</hi> but not <hi>ostentare;</hi> and so, he says, did <hi>Scaliger:</hi> Where, methinks, <hi>Casaubon</hi> turns it handsomly, upon that super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious Critick, and silently insinuates, that he himself was sufficiently vain-glorious; and a boaster of his own Knowledge. All the Writings of this Venerable <hi>Censor,</hi> continues <hi>Casaubon,</hi> which are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, more golden, than Gold it self, are every where smelling of that Thyme, which, like a Bee, he has gather'd from Ancient Authors: But far be Ostentation and Vain-Glory from a Gentleman, so well Born, and so Nobly Educated as <hi>Scaliger:</hi> But, says <hi>Scaliger,</hi> he is so obscure, that he has got himself the Name of <hi>Scotinus,</hi> a dark Writer. Now, says <hi>Casaubon,</hi> 'tis a wonder to me, that any thing cou'd be obscure to the Divine Wit of <hi>Scaliger;</hi> from which nothing cou'd be hidden. This is indeed a strong Compliment, but no Defence. And <hi>Casaubon,</hi> who cou'd not but be sensible of his Author's blind side, thinks it time to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon a Post that was untenable. He acknowledges that <hi>Persius</hi> is obscure in some places; but so is <hi>Plato,</hi> so is <hi>Thucydides;</hi> so are <hi>Pindar, Theocritus,</hi> and <hi>Aristophanes</hi> amongst the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets; and even <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> he might have added, amongst the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Truth is, <hi>Persius</hi> is not sometimes, but generally obscure: And therefore <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saubon,</hi> at last, is forc'd to excuse him, by alledging that it was <hi>se de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I cannot help my own Opinion; I think <hi>Cornutus</hi> needed not to have Read many Lectures to him on that Subject. <hi>Persius</hi> was an apt Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and when he was bidden to be obscure, in some places, where his Life and Safety were in question, took the same Counsel for all his Book; and never afterwards Wrote ten Lines together clearly. <hi>Casaubon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this Chapter, has not fail'd, we may be sure, of making a Compliment to his own dear Comment. If <hi>Persiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> says he, be in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self obscure, yet my Interpretation has made him intelligible. There is no question, but he deserves that Praise, which he has given to himself: But the Nature of the thing, as <hi>Lucretius</hi> says, will not admit of a perfect Explanation. Besides many Examples which I cou'd urge; the
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:62894:22"/> very last Verse of his last Satire, upon which he particularly values himselfe in his Preface, is not yet sufficiently explicated. 'Tis true, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liday</hi> has endeavour'd to justifie his Construction; but <hi>Stelluti</hi> is against it: And, for my part, I can have but a very dark Notion of it. As for the Chastity of his Thoughts, <hi>Casaubon</hi> denies not, but that one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular passage, in the Fourth Satire, <hi>At, si unctus cesses,</hi> &amp;c. is not only the most obscure, but the most obscene of all his Works: I understood it; but for that Reason turn'd it over. In defence of his boistrous Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, he quotes <hi>Longinus,</hi> who accounts them as instruments of the Sublime: Fit to move and stir up the Affections, particularly in Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To which it may be reply'd, That where the Trope is far fetch'd, and hard, 'tis fit for nothing but to puzzle the Understanding: And may be reckon'd amongst those things of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> which <hi>Aeschines,</hi> call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is Prodigies, not Words. It must be granted to <hi>Casaubon,</hi> that the Knowledge of many things is lost in our Modern Ages, which were of familiar notice to the Ancients: And that Satire is a Poem of a difficult Nature in it self, and is not written to Vulgar Readers. And through the Relation which it has to Comedy, the frequent change of Persons, makes the Sense perplex'd; when we can but Divine, who it is that speaks: Whether <hi>Persius</hi> himself, or his Friend and Monitor; or, in some places, a third Person. But <hi>Casaubon</hi> comes back always to himself, and concludes, that if <hi>Persius</hi> had not been obscure, there had been no need of him for an Interpreter. Yet when he had once enjoyn'd himself so hard a Task, he then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd the <hi>Greek</hi> Proverb, that he must <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; either eat the whole Snail, or let it quite alone; and so, he went through with his laborious Task, as I have done with my difficult Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation.</p>
                  <p>Thus far, my Lord, you see it has gone very hard with <hi>Persius:</hi> I think he cannot be allow'd to stand in competition, either with <hi>Iuvenal</hi> or <hi>Horace.</hi> Yet, for once, I will venture to be so vain, as to affirm, That none of his hard Metaphors, or forc'd Expressions, are in my Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But more of this in its proper place, where I shall say somewhat in particular, of our general performance, in making these two Authors <hi>English.</hi> In the mean time I think my self oblig'd, to give <hi>Persius</hi> his undoubted due; and to acquaint the World, with <hi>Casaubon,</hi> in what he has equall'd, and in what excell'd his two Competitors.</p>
                  <p>A Man who is resolv'd to praise an Author, with any appearance of Justice, must be sure to take him on the strongest side; and where he is least liable to Exceptions. He is therefore oblig'd to chuse his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums accordingly: <hi>Casaubon,</hi> who saw that <hi>Persius</hi> cou'd not laugh with a becomeing Grace, that he was not made for jeasting, and that a merry Conceit was not his Talent, turn'd his Feather, like an <hi>Indian,</hi> to another light, that he might give it the better Gloss. Moral Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, says he, and Urbanity, or well-manner'd Wit, are the two things which constitute the <hi>Roman</hi> Satire. But of the two, that which is most Essential to this Poem, and is as it were the very Soul which animates it, is the scourging of Vice, and Exhortation to Virtue. Thus Wit, for a good Reason, is already almost out of Doors: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd only for an Instrument, a kind of Tool, or a Weapon, as he calls it, of which the Satyrist makes use, in the compassing of his Design. The End and Aim of our three Rivals, is consequently the same. But by what Methods they have prosecuted their intention, is farther to be
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:62894:22"/> consider'd. Satire is of the nature of Moral Philosophy; as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive: He therefore, who instructs most Usefully, will carry the Palm from his two Antagonists. The Philosophy in which <hi>Persius</hi> was Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and which he professes through his whole Book, is the Stoick: The most noble, most generous, most beneficial to Humane Kind, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the Sects, who have given us the Rules of Ethiques, thereby to form a severe Virtue in the Soul; to raise in us an undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, against the assaults of Fortune; to esteem as nothing the things that are without us, because they are not in our Power; not to value Riches, Beauty, Honours, Fame, or Health, any farther than as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and so many helps to living as we ought, and doing good in our Generation. In short, to be always Happy, while we possess our Minds, with a good Conscience, are free from the slavery of Vices, and conform our Actions and Conversation to the Rules of right Reason. See here, my Lord, an Epitome of <hi>Epictetus;</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Zeno,</hi> and the Education of our <hi>Persius.</hi> And this he express'd, not only in all his Satires, but in the manner of his Life. I will not lessen this Commendation of the Stoick Philosophy, by giving you an account of some Absurdities in their Doctrine, and some perhaps Impieties, if we consider them by the Standard of Christian Faith: <hi>Persius</hi> has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aln in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to none of them: And therefore is free from those imputations. What he teaches, might be taught from Pulpits, with more profit to the Audience, than all the nice Speculations of Divinity, and Controversies concerning Faith; which are more for the Profit of the Shepherd, than for the Edification of the Flock. Passion, Interest, Ambition, and all their Bloody Consequences of Discord and of War, are banish'd from this Doctrine. Here is nothing propos'd but the quiet and tranquility of Mind; Virtue lodg'd at home, and afterwards diffus'd in her general Effects, to the improvement, and good of Humane Kind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wonder not, that the present Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> has recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this our Author, and the Tenth Satyr of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> in his Pastoral Letter, to the serious perusal and Practice of the Divines in his Diocese, as the best Common Places for their Sermons, as the Store-Houses and Magazines of Moral Virtues, from whence they may draw out, as they have occasion, all manner of Assistance, for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Virtuous Life, which the Stoicks have assign'd for the great End and Perfection of Mankind. Hererin, then it is, that <hi>Persius</hi> has excell'd both <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Horace.</hi> He sticks to his one Philosophy: He shifts not sides, like <hi>Horace,</hi> who is sometimes an <hi>Epicuraean,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Stoick, sometimes an Eclectick; as his present Humour leads him: Nor declaims like <hi>Iuvenal</hi> against Vices, more like an Orator, than a Philosopher. <hi>Persius</hi> is every where the same: True to the Dogma's of his Master: What he has learnt, he teaches vehemently; and what he teaches, that he Practices himself. There is a Spirit of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in all he says: You may easily discern that he is in earnest, and is perswaded of that Truth which he inculcates. In this I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that he excels <hi>Horace,</hi> who is commonly in jeast, and laughs while he instructs: And is equal to <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> who was as honest and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as <hi>Persius,</hi> and more he cou'd not be.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have follow'd <hi>Casaubon,</hi> and enlarg'd upon him; because I am satisfi'd that he says no more than Truth; the rest is almost all frivolous. For he says that <hi>Horace</hi> being the Son of a Tax-gatherer, or a Collector, as we call it, smells every where of the meanness of his
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:62894:23"/> Birth, and Education: His conceipts are vulgar, like the Subjects of his Satires; that he does <hi>Plebeium sapere;</hi> and Writes not with that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which becomes a Satyrist: That <hi>Persius</hi> being nobly born, and of an opulent Family, had likewise the advantage of a better Master; <hi>Cornutus</hi> being the most Learned of his time, a Man of a most Holy Life; the chief of the Stoick Sect at <hi>Rome;</hi> and not only a great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, but a Poet himself; and in probability a Coadjutor of <hi>Persius.</hi> That, as for <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> he was long a Declaimer, came late to Poetry; and had not been much conversant in Philosophy.</p>
                  <p>'Tis granted that the Father of <hi>Horace</hi> was <hi>Libertinus,</hi> that is one degree remov'd from his Grandfather, who had been once a Slave: But <hi>Horace,</hi> speaking of him, gives him the best Character of a Father, which I ever read in History: And I wish a witty Friend of mine now living had such another. He bred him in the best School, and with the best Company of young Noblemen. And <hi>Horace,</hi> by his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to his Memory, gives a certain Testimony that his Education was ingenuous. After this, he form'd himself abroad, by the Conversation of Great Men. <hi>Brutus</hi> found him at <hi>Athens,</hi> and was so pleas'd with him, that he took him thence into the Army, and made him <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Militum,</hi> a Colonel in a Legion, which was the Preferment of an Old Souldier. All this was before his Acquaintance with <hi>Mecenas,</hi> and his introduction into the Court of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and the familiarity of that great Emperour: Which, had he not been well-bred before, had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to civilise his Conversation, and render him accomplish'd, and knowing in all the Arts of Complacency and good behaviour; and, in short, an agreeable Companion for the retir'd hours and privacies of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, who was first Minister. So that, upon the whole matter, <hi>Persius</hi> may be acknowledg'd to be equal with him, in those respects, tho' bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter born, and <hi>Iuvenal</hi> inferiour to both. If the Advantage be any where, 'tis on the side of <hi>Horace;</hi> as much as the Court of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> was superiour to that of <hi>Nero.</hi> As for the Subjects which they treated, it will appear hereafter, that <hi>Horace</hi> writ not vulgarly on vulgar Subjects: Nor always chose them. His Stile is constantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to his Subject, either high or low: If his fault be too much lowness, that of <hi>Persius</hi> is the fault of the hardness of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, and obscurity: And so they are equal in the failings of their Stile; where <hi>Iuvenal</hi> manefestly Triumphs over both of them.</p>
                  <p>The Comparison betwixt <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Iuvenal</hi> is more difficult; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Forces were more equal: A Dispute has always been, and ever will contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

If it be only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd in general, which of them was the better Poet; the Victory is already gain'd on the side of <hi>Horace. Virgil</hi> himself must yield to him in the delicacy of his Turns, his choice of Words, and perhaps the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Latin. He who says that <hi>Pindar</hi> is inimitable, is himself inimitable in his <hi>Odes.</hi> But the Contention betwixt these two great Masters, is for the Prize of Satire. In which Controversie, all the <hi>Odes,</hi> and <hi>Epodes</hi> of <hi>Horace</hi> are to stand excluded. I say this, because <hi>Horace</hi> has written many of them Satirically, against his private Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Yet these, if justly consider'd, are somewhat of the Nature of he <hi>Greek Silli,</hi> which were Invectives against particular Sects and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But <hi>Horace</hi> had purg'd himself of this Choler, before he enter'd
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:62894:23"/> on those Discourses, which are more properly call'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Satire: He has not now to do with a <hi>Lyce,</hi> a <hi>Canidi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In a word, that former sort of Satire, which is known in <hi>England</hi> by the Name of Lampoon, is a dangerous sort of Weapon, and for the most part Unlawful. We have no Moral right on the Reputation of other Men. 'Tis taking from them, what we cannot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> restore to them. There are only two Reasons, for which we may be permitted to write Lampoons; and I will not promise that they can always justifie us: The first is Revenge, when we have been affronted in the same Nature, or have been any ways notoriously abus'd, and can make our selves no other Reparation. And yet we know, that, in Christian Charity, all Offences are to be forgiven; as we expect the like Pardon for those which we daily commit against Almighty God. And this Consideration has often made me tremble when I was saying our Saviour's Prayer; for the plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the forgiveness which we beg, is the pardoning of others the Offences which they have done to us: For which Reason I have many times avoided the Commission of that Fault; ev'n when I have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously provok'd. Let not this, my Lord, pass for Vanity in me: For 'tis truth. More Libels have been written against me, than almost any Man now living: And I had Reason on my side, to have defended my own Innocence: I speak not of my Poetry, which I have wholly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to the Criticks; let them use it, as they please; Posterity, perhaps, may be more favourable to me: For Interest and Passion, will lye bury'd in another Age: And Partiality and Prejudice be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. I speak of my Morals, which have been sufficiently aspers'd: That only sort of Reputation ought to be dear to every honest Man, and is to me. But let the World witness for me, that I have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wanting to my self in that particular; I have seldom answer'd any scurrilous Lampoon: When it was in my power to have expos'd my Enemies: And being naturally vindicative, have suffer'd in silence; and possess'd my Soul in quiet.</p>
                  <p>Any thing, tho' never so little, which a Man speaks of himself, in my Opinion, is still too much, and therefore I will wave this Subject; and proceed to give the second Reason, which may justifie a Poet, when he writes against a particular Person; and that is, when he is become a Publick Nuisance. All those, whom <hi>Horace</hi> in his Satires, and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> and <hi>Iuvenal</hi> have mention'd in theirs, with a Brand of infamy, are wholly such. 'Tis an Action of Virtue to make Examples of vicious Men. They may and ought to be upbraided with their Crimes and Follies: Both for their own amendment, if they are not yet incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible; and for the Terrour of others, to hinder them from falling into those Enormities, which they see are so severely punish'd, in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of others: The first Reason was only an Excuse for Revenge: But this second is absolutely of a Poet's Office to perform: But how few Lampooners are there now living, who are capable of this Duty! When they come in my way, 'tis impossible sometimes to avoid read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. But, good God, how remote they are in common Justice, from the choice of such Persons as are the proper Subject of Satire! And how little Wit they bring, for the support of their injustice! The weaker Sex is their most ordinary Theme: And the best and fairest are sure to be the most severely handled. Amongst Men, those who are
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:62894:24"/> prosperously unjust, are Intitled to a Panegyrick. But afflicted Virtue is insolently stabb'd with all manner of Reproaches. No Decency is consider'd, no fulsomness omitted; no Venom is wanting, as far as dullness can supply it. For there is a perpetual Dearth of Wit; a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness of good Sense, and Entertainment. The neglect of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, will soon put an end to this sort of scribling. There can be no pleasantry where there is no Wit: No Impression can be made, where there is no Truth for the Foundation. To conclude, they are like the Fruits of the Earth in this unnatural Season: The Corn which held up its Head, is spoil'd with rankness: But the greater part of the Harvest is laid along, and little of good Income, and wholesom Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment is receiv'd into the Barns. This is almost a digression, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to your Lordship; but a just indignation forc'd it from me. Now I have remov'd this Rubbish, I will return to the Comparison of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi> and <hi>Horace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I wou'd willingly divide the Palm betwixt them; upon the two Heads of Profit and Delight, which are the two Ends of Poetry in general. It must be granted by the Favourers of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> that <hi>Horace</hi> is the more Copious, and Profitable in his Instructions of Humane Life. But in my particular Opinion, which I set not up for a Standard to better Judgments, <hi>Iuvenal</hi> is the more delightful Author. I am profited by both, I am pleas'd with both; but I owe more to <hi>Horace</hi> for my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and more to <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> for my Pleasure. This, as I said, is my particular Taste of these two Authors: They who will have either of them to excel the other in both qualities, can scarce give better Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for their Opinion, than I for mine: But all unbiass'd Readers, will conclude, that my Moderation is not to be Condemn'd: To such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Men I must appeal: For they who have already form'd their Judgment, may justly stand suspected of prejudice; and tho all who are my Readers, will set up to be my Judges, I enter my <hi>Caveat</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, that they ought not so much as to be of my Jury. Or, if they be admitted, 'tis but Reason, that they shou'd first hear, what I have to urge in the Defence of my Opinion.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Horace</hi> is somewhat the better Instructor of the two, is prov'd from hence, that his Instructions are more general: <hi>Iuvenals's</hi> more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited. So that granting, that the Counsels which they give, are equally good for Moral Use; <hi>Horace,</hi> who gives the most various Advice, and most applicable to all Occasions, which can occurr to us, in the course of our Lives; as including in his Discourses, not only all the Rules of Morality, but also of Civil Conversation; is, undoubtedly, to be preferr'd to him, who is more circumscrib'd in his Instructions, makes them to fewer People, and on fewer Occasions, than the other. I may be pardon'd for using an Old Saying, since 'tis true, and to the purpose, <hi>Bonum quo communius, eo melius. Iuvenal,</hi> excepting only his first Satire, is in all the rest confin'd, to the exposing of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler Vice; that he lashes, and there he sticks. His Sentences are truly shining and instructive: But they are sprinkl'd here and there. <hi>Horace</hi> is teaching us in every Line, and is perpetually Moral; he had found out the Skill of <hi>Virgil,</hi> to hide his Sentences: To give you the Virtue of them, without shewing them in their full extent: Which is the Ostentation of a Poet, and not his Art: And this <hi>Petronius</hi> charges on the Authors of his Time, as a Vice of Writing, which was
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:62894:24"/> then growing on the Age. <hi>Ne Sententiae extra Corpus Orationis emine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant:</hi> He wou'd have them weav'd into the Body of the Work, and not appear emboss'd upon it, and striking directly on the Reader's view. Folly was the proper Quarry of <hi>Horace,</hi> and not Vice: And, as there are but few Notoriously Wicked Men, in comparison with a Shoal of Fools, and Fops; so 'tis a harder thing to make a Man Wise, than to make him Honest: For the Will is only to be reclaim'd in the one; but the Understanding is to be inform'd in the other. There are Blind-sides and Follies, even in the Prosessors of Moral Philosophy; and there is not any one Sect of them that <hi>Horace</hi> has not expos'd. Which, as it was not the Design of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> who was wholly employ'd in lashing Vices, some of them the most enormous that can be imagin'd; so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it was not so much his Talent. <hi>Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico, tangit, &amp; admissus circum praecordia ludit.</hi> This was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation which <hi>Persius</hi> gave him: Where by <hi>Vitium,</hi> he means those little Vices, which we call Follies, the defects of Humane Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or at most the Peccadillos of Life, rather than the Tragical Vices, to which Men are hurri'd by their unruly Passions and exorbitant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. But in the word <hi>omne,</hi> which is universal, he concludes, with me, that the Divine Wit of <hi>Horace,</hi> left nothing untouch'd; that he enter'd into the inmost Recesles of Nature; found out the Imperfections even of the most Wise and Grave, as well as of the Common People: Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, even in the great <hi>Trebatius,</hi> to whom he addresses the first Satire, his hunting after Business, and following the Court, as well as in the Persecutor <hi>Crispinus,</hi> his impertinence and importunity. 'Tis true, he exposes <hi>Crispinus</hi> openly, as a common Nuisance: But he ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies the other, as a Friend, more finely. The Exhortations of <hi>Persius</hi> are confin'd to Noblemen: And the Stoick Philosophy, is that alone, which he recommends to them: <hi>Iuvenal</hi> Exhorts to particular Virtues, as they are oppos'd to those Vices against which he declaims: But <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> laughs to shame, all Follies, and insinuates Virtue, rather by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Examples, than by the severity of Precepts.</p>
                  <p>This last Consideration seems to incline the Ballance on the side of <hi>Horace,</hi> and to give him the preference to <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> not only in Profit, but in Pleasure. But, after all, I must confess, that the Delight which <hi>Horace</hi> gives me, is but languishing. Be pleas'd still to understand, that I speak of my own Taste only: He may Ravish other Men; but I am too stupid and insensible, to be tickl'd. Where he barely grins him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> says, only shews his white Teeth, he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me to any Laughter. His Urbanity, that is, his Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are to be commended, but his Wit is faint; and his Salt, if I may dare to say so, almost insipid. <hi>Iuvenal</hi> is of a more vigorous and Masculine Wit, he gives me as much Pleasure as I can bear: He fully satisfies my Expectation, he Treats his Subject home: His Spleen is rais'd, and he raises mine: I have the Pleasure of Concernment in all he says; He drives his Reader along with him; and when he is at the end of his way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I willingly stop with him: If he went another Stage, it wou'd be too far, it wou'd make a Journey of a Progress, and turn Delight into Fatigue. When he gives over, 'tis a sign the Subject is exhausted; and the Wit of Man can carry it no farther. If a Fault can be justly found in him;
'tis that he is sometimes too luxuriant, too redundant; says more than he needs, like my Friend the <hi>Plain Dealer,</hi> but never more than pleases. Add to this, that his Thoughts are as just as those of <hi>Horace,</hi> and much
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:62894:25"/> more Elevated. His Expressions are Sonorous and more Noble; his Verse more numerous, and his Words are suitable to his Thoughts; sublime and lofty. All these contribute to the Pleasure of the Reader, and the greater the Soul of him who Reads, his Transports are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Horace</hi> is always on the Amble, <hi>Iuvenal</hi> on the Gallop: But his way is perpetually on Carpet Ground. He goes with more impetuosity than <hi>Horace;</hi> but as securely; and the swiftness adds a more lively agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Spirits. The low Style of <hi>Horace,</hi> is according to his Subject; that is generally groveling. I question not but he cou'd have rais'd it. For the First Epistle of the Second Book, which he writes to <hi>Augustus,</hi> (a most instructive Satire concerning Poetry,) is of so much Dignity in the Words, and of so much Elegancy in the Numbers, that the Author plainly shews, the <hi>Sermo Pedestris,</hi> in his other Satires, was rather his Choice than his Necessity. He was a Rival to <hi>Lucilius</hi> his Predecessor; and was resolv'd to surpass him in his own Manner. <hi>Lucilius,</hi> as we see by his remaining Fragments, minded neither his Style nor his Numbers, nor his purity of words, nor his run of Verse. <hi>Horace</hi> therefore copes with him in that humble way of Satire. Writes under his own force, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a dead Weight, that he may match his Competitor in the Race. This I imagine was the chief Reason, why he minded only the clearness of his Satire, and the cleanness of Expression, without ascending to those heights, to which his own vigour might have carri'd him. But limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his desires only to the Conquest of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> he had his Ends of his Rival, who liv'd before him; but made way for a new Conquest over himself, by <hi>Iuvenal</hi> his Successor. He cou'd not give an equal pleasure to his Reader, because he us'd not equal Instruments. The fault was in the Tools, and not in the Workman. But Versification, and Numbers, are the greatest Pleasures of Poetry: <hi>Virgil</hi> knew it, and practis'd both so happily; that for ought I know, his greatest Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is in his Diction. In all other parts of Poetry, he is faultless; but in this he plac'd his chief perfection. And give me leave, my Lord, since I have here an apt occasion, to say, that <hi>Virgil,</hi> cou'd have written sharper Satires, than either <hi>Horace</hi> or <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> if he wou'd have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his Talent, that way. I will produce a Verse and half of his, in one of his Eclogues, to justifie my Opinion: And with <hi>Comma's</hi> after every Word, to shew, that he has given almost as many lashes, as he has written Syllables. 'Tis against a bad Poet; whose ill Verses he describes. <hi>Non tu, in triviis, indocte, solebas, stridenti, miserum, stipula, disperdere carmen?</hi> But to return to my purpose, when there is any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in Numbers, and Sound, the Reader is uneasie, and unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd; he wants something of his Complement, desires somewhat which he finds not: And this being the manifest defect of <hi>Horace,</hi> 'tis no wonder, that finding it supply'd in <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> we are more Delighted with him. And besides this, the Sauce of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> is more poignant, to create in us an Appetite of Reading him. The Meat of <hi>Horace</hi> is more nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing; but the Cookery of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> more exquisite; so that, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Horace</hi> to be the more general Philosopher; we cannot deny, that <hi>Iuvenal</hi> was the greater Poet, I mean in Satire. His Thoughts are sharper, his Indignation against Vice is more vehement; his Spirit has more of the Commonwealth Genius; he treats Tyranny, and all the Vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:62894:25"/> Slave, and a Man who is often afraid of Laughing in the right place: Who is ever decent, because he is naturally servile. After all, <hi>Horace</hi> had the disadvantage of the Times in which he liv'd; they were better for the Man, but worse for the Satirist. 'Tis generally said, that those Enormous Vices, which were practis'd under the Reign of <hi>Domitian,</hi> were unknown in the Time of <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> That therefore <hi>Iuvenal</hi> had a larger Field, than <hi>Horace.</hi> Little Follies were out of doors, when Oppression was to be scourg'd instead of Avarice: It was no longer time to turn into Ridicule, the false Opinions of Philosophers; when the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty was to be asserted. There was more need of a <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Days, to redeem or mend, than of a <hi>Horace,</hi> if he had then been Living, to Laugh at a Fly-Catcher. This Reflection at the same time excuses <hi>Horace,</hi> but exalts <hi>Iuvenal.</hi> I have ended, before I was aware, the Comparison of <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> upon the Topiques of Instruction and Delight; and indeed I may safely here conclude that common-place: For if we make <hi>Horace</hi> our Minister of State in Satire, and <hi>Iuvenal</hi> of our private Pleasures: I think the latter has no ill bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of it. Let Profit have the preheminence of Honour, in the End of Poetry. Pleasure, though but the second in degree, is the first in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And who wou'd not chuse to be lov'd better, rather than to be more esteem'd? But I am enter'd already upon another Topique; which concerns the particular Merits of these two Satirists. However, I will pursue my business where I left it: And carry it farther than that common observation of the several Ages, in which these Authors Flourish'd. When <hi>Horace</hi> writ his Satires, the Monarchy of his <hi>Caesar</hi> was in its newness; and the Government but just made easie to the Conquer'd People. They cou'd not possibly have forgotten the Usurpation of that Prince upon their Freedom, nor the violent Methods which he had us'd, in the compassing of that vast Design: They yet remember'd his Proscriptions, and the Slaughter of so many Noble <hi>Romans,</hi> their Defendors. Amongst the rest, that horrible Action of his, when he forc'd <hi>Livia</hi> from the Arms of her Husband, who was constrain'd to see her Marry'd, as <hi>Dion</hi> relates the Story; and, big with Child as she was, convey'd to the Bed of his insulting Rival. The same <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> gives us another instance of the Crime before mention'd: That <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Sisenna,</hi> being reproach'd in full Senate, with the Licentious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Wife, return'd this Answer; That he had Marry'd her by the Counsel of <hi>Augustus:</hi> Intimating, says my Author, that <hi>Augustus</hi> had oblig'd him to that Marriage, that he might, under that covert, have the more free access to her. His Adulteries were still before their Eyes, but they must be patient, where they had not power. In other things that Emperor was Moderate enough: Propriety was generally secur'd; and the People entertain'd with publick Shows, and Donatives, to make them more easily digest their lost Liberty. But <hi>Augustus,</hi> who was conscious to himself, of so many Crimes which he had committed, thought in the first place to provide for his own Reputation, by making an Edict against Lampoons and Satires, and the Authors of those defamatory Writings, which my Author <hi>Tacitus,</hi> from the Law-Term, calls <hi>famosos libellos.</hi>

                  <p>From hence I may reasonably conclude, That <hi>Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

However he was not the proper Man to arraign great Vices, at least if the Stories which we hear of him are true, that he Practis'd
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:62894:26"/> some, which I will not here mention, out of honour to him. It was not for a <hi>Clodius</hi> to accuse Adulterers, especially when <hi>Augustus</hi> was of that number: So that though his Age was not exempted from the worst of Villanies, there was no freedom left to reprehend them, by reason of the Edict. And our Poet was not fit to represent them in an odious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, because himself was dipt in the same Actions. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, without farther insisting on the different tempers of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> I conclude, that the Subjects which <hi>Horace</hi> chose for Satire, are of a lower nature than those of which <hi>Iuvenal</hi> has written.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have treated in a new Method, the Comparison betwixt <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, Iuvenal,</hi> and <hi>Persius;</hi> somewhat of their particular manner belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all of them is yet remaining to be consider'd. <hi>Persius</hi> was Grave, and particularly oppos'd his Gravity to Lewdness, which was the Predominant, Vice in <hi>Nero's</hi> Court, at the time when he publish'd his Satires, which was before that Emperour fell into the excess of Cruelty. <hi>Horace</hi> was a Mild Admonisher, a Court Satirist, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> for the gentle Times of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and more fit, for the Reasons which I have already given. <hi>Iuvenal</hi> was as proper for his Times, as they for theirs. His was an Age that deserv'd a more severe Chastisement. Vices were more gross and open, more flagitious, more encourag'd by the Example of a Tyrant; and more protected by his Authority. Therefore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>Iuvenal</hi> mentions <hi>Nero,</hi> he means <hi>Domitian,</hi> whom he dares not attack in his own Person, but Scourges him by Proxy. <hi>Heinsius</hi> urges in praise of <hi>Horace,</hi> that according to the Ancient Art and Law of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, it shou'd be nearer to Comedy, than to Tragedy; Not declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against Vice, but only laughing at it.

&amp;c. So that they thought the imitation of <hi>Lucilius</hi> was more proper to their purpose than that of <hi>Horace.</hi> They chang'd Satire, says <hi>Holiday;</hi> but they chang'd it for the better: For the business being to Reform great Vices, Chastisement goes farther than Admonition; whereas a perpetual Grinn, like that of <hi>Horace,</hi> does rather anger than amend a Man.</p>

                     </hi> had not enough consider'd this, when they attempted <hi>Iuvenal:</hi> But I forbear Reflections; only I beg leave to take notice of this Sentence, where <hi>Holiday</hi> says, <hi>A perpetual Grinn, like that of</hi> Horace, <hi>rather angers than amends a Man.</hi> I cannot give him up the Manner of <hi>Horace</hi> in low Satire so easily: Let the Chastisements of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> be never so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for his new kind of Satire; let him declaim as wittily and sharply as he pleases, yet still the nicest and most delicate touches of Satire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in fine Raillery. This, my Lord, is your particular Talent, to which even <hi>Iuvenal</hi> could not arrive. 'Tis not Reading, 'tis not imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:62894:27"/> of an Author, which can produce this fineness: It must be inborn, it must proceed from a Genius, and particular way of thinking, which is not to be taught; and therefore not to be imitated by him who has it not from Nature: How easie it is to call Rogue and Villain, and that wittily? But how hard to make a Man appear a Fool, a Blockhead, or a Knave, without using any of those opprobrious terms? To spare the grossness of the Names, and to do the thing yet more severely, is to draw a full Face, and to make the Nose and Cheeks stand out, and yet not to employ any depth of Shadowing. This is the Mystery of that Noble Trade; which yet no Master can teach to his Apprentice: He may give the Rules, but the Scholar is never the nearer in his practice. Neither is it true, that this fineness of Raillery is offensive. A witty Man is tickl'd while he is hurt in this manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Fool feels it not. The occasion of an Offence may possibly be given, but he cannot take it. If it be granted that in effect this way does more Mischief; that a Man is secretly wounded, and though he be not sensible himself, yet the malicious World will find it for him: Yet there is still a vast differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt the slovenly Butchering of a Man, and the fineness of a stroak that separates the Head from the Body, and leaves it standing in its place. A man may be capable, as <hi>Iack Ketche</hi>'s Wife said of his Servant, of a plain piece of Work, a bare Hanging; but to make a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor die sweetly, was only belonging to her Husband. I wish I cou'd apply it to my self, if the Reader wou'd be kind enough to think it belongs to me. The Character of <hi>Zimri</hi> in my <hi>Absalom,</hi> is, in my Opinion, worth the whole Poem: 'Tis not bloody, but 'tis ridiculous enough. And he for whom it was intended, was too witty to resent it as an injury. If I had rail'd, I might have suffer'd for it justly: But I manag'd my own Work more happily, perhaps more dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously. I avoided the mention of great Crimes, and apply'd my self to the representing of Blind-sides, and little Extravagancies: To which, the wittier a Man is, he is generally the more obnoxious. It succeeded as I wish'd; the Jest went round, and he was laught at in his turn who began the Frolick.</p>
                  <p>And thus, My Lord, you see I have preferr'd the Manner of <hi>Horace,</hi> and of your Lordship, in this kind of Satire, to that of <hi>Iuvenal;</hi> and I think, reasonably. <hi>Holiday</hi> ought not to have Arraign'd so Great an Author, for that which was his Excellency and his Merit: Or if he did, on such a palpable mistake, he might expect, that some one might possibly arise, either in his own Time, or after him, to rectifie his Error, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store to <hi>Horace,</hi> that Commendation, of which he has so unjustly robb'd him. And let the Manes of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> forgive me, if I say, that this way of <hi>Horace</hi> was the best, for amending Manners, as it is the most difficult. His was, an <hi>Ense rescindendum;</hi> but that of <hi>Horace</hi> was a Pleasant Cure, with all the Limbs preserv'd entire: And as our <hi>Mountebanks</hi> tell us in their Bills, without keeping the Patient within Doors for a Day. What they promise only, <hi>Horace</hi> has effectually Perform'd: Yet I contradict not the Proposition which I formerly advanc'd: <hi>Iuvenal</hi>'s Times requir'd a more painful kind of Operation: But if he had liv'd in the Age of <hi>Horace,</hi> I must needs affirm, that he had it not about him. He took the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which was prescrib'd him by his own Genius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was sharp and eager; he cou'd not Rally, but he cou'd Declame: And as his provocations were great, he has reveng'd them Tragically. This notwithstanding, I
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:62894:27"/> am to say another Word, which, as true as it is, will yet displease the partial Admirers of our <hi>Horace.</hi> I have hinted it before; but tis time for me now to speak more plainly.</p>
                  <p>This Manner of <hi>Horace</hi> is indeed the best; but <hi>Horace</hi> has not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted it, altogether so happily, at least not often. The Manner of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> is confess'd to be Inferior to the former; but <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> has excell'd him in his Performance. <hi>Iuvenal</hi> has rail'd more wittily than <hi>Horace</hi> has rally'd. <hi>Horace</hi> means to make his Reader Laugh; but he is not sure of his Experiment. <hi>Iuvenal</hi> always intends to move your Indignation; and he always brings about his purpose. <hi>Horace,</hi> for ought I know, might have tickl'd the People of his Age; but amongst the Moderns he is not so Successfull. They who say he Entertains so Pleasantly, may perhaps value themselves on the quickness of their own Understandings, that they can see a Jest farther off than other men.

But it may be Puns were then in Fashion, as they were Wit in the Sermons of the last Age, and in the Court of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.

                  <p>But I have already wearied my self, and doubt not but I have tir'd your Lordships Patience, with this long rambling, and I fear, trivial Discourse.

And whether it be any dishonour to <hi>Horace,</hi> to be thus surpass'd; since no Art, or Science, is at once begun and perfected, but that it must pass first through many hands, and even through seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages? If <hi>Lucilius</hi> cou'd add to <hi>Ennius,</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> to <hi>Lucilius,</hi> why, without any diminution to the Fame of <hi>Horace,</hi> might not <hi>Iuvenal</hi> give
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:62894:28"/> the last perfection to that Work? Or rather, what disreputation is it to <hi>Horace,</hi> that <hi>Iuvenal</hi> Excels in the Tragical Satyre, as <hi>Horace</hi> does in the Comical? I have read over attentively, both <hi>Heinsius</hi> and <hi>Dacier,</hi> in their Commendations of <hi>Horace:</hi> But I can find no more in either of them, for the preference of him to <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> than the Instructive Part; the Part of Wisdom, and not that of Pleasure; which therefore is here allow'd him, notwithstanding what <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Rigaltius</hi> have pleaded to the contrary for <hi>Iuvenal.</hi> And to shew I am Impartial, I will here Translate what <hi>Dacier</hi> has said on that Subject.</p>
                  <p>I cannot give a more just Idea of the Two Books of Satires, made by <hi>Horace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> than by compairing them to the Statues of the <hi>Sileni,</hi> to which <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

They were Figures, which had nothing of agreeable, nothing of Beauty on their out-side: But when any one took the Pains to open them, and search into them, he there found the Figures of all the Deities So, in the Shape that <hi>Horace</hi> Presents himself to us, in his Satires, we see nothing at the first View, which deserves our Attention. It seems that he is rather an Amusement for Children, than for the serious consideration of Men. But when we take away his Crust, and that which hides him from our sight; when we discover him to the bottom, then we find all the Divinities in a full Assembly: That is to say, all the Virtues, which ought to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual exercise of those, who seriously endeavour to Correct their Vices.</p>
                  <p>'Tis easy to Observe, that <hi>Dacier,</hi> in this Noble Similitude, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd the Praise of his Author, wholly to the Instructive Part: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation turns on this, and so does that which follows.</p>
                  <p>In these Two Books of Satire, 'tis the business of <hi>Horace</hi> to instruct us how to combat our Vices, to regulate our Passions, to follow Nature, to give Bounds to our desires, to Distinguish betwixt Truth and Falshood, and betwixt our Conceptions of Things, and Things themselves. To come back from our prejudicate Opinions, to understand exactly the Principles and Motives of all our Actions; and to avoid the Ridicule, into which all men necessarily fall, who are Intoxicated with those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they have received from their Masters; and which they obstinately retain, without examining whether or no they are founded on right Reason.</p>
                  <p>In a Word, he labours to render us happy in relation to our selves, agreeable and faithful to our Friends, and discreet, serviceable, and well bred in relation to those with whom we are oblig'd to live, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. To make his Figures Intelligible, to conduct his Readers through the Labyrinth of some perplex'd Sentence, or obscure Parenthesis, is no great matter. And as <hi>Epictetus</hi> says, there is nothing of Beauty in all this, or what is worthy of a Prudent Man. The Principal business, and which is of most Importance to us, is to shew the Use, the Reason, and the Proof of his Precepts.</p>
                  <p>They who endeavour not to correct themselves, according to so exact a Model; are just like the Patients, who have open before them a Book of Admirable Receipts, for their Diseases, and please themselves with reading it, without Comprehending the Nature of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; or how to apply them to their Cure.</p>
                  <p>Let <hi>Horace</hi> go off with these Enco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And thus, I have given the History of Satire, and deriv'd it as far as from <hi>Ennius,</hi> to your Lordship; that is, from its first Rudiments of Barbarity, to its last Polishing and Perfection: Which is, with <hi>Virgil,</hi> in his Address to <hi>Augustus;</hi>

                     </q> I said only from <hi>Ennius;</hi> but I may safely carry it higher, as far as <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Andronicus;</hi> who, as I have said formerly, taught the first Play at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year <hi>ab urbe conditâ,</hi> 514. I have since desir'd my Learn'd Friend, Mr. <hi>Maidwell,</hi> to compute the difference of Times, betwixt <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> and <hi>Livius Andronicus;</hi> and he assures me, from the best Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers, that <hi>Plutus,</hi> the last of <hi>Aristophanes</hi>'s his Plays, was Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Athens,</hi> in the Year of the 97th Olympiad; which agrees with the Year <hi>Vrbis Conditae</hi> 364: So that the difference of Years betwixt <hi>Aristophanes</hi> and <hi>Andronicus</hi> is 150; from whence I have probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, that <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi> who was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> had read the Plays of the Old Comedy, which were Satyrical, and also of the New; for <hi>Menander</hi> was fifty Years before him, which must needs be a great light to him, in his own Plays; that were of the Satirical Nature. That the <hi>Romans</hi> had Farces before this, 'tis true; but then they had no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with <hi>Greece:</hi> So that <hi>Andronicus</hi> was the first, who wrote after the manner of the Old Comedy, in his Plays; he was imitated by <hi>Ennius,</hi> about Thirty Years afterwards.

                     <pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:62894:29"/>'Tis but necessary, that after so much has been said of Satire, some Definition of it should be given. <hi>Heinsius,</hi> in his Dissertations on <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi> makes it for me, in these words; <hi>Satire is a kind of Poetry, without a Series of Action, invented for the purging of our Minds; in which Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Vices, Ignorance, and Errors, and all things besides, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd from them, in every Man, are severely Reprehended; partly Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically, partly Simply, and sometimes in both kinds of speaking; but for the most part Figuratively, and Occultly; consisting in a low familiar way, chiefly in a sharp and pungent manner of Speech; but partly, also, in a Facetious and Civil way of Iesting; by which, either Hatred, or Laughter, or Indignation is mov'd.</hi>—Where I cannot but observe, that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and perplex'd Definition, or rather Description of Satire, is wholly accommodated to the <hi>Horatian</hi> way; and excluding the Works of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ius,</hi> as foreign from that kind of Poem: The Clause in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it (without a Series of Action) distinguishes Satire properly from Stage-Plays, which are all of one Action, and one continu'd Series of Action. The End or Scope of Satire is to purge the Passions; so far it is common to the Satires of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Persius:</hi> The rest which follows, is also generally belonging to all three; till he comes upon us, with the Excluding Clause (<hi>consisting in a low familiar way of Speech</hi>) which is the proper Character of <hi>Horace;</hi> and from which, the other two, for their Honour be it spoken, are far distant. But how come Lowness of Style, and the Familiarity of Words to be so much the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Satire, that without them, a Poet can be no more a Satirist, than without Risibility he can be a Man? Is the fault of <hi>Horace</hi> to be made the Virtue, and Standing Rule of this Poem? Is the <hi>Grande Sophos</hi> of <hi>Persius,</hi> and the Sublimity of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> to be circumscrib'd, with the meanness of Words and vulgarity of Expression? If <hi>Horace</hi> refus'd the pains of Numbers, and the loftiness of Figures, are they bound to follow so ill a Precedent? Let him walk a Foot with his Pad in his Hand, for his own pleasure; but let not them be accounted no Poets, who choose to mount, and shew their Horsmanship, <hi>Holiday</hi> is not afraid to say, that there was never such a fall, as from his Odes to his Satires, and that he, injuriously to himself, untun'd his Harp.

Which Alteration, says <hi>Holiday,</hi> is to after-times, as good a Warrant as the first. Has not <hi>Virgil</hi> chang'd the Manners of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Hero's in his <hi>Aeneis?</hi> certainly he has, and for the better. For <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Age was more Civiliz'd, and better Bred; and he writ according to the Politeness of <hi>Rome,</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Augustus Caesar;</hi> not to the Rudeness of <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Age, or the Times of <hi>Homer.</hi> Why shou'd we offer to confine free Spirits to one Form, when we cannot so much as confine our Bodies to one Fashion of Apparel? Wou'd not <hi>Donn</hi>'s Satires, which abound with so much Wit, appear more Charming, if he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care of his Words, and of his Numbers? But he follow'd <hi>Horace</hi> so very close, that of necessity he must fall with him: And I may safely say it of this present Age, That if we are not so great Wits as <hi>Donn,</hi> yet, certainly, we are better Poets.</p>
                  <p>But I have said enough, and it may be, too much on this Subject. Will your Lordship be pleas'd to prolong my Audience, only so far, till I tell you my own trivial Thoughts, how a Modern Satire shou'd be made. I will not deviate in the least from the Precepts and Examples
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:62894:29"/> of the Ancients, who were always our best Masters. I will only illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate them, and discover some of the hidden Beauties in their Designs, that we thereby may form our own in imitation of them. Will you please but to observe, that <hi>Persius,</hi> the least in Dignity of all the Three, has, notwithstanding, been the first, who has discover'd to us this important Secret, in the designing of a perfect Satire; that it ought only to treat of one Subject; to be confin'd to one particular Theme; or, at least, to one principally. If other Vices occur in the management of the Chief, they shou'd only be transiently lash'd, and not be insisted on, so as to make the Design double. As in a Play of the <hi>English</hi> Fashion, which we call a <hi>Tragecomedy,</hi> there is to be but one main Design: And tho' there be an Under-plot, or Second Walk of Comical Characters and Adventures, yet they are subservient to the Chief Fable, carry'd along under it, and helping to it; so that the <hi>Drama</hi> may not seem a Monster with two Heads. Thus the <hi>Copernican</hi> Systeme of the Planets makes the Moon to be mov'd by the motion of the Earth, and carry'd about her Orb, as a Dependant of hers: <hi>Mascardi</hi> in his Discourse of the <hi>Doppia favola,</hi> or Double-tale in Plays, gives an Instance of it, in the famous Pastoral of <hi>Guarini,</hi> call'd <hi>Il Pastor Fido;</hi> where <hi>Corisca</hi> and the Satyre are the Under-parts: Yet we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that <hi>Corisca</hi> is brought into the Body of the Plot, and made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to it. 'Tis certain, that the Divine Wit of <hi>Horace,</hi> was not ignorant of this Rule, that a Play, though it consists of many parts, must yet be one in the Action, and must drive on the Accomplishment of one Design; for he gives this very Precept, <hi>Sit quodvis simplex duntaxat &amp; unum;</hi> yet he seems not much to mind it in his Satires, many of them consisting of more Arguments than one; and the second without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the first. <hi>Casaubon</hi> has observ'd this before me, in his Preference of <hi>Persius</hi> to <hi>Horace:</hi> And will have his own belov'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to be the first, who found out, and introduc'd this Method of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining himself to one Subject. I know it may be urg'd in defence of <hi>Horace,</hi> that this Unity is not necessary; because the very word <hi>Satura</hi> signifies a Dish plentifully stor'd with all variety of Fruits and Grains. Yet <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> who calls his Poems a <hi>Farrago,</hi> which is a word of the same signification with <hi>Satura;</hi> has chosen to follow the same Method of <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ius,</hi> and not of <hi>Horace:</hi> And <hi>Boileau,</hi> whose Example alone is a sufficient Authority, has wholly confin'd himself, in all his Satires, to this Unity of Design. That variety which is not to be found in any one Satire, is, at least, in many, written on several occasions. And if Variety be of absolute necessity in every one of them, according to the Etymology of the word; yet it may arise naturally from one Subject, as it is diversly treated, in the several Subordinate Branches of it; all relating to the Chief. It may be illustrated accordingly with variety of Examples in the Subdivisions of it; and with as many Precepts as there are Members of it; which altogether may compleat that <hi>Olla,</hi> or Hotch-potch, which is properly a Satire.</p>
                  <p>Under this Unity of Theme, or Subject, is comprehended another Rule for perfecting the Design of true Satire. The Poet is bound, and that <hi>ex Officio,</hi> to give his Reader some one Precept of Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and to caution him against some one particular Vice or Folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Other Virtues, subordinate to the first, may be recommended, under that Chief Head; and other Vices or Follies may be scourg'd, besides that which he principally intends. But he is chiefly to inculcate one
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:62894:30"/> Virtue, and insist on that. Thus <hi>Iuvenal</hi> in every Satire, excepting the first, tyes himself to one principal Instructive Point, or to the shunning of Moral Evil. Even in the Sixth, which seems only an Arraignment of the whole Sex of Womankind; there is a latent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to avoid Ill Women, by shewing how very few, who are Virtuous and Good, are to be found amongst them. But this, tho' the Wittiest of all his Satires, has yet the least of Truth or Instruction in it. He has run himself into his old declamatory way, and almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, that he was now setting up for a Moral Poet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Persius</hi> is never wanting to us in some profitable Doctrine, and in exposing the opposite Vices to it. His kind of Philosphy is one, which is the Stoique; and every Satire is a Comment on one particular <hi>Dogma</hi> of that Sect; unless we will except the first, which is against bad Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and yet ev'n there he forgets not the Precepts of the <hi>Porch.</hi> In general, all Virtues are every where to be prais'd, and recommended to Practice; and all Vices to be reprehended, and made either Odious or Ridiculous; or else there is a Fundamental Error in the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
                  <p>I have already declar'd, who are the only Persons that are the Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Object of Private Satire, and who they are that may properly be expos'd by Name for publick Examples of Vices and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>; and therefore I will trouble your Lordship no farther with them. Of the best and finest manner of Satire, I have said enough in the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betwixt <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Horace:</hi> 'Tis that sharp, well-manner'd way, of laughing a Folly out of Countenance, of which your Lordship is the best Master in this Age. I will proceed to the Versification, which is most proper for it, and add somewhat to what I have said already on that Subject. The sort of Verse which is call'd <hi>Burlesque,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Eight Syllables, or Four Feet, is that which our Excellent <hi>Hudibras</hi> has chosen. I ought to have mention'd him before, when I spoke of <hi>Donn;</hi> but by a slip of an Old Man's Memory he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. The Worth of his Poem is too well known to need my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and he is above my Censure: His Satire is of the <hi>Varronian</hi> kind, though unmix'd with Prose. The choice of his Numbers is sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table enough to his Design, as he has manag'd it. But in any other Hand, the shortness of his Verse, and the quick returns of Rhyme, had debas'd the Dignity of Style. And besides, the double Rhyme, (a necessary Companion of Burlesque Writing) is not so proper for Manly Satire, for it turns Earnest too much to Jest, and gives us a Boyish kind of Pleasure. It tickles aukwardly with a kind of pain, to the best sort of Readers; we are pleas'd ungratefully, and, if I may say so, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our liking. We thank him not for giving us that unseasonable Delight, when we know he cou'd have given us a better, and more solid. He might have left that Task to others, who not being able to put in Thought, can only make us grin with the Excrescence of a Word of two or three Syllables in the Close. 'Tis, indeed, below so great a Master to make use of such a little Instrument. But his good Sense is perpetually shining through all he writes; it affords us not the time of finding Faults: We pass through the Levity of his Rhyme, and are immediately carri'd into some admirable useful Thought. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, he has chosen this kind of Verse; and has written the best in it: And had he taken another, he wou'd always have excell'd. As we say of a Court-Favourite, that whatsoever his Office be, he still makes it uppermost, and most beneficial to himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:62894:30"/>The quickness of your Imagination, my Lord, has already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me; and you know before-hand, that I wou'd prefer the Verse of ten Syllables, which we call the <hi>English</hi> Heroique, to that of Eight. This is truly my Opinion. For this sort of Number is more Roomy. The Thought can turn it self with greater ease, in a larger compass. When the Rhyme comes too thick upon us; it streightens the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; we are thinking of the Close, when we shou'd be employ'd in adorning the Thought. It makes a Poet giddy with turning in a Space too narrow for his Imagination. He loses many Beauties without gaining one Advantage. For a Burlesque Rhyme, I have already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be none; or if it were, 'tis more easily purchas'd in Ten Syllables than in Eight: In both occasions 'tis as in a Tennis-Court, when the Strokes of greater force, are given, when we strike out, and play at length. <hi>Tassone</hi> and <hi>Boileau</hi> have left us the best Examples of this way, in the <hi>Secchia Rapita,</hi> and the <hi>Lutrin.</hi> And next them <hi>Merlin Coccajus</hi> in his <hi>Baldus.</hi> I will speak only of the two former, because the last is written in Latin Verse. The <hi>Secchia Rapita,</hi> is an Italian Poem; a Satire of the <hi>Varronian</hi> kind. 'Tis written in the Stanza of Eight, which is their Measure for Heroique Verse. The Words are stately, the Numbers smooth, the Turn both of Thoughts and Words is happy. The first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ix lines of the Stanza seem Majestical and Severe: but the two last turn them all, into a pleasant Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule. <hi>Boileau,</hi> if I am not much deceiv'd, has model'd from hence, his famous <hi>Lutrin.</hi> He had read the Burlesque Poetry of <hi>Scarron,</hi> with some kind of Indignation, as witty as it was, and found nothing in <hi>France</hi> that was worthy of his Imitation. But he Copy'd the <hi>Italian</hi> so well, that his own may pass for an Original. He writes it in the <hi>French</hi> Heroique Verse, and calls it an Heroique Poem: His Subject is Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial, but his Verse is Noble. I doubt not but he had <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Eye, for we find many admirable Imitations of him, and some <hi>Parodies;</hi> as particularly this Passage in the Fourth of the <hi>En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This, I think, my Lord, to be the most Beautiful, and most Noble kind of Satire.

I cou'd say somewhat more of the Delicacy of this and some other of his Satires; but it might turn to his Prejudice, if 'twere carry'd back to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have given Your Lordship, but this bare hint, in what Verse, and in what manner this sort of Satire may best be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd. Had I time, I cou'd enlarge on the Beautiful Turns of Words and Thoughts; which are as requisite in this, as in Heroique Poetry it self; of which this Satire is undoubtedly a Species. With these Beautiful Turns I confess my self to have been unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till about Twenty Years ago, in a Conversation which I had with that Noble Wit of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Sir <hi>George Mackenzy:</hi> He asked me why I did not imitate in my Verses, the turns of Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Denham;</hi> of which, he repeated many to me: I had often read with pleasure, and with some profit, those two Fathers of our English Poetry; but had not seriously enough consider'd those Beauties which give the last perfection to their Works. Some sprinklings of this kind, I had also formerly in my Plays, but they were casual, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd. But this hint, thus seasonably given me, first made me sensible of my own wants, and brought me afterwards to seek for the supply of them in other <hi>English</hi> Authors. I look'd over the Darling of my youth, the Famous <hi>Cowley;</hi> there I found instead of them, the Points of Wit, and Quirks of Epigram, even in the <hi>Davideis,</hi> a Heroick Poem, which is of an opposite nature to those <hi>Puerilities;</hi> but no Elegant turns, either on the word, or on the thought. Then I consulted a Greater Genius,
(without offence to the Manes of that Noble Author) I mean <hi>Milton.</hi> But as he endeavours every where to express <hi>Homer,</hi> whose Age had not arriv'd to that fineness, I found in him a true sublimity, lofty thoughts, which were cloath'd with admirable <hi>Grecisms,</hi> and ancient words, which he had been digging from the Mines of <hi>Chaucer,</hi> and of <hi>Spencer,</hi> and which, with all their rusticity, had somewhat of Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in them. But I found not there neither that for which I look'd. At last I had recourse to his Master, <hi>Spencer,</hi> the Author of that immortal Poem, call'd the <hi>Fairy-Queen;</hi> and there I met with that which I had been looking for so long in vain. <hi>Spencer</hi> had studi'd <hi>Virgil</hi> to as much advantage as <hi>Milton</hi> had done <hi>Homer.</hi> And amongst the rest of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies had Copy'd that. Looking farther into the <hi>Italian,</hi> I found <hi>Tasso</hi> had done the same; nay more, that all the Sonne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> some Gentlemen who have succeeded very happily in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking;
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:62894:32"/> let their Excellencies attone for my Imperfections, and those of my Sons. I have perus'd some of the Satires, which are done by other Hands: And they seem to me as perfect in their kind, as any thing I have seen in English Verse. The common way which we have taken, is not a Literal Translation, but a kind of Paraphrase; or somewhat which is yet more loose, betwixt a Paraphrase and Imitation. It was not possible for us, or any Men, to have made it pleasant, any other way. If rendring the exact Sense of these Authors, almost line for line<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been our business, <hi>Barten Holiday</hi> had done it already to our hands: And, by the help of his Learned Notes and Illustrations, not only of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> and <hi>Persius,</hi> but what yet is more obscure, his own Verses might be understood.</p>
                  <p>But he wrote for Fame, and wrote to Scholars: We write only for the Pleasure and Entertainment, of those Gentlemen and Ladies, who tho they are not Scholars are not Ignorant: Persons of Understanding and good Sense; who not having been conversant in the Original, or at least not having made <hi>Latine</hi> Verse so much their business, as to be Critiques in it, wou'd be glad to find, if the Wit of our Two great Authors, be answerable to their Fame, and Reputation in the World. We have therefore endeavour'd to give the Publick all the Satisfaction we are able in this kind.</p>
                  <p>And if we are not altogether so faithful to our Author, as our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours <hi>Holiday</hi> and <hi>Stapylton,</hi> yet we may Challenge to our selves this praise, that we shall be far more pleasing to our Readers. We have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd our Authors, at greater distance; tho' not Step by Step, as they have done. For oftentimes they have gone so close, that they have trod on the Heels of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Persius;</hi> and hurt them by their too near approach. A Noble Authour wou'd not be persu'd too close by a Translator. We lose his Spirit, when we think to take his Body. The grosser Part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with us, but the Soul is flown away, in some Noble Expression or some delicate turn of Words, or Thought. Thus <hi>Holiday,</hi> who made this way his choice, seiz'd the meaning of <hi>Iuvenal;</hi> but the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has always scap'd him.</p>
                  <p>They who will not grant me, that Pleasure is one of the Ends of Poetry, but that it is only a means of compassing the only end, which is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; must yet allow that without the means of Pleasure, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction is but a bare and dry Philosophy. A crude preparation of Morals, which we may have from <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Epictetus,</hi> with more profit than from any Poet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither <hi>Holiday</hi> nor <hi>Stapylton,</hi> have imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> in the Poetical part of him, his Diction and his Elocution. Nor had they been Poets, as neither of them were; yet in the way they took, it was impossible for them to have Succeeded in the Poetique part.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>English</hi> Verse, which we call Heroique, consists of no more than Ten Syllables; the <hi>Latine</hi> Hexameter sometimes rises to Seventeen; as for example, this Verse in <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     <q>Pulverulenta putrem sonitu quatit ungula Campum.</q> Here is the difference, of no less than Seven Syllables in a line, betwixt the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Latine.</hi> Now the Medium of these, is about Fourteen Syllables; because the Dactyle is a more frequent foot in Hexameters than the Spondee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:62894:32"/>But <hi>Holiday,</hi> without considering that he Writ with the disadvantage of Four Syllables less in every Verse, endeavours to make one of his Lines, to comprehend the Sense of one of <hi>Iuvenal</hi>'s. According to the falsity of the Proposition, was the Success. He was forc'd to crowd his Verse with ill sounding Monosyllables, of which our Barbarous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage affords him a wild plenty: And by that means he arriv'd at his Pedantick end, which was to make a literal Translation: His Verses have nothing of Verse in them, but only the worst part of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Rhyme: And that, into the bargain, is far from good. But which is more Intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by cramming his ill chosen, and worse sounding Monosyllables so close together; the very Sense which he endeavours to explain, is become more obscure, than that of his Author. So that <hi>Holiday</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self cannot be understood, without as large a Commentary, as that which he makes on his Two Authours. For my own part, I can make a shift to find the meaning of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> without his Notes: but his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation is more difficult than his Authour. And I find Beauties in the <hi>Latine</hi> to recompence my Pains; but in <hi>Holiday</hi> and <hi>Stapylton,</hi> my Ears, in the First Place, are mortally o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ended; and then their Sense is so perplex'd, that I return to the Original, as the more pleasing task, as well as the more easy.</p>
                  <p>This must be said for our Translation, that if we give not the whole Sense of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> yet we give the most considerable Part of it: We give it, in General, so clearly, that few Notes are sufficient to make us Intelligible: We make our Authour at least appear in a Poetique Dress. We have actually made him more Sounding, and more Elegant, than he was before in <hi>English:</hi> And have endeavour'd to make him speak that kind of <hi>English,</hi> which he wou'd have spoken had he liv'd in <hi>England,</hi> and had Written to this Age. If sometimes any of us (and 'tis but seldome) make him express the Customs and Manners of our Native Country, rather than of <hi>Rome;</hi> 'tis, either when there was some kind of Analogy, betwixt their Customes and ours; or when, to make him more easy to Vulgar Understandings, we gave him those Manners which are familiar to us. But I defend not this Innovation,
'tis enough if I can excuse it. For to speak sincerely, the Manners of Nations and Ages, are not to be confounded: We shou'd either make them <hi>English,</hi> or leave them <hi>Roman.</hi> If this can neither be defended, nor excus'd, let it be pardon'd, at least, because it is acknowledg'd; and so much the more easily, as being a fault which is never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without some Pleasure to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Thus, my Lord, having troubl'd You with a tedious Visit, the best Manners will be shewn in the least Ceremony. I will slip away while Your Back is turn'd, and while You are otherwise employ'd: with great Confusion, for having entertain'd You so long with this Discourse; and for having no other Recompence to make You, than the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Labours of my Fellow-Undertakers in this Work; and the Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgments, Prayers, and perpetual good Wishes of,</p>

                  <head>THE FIRST SATYR OF JUVENAL,</head>
                  <byline>Translated into ENGLISH VERSE BY Mr. <hi>DRYDEN.</hi>
                  </byline>

                     <head>Argument of the first Satyr.</head>
                     <p>THE Poet gives us first a kind of humorous Reason for his Writing: That being provok'd by hearing so many ill Poets rehearse their Works, he does himself Iustice on them, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them as bad as they bring. But since no man will rank himself with ill Writers, 'tis easie to conclude, that if such Wretches cou'd draw an Audience, he thought it no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to excel them, and gain a greater esteem with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Next he informs us more openly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why he rather addicts himself to Satyr, than any other kind of Poetry. And here he discovers that it is not so much his indignation to ill Poets, as to ill Men, which has prompted him to write. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gives us a summary and general view of the Vices and Follies reigning in his time. So that this first Satyr is the natural Ground-work of all the rest. Herein he confines himself to no one Subject, but strikes indifferently at all Men in his way: In every following Satyr he has chosen some particular Moral which he wou'd inculcate; and lashes some particular Vice or Folly, (An Art with which our Lampoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are not much acquainted.) But our Poet being desirous to reform his own Age, and not daring to attempt it by an Overt act of naming living Persons, inveighs onely against those who were infamous in the times immediately preceding his, whereby he not only gives a fair warning to Great Men, that their Memory lies at the mercy of future Poets and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, but also with a finer stroke of his Pen, brands ev'n the living, and personates them under dead mens Names.</p>
                     <p>I have avoided as much as I cou'd possibly the borrow'd Learning of Marginal Notes and Illustrations, and for that Reason have Translated this Satyr somewhat largely. And freely own (if it be a fault) that I have likewise omitted most of the Proper Names, because I thought they wou'd not much edifie the Reader. To conclude, if in two or three places I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted all the Commentators, 'tis because I thought they first deserted my Author, or at least have left him in so much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, that too much room is left for guessing.</p>

                     <head>ARGUMENT OF THE Sixth Satyr.</head>
                     <p>This Satyr, of almost double length to any of the rest, is a bitter invective against the fair Sex. Tis, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a Common-place, from whence all the Moderns have notoriously stollen their sharpest Raileries. In his other Satyrs the Poet has only glanc'd on some particular Women, and generally scourg'd the Men. But this he reserv'd wholly for the Ladies. How they had offended him I know not: But upon the whole matter he is not to be excus'd for imputing to all, the Vices of some few amongst them. Neither was it generously done of him, to attack the weakest as well as the fairest part of the Creation: Neither do I know what Moral he cou'd reasonably draw from it. It could not be to avoid the whole Sex, if all had been true which he alledges against them: for that had been to put an end to Humane Kind. And to bid us beware of their Artifices, is a kind of silent acknowledgment, that they have more wit than Men: which turns the Satyr upon us, and particularly upon the Poet; who thereby makes a Complement, where he meant a Libel. If he intended only to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his Wit, he has forfeited his Iudgment, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one half of his Readers his mortal Enemies: And amongst the Men, all the happy Lovers, by their
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62894:78"/> own Experience, will disprove his Accusations. The whole World must allow this to be the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tiest of his Satyrs; and truly he had need of all his parts, to maintain with so much violence, so unjust a Charge. I am satisfied he will bring but few over to his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And on that Consideration chiefly I ventur'd to translate him. Though there wanted not another Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which was, that no one else would undertake it: At least, Sir, <hi>C. S.</hi> who cou'd have done more right to the Author, after a long delay, at length absolutely refus'd so ungrateful an employment: And every one will grant, that the Work must have been imperfect and lame, if it had appear'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one of the Principal Members belonging to it. Let the Poet therefore bear the blame of his own Invention; and let me satisfie the World, that I am not of his Opinion. Whatever his <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies were, the <hi>English</hi> are free from all his Imputations. They will read with Wonder and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, the Vices of an Age, which was the most Infamous of any on Record. They will bless them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when they behold those Examples related of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time: They will give back to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity those Monsters it produc'd: And believe with reason, that the Species of those Women is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd; or at least, that they were never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ere propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. I may safely therefore proceed to the Argument of a Satyr, which is no way relating to them: And first observe, that my Author makes their Lust the most Heroick of their Vices: The rest are in a manner but digression. He skims them over; but he dwells on this; when he seems to have taken his last leave of it, on the sudden he returns to it: 'Tis one Branch of it in <hi>Hippia,</hi> another in <hi>Messalina,</hi> but Lust is the main Body of the Tree. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with this Text in the first line, and takes it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62894:79"/> up with Intermissions to the end of the Chapter. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vice is a Loader; but that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ces of secret Crimes; their Arts to hide them; their Wit to excuse them; and their Impudence to own them, when they can no longer be kept secret. Then the Persons to whom they are most addicted; and on whom they commonly bestow the last Favours. As Stage-Players, Fidlers, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Boys, and Fencers. Those who pass for Chast amongst them, are not really so; but only for their vast Dowries, are rather suffer'd, than lov'd by their own Husbands. That they are Imperious, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering, Scolding Wives: Set up for Learning and Criticism in Poetry; but are false Iudges. Love to speak <hi>Greek</hi> (which was then the Fashionable Tongue, as <hi>French</hi> is now with us.) That they plead Causes at the Bar, and play Prizes at the Bear-Garden. That they are Gossips and News-Mongers: Wrangle with their Neighbours abroad, and beat their Servants at home. That they lie in for new Faces once a Month: are slattish with their Husbands in private; and Paint and Dress in Publick for their Lovers. That they deal with Iews, Diviners, and Fortune-tellers: Learn the Arts of Miscarrying, and Barrenness. Buy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and produce them for their own. Murther their Husbands Sons, if they stand in their way to his Estate: and make their Adulterers his Heirs. From hence the Poet proceeds to shew the Occasions of all these Vices; their Original, and how they were introduc'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> by Peace, Wealth, and Luxury. In conclusion, if we will take the word of our malicious Author; Bad Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are the general standing Rule; and the Good, but some few Exceptions to it.</p>

                        <p>THE Translator of <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s 8th Satyr industrously avoided imposing upon the Reader, and perplexing the Printer with tedious Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place Notes; but finding towards the latter End many Examples of Noble-Men who disgraced their Ancestors by Vicious Practices, and of Men Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Born who innobled their Families by Virtuous and Brave Actions, he thought some Historical Relations were necessary towards rendring those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances more Intelligible; which is all he pretends to by his Remarks.

                        <hi>Corvinus</hi> had trusted one of his Old Friends and Acquaintance with a Bag of Money; this Friend denies the Trust, and forswears it too: <hi>Corvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> is very much disturb'd at this Cheat, storms and rages, accuses Providence, and is ready to conclude that God takes no care of Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, because some Sudden and Remarkable Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance did not fall upon this perjur'd false Wretch: <hi>Juvenal</hi> hearing of <hi>Corvinus</hi>'s Loss, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly Behaviour, writes this Satyr to him, both to comfort him after his Loss, and instruct him how to bear it; and thence takes occasion to speak of the Vileness, and Villany of his Times. He begins with the Condition of the wicked Man; and tells him; <hi>i.</hi> That the Sinner must needs hate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and, <hi>ii.</hi> That he will be hated by all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. <hi>iii.</hi> He puts <hi>Corvinus</hi> in mind that he hath a good Estate, and that this Loss will not break him. <hi>iv.</hi> and, <hi>v.</hi> That a great many have suffer'd the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62894:164"/> like Misfortunes; that Cheats were common; his Loss but little, and therefore not to be resented with so violent a Passion. Hence, <hi>vi.</hi> He expatiates on the Vileness of the Times; And, <hi>vii.</hi> compares his Age with the Golden One, which he tediously describes. <hi>viii.</hi> He continues his Reflections on the genera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That, <hi>xvii.</hi> his Passion is Idle and Fruitless; because Revenge, which is the only end of Passion, will do him no good, it will not retrieve his Loss, and besides is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a Base Mind, and Mean Temper.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62894:165"/> of the Wicked Man.

Thus we are more apt to imitate a <hi>Catiline,</hi> than a <hi>Brutus,</hi> or the Uncle of <hi>Brutus, Cato Ulicensis.</hi> For these Reasons he is instant with all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:62894:174"/> all things shall be clean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and set in order; much more it is their Duty to their Children, that nothing appear corrupt or undecent in their Family. Storks and Vultures, because they are fed by the Old Ones, with Snakes, and Carrion, naturally, and without instruction, feed on the same uncleanly Diet. But the Generous Eaglet, who is taught by her Parent, to fly at Hares, and sowse on Kids, disdains after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to pursue a more ignoble Game. Thus the Son of <hi>Centronius</hi> was prone to the Vice of raising Stately Structures, beyond his Fortune; because his Father had ruin'd himself by Building. He whose Father is a <hi>Jew,</hi> is Naturally prone to Superstition, and the Observation of his Country Laws. From hence the Poet descends to a Satyr against Avarice, which he esteems to be of worse Example than any of the former. The remaining part of the Poem is wholly employ'd on this Subject, to shew the Misery of this Vice. He concludes with limiting our desire of Riches to a certain Measure; which he confines within the compass of what Hunger and Thirst and Cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for our preservation and subsistance: With which Necessaries if we are not contented, then the Treasures of <hi>Craesus,</hi> of the <hi>Persian</hi> King, or of the Eunuch <hi>Narcissus,</hi> who commanded both the Will and the Fortunes of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour, wou'd not be sufficient, to satisfie the greediness of our Desires.</p>

He also takes notice of the Noblemen and their abominable Poetry, who in the Luxury of their Fortune, set up for Wits, and Iudges. The Satyr is in Dialogue, betwixt the Authour and his Friend or Monitor; who dissuades him from this dangerous attempt of exposing Great Men. But <hi>Persius,</hi> who is of a free Spirit, and has not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that <hi>Rome</hi> was once a Commonwealth, breaks through all those difficulties, and boldly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns the fulfe Iudgment of the Age in which he Lives. The Reader may observe that our Poet was a Stoick Philosopher; and that all his Moral Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, both here, and in all the rest of his Satyrs, are drawn from the Dogma's of that Sect.</p>

                     <head>ARGUMENT OF THE Second Satyr.</head>
                     <p>This Satyr, contains a most Grave, and Philosophical Argument, concerning Prayers and Wishes. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, it gave occasion to <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s Tenth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr; And both of them had their Original from one of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dialogues, call'd the second <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> Our Author has induc'd it with great mastery of Art; by taking his rise, from the Birth-day of his Friend; on which occasions. Prayers were made, and Sacrifices offer'd by the Native. <hi>Persius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending first the Purity of his Friend's Vows, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends to the Impious and Immoral Requests of others. The Satyr is divided into three parts. The first is the Exordium to <hi>Macrinus,</hi> which the Poet confines within the compass of four Verses, the second relates to the matter of the Prayers and Vows, and an enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of those things, wherein Men commonly Sinn'd against right Reason, and Offended in their Requests. The Third part consists, in shewing the repugnancies of those Prayers and Wishes, to those of other Men, and inconsistencies with themselves. He shews the Original of these Vows, and sharply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs against them: And Lastly, not only corrects the false Opinion of Mankind concerning them; but gives the True Doctrine of all Addresses made to Heaven; and how they may be made acceptable to the Pow'rs above, in excellent Precepts; and more worthy of a Christian than a Heathen.</p>

After which he takes upon him the other part, of the Teacher. And addressing himself particularly to Young Noblemen, tells them, That, by reason of their High Birth, and the Great Possessions of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they are careless of adorning their Minds with Precepts of Moral Philosophy: And withall inculcates to them the Miseries which will attend them in the whole Course of their Life, if they do not apply themselves betimes to the Knowledge of Virtue, and the End of their Creation, which he pathetically insinuates to them. The Title of this Satyr, in some Ancient Manuscripts, was <hi>The Reproach of Idleness;</hi> tho in others of the Scholiasts, 'tis inscrib'd, <hi>Against the Luxury

                     <head>ARGUMENT OF THE Fourth Satyr.</head>
                     <p>Our Author, living in the time of <hi>Nero,</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary and Friend to the Noble Poet <hi>Lucan;</hi> both of them, were sufficiently sensible, with all Good Men, how Unskilfully he manag'd the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: And perhaps might guess at his future Tyranny, by some Passages, during the latter part of his first five years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho he broke not out, into his greater Excesses, while he was restrain'd by the Counsels and Authority of <hi>Seneca. Lucan</hi> has not spar'd him in the Poem of his <hi>Pharsalia:</hi> For his very Complement look'd asquint, as well as <hi>Nero. Persius</hi> has been bolder, but with Caution likewise. For here, in the Person of Young <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades,</hi> he arraigns his Ambition of meddling with State Affairs, without Iudgment or Experience.
'Tis probable that he makes <hi>Seneca</hi> in this Satyr, sustain the part of <hi>Socrates,</hi> under a borrow'd Name. And, withal, discovers some secret Vices of <hi>Nero,</hi> concerning his Lust, his Drunkenness and his Effeminacy, which had not yet arriv'd to publick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He also reprehends the Flattery of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, who endeavour'd to make all his Vices pass for Virtues. Covetousness was undoubtedly none
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62894:221"/> of his Faults; but it is here describ'd as a Veyl cast over the True Meaning of the Poet, which was to Satyrise his Prodigality, and Voluptuousness; to which he makes a transition. I find no Instance in History, of that Emperour's being a <hi>Pathique;</hi> tho <hi>Persius</hi> seems to brand him with it. From the two Dialogues of <hi>Plato,</hi> both call'd <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> the Poet took the Arguments, of the Second and Third Satyr, but he inverted the order of them: For the third Satyr is taken from the first of those Dialogues.</p>
                     <p>The Commentatours before <hi>Casaubon,</hi> were ignorant of our Author's secret meaning; and thought he had only written against Young Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in General, who were too forward in aspiring to publick Magistracy: But this Excellent Scholiast has unravell'd the whole Mystery: And made it apparent, that the Sting of the Satyr, was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly aim'd at <hi>Nero.</hi>

                     <p>The judicious <hi>Casaubon,</hi> in his Proem to this Satyr tells us, that <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> the Grammarian, being ask'd, what Poem of <hi>Archilochus</hi> his Iambicks he preferr'd before the rest, answerd, the longest.

For this Reason, I have selected it from all the others; and inscrib'd it to my Learned Master Doctor <hi>Busby;</hi> to whom I am not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This Satyr consists of two distinct Parts: The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Praises of the Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

As also his Exhortation to Young Noblemen, that they wou'd enter themselves into his Institution. From hence he makes an artful Transition into the second Part of his Subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherein he first complains of the Sloath of Scholars; and afterwards perswades them to the pursuit of their true Liberty: Here our Author excellently Treats that Paradox of the Stoicks, which affirms, that the Wise or Virtuous Man is only Free; and that all Vicious Men, are Naturally Slaves.

All the Studious, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Poets, about the end of <hi>August,</hi> began to set themselves on Work: Refraining from Writing, during the Heats of the Summer. They wrote by Night; and sate up the greatest part of it. For which Reason the Product of their Studies, was call'd their <hi>Elucubrations;</hi> or Nightly Labours. They who had Country Seats retir'd to them, while they Studied: As <hi>Persius</hi> did to his, which was near the Port of the Moon in <hi>Etruria;</hi> and <hi>Bassus</hi> to his, which was in the Country of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> nearer <hi>Rome.</hi>

In a Dream, or Vision, call you it which you please, he thought it was reveal'd to him, that the Soul of <hi>Pithagoras</hi> was Transmigrated into him: As <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> before him believ'd, that himself had been <hi>Euphorbus</hi> in the Wars of <hi>Troy.</hi> Commentators differ in placing the order of this Soul, and who had it first. I have here given it to the Peacock; because it looks more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of Nature, that it shou'd lodge, in a Creature of an Inferiour Species; and so by Gradation rise to the informing of a Man.

however, this is the most Poetical Description of any in our Author: And since he and <hi>Lucan</hi> were so great Friends, I know not but <hi>Lucan</hi> might help him, in two or three of these Verses, which seem to be written in his stile; certain it is, that besides this Description of a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck, and two Lines more, which are at the End of the Second Satyr, our Poet has written nothing Elegantly.
