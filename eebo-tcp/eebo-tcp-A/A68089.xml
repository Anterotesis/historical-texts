            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>For that I thought I ſhould fynde no quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in warre, I would not proue it.

And finally thinking in ſeruing a Prince, not in handy craftes, but in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable affayres, to fynd ſome contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mynd, I determined with the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lerning I had, to ſetle me to that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:6031:46"/>
wher, by and by I found the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of that that I thought. For beſides the paines that it is to ſerue a Prince, and the troubles that in ſuche ſeruice are ſuffered, not being able eyther to ſlepe or eate in due ſeaſon, the which are euen thinges that preſerue our life, the enuy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reigneth in courtes, and thunkindnes that ſemeth to be in princes towardes thoſe that ſerue them, (who thinke themſelues neuer iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewarded) without they would geue them theyr hole kingdome, ſuffered me neuer to reſt my mynd, to liue one onely howre contented. Wherby I was deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and gaue my ſelfe to ſayling, and ſo there where I thought not, I found my quietnes. For being caried by fortune into this Iſland, I was chaunged by Cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as thou ſeeſt, into an hare, the which was as it mought be to you, to be fallen into a moſt pleſaunt ſlepe.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue alwayes thought moſt noble Circes, that there was a difference betwene one man, and an other: as it is daylye ſayd by prouerbe, by the mouthes of our Grety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: but yet not ſo greate dyfference as I haue knowen ſyns I ſpake with yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hare that thou ſaweſt, or to ſay better with him whom thou haſte tranſfourmed into a Hare.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cir.</speaker>
               <p>And why ſoo? wyll he peraduenture become man agayne?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vli.</speaker>
               <p>And I doo yet lamente, becauſe I am ſtyll

of the ſelte ſame opinion, and thys is, for that I know plainely, that his ferefulnes and lyttle corage, wyll not ſuffre hym to knowe the truthe. Seeſt thou not that he is ſo weke harted by nature, that he hath ſo much fere of euery litle aduerſitie, that he woulde rather chooſe to lyue in euerye moſt vyle bondage without thoughts, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in anye honeſt degree, with thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that the ſame bringeth with it.</p>

               <p>He hym ſelfe, whoe wyll rather remaine ſo a beaſt, then retourne man, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye troubles, that he thinketh men haue. And yet the confeſſeth, remaynynge ſo, to be in ſuch bondage to nature, and led by her by force that he is not mayſter of hys owne operations. Whereby the deſyre to eate, commyng on hym whyles we were reaſonyng together, and ſeinge certayne graſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient meate for him, he departed from me wyth a very ill wil, for that he had not yet aunſwered me after hys owne mynd, ſaying that he could not chooſe but go feede, for ſo hys nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced

hym to do. So that ſe what a weeke harted manne he was, that would rather lyue in a ſeruitude, and in a lyke ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thoughte there were ſomewhat fewer diſpleaſures: then to retourne ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to be mayſter of hys owne paſſyons, though he muſte ſomewhat ſtryue wyth them: as perchaunce thou haſt heard ſaye, howe many there haue ben of our Greti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who to auoide ſome bondage, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcemente, haue not onelye not cared to ſtryue with the world, and with fortune, but alſo not to pardon euen their owne lyues.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cir.</speaker>
               <p>This that thou calleſt bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in hym, or enforcemente, is vnto hym neyther thone nor thother.</p>

               <p>Bycauſe hys nature requyreth ſo. Tell me I praye thee, when a ſtone falleth downe, doth he it by force?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It is true: but hys nature requyreth ſoo, and that motion that cauſethe hym to good towardes the centre, commyng of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner power, the which is within the ſame,

called nature, muſte be naturall to hym, and not violente: becauſe the violente mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are thoſe that come be an outwarde power. And therefore, although he can do none otherwyſe: yet it can not be ſayd that he is enforced.</p>

               <p>No, not by force, but by nature, beynge natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vnto hym to be weightie: for yf he wer not ſo weightye, he ſhoulde not bee a ſtone.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>And ſo it is alſo with the affection of beaſtes, when it is led by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and therefore it can not be called en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, ſynce ſhe doth alwaies the beſt for them, as ſhe doth in all other thynges: and that that is nede to theyr conſeruation and perfection.</p>

               <p>For that meane that is a vertue, is not like the arithmeticall middes, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of like farnes from his extremes, as is (for an example) in the continual qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the centrie of the circle: from the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che centre as many lines as thou wilte, drawen to the circumference ar al equal: or as the ſixe, is betwene two and tenne in ſeperate quantitie, the whiche is as farre diſtaunte from the one as from the other.

not being put betwene his extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes by equall diſtaunce, after the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the Arithmetricall middes, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth that a vertue determine it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to a reaſonable proportion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, to the ſimilitude of the geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call middes: and this vertue to whom it belongeth to determine it, is wiſedome.

the wiſedome of the Cranes, that rule them ſelues ſoo ordinately vnder the principalitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one of them, and howe when the others take their reſt, he onely ſtandeth with his head alofte, to take hede to the others, holding a ſtone wyth the one of his fete, for that he woulde not ſleape, and hearing any thinge, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them ſtraighte therof.

               <p>Becauſe thou ſhouldeſt be able to diſcerne, which are the proper ſenſibles, of one ſence, and whiche are the common,

               <p>Ther are three powers, or knowing vertues: the fyrſte of the which, are the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges of thoſe ſeperated ſubſtaunces that continually turne the heauens, the obiect of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Vli.</speaker>
               <p>The matter of thinges is of two ſortes: thone of the which is called comune, and the other particuler. The comune matter of man is the fleſhe, the bones, the ſinoes and other thinges: and the particuler mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is this fleſhe, theſe bones, and theſe ſynoes. And this perticuler is that, that going continually vnto breking, alwaies varieth. And without this the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conſydereth it: but not yet without the fleſhe and bones: whereby conſyder man as a reaſonable creature of boones, and fleſhe, and mortall: and in this ſorte
<pb facs="tcp:6031:118"/>
vniuerſally, and without perticuler mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he commeth to be vnuariable: and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured knowledge may be had of him.</p>

               <p>Haue not we alſo the phantaſie that doth the ſelfe ſame? for it receyueth the Images of thinges by the ſenſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiallye, and beſides this deuideth and maketh all that it liſteth, and at all times when it will.</p>

               <p>It is true that the fantaſie is a power ſoo noble, that ſome heretofore haue douted, that it is the ſelfe ſame thing in vs, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is. And they that haue not thought thus, haue ſaid that the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at the leaſt, coulde not worke withoute the phantaſie, the whiche is moſt true. But this maketh not yet that it is not farre more inferior then the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge: and that this is true, the fantaſye is a miniſter of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, and ſerueth it continuallye in his operations, and thoſe powers that are made by nature for the ſeruice of others, are leſſe parfect, then the others: as thou maiſt manifeſtly ſee in thy ſelfe, that the outer ſenſes, as are the ſight, the hearing
<pb facs="tcp:6031:119"/>
and others, for that they ſerue to our com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon ſenſe (the which hath not for obiect one onely ſenſible, as they haue, but al) are leſſe noble then he. And he then that ſerueth vnto the eſtimatiue, or fantaſy, is alſo farre leſſe noble then that. But yf thou wilt be more ſure hereof, conſider the operations of youre fantaſie, and thoſe of our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, and thou ſhalt ſee howe farre the fantaſie is inferiour vnto the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. For though your fantaſie take the ſemblaunces, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of thinges immateriallye, it can not yet take them, without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the matter that are, the being in quantitie, the being in place, and in tyme, and ſuch like: whereby you canne neuer imagin any thing at all withoute theſe conditions. The which happeneth not vnto our vnderſtanding that can per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue the nature of thinges, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering quantitie, or place, time, or vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, and ſuch like appertaining to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: it is true that he getteth theſe his kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, from the images that are in the fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſy, immaterially: for he could not get them of the things it ſelf, for being ſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.
<pb facs="tcp:6031:119"/>
Beſides this, althoughe youre phantaſie, can make alſo, and deuide as it ſhould be, to make of a horſe, &amp; a man, a centaur: and to feine a man without fete &amp; without hands, it can not yet deuide the matter from the form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and in one onely ſubiecte. Beſides this it can neuer imagin any thing, that it hath not ſene to fore: and yf not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet at the leaſt his partes.</p>

And this power (as I haue told thee) maketh man very noble: for it maketh him free, and maiſter of all his operations. And this is for that the will is free, and hath not bene determined by nature, more vnto one contrarye, then vnto an other. For although the good be her obiecte, ſhe is not therefore determined more vnto that, then vnto the contrarye. Wherfore
<pb facs="tcp:6031:125"/>
it is not with it as with the naturall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, who being nere their obiectes and hauing due diſtaunce betwene them, can not choſe but worke: as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſene in the fyre, the whiche hauing a matter by it apte to burne, can not ſtay to not burne it. But our will, hauing a good thing ſet before it, and thoughe it be ſomewhat enclyned by nature to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe it, is not yet conſtrained by any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie to loue it: whereby ſhe maye loue it and not loue it. Then al the other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that man hath as a creature, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte vnto this power, not alwayes in ſuch ſort that they can not be moued by their obiectes, without the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of the ſame will, but for that they are diſpoled and ordeyned, to moue at all times that it pleaſeth her.

<pb facs="tcp:6031:125"/>
that can commaund her that ſhe wil, but that that ſhe liſt: the which is not ſo with your ſenſitiue appetite, For an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte offered vnto it, that it deſireth, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of neceſſitie the beaſt to folow it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and without any election, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body may well knowe, who will dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerue your operations.</p>

turninge him ſelfe towardes thoſe that are ſuperiour vnto him. For if he will geue him ſelfe wholy vnto the belly: hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his countenaunce, and face conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually fixed on the earth, he ſhall become as one that perceiueth nothinge, and like to the plantes: and if he ſhal drowne him ſelfe to much in the ſenſitiue pleaſure, he ſhall become like the brute beaſtes: but yf he lyfting his face towardes heauen, playing the philoſopher, ſhal conſider the beautie of the heauens, and the maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous order of nature, he ſhall change him ſelf from an erthly beaſt, vnto an heuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creature: and if he, diſpiſing all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedimentes of the body, ſhall attende to beholde the diuine thinges, he ſhal make him ſelfe almoſt a god.
