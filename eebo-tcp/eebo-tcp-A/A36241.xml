            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The

only thing that made me think a Reply <hi>needless,</hi> was that in all the <hi>Learning</hi> he has shewn, I could find nothing that I thought any indifferent Person could think proper for satisfying <hi>Conscience</hi> in the single point here in Question, nothing that could give me the least <hi>reason</hi> to doubt of the <hi>Arguments</hi> principally insisted on by the <hi>Vindicator.</hi> For other things not relating to that, I thought our candid <hi>Adversaries</hi> themselves would excuse us when they considered the <hi>Disadvantages</hi> on our side, the Difficulties of the <hi>Press,</hi> the Displeasure of our <hi>pretended Superiors,</hi> much more considerable than any <hi>Argument</hi> that I could find produced either by <hi>him</hi> or any other Adversary.</p>

            <p>So far I am from trusting my own Opinion in this matter, that I would gladly know some <hi>particular</hi> of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Book, that  even our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> who are so clamorous for a <hi>Reply,</hi> think sufficient to excuse their <hi>Schism</hi> against the Charge of the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> His <hi>Baroccain M S</hi> has already been proved impertinent to our present Dispute. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> has shewn that the <hi>occasion</hi> of his writing did not <hi>oblige</hi> his Author to defend the validity of <hi>Lay-deprivations;</hi> he might have added, that his <hi>Author</hi> himself was not ignorant, that <hi>Synods</hi> did intervene in several of his <hi>Instances,</hi> which must have made so many of them perfectly impertinent to his design, if that had been to vindicate the Validity of <hi>Lay depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</hi> That is not all: The <hi>Vindicator</hi> has also shewn from the <hi>Canons</hi> subjoyned at the end, and suppressed by the <hi>Doctor,</hi> that the Author <hi>could not</hi> design the Defence of <hi>Lay Deprivations.</hi> Nor has the <hi>Doctor</hi> offered at any thing that might shew such a Design consistent with those <hi>Canons,</hi> or the Author's Subjection to them. Yet those <hi>Canons</hi> alone are decisive to our purpose, both as to the sense of the <hi>Constantinoplitane</hi> Church, and of that <hi>Author</hi> as a Member of it, whether they were part of his <hi>Work</hi> or not; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, the Impartial Reader is to judge whether what the <hi>Doctor</hi> has said, be sufficient to purge his wilful suppressing them. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> has also shewn the Author not only <hi>remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> from, but <hi>ignorance</hi> of the times he writes of. Nor has the <hi>Doctor</hi> proved, or pretended any thing to the contrary. Nay, even of the <hi>Facts</hi> enumerated by him, there are but <hi>few</hi> that the <hi>Doctor</hi> has thought fit, on second thoughts, to assert indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently on his Authority. It cannot therefore be on this account,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49601:5"/>
of vindicating his <hi>M S,</hi> that any Impartial Reader can judge the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s performance to be a just <hi>Reply</hi> to the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toin</hi>

I grant indeed, that these Two Questions are not directly the same.

That a <hi>Synodical</hi> deprivation, though <hi>unjust,</hi> discharges the <hi>Subjects</hi>  from the Obligation of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Cononical Obedience,</hi> is usually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But not for that <hi>reason</hi> which the <hi>Doctor</hi> has given for it. The <hi>division</hi> which might otherwise follow in the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>publick disturbance</hi> which might follow thereupon, if they were not so discharged, are equally applicable to the <hi>opposite</hi> Pretenders, and could afford the Subjects no directions with <hi>whether</hi> of them they ought to <hi>joyn.</hi> The <hi>true reason</hi> ought to decide the <hi>Title,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be such as <hi>one</hi> only of the Rivals can pretend to. That is, that the <hi>Synod,</hi> however <hi>unjust</hi> in its <hi>way</hi> of proceeding, is notwithstanding to be allowed as a <hi>conpetent Judge;</hi> and therefore that, on that account, its Sentences ought to hold in <hi>Practice,</hi> till repealed by a <hi>higher Authority</hi> of the <hi>same kind,</hi> that is, by a <hi>greater Synod.</hi> But an <hi>incompetent Jude</hi> leaves things in the same condition in which it <hi>found</hi> them, and <hi>ought</hi> not, in <hi>Conscience</hi> or <hi>Equity,</hi> to have an <hi>effect</hi> at all. Nor can it therefore impose on the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> of the <hi>Subjects</hi> any, the least, <hi>Obligation,</hi> even to <hi>acquiescence.</hi> Nor does it follow, that because the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s <hi>conscent</hi> may not be necessary to <hi>oblige</hi> him to <hi>stand</hi> to the <hi>unjust Sentence,</hi> that therefore the <hi>reason</hi> of his obligation to <hi>acquiescences</hi> is not grounded on <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal consent.</hi> The <hi>consent</hi> of his <hi>Predecessors</hi> on the valuable considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having the <hi>conveniences</hi> of <hi>Synodical debates,</hi> may conclude <hi>him</hi> while <hi>he</hi> enjoys the same <hi>valuable considerations.</hi> And the <hi>consent</hi> of his <hi>Collegues</hi> may oblige <hi>him</hi> also, who have the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>judging</hi> with whom they will observe the <hi>Commerce</hi> of their <hi>Communicatory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Their <hi>agreement</hi> in <hi>denying</hi> him their <hi>Communicatory Letters,</hi> is, in effect, a <hi>Deprivation,</hi> when what he does is not ratified in the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> This will go far to hinder his <hi>Cummunion</hi> from being <hi>Catholick,</hi> which may go far also towards the <hi>absolving</hi> his <hi>Subjects</hi> from <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> if by joyning with any <hi>other,</hi> they may have the benefit of <hi>Catholick Communion.</hi> But this following the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Episcopal Predecessors,</hi> or of the <hi>Episcopal Colledge,</hi> will by no means, allow the <hi>Subject</hi> that Liberty which the <hi>Doctor</hi> disputes for, of <hi>deserting</hi> their <hi>Bishops</hi> on their own <hi>private Judgments</hi> concerning the <hi>publick good.</hi> It will not follow, that <hi>that Necessity</hi> must excuse them, which has no other consideration on which it may be grounded, desides that of an <hi>irresistible force.</hi>

            <p>But the <hi>Doctor</hi> (it seems) can see no difference, as to <hi>Acquiescence</hi> in  a Case of <hi>Necessity,</hi> between what is done by a <hi>competent,</hi> and what by an <hi>incompetent, Authority.</hi> It is strange that a Person so <hi>able</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> in <hi>other</hi> Cases, where <hi>Interest</hi> permits him to judge <hi>impertially,</hi> should <hi>not</hi> see it. The obvious difference now mentioned is, that the <hi>Deprivation</hi> by an <hi>incompetent Authority</hi> leaves Subjects under <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>Duty,</hi> from which they are <hi>discharged,</hi> when the <hi>Authority,</hi> though acting <hi>unjustly,</hi> is notwithstanding <hi>competent.</hi> Thence it plainly follows that, where the <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>Duty</hi> is taken away, there <hi>compliance</hi> is not <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> And where it is not <hi>sinful,</hi> it may be born with in the Case of that <hi>Necessity,</hi> which is the result of an <hi>irresistible Force.</hi> But where the <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Duty</hi> remains, and the <hi>compliance</hi> is therefore <hi>sinful;</hi> I know <hi>no</hi> tolerable <hi>Casuisty</hi> that <hi>allows</hi> it upon such <hi>Necessity.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi> himself, as we have seen already, excepts it in his <hi>own</hi> stating of the Case. <hi>Tenants</hi> do not usually hold their Tenures by <hi>Oaths:</hi> But where they do; I am sure all creditable <hi>Antiquity</hi> thought them under <hi>stricter Obligations</hi> to performance than (it seems) the <hi>Doctor</hi> does. The <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of the <hi>Publick</hi> are, no doubt, useful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations for understanding the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Oaths,</hi> in which they oblige to <hi>performance.</hi> But the <hi>Doctor</hi> might have been pleased to consider that here are two <hi>publick,</hi> oftentimes <hi>incompareble, Interests</hi> concerned in the <hi>Obligation</hi> of <hi>Oaths.</hi> There is the <hi>publick Interest</hi> of those <hi>to</hi> whom, as well as of those <hi>by</hi> whom, the <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>given.</hi> And all fair and equal dealing <hi>Casuists</hi> prefer the <hi>former</hi> before the <hi>later</hi> in <hi>Oaths</hi> given for the Security of <hi>others.</hi> How than can the <hi>Doctor</hi> make the <hi>good</hi> of Sworn <hi>Tenants</hi> in <hi>general</hi> to put restrictions on <hi>Oaths</hi> given for the <hi>Security</hi> not of the Sworn <hi>Tenants,</hi> but of the <hi>liege Lords</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> for whose <hi>Security</hi> the <hi>Obligations</hi> are undertaken? He ought to <hi>prove</hi> that a <hi>Conqueror</hi> can daprive a <hi>Bishop</hi> of his <hi>Spiritual Power</hi> if he be pleased to reason upon it. That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> supplyed the place of <hi>Narcissus,</hi> when they thought him <hi>dead,</hi> does not <hi>prove</hi> that they had thought themselves at liberty to have done so, if they had <hi>known</hi> him to have been <hi>living.</hi> Whatever present <hi>incapacity</hi> he might have been under for the <hi>administration</hi> of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they might have thought themselves obliged to <hi>Stay</hi> for him, as the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> did for St. <hi>Athanisius.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> Case is less for his purpose.

It utterly ruines the whole <hi>design</hi> of giving this <hi>Security</hi> by the way of <hi>Oaths.</hi> That is, to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige</hi> them in such <hi>Cases</hi> wherein no considerations <hi>can</hi> oblige them, but those of <hi>Conscience,</hi> where their corrupt affections, should <hi>incline</hi> them to the <hi>contrary,</hi> and where there is no visible <hi>force</hi> appearing that may make the <hi>inconveniences</hi> of <hi>breaking</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi> greater than those of <hi>keeping</hi> it.

               <note place="margin">Psal.

            <p>Upon these terms the <hi>Doctor</hi> is pleased to tell us, that he is <hi>fully persuaded that our ejected Fathers are very worthy and good men.</hi> But not without a manifest <hi>design.</hi> They must, if they will maintain the place he has admitted them to in <hi>his</hi> good opinion, be true to that Idea of <hi>good men</hi> by which he is resolved to try them; <hi>give up</hi> those <hi>Rights</hi> whose <hi>maintenance</hi> may oblige him and his Brethren to any <hi>temporal</hi> loss. And is not this a very obliging reason to induce them to it, that they must give up the <hi>trust</hi> committed to them of the <hi>publick</hi> Interests of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Religion,</hi> rather than he and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren should hazard their <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>private</hi> Interests in <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> those <hi>Rights,</hi> by contributing no more on their own parts than what is otherwise their <hi>duty</hi> to them? They must have agreat stock indeed of that which he is pleased to call <hi>goodness,</hi> if this way of Reasoning can make them think themselves obliged to him. Much more, if, upon this <hi>pretence</hi> of kindness, he may be allowed to <hi>beg,</hi> what he can never be able to <hi>prove,</hi> that they are <hi>obliged</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> rather to <hi>surrender</hi> their <hi>Rights,</hi> than that <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>obliged Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> should be obliged to any <hi>hazard</hi> in <hi>maintaining</hi> them. This one would think too much for him to <hi>persume</hi> till he were better able to prove it.

This was, I am sure, regarded in the Cases of <hi>Edward</hi> the II. and <hi>Richard</hi> the II. The Subjects did not content themselves with a <hi>presumed consent</hi> to what was done in deposing them, gathered only from their <hi>silence;</hi> but they desired and procured an express <hi>renonciation</hi> of their <hi>Rights,</hi> and an express <hi>releastment</hi> from the <hi>Oaths</hi> which they had taken to them formerly. This reason therefore alone would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such Persons from undertaking second <hi>inconsistent</hi> engagements, that they had not yet been <hi>expresly</hi> discharged from the <hi>first.</hi> So far they would be from reckoning on their <hi>silence</hi> alone as sufficient to <hi>discharge</hi> them. For there are besides, especially in such Circumstances as ours, obvious reasons why <hi>silence</hi> only should not be taken for an Argument of a presumed <hi>consent.</hi> The fear of <hi>those</hi> under whose <hi>violence</hi> they suffer may hinder them from <hi>publick Signification</hi> of their <hi>dissent,</hi> and yet, (it seems) nothing under a <hi>publick Signification</hi> will satisfy the <hi>Doctor.</hi> If this <hi>fear</hi> should less influence so <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>good Men,</hi> yet the fear of <hi>miscarrying</hi> might, in <hi>Prudence,</hi> discourage them from <hi>attempting</hi> what they might easily foresee that they should never be able to go thorough with. And how could our <hi>H. Fathert</hi> hope to <hi>succeed</hi> under so manifest and general a <hi>desertion</hi> of those who <hi>owe</hi> Duty to them, and <hi>know</hi> they do so? But it is not very <hi>Human</hi> in our <hi>Adversaries</hi> by their notorious <hi>undutifulness</hi> to <hi>oblige</hi> our <hi>Fathers</hi> to this <hi>silence,</hi> and than <hi>Ironically</hi> to turn their <hi>silence</hi> into an Argument of a presumed <hi>consent.</hi> In the mean time these considerations make it plain that it is very possible for them to <hi>continue</hi> their <hi>Claim,</hi> though they should give no <hi>publick Significations</hi> of doing so. And their <hi>cno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing</hi> it, though without any <hi>publick Signification,</hi> is Sufficient to our <hi>obligation</hi> with regard to <hi>Conscience,</hi> till they give a <hi>publick Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that they will <hi>discharge</hi> us. For that is sufficient to <hi>continue</hi> their old notorious <hi>Claim</hi> they had to our <hi>Duty</hi> before the <hi>pretended depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> I know no other Case wherein our <hi>Advarsaries</hi> where concerned, in which they would think it <hi>just</hi> to <hi>presume</hi> that Persons living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a notorious <hi>force</hi> do therefore <hi>surrender</hi> their <hi>Rights</hi> because they do not further provoke their <hi>Oppressors</hi> by an open <hi>Signification</hi> of their <hi>Claim.</hi> But if nothing less than a <hi>publick Signification</hi> of their <hi>Claim</hi> will content the <hi>Doctor,</hi> methinks he should have acquainted us what <hi>Acts</hi> they are of <hi>Episcopal Power</hi> which he expects from our <hi>H. Fathers</hi> as <hi>publick Significations</hi> of it. Does he expect that they must signify their minds herein <hi>Juridically,</hi> as they did formerly, from their <hi>Courts</hi> and their <hi>Cathedrals?</hi> But he knows these are in the <hi>Power</hi> of those who have pretended to <hi>deprive</hi> them. He knows their <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Subordinate Governours</hi> will not now <hi>obey</hi> them. Must

they <hi>publickly</hi> warn those who are in possession of their <hi>Cures</hi> and <hi>Parishes?</hi> But how can they expect more <hi>Duty</hi> from them who follow the <hi>revenues</hi> into the <hi>Schism,</hi> and who are in <hi>actual Communion</hi> with, and under the <hi>pretended</hi> Obligation of <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Canonical Obedience</hi> to, their Rival <hi>Schismaticks?</hi> What could they expect from such a <hi>publication</hi> of their <hi>dissent,</hi> (besides their gratifying the <hi>Doctor)</hi> but to <hi>expose</hi> their own <hi>Authority,</hi> without any prospect of <hi>publick benefit</hi> that might <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail</hi> it? What but a fruitless <hi>exasperation</hi> of their <hi>Persecutors?</hi> Would he have them fix publick <hi>Protestations</hi> against what has been done, in publick places? But the worthy <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Worcester's</hi> Case is a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Instance how <hi>such</hi> a <hi>publication</hi> would be resented. I hope he will not own any design of urging them to such difficulties only to <hi>gratify</hi> him, if he has really that veneration for them which he Professes to have. By all the <hi>Episcopal Acts</hi> that are <hi>necessary,</hi> and of which their <hi>Circumstances</hi> are capable, they do already <hi>publickly signify</hi> their <hi>insisting</hi> on their <hi>old Title.</hi> I know no <hi>Episcopal Acts,</hi> necessary for <hi>our present</hi> condition, but what they readily <hi>exercise</hi> as <hi>they</hi> see occasion for them. They exercise them in <hi>Dioceses</hi> not otherwise <hi>vacated</hi> than by the <hi>Schism,</hi> without the Ordinaries <hi>leave,</hi> and to Persons <hi>not</hi> owning the <hi>Ordinaries Communion,</hi> which also our H. <hi>Fathers</hi> themselves <hi>abstain</hi> from. These are <hi>publick Significations</hi> that they do <hi>disown</hi> the <hi>state com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> as <hi>Schismatical</hi> (not only as using <hi>unlawful Offices)</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be justified on any other terms but their <hi>challenging</hi> their <hi>old Rights,</hi> and <hi>condemning</hi> their Schismatical <hi>Rivals.</hi>

And what has he to <hi>prove</hi> the <hi>contrary?</hi> Nothing but the voice of <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>bloud; A hard saying! who can bear it?</hi> But this learned <hi>divine</hi> knows very well that the <hi>hardness</hi> of a <hi>saying</hi> (especially if it be only so to <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>bloud)</hi> is no Argument to prove it <hi>false.</hi> He knows it <hi>was not so</hi> in that very passage whence he borrows the Expressions. He knows it <hi>is not</hi> so in all Cases of <hi>Persecution,</hi> and of <hi>Doctrins</hi> that may <hi>deserve</hi> to be maintained by <hi>suffering.</hi> And he urges nothing <hi>peculiar</hi> in our present Case. But he <hi>cannot imagine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49601:13"/>
that the welfare and prosperity of mankind does depend upon so ticklish and uncertain a point as that of an ejected Governors consent. That, if he refuses to give his Consent, all the Church, or the Nation, must be made a Sacrifice to him.</hi> So he represents the Case very <hi>Invidiously.</hi> As if the <hi>Competition</hi> were between the <hi>private Interests</hi> of the <hi>Governour</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Community.</hi> He therefore fancies that the <hi>false Principles</hi> on which <hi>this Nation</hi> is <hi>built</hi> is this, <hi>That the Oath that is taken to the Governour, is taken only for his sake.</hi> But though that <hi>Principle</hi> which he calls <hi>folse</hi> be really in the <hi>Constitution</hi> of some particular <hi>Gouernments,</hi> and therefore is not <hi>universally false;</hi> yet neither, on the contrary, is it <hi>universally true.</hi> Particularly, it is <hi>not</hi> true in the Case of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Government.</hi> This Government is not a <hi>Property</hi> of the <hi>Governours,</hi> but a <hi>Trust</hi> committed to their management for the Good of others, rather than of themselves. Yet though this be the Case, it is the <hi>publick Interest</hi> of the whole <hi>Society,</hi> that all the <hi>Members</hi> of it be <hi>unanimous</hi> in <hi>defending</hi> the particular <hi>Persons</hi> in whom the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> is <hi>vested,</hi> against a <hi>forcible</hi> Dispossession. It is the <hi>publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> that no <hi>Rights</hi> whatsoever be <hi>overpower'd,</hi> because if they be, no <hi>Rights</hi> whatsoever neither <hi>private</hi> nor <hi>publick,</hi> can be <hi>secure;</hi> but may be also <hi>overpower'd</hi> by the same <hi>Precedent.</hi> It is yet more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Publick Interest,</hi> that those <hi>Rights</hi> be secured against all <hi>force,</hi> upon which the <hi>Security</hi> of all the <hi>Particular Rights</hi> of the whole <hi>Society</hi> depend. Such are those of the <hi>Supream Governours</hi> who if they be not <hi>enabled</hi> to defend <hi>themselves,</hi> can never be <hi>able</hi> to <hi>protect</hi> either the <hi>whole Body,</hi> or any <hi>particular Members</hi> of it, in <hi>Possession</hi> of the <hi>Rights</hi> to which they were Intitled by the <hi>Constitution.</hi> Upon this account it has been accounted the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Societies</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> that they be <hi>unanimous</hi> in <hi>defending</hi> it. For this will make the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> better <hi>able</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> it <hi>self,</hi> and <hi>protect</hi> its <hi>Subjects</hi> in their <hi>Rights,</hi> if it have the <hi>united assistance</hi> of the <hi>whole Society,</hi> not subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into several little <hi>Interests.</hi> It has also been thought the <hi>publick Interest</hi> of <hi>Societies</hi> rather to be <hi>concluded</hi> by their <hi>Governours,</hi> as to their <hi>Practice,</hi> in their Judgment concerning the <hi>publick good,</hi> than to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to embroyl their whole Bodies by forming subdivided Factions and intestine animosities, which is the natural consequence of being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the use of their <hi>private Judgements,</hi> even concerning the <hi>publick good</hi> in a <hi>Society</hi> already constituted. Thus the <hi>Doctor</hi> may see how even the regard of the <hi>publick good</hi> may oblige him to hazard all that he calls <hi>Ruin,</hi> in asserting the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Suprem Governours,</hi> by reasons <hi>anticedent</hi> to the <hi>Oath</hi> it self, and <hi>independent</hi> on his <hi>pretended false Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> that <hi>Oaths</hi> are taken only for the <hi>sake</hi> of <hi>Governours.</hi> These
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49601:13"/>
               <hi>Reasons</hi> proceed, though the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> had been like many <hi>Humane Governments,</hi> founded on <hi>Humane Institution,</hi> and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing <hi>consent</hi> of its respective <hi>Members.</hi> But the reason of <hi>hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> all for the <hi>Rights</hi> of our <hi>Ecclesiastical Superiors</hi> holds more <hi>strongly.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> himself has so <hi>constituted</hi> his own <hi>Church</hi> as to <hi>oblige</hi> us, in regard of <hi>all Interests,</hi> to the strict <hi>dependence</hi> on our <hi>Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</hi> As <hi>Schism</hi> is the greatest <hi>mischief</hi> that can befall any <hi>Society;</hi> so a <hi>Society,</hi> such as the <hi>Church</hi> is, that must subsist over all the <hi>World,</hi> independent on the <hi>Secular arm,</hi> nay under <hi>Pesecution</hi> from it, must be in the greatest <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>Schism.</hi> And God has accordingly most wisely contrived his <hi>Spiritual Society</hi> so as to secure it from that <hi>danger,</hi> by making it the greatest <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and of <hi>all</hi> its <hi>Members</hi> considered <hi>severally,</hi> to <hi>adhere</hi> to their <hi>Spiritual Monarch.</hi> It is certainly their greatest <hi>Interest</hi> to keep their <hi>Mystical Communion</hi> with <hi>God</hi> the <hi>head</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and with <hi>Christ</hi> the head of his <hi>Mystical Body</hi> the <hi>Church.</hi> But this, <hi>God</hi> has made no otherwise attainable but by maintaining a <hi>Communion</hi> with his <hi>visible Body</hi> by <hi>visible Sacraments,</hi> obliging himself to ratify in <hi>Heaven</hi> what is transacted by the <hi>visible Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> on <hi>Earth.</hi> Thus he <hi>admits</hi> to his <hi>Mystical Union</hi> those who are admitted by the <hi>visible Governours</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> into his <hi>visible Body,</hi> and <hi>excludes</hi> from the <hi>Mystical Union</hi> those who are by the <hi>Church Governours excluded</hi> from the <hi>Union</hi> that is <hi>visible.</hi> So the Apostle St. <hi>John</hi> reasons that whosoever would have <gap reason="foreign">

            </head>
            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> now proceeds in the <hi>4th</hi> and last place, to shew that this <hi>complyance</hi> with the new <hi>Intruders</hi> is not <hi>sinful</hi> on account of the  Objection insisted on by the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> that the <hi>Usurpers</hi> are <hi>in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty no Bishops</hi> at all. This matter were indeed very easy if all the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> had produced for his purpose had been only a <hi>saying of</hi> St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> and a <hi>saying nothing to his purpose.</hi> He might then indeed <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> should pretend to <hi>raise so great a structure on so weak a foundation.</hi> But considering what the <hi>Vindicator</hi> had said to <hi>prove</hi> the <hi>saying true,</hi> one might rather wonder at the <hi>Doctors confidence</hi> in slighting and overlooking what one would therefore think him conscious that his <hi>Cause</hi> would not afford an Answer to. The <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> had <hi>proved</hi> it <hi>more</hi> than a <hi>saying,</hi> that it was the <hi>Sense,</hi> not only of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but of all the <hi>Bishops</hi> of that <hi>Age,</hi> who all of them <hi>denyed</hi> their <hi>Communicatory Letters</hi> to such an <hi>Intruder</hi> into a <hi>Throne</hi> not <hi>validly</hi> vacated, thereby implying, that they did not own him of their <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Colledge,</hi> and therefore took him for <hi>no Bishop</hi> at all. The <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi> shewed withal that it was agreable to the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of that <hi>Age,</hi> derived by <hi>Tradition</hi> from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they had <hi>reason</hi> to <hi>say</hi> and <hi>think</hi> so too. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>proved</hi> it independently on their <hi>saying</hi> or <hi>thoughts</hi> (however o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise <hi>creditable</hi> in an affair of this kind) from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> it self, that where there could be but <hi>one</hi> of a kind, and <hi>two</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders could not therefore be <hi>both</hi> genuine, the <hi>validity</hi> of <hi>one Title</hi> is to be gathered from the <hi>invalidity</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi> But to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is it to produce <hi>proofs</hi> if the <hi>Doctor</hi> will take no notice of them? But <hi>Cornelious</hi> (with relation to whose Case St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> uses this Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that the <hi>latr Bishop</hi> is not <hi>second,</hi> but <hi>none)</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> says, <hi>had never been deposed,</hi> but <hi>was still the possessor,</hi> which he takes for a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P.</note> from our deprived Fathers Case. He was <hi>deposed</hi> as much as it lay in the Power of the <hi>Pagan Emperour</hi> to do so. He was set up, not only as the <hi>Christian Bishops</hi> then generally were, <hi>without</hi> his <hi>consent,</hi> but notoriously <hi>against</hi> it. He was as much grieved at it as if a <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> had been set up against him for the <hi>Empire.</hi> And he had kept the See <hi>vacant</hi> for a considerable time <hi>after</hi> the Martyrdom of <hi>Fabianus,</hi> doing all that he could do to <hi>hinder</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> from meeting in such a <note place="margin">See P. 18.</note> way as was requisite for supplying the <hi>vacancy.</hi> Let the <hi>Doctor</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Judge what <hi>Decius</hi> could have done more for <hi>deposing</hi> him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

the <hi>Doctor</hi> tells us that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was the <hi>Possessor.</hi> Very true. But not in regard of any <hi>Possession</hi> of which the <hi>Emperour</hi> could <hi>deprive</hi> him. And indeed in no higher sense than ours <hi>are,</hi> as shall appear hereafter. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was <hi>possessed</hi> of no more <hi>Temporals</hi> of which the <hi>State</hi> could <hi>deprive</hi> him. And our H. <hi>Fathers</hi> are <hi>still,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>invaled deprivation,</hi> in as firm and indisputable a <hi>Possession</hi> with regard to <hi>Conscience,</hi> as <hi>Cornelius.</hi> So unhappy the <hi>Doctor</hi> is in prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which he calls the <hi>Saying</hi> of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> nothing to to the <hi>Vindicators purpose.</hi> What the <hi>Doctor</hi> adds that he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve so <hi>great and wise a Man</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> could have been of <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> another opinion from himself, we are not much concerned for till he shall be pleased to produce some better <hi>Arguments</hi> why he <hi>should</hi> not be so. One would think he <hi>wanted</hi> better <hi>Arguments</hi> when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists upon the fairness of the <hi>Elections</hi> of the <hi>Usurpers</hi> for <hi>legitimating</hi> their <hi>Call.</hi> He knows very well the <hi>liberty</hi> our <hi>Laws</hi> allow the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Electors,</hi> that they must <hi>choose</hi> the <hi>Person</hi> proposed, or a <hi>Premunire,</hi> But he must never expect to be <hi>restored</hi> to the <hi>Rights</hi> of his function if he, and such as he, will not only <hi>betray</hi> their <hi>own Rights,</hi> but <hi>plead</hi> for their Adversaries <hi>Invasion</hi> of them. The <hi>Doctor Enthymeme</hi> the <hi>Vindicator</hi> will then be <hi>concerned</hi> to take notice of when the <hi>Doctor</hi> can shew it in his <hi>Book.</hi> But the <hi>Doctor</hi> thinks he has got an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove that an <hi>unjust Synod</hi> can deprive no more than an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Authority.</hi> And why? Because a <hi>Synod</hi> proceeding <hi>unjustly</hi> cannot <hi>deprive</hi> of the <hi>Right.</hi> For <hi>to</hi> him, he says, <hi>it is absurd that</hi> any <note place="margin">P. 11.</note> 
               <hi>unjust sentence should take away the Right.</hi> Hence he iners that a <hi>Bishop substituted</hi> in the place of another <hi>unjustly deprived</hi> by a <hi>Synod,</hi> must also be <hi>no Bishop,</hi> if a <hi>Bishop substituted</hi> into a place <hi>vacated</hi> by a <hi>Lay deprivation</hi> be also <hi>none.</hi> This would indeed hold if a Bishop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived <hi>wrongfully</hi> by a <hi>competent Authority</hi> retained as much <hi>Right</hi> as he who had been <hi>deprived</hi> no otherwise than by an <hi>Authority</hi> that were <hi>incompetent.</hi> But the <hi>Doctor,</hi> methinks, might easily have discerned the <hi>difference</hi> if he would have been pleased to Judge <hi>impartially.</hi> All the <hi>Right</hi> that he has who is deprived <hi>unjustly,</hi> is only a <hi>Right</hi> to a <hi>juster sentence,</hi> either by an <hi>Appeal</hi> to a <hi>Superior Authority,</hi> if the <hi>Authority</hi> which has <hi>deprived</hi> him be <hi>subordinate;</hi> or in the <hi>Conscience</hi> of that <hi>same Authority</hi> which had <hi>deprived</hi> him, if it be it self <hi>Supreme.</hi> But till the <hi>competent Authority</hi> put him into <hi>Possession,</hi> he has no <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>consequences</hi> of <hi>Possession,</hi> the <hi>duties</hi> of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> and the <hi>actual benefits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of his <hi>Office.</hi> Nor has he any <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Possess</hi> himself of the place by <hi>violence,</hi> but must use <hi>Legal means</hi> of recovering what is already his due in <hi>Conscience.</hi> This he knows
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49601:15"/>
is the sense of our <hi>Legal Courts</hi> concerning <hi>Sentences</hi> pronunced by <hi>competent,</hi> though <hi>corrupt,</hi> Judges. But where the <hi>dispossession</hi> is by a <hi>Judge</hi> not <hi>competent,</hi> the <hi>injured</hi> Person may make use of <hi>force</hi> for regaining his <hi>Possession,</hi> and in the mean time he retains an <hi>actual Right</hi> to all the <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>benefits</hi> of his <hi>Office</hi> during his <hi>dispossession.</hi> This our Laws would allow the <hi>Doctor,</hi> if the King of <hi>France,</hi> or any other <hi>force</hi> not seconded with a <hi>Legal Right</hi> to <hi>use</hi> that <hi>force,</hi> should <hi>dispossess</hi> him of his <hi>Fellowship</hi> of <hi>Wadham</hi> Colledge, and substitute a <hi>Successor</hi> into his Place. Our <hi>Laws</hi> would notwithstanding own <hi>him</hi> as the true <hi>Fellow,</hi> Entitled to all the <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Fellowship,</hi> and would not allow his <hi>Rival</hi> as a <hi>Fellow,</hi> nor <hi>indemnify</hi> any that should pay <hi>him</hi> the Dues belonging to the Place, not allow him the <hi>Plea</hi> of a <hi>forcible entry,</hi> if the <hi>Doctor</hi> should recover his <hi>Possession</hi> by <hi>force.</hi> But none of these things would be allowed him, if himself had been <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,</hi> and his <hi>Rival substituted</hi> by the <hi>unjust Sentence</hi> of a <hi>corrupt Judge,</hi> but in a <hi>Legal Court.</hi> Thus he may see a <hi>better Reason</hi> than what is given by <hi>him</hi> for our <hi>Submission</hi> to an <hi>unjust Deprivation</hi> of a <hi>Synod.</hi> The <hi>actual Right</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> so <hi>deprived</hi> to the <hi>Duty</hi> of his <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Subjects,</hi> and the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of his <hi>Place,</hi> are really <hi>taken from</hi> him, till he be again <hi>possessed</hi> by the Acts of those who are <hi>empowered</hi> by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> to give <hi>Possession.</hi> And all the <hi>Right</hi> he has, is only in the <hi>Consciences</hi> of those who are empowered by the <hi>Laws</hi> for it, first to be <hi>put</hi> into the <hi>possession,</hi> and than to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Privildges</hi> annexed by the <hi>Law</hi> to be <hi>Legal Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</hi> This is very consistent with a <hi>paying</hi> the <hi>Rights consequent</hi> to <hi>Possession,</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> till the <hi>Possession</hi> be <hi>Legally</hi> restored. But even the <hi>Legal Possession</hi> by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and with regard to <hi>Conscience,</hi> cannot be <hi>affected</hi> by an <hi>invalid deprivation</hi> of an <hi>incompetent Judge.</hi>

            <p>As for the Case of <hi>Schism</hi> which he pretends to be <hi>avoided</hi> by them  by their <hi>compliance</hi> with the <hi>Usurpers,</hi> this <hi>Evil</hi> is so far from being <hi>avoided,</hi> as that it has been <hi>occasioned</hi> by it. The <hi>Doctor</hi> cannot deny but that their <hi>communicating</hi> with the <hi>Intruders,</hi> has occasioned a notorious <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> which on <hi>one</hi> side or the <hi>other,</hi> must needs be <hi>Schismatical.</hi> All therefore that he can pretend, is, that <hi>they,</hi> by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,</hi> are not chargable with the <hi>crime</hi> of the <hi>Schism</hi> that has been <hi>occasion'd</hi> by it. How so? it is because if we had also done as <hi>they</hi> have done, there had been no <hi>Schism.</hi> Very true. But it had been full as true, if <hi>they</hi> had done as <hi>we</hi> have done. This pretence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaves the <hi>Criminalness</hi> of the <hi>breach</hi> as uncertain as before, and necessarily puts them (for tryal of that) on the <hi>merit</hi> of the <hi>Cause.</hi> And if that be enquired into, all the <hi>Presumptions,</hi> as well as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Proofs,</hi> are in favour of <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>against them.</hi> We were plainly <hi>one</hi> before this <hi>breach.</hi> As therefore the <hi>branch</hi> it self is new, so the guilt of it must be resolved into the <hi>Innovations</hi> that <hi>occasion'd</hi> it, which will, by unavoidable <hi>consequence,</hi> make them chargeable with the <hi>breach</hi> who were guilty of the <hi>Innovations.</hi> The <hi>Innovations</hi> that have <hi>caused</hi> the <hi>breach,</hi> are the disowning our <hi>old Bishops,</hi> and <hi>substituting</hi> others in their <hi>Places,</hi> whilst themselves are <hi>living,</hi> and continue their <hi>Claim,</hi> and are not <hi>deprived</hi> by any <hi>Authority</hi> that had really a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>deprive them.</hi> But in these instances, <hi>they,</hi> not <hi>we,</hi> have been the <hi>Aggressors</hi> and <hi>Innovators.</hi> Do <hi>we</hi> own the <hi>Old Bishops</hi> for the <hi>true Bishops</hi> of these <hi>Sees,</hi> of which they have pretended to <hi>deprive</hi> them? And did not they do so too, as well as we, before the <hi>Deprivation?</hi> And what had <hi>they</hi> to pretend for themselves, why they do not so still. Besides this very <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Deprivation,</hi> which the <hi>Doctor</hi> owns
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49601:16"/>
to be <hi>invalid?</hi> And how can they <hi>justify</hi> their <hi>disowning</hi> them upon a <hi>Sentence</hi> confessedly <hi>invalid?</hi> This <hi>new</hi> behaviour of theirs, they must wholly own, as it is <hi>new,</hi> to be their <hi>own.</hi> We only <hi>continue</hi> to <hi>own</hi> our Holy <hi>Fathers,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Hody</hi> himself and his Brethren did formerly. As for the <hi>Second</hi> Act, the setting up <hi>new Bishops</hi> in <hi>opposition</hi> to <hi>our</hi> Fathers, they cannot excuse themselves from being the <hi>Innovators,</hi> and concerning <hi>us, they</hi> cannot <hi>pretend</hi> it. <hi>They</hi> have <hi>made</hi> the <hi>new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> who <hi>consecrated</hi> them, and <hi>they</hi> also who <hi>own</hi> them by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating</hi> with <hi>them,</hi> or their <hi>Consecrators,</hi> These have intirely been the Acts of the <hi>Ecclesiasticks.</hi> Yet without these, all that the <hi>Lay-Power</hi> could have done, could never have formed a <hi>Schism,</hi> nor <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> our <hi>Communion.</hi> And as to what has been done on <hi>both</hi> sides, <hi>we</hi> can better excuse our <hi>selves,</hi> than <hi>they</hi> can. Could <hi>they</hi> and <hi>we</hi> have consented to have acted <hi>Uniformly,</hi> there could have been no <hi>Schism:</hi> But <hi>we</hi> can better account for <hi>our</hi> not complying with <hi>them,</hi> than they can for not complying with <hi>us.</hi> On <hi>their</hi> side, they have nothing to plead but <hi>worldly</hi> Considerations. <hi>They</hi> could not doubt of the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> with regard to <hi>conscience,</hi> of <hi>doing</hi> that on <hi>their</hi> side, which, if <hi>done,</hi> had <hi>prevented</hi> the <hi>Schism. They</hi> can pretend no <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> in <hi>Conscience,</hi> for setting up <hi>other Bishops,</hi> as <hi>we</hi> can, for <hi>not owning</hi> them; till <hi>they</hi> can <hi>prove us</hi> fairly <hi>discharged</hi> in <hi>Conscience,</hi> which <hi>they,</hi> as well as <hi>we,</hi> were <hi>obliged</hi> in, in regard of the old <hi>true Proprie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tors.</hi> They could pretend no <hi>cementing Principles</hi> essential to the <hi>subsistence</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as a <hi>Society,</hi> and a <hi>Communion</hi> independent on the <hi>State,</hi> obliging them to <hi>comply</hi> with these <hi>encroachments</hi> of the <hi>Politicions,</hi> for making <hi>Spiritual</hi> considerations to give way to <hi>Temporals. They</hi> could pretend no <hi>Catholick Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in <hi>any</hi> Age, <hi>approving</hi> what was done by <hi>them,</hi> as <hi>we</hi> can of the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>purest</hi> Ages, for what has been done by <hi>Us. They</hi> could not pretend any such <hi>united Authority,</hi> of even the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> before this <hi>change,</hi> for many things wherein we differ <hi>now,</hi> as <hi>we</hi> can. So far <hi>thay</hi> have been from <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding Schism</hi> by these <hi>compliances,</hi> or from <hi>purging</hi> themselves from the <hi>guilt</hi> of the <hi>Schism</hi> which has followed thereupon.</p>

has insisted on, which (if they prove any thing) proceed in general, that is, prove <hi>Bishops obliged</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> to <hi>yield</hi> their <hi>Rights</hi> as often as they are <hi>invaded,</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> as <hi>generally</hi> absolved from their <hi>Duty</hi> to such <hi>Bishops</hi> though the <hi>Bishop</hi> should think fit to <hi>assert</hi> their <hi>Rights.</hi> Both of these are asserted by him on account of the <hi>irresistibleness</hi> of the <hi>force</hi> which brings on the <hi>violence,</hi> which is an Argument that must always hold on the side of the <hi>State,</hi> in all Disputes that she has with the <hi>Church.</hi> These things asserted by <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> such as the <hi>Doctor</hi> is, must for <hi>ever</hi> encourage the <hi>Laity,</hi> who are not acted by great <hi>skill,</hi> as well as <hi>good inclinations</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> to believe they do <hi>well</hi> in what they do of this <hi>kind,</hi> and therefore to <hi>repeat</hi> it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any scruple.

We are only for <hi>denying</hi> Obedience to an <hi>incompetent Authority,</hi> that <hi>invades</hi> Rights which do not <hi>belong</hi> to it. And for this it is certainly a very <hi>just</hi> reason for <hi>denying</hi> them what they have <hi>no Right</hi> to, if <hi>yielding</hi> will encourage them to the <hi>like</hi> Injuries and Usurpations <hi>frequently,</hi> which it must needs do, if they must never expect <hi>opposition,</hi> how frequently soever they are pleased to <hi>renew</hi> the <hi>Injuries;</hi> nay, if Persons concerned <hi>against</hi> them, shall encourage them in the <hi>belief</hi> that they are <hi>no Injuries</hi> at all.

but <hi>Episcopacy</hi> it self.

There the <hi>Doctor</hi> may <hi>see,</hi> what he seys he cannot <hi>imagine,</hi> that what <hi>he</hi> calls <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> can <hi>concur</hi> for the <hi>deprivation,</hi> not of a <hi>Bishop</hi> only, but of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> And we have little security that it shall not be put in <hi>Practice,</hi> if we must by <hi>Principles,</hi> as he does, <hi>allow</hi> them to do it here, upon an <hi>occasion</hi> that they shall judge <hi>Extraordinary.</hi> That <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occasion</hi> is not very difficult to be found by them, who make <hi>Spiritual</hi> considerations give way to <hi>Temporal.</hi> The use of the <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Revenues</hi> for carrying on the present expensive <hi>War,</hi> is likely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be <hi>judged</hi> so. And the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> who was himself a <hi>King,</hi> has warned us not <hi>to put confidence in Princes.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi> indeed tells us, that the <hi>Bishops</hi> here have <hi>the same Security</hi> that other <hi>Subjects</hi> have. I am sure they ought to have it, not only for the reason of the things, but by our <hi>Constitution.</hi> Their <hi>Rights</hi> ought to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>more sacred</hi> than any <hi>other Rights</hi> or <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Subjects</hi> and therefore <hi>more inviolable.</hi> All the <hi>Sacredness</hi> that has been made use of by our <hi>Legislators</hi> for securing them, has been derived from the interposition of the Clergy, who, if they be not treated as <hi>sacred</hi> themselves, can never secure <hi>other Rights</hi> which have no other <hi>sacredness</hi> than what they derive from the intervention of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> But if he considers how little <hi>Laws</hi> often signify considering those who are allowed the Authority of <hi>Authentically Interpreting</hi> and <hi>Executing</hi> them, and what <hi>Principles</hi> are now allowed in those who are thought <hi>qualified</hi> for that <hi>Authentical Interpretation</hi> and <hi>Execution;</hi> I know no sort of <hi>Subject</hi> that he could pitch on that either have been, or are likely to be, treated so arbitrarily by our <hi>Legislators.</hi> The <hi>Laity</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> time, dissolved whole <hi>Bodies</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>alienated</hi> their <hi>revenues,</hi> without any <hi>consent</hi> of those <hi>Bodies,</hi> or of any <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized</hi> to <hi>represent them,</hi> without any <hi>Legal trial</hi> or <hi>eviction</hi> in any form of <hi>Law.</hi> When has any such thing been ever attempted against any <hi>Lay Bodies</hi> by their <hi>Representatives</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> who were chosen to <hi>preserve,</hi> not to <hi>oppress,</hi> the <hi>Liberties</hi> of those who <hi>chose</hi> them.

            <p>Nor can this be thought strange, if we consider the <hi>Opinions</hi> than generally receiv'd concerning the <hi>Benefits</hi> then expected from their  <hi>Perist-hood,</hi> far <hi>greater</hi> than could be pretended to by the <hi>Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</hi> This was indisputable, when its benefits were believ'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the <hi>Future Life</hi> as well as <hi>this,</hi> as it was generally believed by the <hi>Jews</hi> of the <hi>Apostolical Age</hi> (excepting only the Sect of the <hi>Sadducees,)</hi> and as we <hi>Christians</hi> are assured of it <hi>now</hi> in the times of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Whether those <hi>Rewards</hi> were by GOD <hi>eexpresly Cove nanted</hi> for, or only as a Divine <hi>gratuity</hi> reserved for the <hi>Peculium</hi> as his <hi>Favourites,</hi> more than could be expected from the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> or whether they were <hi>implicitely</hi> understood, as included in the <hi>Mystical</hi> sense of the <hi>Covenant</hi> it self, as either discovered by the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Reasonings,</hi> or the <hi>Oral Traditions</hi> of their <hi>Ancestors,</hi> is not perhaps so easie to determine. Yet certain it is, that they were <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>generally</hi> believed by the <hi>Jews</hi> of the <hi>Apostolical Age.</hi> This appears in that it is noted as a <hi>singularity</hi> in the <hi>Sadducees</hi> to deny them; Thence it appears, that the Three <hi>other Sects</hi> of the <hi>Pharisees, Essens,</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeans,</hi> were all <hi>agreed</hi> against the <hi>Sadducees</hi> in asserting them.

               <hi>Pharisees</hi> alone  for securing himself against them. Now all the Challenge of the. <hi>Benefits</hi> proper to the <hi>Peculium,</hi> depended on the <hi>Right</hi> they had to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the publick <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant</hi> transacted in them. God's <hi>Promises</hi> were his <hi>part</hi> of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant</hi> is expresly said to have been by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> Psal. L. 5. that being the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way used in those times of transacting <hi>Covenants</hi> between <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> also. As therefore it was in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> to which the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Sacrificing</hi> was then <hi>confined,</hi> to <hi>admit</hi> to, or <hi>exclude</hi> from, the <hi>participation</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> so it must consequently have been in the <hi>power</hi> of that <hi>Sacred Function,</hi> to <hi>grant</hi> or <hi>deny,</hi> these <hi>Benefits,</hi> which were not attainable otherwise than by those <hi>Sacrifices</hi> But these are <hi>Benefits</hi> manifestly beyond the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>greater</hi> than any to which <hi>his Power</hi> does extend. The <hi>Magistrate</hi> can conser no Title to <hi>Future</hi> and <hi>Eternal Rewards</hi> to Persons other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise never so well qualified for receiving them.

How than could he pretend to to that <hi>Power?</hi> How could he <hi>give</hi> or <hi>take</hi> away a Power from <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> to which himself could not pretend? How could he suppose his <hi>Act</hi> would be <hi>ratified</hi> in <hi>Heaven?</hi> Or how imagine GOD <hi>obliged</hi> by it, to <hi>reject</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> whom he as <hi>Prince</hi> was pleased to <hi>reject,</hi> and <hi>accept</hi> of others who were <hi>permitted</hi> only by his <hi>Authority</hi> to officiate at GOD's <hi>Altar?</hi> And what could all his <hi>intermedling</hi> in these matters <hi>signify,</hi> if he cannot <hi>oblige God</hi> to <hi>ratify</hi> what is done by him? if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding GOD should <hi>accept</hi> of the Person <hi>rejected</hi> by him, and <hi>reject</hi> the Person <hi>obtruded</hi> by the <hi>Civil Magistrate?</hi> Nothing certainly, with regard to <hi>Conscience,</hi> which is the <hi>principal</hi> consideration in this Case.</p>

The <hi>Magistrate</hi> of <hi>this World,</hi> could not, in his <hi>own Right,</hi> challenge any <hi>Power</hi> in things relating to the <hi>other World.</hi> The only way therefore left him, by which he might challenge it, must have been some <hi>Donation</hi> of GOD. Yet niether for this was there any the least Pretence. No <hi>Text</hi> of written <hi>Revelation</hi> ever so much, that I know of, as <hi>Pretended</hi> for it. And no <hi>likelihood</hi> for it, in the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> it self. No <hi>probability,</hi> that GOD would <hi>intrust</hi> Concernments of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> incomparably more <hi>Noble,</hi> with a <hi>Magistracy</hi> less <hi>Noble</hi> than the <hi>Trusts</hi> committed to it.

            <p>Nor did this <hi>Reasoning</hi> hold only our Supposition that the <hi>Benefits</hi>  of the <hi>Priest-hood</hi> were thought to extend to a <hi>future State.</hi> Though it had only related to <hi>this World,</hi> as all other <hi>Priest hood</hi> besides that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did undoubtedly; yet even so, there was no reason to believe the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> had any <hi>Rights</hi> to dispose of it. This at least was thought certain that the High <hi>Priest</hi> who could <hi>oblige</hi> GOD to <hi>accept him</hi> and his <hi>Obligations,</hi> (without which all his <hi>Ministry</hi> must have been <hi>unavailable)</hi> must first have been suppos'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive <hi>Authority</hi> from <hi>God.</hi> Had the <hi>Priest</hi> only represented the <hi>People,</hi> there might have been some <hi>pretence</hi> for the <hi>Magistrates</hi> interest in <hi>appointing</hi> and <hi>removing</hi> the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Priest,</hi> as being himself invested with all the <hi>Power</hi> that can be derived from an <hi>Original</hi> purely <hi>Humane.</hi> But as the <hi>Priest</hi> has a Power of <hi>Blessing</hi> and <hi>Cursing</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively, so as to <hi>oblige</hi> GOD to <hi>ratify</hi> his <hi>Blessing</hi> and <hi>Curses,</hi> as Men have qualified themselves respectively; so it is certain that he cannot <hi>oblige</hi> GOD, unless he <hi>represent</hi> GOD, which he can never do, unless GOD have granted him <hi>Authority</hi> to do so. And as he does not only <hi>offer</hi> the Peoples <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> but offers them with a <hi>Title</hi> to <hi>acceptance,</hi> so he must himself be a <hi>Person acceptable to GOD</hi> on account of his <hi>Office,</hi> which he cannot be presumed to be if he <hi>come</hi> into his Office any other way than GOD has <hi>appointed</hi> for his <hi>Admission.</hi> Indeed the whole ground of his <hi>obliging</hi> GOD depends on <hi>GOD'S Promise,</hi> which is <hi>GOD'S Part</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And in this regard none can <hi>oblige</hi> GOD but the <hi>Priest,</hi> and no <hi>Priest</hi> but he who has before been appointed by God to do so. <hi>Covenants</hi> are <hi>mutual,</hi> and therefore <hi>require,</hi> and <hi>give</hi> Security, on <hi>both Parts</hi> concerned in them. The <hi>Priest</hi> therefore, as, in a lower sense, <hi>mediating</hi> in this <hi>Covenant</hi> between <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> is to procure Security on <hi>GODS</hi> side, as well as on <hi>ours.</hi> This he cannot do but by <hi>obliging</hi> GOD to <hi>promise</hi> Performance on his part, of what is to be done by <hi>him</hi> as <hi>his part</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And that <hi>Promise</hi> being <hi>GOD'S</hi> part of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> he cannot be <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>it</hi> any other way than as he is obliged to the <hi>Covenant</hi> it self. Nor can he be obliged by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> if the <hi>Priest</hi> be not <hi>first Authorized</hi> by him to <hi>Covenant</hi> for <hi>him,</hi> and to oblige him by that <hi>Act</hi> of his own <hi>Authority.</hi> Thus there, fore it appears that the <hi>Priest</hi> as a Common <hi>Mediator</hi> in a <hi>Covenant</hi> between <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> must therefore be invested with a <hi>Divine,</hi> as well a <hi>Humane,</hi> Authority.</p>

            <head>§ XXXVI. And that also according to the <hi>Opinions</hi> of those times.</head>
            <p>Nor was this <hi>Reasoning</hi> only <hi>true,</hi> but also <hi>believed</hi> to be so in the  <hi>times</hi> I am now discoursing of. St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly supposes it as true of <hi>Priests</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> in his <hi>Reasonings</hi> in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> That <hi>Priests</hi> ought to be <hi>Authorized</hi> by the <hi>GOD</hi> for whom they are to Officiate. <hi>Every High Priests taken from among Men is ordain'd for Men in things pertaining to GOD, that he may offer both gifts and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for Sin.</hi> Heb. V. I. And he tells us by <hi>whom</hi> they were so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ordained, <hi>v. 4. No Man taketh this honour to himself; but he that was called of GOD, as was Aaron.</hi> The Proposition is <hi>Universal.</hi> Accordingly he observes that <hi>CHRIST also glorified not himself; to be made an High Priest: But he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee,</hi> v. 5. And that he also was <hi>called of GOD an High Priest,</hi> though <hi>of the Order of Melchisedec.</hi> v. 10. The Duty must be <hi>Universal,</hi> when he <hi>Reasons</hi> thus upon it from the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Priest-hood (which himself counts of <hi>another Order</hi> Chap. VII. 11.) to that of <hi>Melchisedec.</hi> The Apostle here Speaks exactly according to the sense of the Old Testament. GOD there also says concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons: <hi>I have given your Priests Office unto You.</hi> Numb. XVIII. 7. And again: <hi>Behold I also have given Thee the Charge of mine <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eave offerings, of all the hallowed things of the Children of Israel. Unto thee have I given them by reason of the Anointing, and to thy Sons, by an Ordinance for ever.</hi> v. 8. This was said after the punishment of <hi>Korah,</hi> and the <hi>Second</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the <hi>Priest-hood</hi> to them, by the <hi>blossoming</hi> of <hi>Aarons Rod.</hi> No doubt with a design to intimate that they who should come in otherwise, should be as <hi>Korah and his Company</hi> (so it is expressed Chap XVI. 40) though not in the <hi>Miraculousness</hi> of their <hi>Punishment,</hi> yet at least in the <hi>Unacceptableness</hi> of their <hi>Ministry.</hi> It is withal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable further, that <hi>GODS</hi> giving the <hi>Priest hood</hi> is said to have been <hi>by reason of the Anointing,</hi> that is, by the Rites of <hi>Consecration.</hi> It is certain. GOD did <hi>intend,</hi> as in other things, so particularly in his <hi>Priests,</hi> on occasion of <hi>whom</hi> he says it, to be <hi>Sanctified in them that come nigh him,</hi> Lev. X. 3. In order whereunto it was requisite that they also should be <hi>Holy</hi> as he was <hi>Holy:</hi> This was a <hi>federal</hi> and <hi>external Holiness,</hi> upon account of their being <hi>initiated</hi> into their <hi>Office</hi> by the <hi>external</hi> and <hi>federal</hi> Rites of <hi>Consecration,</hi> among which this of the <hi>Anointing</hi> was the <hi>principal.</hi> Whosoever therefore was not thus Anointed, was, for that very reason, presumed not to be <hi>Holy,</hi> nor therefore <hi>acceptable</hi> to <hi>GOD,</hi> and consequently <hi>uncapable</hi> of the <hi>Priest-hood.</hi> But this <hi>Anointing</hi> required not only the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but of the <hi>Person</hi> also that administred it, and that in a higher degree than could belong to the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi> The Princes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had an <hi>Unction,</hi> and were by that enabled to perform some
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49601:27"/>
               <hi>lower</hi> Acts of <hi>Consecration.</hi> So <hi>Solomon</hi> makes the <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Temple.</hi> But the principal <hi>Consecration</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> was by the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> in which the forementioned examples of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> shew that the <hi>Prince</hi> had no <hi>Right</hi> to intermeddle. What <hi>Moses</hi> did in the <hi>Consecrating Aaron</hi> and his <hi>Sons,</hi> was by special direction from GOD, and before GOD had confined to <hi>Priest hood,</hi> and therefore could not be made a <hi>Precedent</hi> afterwards. After that <hi>first Consecration</hi> was performed, we never find <hi>Moses</hi> any further inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddling, but he leaves all the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Priest hood</hi> afterward to them who, by that <hi>first Consecration,</hi> were <hi>Authorized</hi> for them. <hi>The Unction</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Priest-hood</hi> did so far exceed the <hi>Unction</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Regal Power,</hi> that the <hi>Princes</hi> intervention in the <hi>Consecrating</hi> of a <hi>Priest</hi> could not, in the sense of those times, be taken for the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> requisite for giving a <hi>Priest-hood.</hi> It is very true, the <hi>King,</hi> on account of his <hi>Anointing,</hi> was counted <hi>Holy.</hi> And so were <hi>all the Congregation holy.</hi> Numb. XVI. 3. And it is reckoned among the <hi>Privildeges</hi> of the <hi>Peculium</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> that they were a <hi>Holy-Priest-hood.</hi> Yet that did not excuse them from a great <hi>Piacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> crime, whenever they invaded any <hi>Offices</hi> of their own <hi>Priest-hood.</hi> Every lower degree of <hi>Holiness</hi> was counted <hi>Prophane</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of that which was <hi>above</hi> it. As therefore the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were reputed <hi>Prophane</hi> in comparison of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were equal in <hi>Holiness</hi> to the Gentiles <hi>Priest hood;</hi> so the <hi>Laity</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> were reckoned <hi>Prophane</hi> in Comparison of the <hi>Levites,</hi> as the <hi>Levites</hi> also, in comparison of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Priests,</hi> and those also in comparison of the <hi>High Priest;</hi> and were accordingly treated by GOD, it they presumed on <hi>Offices</hi> higher than those committed to them. Though therefore the <hi>Prince</hi> was more <hi>Holy</hi> than the <hi>Laity.</hi> yet that did not warrant his invasion of the <hi>Office</hi> of the meanest <hi>Levite.</hi> So far it was from giving him any Power over the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> it self. He had no Power of <hi>Inaugurating,</hi> and therefore had none of <hi>Exaugurating,</hi> to speak in the old <hi>Roman Pontifical</hi> Style.</p>

            <p>Thus it appears on all accounts, that judging by the <hi>Doctrines</hi>  received in that Age, <hi>Solomon</hi> could not pretend any <hi>direct Power,</hi> for depriving <hi>Abiathor</hi> of his <hi>Priest hood.</hi> Hence it follows <hi>3ly,</hi> That all that <hi>Solomon</hi> could do, on account of his <hi>Regal Power,</hi> was only to exercise that external <hi>Force</hi> on him, which he might justify, on consideration of his <hi>Secular Crime,</hi> as his <hi>Sovereign</hi> in <hi>Seculars,</hi> which though it could not in <hi>Conscience</hi> deprive <hi>Abiathar</hi> of his <hi>Right</hi> yet might (in the <hi>Consequence)</hi> make all the <hi>exercise</hi> of his <hi>Right</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.

               <hi>Stretch out his hand against the Lord's Anointed, and be guiltless,</hi> That is, without being <hi>guilty</hi> of a <hi>Piacular</hi> Crime.

That GOD had given the <hi>less Noble</hi> Office a more <hi>effectual</hi> Security, as to this world, against <hi>encroachments,</hi> he had reason to look on as a Wise provision for the <hi>Publick,</hi> that where there might otherwise have been the most <hi>Specious pretentions,</hi> and consequently the greatest <hi>Temptations</hi> to <hi>encroaching,</hi> there might be the lesser <hi>advantage</hi> for it.

I know very well that this particle <hi>that,</hi> is used in the <hi>N.

But the <hi>circumstances</hi> of this place make it probable that <hi>Solomon</hi> knew what he did, and <hi>intended</hi> the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of that Prophesy, and that what he did was done by him <hi>purposely,</hi> for that very <hi>end,</hi> that he might <hi>fullfill</hi> it. The Prediction was very notorious, being <hi>twice</hi> repeated, first by a <hi>Man of GOD, 1 Sam.</hi> II. 27, then by <hi>Samuel</hi> also, <hi>Chap.</hi> III. 11. as the first <hi>initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of him into his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office, which recommended him to <hi>all Israel from Dan to Beersheba,</hi> as one that <hi>was established to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Lord, v.</hi> 20. It was also in both Cases notified to <hi>Eli</hi> himself, that all, as well <hi>Friends</hi> as <hi>Enemies,</hi> might know it. How therefore can we believe <hi>Solomon</hi> ignorant of it? Then the distance of the <hi>time</hi> between <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> was such, as that there was <hi>reason</hi> to expect that it should be fullfilled in <hi>Abiathar,</hi> if it were fullfilled at <hi>all.</hi> Such punishments of the Children for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were not usually deferred beyond the <hi>fourth generation,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the words of the 2d <hi>Commandment.</hi> So also in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then History,</hi> the treachery of <hi>Gyges</hi> against <hi>Candaules</hi> was punished in <hi>Croesus,</hi> who was in the <hi>fourth</hi> generation descended from <hi>Gyges;</hi> as <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Conspiracy was also, in his <hi>fourth</hi> generation, in the <hi>Sacred</hi> History. By these Examples we find a <hi>consent</hi> in those <hi>Traditions</hi> of the earlier Times. And the distance between <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> could

not be <hi>less.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Joseph <hi>Anti.</hi> Lib. VIII. c. 1</note> 
               <hi>Josephus</hi> indeed makes <hi>Eli</hi> to have been the <hi>Grand-Father</hi> to <hi>Abiathar.</hi> But it is certain that they were further removed than so. <hi>Abiathar</hi> was himself the Son of <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> and <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the Son of <hi>Ahitub.</hi> So <hi>Ahitub</hi> must have been his <hi>Grand-Father.</hi> Thus it appears that <hi>Abiathar</hi> was, at <hi>least,</hi> in the <hi>fourth</hi> Generation from <hi>Eli,</hi> whose Sin was to be punished in him. Further yet, <hi>Ahitub</hi> is said to have been the <hi>Brother of Ichabod, the Son of Phineas, the Son of Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. XIV. 3. Thus <hi>Abiathar</hi> will be the Vth from <hi>Eli,</hi> (if <hi>both terms</hi> be included) and in the 4th <hi>Generation,</hi> in the utmost way of counting possible. There was therefore no reason to expect any further <hi>delay</hi> of that punishment which had been so long before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. And therefore <hi>Abiathar</hi> was the <hi>Person</hi> in whom it was to be expected. This being so, <hi>Solomon</hi> could not but look on it as very <hi>Providential,</hi> that <hi>Abiathar</hi> should be permitted by GOD to fall into the conspiracy of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> and thereby to incur his <hi>Royal</hi> displeasure, in whose Power it was to <hi>execute</hi> the Divine Sentence on him, by that Power of <hi>Force</hi> which GOD had committed to the <hi>Prince.</hi> It tended withal very much to confirm the same Observation, that, for above 40 Years since his first evil (for so many years were contained in <hi>Davids</hi> Reign reckoned from the death of <hi>Saul) Abiathar</hi> should have no Posterity that might Succeed him in his Office, if this was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Case. For by this it appar'd necessary that if <hi>he</hi> were <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd,</hi> the whole <hi>family</hi> of <hi>Ithamar</hi> should be deprived also, at least the <hi>Family</hi> of <hi>Eli,</hi> as the <hi>Prophesies</hi> forementioned had foretold. For as for the <hi>rest</hi> of his <hi>Family, Saul</hi> seems to have destroyed it universally. These Observations put together might give <hi>reason</hi> to believe, that <hi>this</hi> was the very <hi>time</hi> design'd by GOD for the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of this <hi>Prophesy.</hi> At the same time <hi>Zadok</hi> was firm to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Interests, which seemed to tend to <hi>fullfil</hi> the <hi>Prophesy</hi> to <hi>Phineas</hi> of an <hi>everlasting Priest-hood,</hi> implying that the time should come, when the whole suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from <hi>Aaron</hi> should be confined to the Family of <hi>Phineas,</hi> which therefore was <hi>not</hi> to <hi>fail</hi> together with the other collateral Branches derived from <hi>Aaron.</hi> But I rather believe, that <hi>Abiathar</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did <hi>not</hi> fail intirely, which still makes further for my purpose, that what <hi>Solomon</hi> did in this matter, was really with a <hi>design</hi> and <hi>prospect</hi> on the <hi>Prophesy</hi> it self. Otherwise, had he only designed a <hi>Personal</hi> punishment for <hi>Abiathar,</hi> that might have been done by removing <hi>him</hi> form the <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> and Substituting the <hi>next</hi> of the Family of <hi>Ithamar</hi> in his place. What he did <hi>more</hi> is not, any other way, so well accountable, as by supposing him to have had a direct <hi>design</hi> of <hi>fullfilling</hi> the <hi>Prophesy.</hi> It is otherwise as apparent from the <hi>Prophesy</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:49601:30"/>
it self, that <hi>Eli</hi> was to have a <hi>Posterity</hi> that was to <hi>Survive</hi> the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the Prophesy, as that they were to be deprived of the <hi>Priest hood</hi> by it. What else can be the meaning of those Words? <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. II. 36.</note>

            <p>Hence it follows 7ly, that, even by <hi>our</hi> Principles, the <hi>Jews</hi> had  no reason to make any <hi>Separation</hi> on <hi>Abiathar's</hi> account, though we should suppose him deprived, not <hi>unjustly</hi> only, but <hi>invalidly</hi> also. For supposing his deprivation <hi>invalid,</hi> all that can follow is, that still he <hi>retain'd</hi> the same <hi>Right</hi> as to Conscience, which he had <hi>before.</hi> But even that would not have sufficed for to justifie a <hi>Separation,</hi> on his account. Even before, not <hi>he,</hi> but <hi>Zadok;</hi> was the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> So that, in case of <hi>difference,</hi> they were still secure in adhering to <hi>Zadok,</hi> in opposition to all others whatsoever, whoever he were that occasioned the <hi>Separation.</hi> Even before, therefore, <hi>Zadok,</hi> owed no duty to him, but <hi>he</hi> to <hi>Zadok;</hi> and consequently, not <hi>Zadok,</hi> but <hi>he.</hi> had been guilty of the <hi>Schism</hi> that would have followed upon the difference. If such an <hi>invalid</hi> deprivation could not affect, or weaken, the Title of <hi>Abiathar,</hi> as to <hi>Conscience,</hi> much less can it be pretended to affect that of <hi>Zadok,</hi> who was not any way concerned in it. Even before, the <hi>Duty</hi> of the <hi>Communicants,</hi> in case of such division, had been still owing to <hi>Zadok;</hi> and therefore they also must have involved themselves in the <hi>Schism,</hi> if, upon pretence of their <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>Abiathar,</hi> they had violated their <hi>more sacred</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>Zadok,</hi> to whom <hi>Abiathar</hi> himself owed <hi>Duty,</hi> as well as they. Indeed they owed <hi>Abiathar</hi> no <hi>Duty</hi> at all, but in <hi>subordination</hi> and <hi>dependence</hi> on their antecedent <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>Zadok:</hi> And therefore when that <hi>subordination</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> had been taken away, as it must have been by a notorious <hi>Separation,</hi> they could not then owe <hi>Abiathar</hi> any <hi>duty</hi> at all; and therefore thy must have <hi>broken</hi> their <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>Zadok,</hi> in paying any to <hi>Abiathar.</hi> For thus it is in other <hi>subordination</hi> also. Whilst a <hi>General</hi> does himself observe his own <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,</hi> his <hi>Soldiers</hi> cannot pay their <hi>duty</hi> to the common <hi>Sovereign,</hi> without paying it to the <hi>General,</hi> who has the <hi>Sovereign's Authority</hi> to exact <hi>duty</hi> from <hi>them.</hi> But if the <hi>General,</hi> revolt, <hi>they</hi> are judged <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> as well as <hi>he,</hi> to the common <hi>Sovereign,</hi> if, upon any pretence whatsoever, they pay <hi>him</hi> any <hi>Duty</hi> at all. So far <hi>this</hi> Case there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is from being paralled to <hi>that</hi> of our present <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> that here the <hi>Reasoning</hi> and the <hi>Duty</hi> lie directly contrary.

for <hi>executing</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Office</hi> committed to them. And that the <hi>later</hi> was consecrated into his <hi>Predecessor</hi>'s Place, both without the <hi>consent,</hi> and by the <hi>subjects</hi> of his <hi>Predecessor,</hi> was as applicable to all his <hi>Predecessors</hi> as <hi>himself,</hi> and therefore must as much weaken <hi>their Title</hi> also, as it did <hi>his,</hi> and make them only <hi>equal</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> on this consideration also. This would resolve the <hi>Right</hi> only into some <hi>dead</hi> Person, whose <hi>Rights</hi> all <hi>Laws</hi> determine with their <hi>Lives,</hi> especially were no Person <hi>living</hi> is concerned in them. All therefore that can be said in this Case is, that what ought <hi>not</hi> to have been done at <hi>first,</hi> was now <hi>done,</hi> and <hi>ratified</hi> by <hi>Providence,</hi> the same way as all other <hi>Humane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as well <hi>Secular</hi> as <hi>Sacred,</hi> are usually changed by <hi>Prescription;</hi> which by the Law of <hi>Nations,</hi> and with relation to the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> and <hi>Governments</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> is, in process of <hi>time,</hi> judged suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficien to <hi>extinguish</hi> an Original <hi>Right,</hi> and to make that a <hi>RIGHT</hi> which at <hi>first</hi> was no other than <hi>invasion</hi> and <hi>Violence.</hi> This holds especcially where the <hi>Right</hi> is only <hi>Personal,</hi> as that of the <hi>Priest-hood</hi> was; and the Person made <hi>uncapable</hi> of holding it. <hi>Mutilation</hi> alone was sufficient to have taken away the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Priest hood,</hi> by the same <hi>Law</hi> that gave a <hi>Right</hi> to it, and therefore much more <hi>Death.</hi> This was really the <hi>Case,</hi> when our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> communicated with the <hi>High-Priests,</hi> obtruded by the <hi>Romans. Josephus</hi> himself observes, that whereas the <hi>High Priest-hood</hi> was before for <hi>Life,</hi> then it was <hi>not</hi>

            <p>If our Adversaries will needs Reason from <hi>Precedents</hi> of <hi>those times,</hi> they must put a Case exactly <hi>Parallel</hi> with Ours, of a <hi>High-Priest</hi>  possessed of a Title <hi>unquestionably</hi> better than his <hi>Successors,</hi> yet vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently forced, as <hi>Ours</hi> are, out of his <hi>Possession.</hi> This Case, I grant, did frequently befall the <hi>Jews</hi> when they were Subject to <hi>Infidel Magistrates.</hi> But it was in <hi>such times</hi> whose <hi>Practice</hi> we cannot reckon upon as <hi>Infallible,</hi> as we <hi>can</hi> upon that of our Blessed <hi>SAVIOUR</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> Here therefore we cannot reckon upon their bare <hi>Practice,</hi> That, what was <hi>done,</hi> was as it ought to be, purely on this <hi>account</hi> alone, because it was <hi>done;</hi> but, independently on that, we must enquire what the <hi>Principles</hi> then received obliged them to do, if they would approve themselves <hi>true</hi> to them. And here, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shewn that <hi>External Force</hi> alone was sufficient to make all <hi>exercise</hi> of the <hi>Priest hood impracticable,</hi> to the Person so deprived by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Force.</hi> Hence it follows, that it was not in their Power <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> to <hi>assert</hi> his <hi>Right,</hi> by <hi>communicating</hi> with him in <hi>Acts</hi> of his <hi>Sacerdotal Authority.</hi> For him to erect any <hi>other Altar,</hi> where it might be in his <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Officiate,</hi> besides that in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was condemned as <hi>Schismatical,</hi> by the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of those <hi>Ages,</hi> in the Case of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and upon the same accounts as the Worship in the <hi>High places</hi> had been condemned in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and as the <hi>Altar</hi> built by the <hi>Tribes</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan</hi> was condemned, till they knew the true <hi>design</hi> of that <hi>Altar,</hi> that it was only for a <hi>Monument</hi> of their <hi>Interest</hi> in the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> not for <hi>opposite Sacrifices.</hi> The only way therefore <hi>left</hi> them to <hi>assert</hi> his <hi>Right,</hi> had been to have <hi>abstained</hi> from <hi>Communicating</hi> in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of his <hi>Rival</hi> in the <hi>Temple.</hi> But there is great <hi>reason</hi> to believe that <hi>that</hi> was more than they could justify <hi>then;</hi> and that reason, <hi>peculiar</hi> to their <hi>Constitution</hi> at <hi>that time,</hi> which therefore cannot be drawn into Consequence <hi>now</hi> under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> nor applyed to the Case of our <hi>present</hi> Holy <hi>Fathers.</hi> It is certain
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49601:35"/>
that their Communion <hi>then</hi> was as much <hi>confined</hi> by <hi>GOD</hi> to the <hi>One Altar</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as to the <hi>One High Priest.</hi> The only Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration remaining, is whether of the two Regards was <hi>principal.</hi> That is the proper way to determine, whether was to <hi>give way</hi> to the other, where both could not be had: That is, whether that <hi>Altar</hi> was to be taken for the <hi>One Altar</hi> designed by <hi>GOD,</hi> where the <hi>true High Priest</hi> officiated, who had the nearest <hi>Title</hi> in the order of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> from <hi>Aaron?</hi> Or, whether that <hi>High Priest</hi> was to be taken for the <hi>true Representative</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and thereby could oblige GOD to performance, who <hi>officiated</hi> at the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> provided he were otherwise qualified, by being of the Posterity of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and of the <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Phineas,</hi> and fairly <hi>consecrated</hi> by those who had <hi>Power</hi> to consecrate him, though he were not the <hi>next</hi> that was legally qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of that very <hi>Line.</hi> And we have reason to believe, that the <hi>Altar</hi> was the <hi>principal</hi> Consideration in the Design of <hi>GOD,</hi> who thereby secured the <hi>Communion</hi> against <hi>Schismatical Factions,</hi> even of the <hi>High-Priests</hi> themselves, by allowing none for his <hi>authorized Representatives</hi> but those who were <hi>possessed</hi> of that <hi>One Altar.</hi> For <hi>Jerusalem</hi> alone is called the <hi>Holy City,</hi> St. Matt. IV. 5. XXVII. 53. and so call'd in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Coins for that very Reason, because that was the <hi>place where men ought to worship,</hi> St. Joh IV. 20. That only was the <hi>place</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were to bring their <hi>Tythes</hi> and <hi>Offerings,</hi> and where all their <hi>Males</hi> were, <hi>thrice</hi> a <hi>Year,</hi> to appear in Person. So that all face of <hi>publick</hi> Worship must have been laid aside at the Pleasure of their <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del Princes,</hi> if one Obtrusion of a <hi>remoter</hi> Person, in the order of the <hi>Succession,</hi> might have sufficed to hinder their communicating there, which none can think but that GOD did intend to lay greater stress on, than on the <hi>immediate</hi> Order of the <hi>Succession.</hi> It is certain, they could not, by the <hi>Law</hi> it self, challenge their Dues for <hi>Maintenance</hi> any where else than there, nor <hi>eat</hi> several of the <hi>Oblations</hi> any where else than in that <hi>holy place</hi> in their <hi>Temple.</hi> Which shews plainly, that the <hi>Dues</hi> of <hi>Priesthood</hi> were not <hi>due</hi> to them on any other Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than that of their <hi>officiating</hi> in that very <hi>place</hi> designed by <hi>GOD</hi> for their <hi>Holy Offices.</hi> Hence it appears, that what <hi>Right</hi> they might pretend, when they were <hi>excluded</hi> from the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was only such a <hi>remote Right</hi> as Men ordinarily have to Offices, before their <hi>Admission</hi> into the Legal <hi>Possession</hi> of them. They are indeed <hi>wronged</hi> if they be not <hi>admitted</hi> as the <hi>Law</hi> requires; but <hi>till</hi> they be admitted, the same <hi>Laws</hi> allow them no <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Profits,</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> and <hi>Dependencies</hi> annexed to the <hi>Office.</hi> This was the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when there were <hi>Exumples</hi> of violent <hi>exclusion</hi> of those who

            <p>Hitherto I have considered the Case of <hi>Abiathar</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> as  it concerned the <hi>Jews,</hi> with some <hi>general</hi> Strictures only, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our <hi>present</hi> Case.

Here therefore I design to shew that the same <hi>Reasonings</hi> hold, and hold with more <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Force,</hi> for our deprived <hi>Fathers</hi> Rights, than they did for those of <hi>Abiathar.</hi> First therefore our <hi>Episcopal</hi> Fathers <hi>Rights</hi> are as properly (indeed in a <hi>more noble</hi> sense) the <hi>Rights</hi> of a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49601:36"/>
               <hi>Priesthood</hi> as those of <hi>Abiathar</hi> were. So that it is very proper to <hi>reason</hi> from <hi>one</hi> to the other. I know how very difficulty this is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by many. And yet I wonder it should be so, considering that it is manifest in the <hi>reasonings</hi> of the Writers of the <hi>Apostolical Age,</hi> who <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> from one to the <hi>other</hi> as plainly as I do, which <hi>Reasonings</hi> must be perfectly unconclusive as proceeding on <hi>four terms,</hi> if the Notion of <hi>Priesthood</hi> be not supposed <hi>univocally common</hi> to <hi>ours,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ministry. Thus the Apostle Reasons in the Case of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: <hi>Do ye not know that they which Minister about Holy things, live</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Chr. ix. 4</note>

These things also plainly shew, that the <hi>benefits</hi> expected by the <hi>Christians</hi> from their <hi>Eucharist</hi> were transacted, according to the then receiv'd Notions both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> as properly so called as the others were, as to all intents and purposes of <hi>Legal</hi> transaction. So again, the same Apostle owns the <hi>Sacrifical</hi> Style, when he calls that an <hi>Altar</hi> which <note place="margin">Heb. xiii. 10.</note> he had elsewhere called the <hi>Lords Table: We have an Altar whereof they have no Right to eat, which serve the Tabernacle.</hi> That <hi>Altar</hi> he compares with <hi>meats</hi> in the verse before, and therefore must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably mean the <hi>Eucharistical Altar.</hi> Besides the <hi>Jews</hi> did pretend to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49601:37"/>
the <hi>Heavenly Altar,</hi> as is clear from the places formerly produced from <hi>Philo.</hi> But it was <hi>Notorious</hi> that their <hi>Priests</hi> as such had <hi>no Right</hi> to the Christian <hi>Eucharistical Altar,</hi> nor did they ever pretend to it. This therefore was more unquestionable, and more fit to be Reason'd on, for the Apostles purpose. So also <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> argues from <note place="margin">Clem. Rom. <hi>Ep. ad</hi> Corinth.</note> the <hi>Sacredness</hi> of the <hi>Jewish Priest hood,</hi> to the like <hi>Sacredness</hi> of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Ministry.</hi> And from the like Notions of an <hi>Altar, Ignatius</hi> also Reasons in the places already mentioned. So many <hi>precedents</hi> we have of <hi>Reasonings</hi> of this kind in the <hi>Apostolical times</hi> themselves. And if he consider the things themselves sedately, I see no reason why we should think these Notions <hi>strange</hi> in that <hi>Age.</hi> The <hi>Jewish Sacrifices</hi> themselves were not then thought available as they consisted in shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Bloud of <hi>Brutes,</hi> but as they <hi>represented</hi> the <hi>Archcetypal Sacrifice</hi> of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and as <hi>Covenanting Symbols</hi> gave the <hi>Communicants</hi> a <hi>Right</hi> to what was <hi>represented</hi> by them. This was the truly <hi>beneficial</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Covenant</hi> transacted by <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> And in this Sense, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive how our Adversaries can deny our <hi>Eucharist</hi> the name of a Sacrifice, as <hi>properly,</hi> as it agreed to any used among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Our <hi>Eucharist</hi> also was designed by our Lord to <hi>represent</hi> his own <hi>Archetypal Sacrifice</hi> on the <hi>Cross.</hi> And not only so, but as a <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Symbol,</hi> to <hi>convey</hi> a <hi>Right</hi> to that <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> so <hi>represented,</hi> to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy rightly disposed <hi>Communicant.</hi> What therefore can our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries desire more for satisfying the proper <hi>beneficial</hi> Notion of a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?</hi> Wine may, by <hi>Christs appointment,</hi> signify his <hi>Bloud</hi> to <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beneficial</hi> purposes, as well as <hi>real Bloud</hi> itself.</p>

from the <hi>Secular Power.</hi> To this it was requisite, that it should be under no obligation of <hi>Conscience,</hi> to depend on any thing that was in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Persecuting Magistrate,</hi> as it must have done, if it had been obliged by <hi>GOD</hi> to any one particular <hi>Place.</hi> It was also requisite, that this <hi>Priesthood</hi> being constituted by <hi>GOD</hi> as the <hi>cement</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual Society,</hi> all that was requisite for managing that Society, should have been by <hi>God,</hi> (who was pleas'd to <hi>found</hi> that Society) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> as its <hi>Right</hi> in <hi>Conscience,</hi> and therefore by the same <hi>Divine</hi> Power, <hi>exempted</hi> from the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi> For all that this <hi>Priesthood</hi> could have to recommend <hi>Duty</hi> to the <hi>Consciences</hi> of its <hi>Subjects</hi> in a state of <hi>Persecution,</hi> was only its <hi>Sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and the <hi>Obligation</hi> that lay on <hi>GOD</hi> to ratify his own <hi>Act,</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the <hi>Censures</hi> denounced by it against <hi>refractory</hi> Persons; and therefore they must be very well <hi>satisfied,</hi> that the <hi>Censures</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by one to whom <hi>GOD</hi> had given a Lawful <hi>Authority</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them.

Otherwise, they could not think God oblig'd to <hi>ratify</hi> them, if they had been <hi>Invasions</hi> of the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</hi> But the <hi>Districts</hi> were then absolutely necessary for making the <hi>Churches Censures,</hi> as settled out by <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Apostles practicable.</hi> By <hi>them</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> knew what <hi>Persons</hi> were liable to their particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Jurisdictions.</hi> By those the <hi>Subjects</hi> olso knew the particular <hi>Bishops</hi> to whose <hi>Censures</hi> they were obliged to pay a <hi>Deference.</hi> If the <hi>Bishop</hi> had censured Persons not belonging to his Jurisdiction, by the settlement then made by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> they could not think <hi>GOD</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to <hi>second</hi> him in his <hi>Usurpations,</hi> and therefore could be under no <hi>Obligation</hi> to regard such <hi>Censures.</hi> It was therefore absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Preaching</hi> the Gospel, and settling <hi>districts,</hi> without the leave of the Possessing <hi>Magistrates,</hi> must by <hi>GOD</hi> have been made the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> in reference to <hi>Conscience,</hi> and therefore could not at the same time have been the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi> What then will become of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary <hi>Contract?

               <hi>things</hi> themselves <hi>transacted</hi> by the <hi>Spiritual Power</hi> are in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> nor that GOD has given the <hi>Magistrate</hi> any <hi>Authority</hi> to represent him in these matters, which may <hi>oblige him</hi> to <hi>ratify</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> what the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> in his name, pretends to Act on <hi>Earth:</hi> It should unavoidably follow that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> has <hi>not</hi> this <hi>Power</hi> at <hi>all,</hi> which if he have not in <hi>general,</hi> he cannot have in <hi>this,</hi> nor in any <hi>other</hi> particular <hi>Case</hi> assignable by our Adversaries. Why are they therefore so unreasonable as to expect, after we have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this Power in <hi>general,</hi> that we must be put to the further trouble of disproving it in a <hi>particular Case?</hi> They themselves can easily perceive the <hi>partiality</hi> of their demands in other the like Cases. They who, on the other side, are for the <hi>encroachments</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> upon the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Magistracy</hi> in order to <hi>Spirituals,</hi> in Case of <hi>Heresy,</hi> do so far proceed successfully, when they shew that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy</hi> is a <hi>Crime</hi> properly cognizable by the <hi>Spiritual Judicatories,</hi> and that <hi>Magistrates,</hi> as well as others, are <hi>Subject</hi> to such <hi>Judicatories</hi> in matters purely <hi>Spiritual.</hi> But then the <hi>consequence</hi> would only be, that a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> so convicted of <hi>Heresy,</hi> might by such <hi>Spiritual Judges</hi> be <hi>deprived</hi> of his <hi>Right</hi> to Communion, and consequently of all the <hi>Spiritual Rights</hi> and <hi>benefits,</hi> to which he is <hi>entitled</hi> as a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>true Communion.</hi> This is the utmost that <hi>Spiritual Judges</hi> can pretend to, or wherein they can expect that GOD will <hi>second</hi> and <hi>ratify</hi> their Determinations. But when they proceed further to forbid all <hi>Civil Conversation</hi> with the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> to <hi>deprive</hi> him of his <hi>Civil Rights,</hi> to <hi>absolve</hi> his <hi>Subjects</hi> from their <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Civil Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi> These are <hi>consequences,</hi> which, I believe our Adversaries will not defend. Yet how they can avoid being obliged to it, if they will be true to the <hi>Consequences</hi> of their <hi>reasonings</hi> in this <hi>Case,</hi> for my part, I cannot understand. For why may not the <hi>Church</hi> assume a <hi>Right</hi> of punishing <hi>Temporally,</hi> a <hi>Crime</hi> that is really allowed to be of <hi>Spritual Cognizance,</hi> if the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> for a <hi>Temporal Crime,</hi> may inflict a <hi>deprivation</hi> of <hi>Spirituals?</hi> I do not now insist on what we have to say, as to the <hi>validity</hi> of the Sentence given against our Fathers, in respect of the <hi>Temporal Authority</hi> that can be pretended for it. However, that is, at least, sufficient to shew, that it is only the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>those,</hi> who have <hi>given Judgment,</hi> against them, that they had even <hi>Temporal Authority</hi> sufficient for it. And if the <hi>Secular Powers</hi> may <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Bishops,</hi> for any <hi>Crime,</hi> which they who <hi>deprive</hi> them, shall be pleased to call <hi>Temporal;</hi> and if <hi>we</hi> also, are obliged to think such <hi>deprivatons</hi> sufficient to discharge <hi>Us</hi> from the <hi>Duty</hi> we owe them, with regard to our <hi>Conscience:</hi> I cannot see how the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

Christian Bishops</hi> could have escaped such <hi>deprivation.

No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it should not, since the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> from whom they borrow the <hi>term</hi> of <hi>Character,</hi> hold <hi>Characters</hi> to be <hi>indelible</hi> by any <hi>Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> whatsoever, not only <hi>secular,</hi> but <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> also. However all the <hi>Use</hi> our Adversaries make of their remaining <hi>Character,</hi> is only to make them <hi>restorable</hi> to their <hi>old Jurisdictions,</hi> without a <hi>new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration;</hi> and in the <hi>mean time,</hi> to legitimate some <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Epicopal Power,</hi> which must no be supposed to depend on a relation to a <hi>particular Jurisdiction.</hi> But this <hi>Character,</hi> that has no relation to a <hi>particular District,</hi> could not be <hi>sufficient</hi> for preserving <hi>Bodies</hi> (such as the <hi>Church</hi> was <hi>designed</hi> to be by, them who <hi>founded</hi> it) in a State of <hi>independency</hi> on the <hi>Civil Magistrate;</hi> Bodies, as then understood by the <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> being <hi>determined</hi> and <hi>distinguished</hi> by such <hi>Districts.</hi> The allowing therefore the <hi>Heathen</hi> Persecuting <hi>Magistrates</hi> a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>dissolving</hi> the relation of all the <hi>Bishops</hi> of their <hi>Dominions,</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Districts,</hi> had parfectly <hi>dissolved</hi> all <hi>particular Churches,</hi> as <hi>Bodies,</hi> when the <hi>Magistrate</hi> was pleased to <hi>dissolve</hi> them; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>design</hi> of <hi>CHRIST</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>perpetuate</hi> Churches, as <hi>Bodies, independent</hi> on the <hi>state.</hi> And it is certain, that this Power of <hi>discharging</hi> Ecclesiastcal Governours from the <hi>Districts</hi> in their <hi>own Dominions,</hi> was not <hi>own'd</hi> in the Civil Powers by the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>earliest Christians.</hi> Had it been so, the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves must have quitted <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when they were <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi> by the <hi>Sanbedrim,</hi> and <hi>sought</hi> out other <hi>Converts</hi> and <hi>Districts,</hi> wherein they might <hi>exercise</hi> their <hi>Function</hi> and <hi>Character.</hi> But <hi>where</hi> could they seek or find them, but the <hi>same Objection,</hi> would still recur from this <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Civil Magistrate?</hi> There must therefore have been <hi>no Churches</hi> in the World, if <hi>this Doctrine</hi> had been <hi>allowed</hi> of. But it is certain, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did still <hi>challenge</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> their <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and were <hi>own'd</hi> and <hi>seconded</hi> in doing so, by the <hi>Christians Inhabitants</hi> of that <hi>City,</hi> against all the <hi>Persecutions</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and were all of them <hi>own'd</hi> by GOD, by the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials</hi> that followed them, which could never have been, if these their <hi>Practices</hi> had been <hi>Usurpations.</hi> And all the <hi>Right</hi> that <hi>Bishops then</hi> had for obliging the whole <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> was grounded on the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> of <hi>Communicatory Letters,</hi> and the <hi>Common interest</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> to <hi>ratify</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>particular Districts.</hi> Thence it appears, that all <hi>exercise</hi>

            <p>But the <hi>Principle</hi> pretence of all that our Adversaries insist on, is,  That in those <hi>earlier</hi> times, the <hi>Church</hi> was indeed a <hi>Society</hi> distinct from the <hi>State,</hi> and whilst it continued so, the <hi>deprivations</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> could therefore not extend to <hi>Spirituals,</hi> which were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituts of the <hi>Church</hi> as a <hi>Society</hi> distinct from it: But that there is no necessary consequence, because it was so then, that therefore it <hi>most</hi> be so <hi>now:</hi> That the <hi>Reasoning</hi> from the <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of those <hi>Times,</hi> does indeed hold where the <hi>Case</hi> is the <hi>same</hi> as it was then, That is, where the <hi>State</hi> consists of <hi>Infidels;</hi> but not in ours, wherein the <hi>State</hi> professes the <hi>Christian, Religion.</hi> This is suggested by the worthy Author of the <hi>Defence of the Church of England,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>from the Charges</hi> of the <hi>Vindicator.</hi> And he has therein managed the <hi>Reasoning</hi> Part of this Dispute better than the <hi>Doctor,</hi> in that he has pitched on the particular <hi>Proposition,</hi> which he thinks needs <hi>further proof</hi> in the Scheme of the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> seeming withal to allow that if this also be cleared, the rest of the <hi>Vidicators</hi> Proof will <hi>hold,</hi> as being firmly superstructed on it. This therefore brings the Question to a short issue, and affords a further Subject of useful Discourse, for improving what has been said already, and I therefore return my hearty thanks to that <hi>Author</hi> for it, only wishing that he had allowed himself a larger Scope for making that out, which if <hi>proved,</hi> would have been so very considerable for his purpose. Supposing he had proved his Assertion true, yet other things, remain'd to have been proved further, for making it applicable to our present Case. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more had certainly been requisite for his purpose, than barely to suppose the <hi>Magistrate</hi> barely <hi>Christian.</hi> He might easily have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen that, even among <hi>Christians,</hi> there are different <hi>communions,</hi> on account of <hi>HERISY</hi> and <hi>SCHISM.</hi> If the <hi>Magistrate</hi> therefore be guilty of either of those, he is as <hi>uncapable</hi> of <hi>Uniting</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> in one <hi>Cmmunion,</hi> as if he were an <hi>IDOLATOR.</hi> And I suppose all the ground that worthy Person has for making a <hi>believing Prince</hi>'s Case different from that of an <hi>Infidel,</hi> in order to the <hi>Church's</hi> coalition into <hi>one Body</hi> with the <hi>Society</hi> that is governed by the <hi>believing</hi> Prince, must be <hi>the</hi> Church's <hi>Union</hi> in <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>him,</hi> which it cannot have with an <hi>Infidel.</hi> For that <hi>Political Union,</hi> which is requisite for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49601:45"/>
               <hi>Secular</hi> Government, as far as it is <hi>consistent</hi> with <hi>difference</hi> in <hi>Communion,</hi> as to <hi>Spirituals,</hi> the <hi>Orthodox</hi> are as capable of maintaining with <hi>INFIDEL</hi> Princes, as they are with either <hi>HERITICKS,</hi> or <hi>SCHISMATICKS.</hi> And for applying that Case, he might have considered further, how far <hi>Communicating</hi> with <hi>Schismaticks</hi> in <hi>other</hi> places, and <hi>setting up</hi> Schism where he found the <hi>true Communion</hi> established by <hi>Law,</hi> and allowing no Patronage of <hi>Law,</hi> without <hi>Schismatical conditions,</hi> may go to prove a <hi>Prince's</hi> Case <hi>SCHISMATICAL.</hi> Then supposing the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> united into <hi>one Society,</hi> he should have enquired further, why this <hi>Union</hi> must rather be under the <hi>Secular,</hi> than the <hi>spiritual,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Monarch.</hi> This, I am sure, is against the <hi>General Rule</hi> of <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations,</hi> to make the <hi>more Noble</hi> Power Subject to that which is <hi>less</hi> so; and therefore ought to have been proved by reasens <hi>peculier</hi> to this <hi>particular coalition</hi> of two <hi>Societies</hi> into <hi>one.</hi> Such <hi>peculiar</hi> Reasons I doubt are more then ever we can expect from him. But supposing both these difficulties surmounted, that the <hi>Church</hi> had a <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>one Communion</hi> with her, and that the <hi>two Societies</hi> now <hi>united,</hi> were to be Governed rather by the <hi>PRINCE,</hi> than the <hi>METROPOLITANE;</hi> Yet still <hi>another Question</hi> remained worthy his Consideration, <hi>how long this Union was to hold?</hi> If <hi>irrevocably,</hi> then the <hi>Church</hi> would be left <hi>destitute</hi> of a <hi>Power,</hi> necessary for her <hi>subsitence,</hi> whenever the <hi>Prince</hi> should Apostatize to <hi>Infidelity,</hi> or an <hi>Infidel</hi> should succeed him by the <hi>Rules</hi> established for the <hi>Succession.</hi> If therefore the <hi>Church's Power</hi> be granted <hi>revocable,</hi> the Enquiry then would be, whether the <hi>Grant</hi> can in <hi>reason</hi> be supposed to <hi>hold</hi> any longer than the <hi>Prince's Protecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of her. If so; then whether, when he <hi>revokes</hi> his <hi>Protection</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on <hi>Conscionable</hi> terms, and <hi>Persecutes</hi> his Fellow <hi>Brethren,</hi> for no other reason, but for being <hi>true</hi> to the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>old communion,</hi> this be not the very Season wherein they are, in <hi>Conscience, absolved</hi> from their <hi>old Grants,</hi> and are perfectly free to <hi>resume</hi> their old <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Liberties?</hi> I know our <hi>Adversary</hi> will understand me, without any further application.</p>

into the <hi>Church's Communion,</hi> are received, as other <hi>Laicks</hi> are, by <hi>Baptism;</hi> which can therefore intitle them to no more <hi>Power,</hi> than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Christians,</hi> who are admitted into the <hi>same Society,</hi> the <hi>same way,</hi> as they are. As therefore <hi>Baptism</hi> alone confers no <hi>spiritual Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> no more it can to the <hi>Prince,</hi> who has no Preheminence above them, on <hi>this account.</hi> When therefore he is baptized, he still remains, in reference to <hi>spiritual Power,</hi> no more than a <hi>Private Person,</hi> as all <hi>others</hi> do, who have no more <hi>spiritual Authority</hi> given them, than what is conferred upon them in their <hi>Baptism.</hi> How then comes he by this <hi>Power</hi> in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> which our <hi>Adversaries</hi> challenge for him? All our forementioned <hi>Reasons</hi> proceed as validly against his claim of <hi>spiritual Power,</hi> whilst he continues only a <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> tho' <hi>Baptized,</hi> as they did before his <hi>Baptism.</hi> Still, the <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power</hi> is grounded on the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>rewarding</hi> and <hi>punishing Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi> by <hi>admitting</hi> to, or <hi>excluding</hi> from, the <hi>Spiritual Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Society.</hi> Still, the <hi>Power</hi> of that <hi>admission</hi> to, or <hi>exclusion</hi> from, those <hi>Benefits,</hi> depends upon the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Incorporating Rites;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, <hi>admit</hi> into the Body, or if denyed, <hi>exclude</hi> from it. Still the <hi>Incorporating Acts,</hi> are the two <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as we are <hi>Baptized</hi> into, the <hi>spiritual Body,</hi> and as we are <hi>made one spiritual Body,</hi> by our <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking</hi> of <hi>one Bread:</hi> So that none can have the <hi>Power</hi> of these <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating Acts,</hi> who has not the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Administring</hi> the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Still, the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Administring</hi> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> is proper to the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Priest hood;</hi> and it is still, as unlawful for <hi>Princes</hi> to invade the <hi>Sacerdotal Offices,</hi> as it was under the old <hi>Law,</hi> when the <hi>Prince</hi> was <hi>obliged</hi> to be always of <hi>one Body,</hi> with the <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> in reference to <hi>Religious</hi> Acts of <hi>Communication.</hi> Still, the <hi>Reasoning</hi> of St. <hi>Clemens</hi> holds that <hi>Laymen</hi> are <hi>only</hi> to meddle with <hi>Acts</hi> properly <hi>Laical,</hi> and proceeds with <hi>more Force</hi> than in the Case wherein that <hi>Holy Apostolical Person</hi> used it. The <hi>Gifted Laicks</hi> had been <hi>Baptized</hi> as well as our <hi>Believing Princes,</hi> and in that regard were every way <hi>Equal</hi> with them. But as they were endued with <hi>Spiritual Gifts,</hi> they were better qualified for <hi>extraordinary Calls</hi> to <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>sacerdotal Power,</hi> than <hi>Princes</hi> can be by any Pretensions to, or Advantages of, <hi>Worldly grandeur. Baptism</hi> indeed makes the <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>Church one Society,</hi> as the <hi>Prince</hi> is thereby <hi>incorporated</hi> into the <hi>Priviledged Society</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> But then, this <hi>Baptismal Union</hi> is rather of the <hi>Prince</hi> to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> than of the <hi>Bishop</hi> to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and therefore on the <hi>Bishop's terms,</hi> not the <hi>Prince</hi>'s. How then can the <hi>Prince's</hi> being receiv'd into the <hi>Church</hi> as a <hi>private Person,</hi> and as a <hi>Subject</hi> to the <hi>spiritual Authority,</hi> intitle him to any of that same <hi>Authority,</hi> to which by his <hi>Baptism,</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49601:46"/>
he professes his <hi>subjection?</hi> He is indeed so far from being a <hi>Publick Person</hi> in his <hi>Baptism,</hi> that the <hi>Obligation</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> of his <hi>Baptism,</hi> are wholly <hi>Personal</hi> to <hi>himself,</hi> none of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> being in the least, concerned in it. If he had acted as a <hi>Publick Person</hi> in it, his <hi>single Act</hi> had obliged <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and would have consequently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>them</hi> to all the <hi>benefits</hi> of his <hi>stipulation.</hi> But this is more than our <hi>Adversaries</hi> will pretend in this Case. How then can an <hi>Act</hi> purely <hi>Personal,</hi> intitle him to an <hi>accession</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</hi>

            <p>Thus far therefore it is certain, that a <hi>Prince</hi>'s admission into the  Church, is not alone sufficient for a <hi>Coalition</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> into <hi>one Body</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> because that <hi>other Body</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> whereof he is <hi>head,</hi> is not the least concern'd in this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>his</hi> as a <hi>Private Person,</hi> not as a <hi>Publick,</hi> much less as a <hi>Head</hi> of any <hi>Body</hi> at all.

However we deny not, but that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> has a <hi>Right</hi> in the <hi>disposal</hi> of those favours which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for the <hi>Churches</hi> interest in order to a <hi>legal Settlement</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</hi> And he has withal thereupon a <hi>Right</hi> to expect a <hi>Security</hi> to be given him for his own <hi>Temporal Power,</hi> against <hi>invasions</hi> from the <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> in consideration even of that Act of <hi>Justice,</hi> of <hi>securing</hi> them also from the like <hi>Invasions</hi> from the <hi>Temporal Power,</hi> by his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying it in their <hi>defence,</hi> though he be otherwise obliged in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> to protect that which himself believes to be the <hi>true Religion</hi> and the <hi>true Communion.</hi> But then this is no proper <hi>Cession</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Rights.</hi> For even <hi>antecedently</hi> to the amicable <hi>correspondence</hi> between the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> was as much <hi>obliged</hi> in <hi>Conscience</hi> to forbear <hi>encroachments</hi> on the <hi>Temporal Rights,</hi> as the <hi>Magistrate</hi> was on the <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Only the difference was, that <hi>before</hi> the <hi>correspondence,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> her <hi>self</hi> took upon her to <hi>judge</hi> concerning the <hi>trustiness</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> put in <hi>Office</hi> by <hi>her,</hi> having then no <hi>access</hi> to the <hi>Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate;</hi> but afterwards she suffered <hi>him</hi> to judge <hi>himself</hi> of his <hi>own security.</hi> That was by not having <hi>Bishops</hi> imposed upon him to enjoy his <hi>Temporals</hi> annexed to their Office, without his <hi>own approbation</hi> which was no more than what was generally reasonable on equal terms. This sometimes allowed him a <hi>power</hi> at <hi>first</hi> of <hi>stopping</hi> any Person proposed if he did not like him, sometimes of <hi>pitching</hi> on the <hi>Person</hi> by the <hi>Right</hi> of a <hi>Lay Patron.</hi> So also he was allowed to <hi>judge</hi> concerning <hi>Canons,</hi> whether they might prove <hi>prejudical</hi> to the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Government,</hi> before he seconded them with his <hi>Temporal Government,</hi> and by <hi>secular Coercions,</hi> which was also very just and equal, without any <hi>cession</hi> on the <hi>Churches</hi> side. For this was only allowing him to <hi>judge</hi> where his <hi>own Power</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> was concerned. But then this

               <hi>Right</hi> was only to keep <hi>out</hi> a Person who was not <hi>yet</hi> possessed of the <hi>Power</hi> he pretended to, by even the <hi>spiritual Right</hi> of <hi>Consecration,</hi> and therefore no Act of <hi>Authority</hi> upon a <hi>Bishop</hi> properly so called, but only on a <hi>Candidate</hi> for the <hi>Office.</hi> But there was never any Act of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church</hi> so much as <hi>pretended,</hi> that I know of, that ever Allowed <hi>Princes</hi> to <hi>turn</hi> Bishops <hi>out</hi> of their <hi>spiritual Rights,</hi> without <hi>Synods,</hi> when they were once <hi>Canonically possessed</hi> of them.

            <p>Particularly, this Reasoning holds in our <hi>present Case,</hi> more <hi>strongly</hi> than it would in <hi>others.</hi> It may indeed be possible, by being <hi>Members</hi>  of <hi>another Society,</hi> that all the <hi>Particulars</hi> of which a <hi>Society</hi> does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, may enjoy <hi>greater advantages</hi> by being dissolved into another <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> than by being a <hi>Society</hi> by <hi>themselves,</hi> and at their own <hi>disposal.</hi> And a Case may therefore fall out, wherein a <hi>less beneficial Society,</hi> may not only put their <hi>Liberties</hi> in the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>another more beneficial Society,</hi> to be by it <hi>disiolved</hi> at pleasure, but may also <hi>actually</hi> surrender their very <hi>Liberties</hi> themselves, in consideration of <hi>greater benefits,</hi> to all the particulars of the <hi>less beneficial Society,</hi> not only than those which they possess on account of their <hi>Incorporation,</hi> but also than that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> also which they enjoy on account of their <hi>independency,</hi> which is it self also a very valuable <hi>benefit,</hi> and <hi>adds</hi> considerably to the <hi>other</hi> advantages of their <hi>present Society,</hi> in the common esteem of Mankind. But for this, two things are requisite to make the Case <hi>Practicable,</hi> neither of which are applicable to the subject of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Discourse First, the <hi>benefits</hi> of the <hi>New Society,</hi> must indeed be more <hi>valuable</hi> than those of the <hi>old</hi> one, together with their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> considered into the bargain. 2dly. They who are <hi>possessed</hi> of the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>old Society,</hi> must be <hi>possessed</hi> of them on their <hi>own</hi> Accounts, not as <hi>Trustees</hi> of any other, that so they may have no further <hi>Obligation</hi> to preserve them, than their own <hi>present Interests</hi> in them, and may therefore be at <hi>Liberty</hi> to <hi>accept</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of <hi>graeter</hi> present <hi>Interest.</hi> If either of these Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fail, they cannot think themselves obliged in <hi>Equity</hi> to <hi>stand</hi> to such a <hi>Contract,</hi> especially where no more is pretended than an <hi>implicite</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:49601:52"/>
one, not expressed in <hi>Words,</hi> but gathered only from considerations of <hi>Equity.</hi> And here neither of them can be so much as pretended. First it cannot be pretended that any <hi>Secular</hi> Favours or Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities whatsoever can make <hi>amends</hi> for the <hi>benefits</hi> of their <hi>present spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Society.</hi> This has been proved already. I shall therefore here take it for granted. Indeed it is in our present Case so very <hi>manifest,</hi> that I need no great Favour of our Adversaries themselves to give me <hi>leave</hi> to do so. Supposing it therefore granted, all the Rules of <hi>equitable Reasoning</hi> in the sense of those <hi>Ages</hi> wherein the <hi>State</hi> first became <hi>Christian,</hi> will relieve the <hi>Church</hi> against any such pretentions, as are here insisted on, of an <hi>implicite contract</hi> for surrendring her <hi>independency. Societies</hi> had in the <hi>Roman Civil Law</hi> (which is the best standard for judging what was thought <hi>equitable</hi> in those <hi>times)</hi> the same favour as <hi>Minors,</hi> from being <hi>obliged</hi> by over-reaching <hi>Contracts.</hi> And indeed there was <hi>reason</hi> for it, when their <hi>Interests</hi> were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by <hi>others</hi> who as seldom <hi>consulted</hi> the sense of the <hi>Communities,</hi> as <hi>Guardians</hi> did their <hi>Pupils,</hi> and who were liable to as just <hi>suspicions</hi> of corrupt insidious dealings, and private interests, as <hi>Guardians</hi> were. This therefore would allow the <hi>Church</hi> a <hi>Restitution in integrum,</hi> a perfect <hi>rescission</hi> of such a <hi>Contract,</hi> made in her <hi>name</hi> by her <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives,</hi> where the <hi>disadvantage</hi> was in it so <hi>manifest,</hi> as the <hi>alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating spiritual Rights</hi> in exchange for <hi>Temporal;</hi> and the <hi>contract</hi> had yet proceeded no further than to be <hi>implicite</hi> only and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative.</hi> Indeed here the very <hi>Representatives</hi> themselves might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be relieved in <hi>Equity.</hi> For, receiving a <hi>valuable consideration,</hi> is that which is expresly mention'd, even in our <hi>Modern Contracts,</hi> even where that valuable consideration it <hi>self</hi> is not mentioned, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to prevent their <hi>revecableness,</hi> if it had not been <hi>mentioned.</hi> It is therefore supposed that when the <hi>Consideration</hi> is not <hi>valuable</hi> in comparison with the <hi>Right</hi> contracted for, it is but reasonable in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> that such a <hi>Contract</hi> be <hi>rescinded.</hi> Especially, where the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> is not expressed in <hi>Words,</hi> there is no <hi>reason</hi> in <hi>Equity</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that any such <hi>Alienation</hi> was <hi>intended.</hi> All that can be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Case, is, that the <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Favour,</hi> and <hi>Protection,</hi> is <hi>accepted</hi> of by the <hi>Representatives</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But how does it appear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an <hi>explicite Contract,</hi> that it is <hi>accepted</hi> of with a <hi>design</hi> of entring into a <hi>Contract?</hi> How does it appear, that it is <hi>accepted</hi> of as a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration?</hi> How does it appear, that any <hi>Right,</hi> on their <hi>own side,</hi> is <hi>intended</hi> to be <hi>parted</hi> with in consideration of it?

            <p>Thus much might have been pleaded for <hi>discharging</hi> the <hi>Church Officers</hi> from these <hi>Obligations,</hi> though they had indeed a <hi>Power</hi> to  <hi>oblige</hi> themselves thus far, and had no more to do in this matter, than to consider whether there were prospects of <hi>present Interest</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to <hi>induce</hi> them to it. But that is not the Case here. All they can do, on any consideration whatsoever, by any however <hi>Explicite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact</hi> is not sufficient to <hi>Alienate</hi> that <hi>Power,</hi> by which the <hi>Church</hi> must again <hi>subsist,</hi> whenever the <hi>Magistrate</hi> deserts her. For this <hi>Power</hi> is not her <hi>own,</hi> but a <hi>trust</hi> commited to her <hi>by GOD,</hi> and a <hi>trust</hi> committed to her, with a <hi>design</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> should be <hi>perpetuated.</hi> Whatsoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she does, she cannot <hi>oblige God</hi> by an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Alienation</hi> of it. So a <hi>Servant</hi> that should <hi>Alienate</hi> his <hi>Lord's Rights</hi> without his <hi>leave,</hi> cannot hinder his <hi>Lord</hi> from <hi>challenging</hi> them again, nor any other <hi>Servant</hi> who is <hi>impower'd</hi> by his <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>demand</hi> them. This is allowed among our hired <hi>Servants,</hi> and much more with the <hi>Roman Slaves,</hi> to whom the Scriptures allude in this matter.

to signify the <hi>Nature</hi> of his <hi>Power</hi> by the <hi>Roman Civil Laws</hi> received at that time, which allowed <hi>Servants</hi> to <hi>acquire Actions</hi> to their <hi>Masters,</hi> but not <hi>Alienate</hi> them without their express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves therefore were not at <hi>Liberty</hi> to <hi>Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> this <hi>trust</hi> committed to them upon any considerations whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of their own <hi>private convenience;</hi> nor much less can <hi>they</hi> do it, who <hi>now</hi> succeed them in a <hi>Power,</hi> indeed <hi>derived</hi> from them; but in many particulars more <hi>limited</hi> than <hi>theirs</hi> was.

            <p>Indeed the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>spiritual Society</hi> as constituted by <hi>GOD</hi> is  such, as that it cannot be thought agreeable to the <hi>mind</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> that it should so <hi>concorporate</hi> with the <hi>State,</hi> as wholly to <hi>depend</hi> on the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Civil Magistrate,</hi> so as that its <hi>Supream Governours,</hi> the <hi>Bishops,</hi> should be <hi>subject</hi> to <hi>him</hi> in <hi>Spirituals</hi> also. It is not agreeable to his mind that the more <hi>Noble Society</hi> should be <hi>subjected</hi> to that which is <hi>less Noble;</hi> that the Interests of <hi>Souls</hi> which are more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his esteem than all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the <hi>pleasures</hi> of particular <hi>Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Interests</hi> of their <hi>particular</hi> little <hi>Districts.</hi> It is not agreeable, that he should <hi>trust</hi> a <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>principal importance,</hi> in the hands of those who are not likely to regard it, as their <hi>principal employment,</hi> who make the World their principal <hi>Study,</hi> and take their understanding that, and its concers throughly to be the principal <hi>accomplishment</hi> they are capable of, for the discharging of that which <hi>they</hi> take to be their <hi>principal Office,</hi> and who either take no pains at all to <hi>understand</hi> the <hi>concerns</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> or do it no otherwise than as it is consistent with their other <hi>employments,</hi> which are not indeed of that <hi>importance</hi> as matters of Religion are.

It is no way likely that he would have <hi>Religion</hi> left to their disposal, who by their Office think themselves obliged to be swayed <hi>Principally</hi> by their <hi>Worldly</hi> interests, than which there is hardly any thing more contradictory to the great ends of <hi>Religion;</hi> to make <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Manners</hi> necessary to be <hi>begun</hi> by <hi>Courts,</hi> which are usually the <hi>Originals</hi> of the <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of that kind, and the great <hi>hindrances</hi> to well meant designs of <hi>Reformation.</hi> An obvious <hi>consequence</hi> of such a <hi>trust</hi> would be, that <hi>Religion,</hi> which Princes do not take for their <hi>Principal</hi> Work, must be made subservient to their <hi>worldly Politicks,</hi> which Princes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

take for their <hi>Principal</hi> employment. And who can think that GOD would ever intend that a <hi>Religion</hi> at <hi>first</hi> established in a State of <hi>Independency</hi> on the <hi>secular Power,</hi> should afterwards be brought to a State <hi>precarious,</hi> and depending on the <hi>pleasure</hi> of the <hi>secular Magistrate?</hi> GODS establishing it otherwife at <hi>first</hi> shewed plainly that it was <hi>better</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>independent</hi> on the <hi>State,</hi> whensoever there should be any <hi>difference</hi> between it and the <hi>secular Magistrate.</hi> This withal we are certain of, that GOD is not <hi>changeable</hi> as man is; but that whilst the same <hi>Reason</hi> holds, or when the same <hi>Case</hi> returns, his <hi>mind</hi> will be the <hi>same</hi> as it was before. When ever therefore the <hi>Magistrate</hi> who has once <hi>favoured</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> shall again <hi>desert</hi> it, and <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi> his <hi>Protection</hi> from it; we must then conclude that the <hi>Church</hi> is in the same condition she was in <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Magistrate</hi> received her into his <hi>Protection;</hi> and therefore that it is GODS Pleasure also that she should subsist <hi>then,</hi> as she had done <hi>before,</hi> on her <hi>own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> On her own Government, I say, as well qualified now, as formerly, for continuance, and perpetuity, by its <hi>independence</hi> on the <hi>pleasure</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate.</hi> This is indeed the only way of knowing <hi>GODS pleasure</hi> concerning a <hi>Case,</hi> where no <hi>now Revelation</hi> is so much as pretended, as none is here, even by our Adversaries. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being certain, that, in Case of a <hi>New breach,</hi> GODS <hi>pleasure</hi> is that the <hi>Church</hi> should again be <hi>independent;</hi> it will be also certain, that in the <hi>Interval;</hi> whilst the good <hi>correspondence</hi> holds between the <hi>two Societies,</hi> GOD cannot allow such an <hi>Alienation</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> as shall <hi>disable</hi> her, in Case of a <hi>now breach,</hi> to persist on her <hi>old terms.</hi> This will requite that the <hi>old Society</hi> be preserved with the <hi>old Government</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> during the <hi>Interval.</hi> For the <hi>Church</hi> is not such a <hi>Society</hi> as other <hi>Humane</hi> ones, that can be <hi>set up</hi> at pleasure by the <hi>Agreement</hi> of the particular <hi>Members</hi> of which it consists, whenever they are <hi>Free</hi> from other <hi>antecedent</hi> inconsistent <hi>Obligations.</hi> This is a <hi>Society</hi> erected by <hi>GOD,</hi> and requires <hi>Governours</hi> Authorized by <hi>him</hi> more than other <hi>Civil Societies</hi> do, for <hi>Obliging</hi> him to confer <hi>spiritual Blessings</hi> exceeding the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Members</hi> considered in themselve. GOD has given them no reason to expect, when the <hi>breach</hi> shall fall, that he will <hi>extraordinarily</hi> empower Men <hi>immediatly</hi> as he did the <hi>Apostles.</hi> The only way therefore for securing the <hi>continuance</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is to keep up a <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Governours.</hi> Authorized by the <hi>Apostles</hi> in that <hi>Succession,</hi> which has been derived from <hi>them</hi> to our <hi>present times,</hi> which cannot be, unless the <hi>Succession</hi> it self be <hi>continued</hi> on, in all the <hi>Interval</hi> of good <hi>Correspondence.</hi> This therefore requires that they do not suffer themselves so to be <hi>Incorporated</hi> into the <hi>State,</hi> as to have

no <hi>Governours</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Acting by a <hi>highery Authority</hi> than what can be derived from the <hi>Prince.</hi> This consideration alone is sufficient to disprove our Adversaries fancy concerning the <hi>coalition</hi> of the <hi>Two Bodies,</hi> under the <hi>King</hi> as the Common <hi>Head</hi> of both of them, when, in the mean time, the <hi>Church</hi> is obliged to <hi>continue</hi> in her <hi>Bishops</hi> a <hi>power</hi> not derivable by any <hi>Patents</hi> from the <hi>KING.</hi> This Power therefore <hi>not derived</hi> from <hi>him,</hi> must be perfectly <hi>independent</hi> on him.

If therefore, when it is taken away the <hi>Bishop</hi> has then no <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Govern,</hi> he cannot expect <hi>GOD</hi> will ratify any <hi>exercise</hi> of a <hi>Power</hi> to which he can pretend no <hi>Right.</hi> But without <hi>GOD</hi>'s ratifying what is done by the <hi>Authority,</hi> and good <hi>reason</hi> to <hi>presume</hi> that <hi>GOD</hi> is <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>ractify</hi> it, such a <hi>Government</hi> can signify nothing for keeping the <hi>Society</hi> in a <hi>Body,</hi> that has nothing to recommend it, but consideratinos relating to <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Conscience.</hi> The <hi>Alienation</hi> therefore of this <hi>Power</hi> so necessary for <hi>securing</hi> the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> being so plainly <hi>against</hi> the <hi>Mind</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>giving</hi> the <hi>Power,</hi> no Act of <hi>Alienation</hi> of it, can expect a <hi>ratification</hi> from <hi>GOD,</hi> and therefore it must be <hi>Originally null</hi> and <hi>invalid.</hi>

Especially what the <hi>Magistrate</hi> either <hi>has,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> do, in <hi>consideration</hi> of that <hi>surrendry,</hi> falling infinitely short of being an <hi>Equivalent.</hi> Besides it is manifest, that the <hi>Surrendry</hi> then made, was perfectly <hi>forced</hi> on them, as well as the <hi>Fine</hi> was laid upon the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Clergy'</hi> on account of the <hi>Praemunire</hi> they had incurred for owning Cardinal <hi>WOLSEY</hi>'s <hi>Legatine Power.</hi> It has therefore, on that account also, that consideration of the <hi>Force</hi> by which it was extorted, for <hi>discharging</hi> Posterity, from its <hi>obligation,</hi> which, added to the Considerations now mentioned, will <hi>free</hi> it every way from the <hi>Obligation</hi> of the <hi>Contract.</hi> All that can be said for it, must be grounded on some <hi>antecedent Right</hi> that the <hi>Prince</hi> might pretend <hi>before</hi> his <hi>Force;</hi> and therefore it must not wholly be resolved into this <hi>extorted Surrendry.</hi> For if the <hi>Prince</hi> had no <hi>Right before</hi> his <hi>Force,</hi> he could have none <hi>afterwards,</hi> on account of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> whatever he might pretend by <hi>Human Secular Laws.</hi> For his <hi>Force</hi> without any <hi>antecedent Right,</hi> had been no other but downright <hi>Injustice,</hi> which could not entitle <hi>him,</hi> nor his <hi>Successors,</hi> to any <hi>Right</hi> in <hi>Conscience.</hi> Especially where the <hi>Right</hi> it self is of that <hi>nature,</hi> as it is <hi>here,</hi> that it belongs to a <hi>higher</hi> than <hi>Human Secular Judicatory.</hi> It therefore concerns our Advesaries to consider what they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for that Right <hi>antecedent</hi> to that <hi>Force.</hi> And I think what has already been proved, sufficient to cut them off from all Pretensions of <hi>Right</hi> by the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For I have shewed, that the <hi>Church</hi> was <hi>possessed</hi> of a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> her self <hi>independently</hi> in

               <hi>visible Districts</hi> and <hi>Jurisdictions</hi> before any <hi>Conversions</hi> of <hi>Princes.</hi> I have shewn withal, that no <hi>Contract</hi> either <hi>was</hi> made, or <hi>could</hi> be made, that could <hi>dispossess</hi> her of that <hi>Right,</hi> with regard to <hi>Conscience.</hi> If therefore they will pretend to any such Right <hi>antecedent</hi> to the <hi>forcible surrendry,</hi> it must be on some <hi>other</hi> Topick than that of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> The tell us therefore, that the <hi>Jewish Kings</hi> in the old Testament, ordered many things relating to <hi>Religion.</hi> Thence they infer, that <hi>our Princes</hi> have the <hi>same Power</hi> now. But, granting the <hi>Fact</hi> true, that the <hi>Jewish Princes</hi> were invested with that Power, it will however by no means <hi>follow,</hi> that our <hi>Christian Princes</hi> must be so <hi>now,</hi> If what I have already proved, hold true. For having directly proved, that the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is otherwise; the Question then will be, <hi>whether Precedents</hi> are to take place. And that in this <hi>Case,</hi> cannot be difficult, according to the <hi>ordinary Rules</hi> of judging concerning the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>inconsistent Laws.</hi> These Rules are, That <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>greater importance</hi> take place of <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>lesser impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> That <hi>later Laws</hi> of even the <hi>same</hi> Legislative Power take place of <hi>elder Laws,</hi> as being so far virtually <hi>repeals</hi> of them as their <hi>Practice</hi> proves <hi>inconsistent:</hi> That <hi>Laws</hi> more suited to <hi>present Circumstances</hi> take place of those which were made on a <hi>remoter prospect</hi> of our <hi>present Circumstances.</hi> And by all these Rules there can be no doubt but that <hi>now</hi> all such <hi>Legal Precedents</hi> are to be <hi>overruled</hi> by the <hi>peculiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> This, I am sure, is generally admitted in <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reasonings</hi> of this <hi>kind.</hi> And there is nothing peculiar <hi>pleaded</hi> in this Case, why <hi>Jewish precedents</hi> should rather overrule <hi>here</hi> than in <hi>other</hi> Instances. Much less is there any reason, why they should take place at a <hi>distance,</hi> upon the first <hi>Conversions</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> when it is so manifest that they did <hi>not</hi> do so at the <hi>first Settlement</hi> of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches.</hi> However, as to this particular of <hi>Deprivation,</hi> I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given my reasons against the <hi>Magistrates Right,</hi> even in the times of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and have answer'd already what has been pretended to the contrary, from the Case of <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and those other <hi>later De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privations</hi> by the <hi>Heathen Magistrates.</hi> And this is at present our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Dispute.</p>

            <p>Indeed in this whole matter concerning <hi>Reasoning</hi> from the <hi>Jewish</hi>  to the <hi>Evangelical Priesthood,</hi> I have taken care to Argue barely from what was common to them both, the Nature of <hi>Priesthood</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and in those very <hi>instances</hi> wherein even the <hi>Apostolical Christians</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Argument.</hi> Our Adversaries on the contrary when they Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the <hi>Princes Power then,</hi> to the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Christian Princes now;</hi>

they do not Argue, as I have done from the <hi>Priesthood</hi> simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, but from the Power <hi>annexed</hi> to the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> yet <hi>seperable</hi> from it, according to the design of GOD in the particular <hi>Constitution.</hi> The Power of <hi>Governing</hi> the <hi>Society,</hi> whose <hi>holy Rights</hi> are administred by it, is, I confess, very <hi>seperable</hi> from the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Priesthood</hi> in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> and whether it was <hi>actually</hi> annexed to it, or not, is therefore to be judged by the <hi>particular constitution.</hi> But particularly for the <hi>Jewish State,</hi> I rather believe that it was <hi>not</hi> annexed to it. For the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> as <hi>annexed</hi> to the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> is founded on the <hi>Right</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> has to <hi>oblige</hi> subjects by excluding <hi>refractory</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as <hi>such,</hi> from partaking in his <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> But so much <hi>Erastus</hi> has, I think well observed, that the only things that then hindred from the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> were only <hi>Legal incapacities,</hi> such as not being of the <hi>Holy Seed,</hi> or being under some <hi>Legal Pollution;</hi> not any whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>immoralities</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Punishment</hi> for not stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the award of the <hi>Priests</hi> was <hi>capital,</hi> as being a <hi>disobedience</hi> to so much of the <hi>secular Government,</hi> as it was <hi>Theocratical;</hi> not <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> from the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of those who had been contemned by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linguent Nor indeed was there that <hi>necessity</hi> that the <hi>Government;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as to <hi>Spirituals,</hi> should be <hi>annexed</hi> to the <hi>Priesthood then,</hi> as there is under the <hi>Gospel now.</hi> The <hi>Prince</hi> was then always obliged to be a <hi>Jew,</hi> and therefore of the <hi>Religion</hi> establish'd for that <hi>Nation</hi> by <hi>GOD</hi> himself. <hi>Now</hi> his being of <hi>an other</hi> than the <hi>true Religion,</hi> is no hindrance by our modern Constitutions, from having a Lawful <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>secular Government.</hi> Then the <hi>Prince</hi> had a better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Theocracy,</hi> to command in affairs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>GOD;</hi> than any <hi>Prince</hi> living can <hi>now,</hi> when no <hi>State</hi> pretends to be <hi>Theocratical.</hi> Then all the concerns of the <hi>Peculium</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to that single <hi>Nation</hi> which was wholly commanded by <hi>one Prince.

               <hi>Courts do not meddle with it.

But of this most CERTAIN we are, that our Laws

do neither suffer a Spiritual Court to entertain in those Causes which by the Law are Civil; nor yet, if the matter be indeed Spiritual, a meer Civil Court to give Judgment of it.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Hookeer.</hi> And he proves what he says in the Margin from passages of the <hi>Laws</hi> themselves, and the Book <hi>de Nat.

               <hi>Fundamental</hi> to all the <hi>Security</hi> that can be given by our <hi>present Constitution.</hi> And it is no way reasonable, that bare <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> without <hi>express</hi> Acts for <hi>Alienating</hi> such <hi>Rights</hi> as these are, should be thought sufficient for extinguishing a Claim grounded on so <hi>inviolable</hi> a <hi>Security.</hi> If they be so, <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth made such <hi>Precedents</hi> for violating <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> too, that no <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> can now be <hi>secure.</hi> And it is withal as certain, that in the <hi>Disputes</hi> which occasioned the passing <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> this particular of the <hi>exemption</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> was one point principally insisted on. Nay, it was insisted on <hi>then</hi> to <hi>higher</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses than were <hi>reasonable,</hi> or than I am concerned for <hi>now,</hi> so far as to <hi>exempt</hi> them from <hi>Secular Courts,</hi> even when they were guilty of <hi>Secular Crimes,</hi> and even so it was most frequently determined in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> That was <hi>Becket</hi>'s Dispute, which generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the following Ages, when he was <hi>Canonized,</hi> and when <hi>Henry</hi> the IId had submitted to <hi>Pennance</hi> for what he had done in opposition to him. This Case of their <hi>Exemption</hi> as to their <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals,</hi> which is all for which I am now concerned, was than so <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally</hi> acknowledged, even by the <hi>Laity</hi> themselves, that there was very little occasion of <hi>disputing</hi> it. Rarely was it ever <hi>invaded,</hi> and <hi>more rarely</hi> yet (if ever) was that Invasion <hi>defended</hi> by themselves who were guilty of it, till the Unhappy Times of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth. So <hi>uncontroverted</hi> was the <hi>Right</hi> for which I plead, that I do not think our Adversaries can give one <hi>single</hi> Instance of substituting a <hi>Successor</hi> into a <hi>See</hi> vacated by no better, than a <hi>Lay deprivation.</hi> This privilege therefore against <hi>Lay deprivations,</hi> was so <hi>undoubtedly</hi> the sense of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> that on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as well as in point of <hi>Right,</hi> all <hi>Patriots</hi> ought to be Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for it, as well as all good <hi>Christians;</hi> all who have a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for those Two <hi>Fundamental Securities</hi> of <hi>Property</hi> as well as of <hi>Religion;</hi> all who are so <hi>wise,</hi> as to <hi>foresee</hi> how far <hi>Precedents</hi> of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating them in <hi>one</hi> Instance, may proceed for violating them in <hi>others</hi> also.</p>

            <p>I hope the Worthy <hi>Defender</hi> of the present Dividers of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> will, by this time, see that this <hi>Proposition</hi> questioned by  him. concerning the <hi>Distinction</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> even from a <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Orthodox State,</hi> is as firmly proved as any <hi>other</hi> particular of the <hi>Vindicators</hi> whole <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> I hope he will also find it conformable to those very same <hi>Authorities</hi> he was pleased to porduce against it,

that of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and even of our <hi>Church of England,</hi> as settled by our <hi>Ancient Laws.</hi> Though the Compass I am obliged to confine my self to, will not allow me to follow either him or the <hi>Doctor</hi> into <hi>other Arguments,</hi> or into particular <hi>Applications</hi> of this I have insisted on; yet I have endeavoured to urge my Argument so, as to obviate whatever they have said that might otherwise have seemed to weaken it. I now leave and recommend the Success to <hi>him</hi> whose Cause I have endeavour'd to plead, not as I <hi>would,</hi> but as I was <hi>able.</hi> A <hi>Good Cause</hi> alone is indeed a very great advantage above Artifices of Wit and Subtilty, in pleading for an <hi>ill</hi> one. That is all that I pretended to. But it is God alone that must give the <hi>Word</hi> to the <hi>Preachers,</hi> and <hi>dociliey</hi> to the <hi>hearers.</hi> And it is his usual way to glorifie his <hi>own Power,</hi> in the <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>contemptibleness</hi> of well-meaning Instruments. This Title I have, and this alone, to his <hi>Assistance</hi> and <hi>blessing</hi> on the <hi>management,</hi> that it will appear to be his own Work, if the <hi>Good Cause</hi> it self do not <hi>suffer</hi> by my concernment in it. The same good GOD dispose our Adversaries to follow the <hi>Truth</hi> rather than their <hi>Worldly Interests;</hi> to consider <hi>impartially</hi> what is said, how contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory soever it may seem to their <hi>Fleshly Inclinations,</hi> to examine with their more sagatious Judgments, rather what the <hi>Cause</hi> it self would afford to be said for it, than what has been said by <hi>me.</hi> He alone can revive in them their old <hi>love</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> of <hi>Unity;</hi> their former <hi>seriousness</hi> in these concerns of the <hi>greatest importance</hi> to them; their former, or even the <hi>Primitive Zeal</hi> for the Interests of the <hi>Church</hi> and of <hi>Religion</hi> in this <hi>Unbelieving Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statizing</hi> Generation. When he shall be pleased to do so, we may then hope to see <hi>Endeavours</hi> for <hi>healing</hi> the <hi>Breaches</hi> themselves have made; we may then hope to see them ambitious of doing it on the most <hi>Honourable Terms</hi> that may be for the <hi>Church</hi>'s <hi>Security</hi> against <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Invasions,</hi> and against the <hi>Precedent</hi> of making <hi>Spiritual Interests</hi> give way to <hi>Worldly Politicks;</hi> we may then hope to see <hi>them</hi> again as much concerned as we <hi>are,</hi> nay, as we <hi>ought</hi> to be, that our <hi>Church</hi> and our <hi>Communion</hi> may not depend on the preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pleasure of a <hi>Persecuting Magistrate.</hi> How much more pleasing a sight must this be to all <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Tempers than our present <hi>Divisions</hi> and <hi>Scandals,</hi> and <hi>Animosities?</hi> When, O When, shall it once be?</p>
