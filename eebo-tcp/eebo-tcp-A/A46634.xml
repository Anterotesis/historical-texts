         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
VINDICATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ON <hi>May</hi> 21. I received a Letter with a printed Book inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
being entituled, <hi>A Reply to that part of</hi> Spira's <hi>Deſpair
Revived, in which the Baptists in general are concerned; but
more eſpecially thoſe at</hi> Aſhford <hi>in</hi> Kent. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſame, I find it ſuch as may, if unanſwer'd, turn to my
great Diſgrace and Contempt; yea, and not only ſo, but it may be
a means to invalidate that Evidence which I have brought in that
<hi>Spira revived</hi> for the Truths of the bleſſed Goſpel, witneſſing againſt
the Atheiſtical Principles of this Age: And yet further, this ſhameful
Reply (for ſo it ſhall quickly be detected) is dedicated to the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> ſeeking Patronage from ſo great and worthy
a Perſon, and ſo abuſing of his Name. Theſe things have ſuch
weight with them, beſides what elſe I ſhall offer toward the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that though ſome are for my ſilence altogether (it being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worth while to anſwer ſuch ignorant and clamorous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
my own integrity, through the Grace of God, being well
known, and no ways obnoxious to their Slanders, being not likely,
I mean, to ſuffer any dimution in my Credit and Reputation here
upon) yet I cannot forbear, being ſo nearly concerned, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for the Truth's ſake, to write a few Lines, and publiſh a ſhort An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
in order to ſo juſt and neceſſary a Vindication. Now, that I may
not be tedious, being indeed under a Temptation thereto, writing in ſo
juſt a Cauſe, in defence of the Truth and my Credit, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in a ſhameful manner by that <hi>Reply,</hi> I will confine my Pen with
in theſe narrow Bounds, to write but of three things; one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Perſon who makes the Reply, and the manner of it; th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
next concerning the Charge which is brought againſt what I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
publiſhed in that <hi>Spira,</hi> ſo far as it reſpected the Anabaptiſts
which conſiſts of two parts; one concerning the poor Melancholy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65213:5"/>
diſtracted Man, <hi>R. M.</hi> and his tragical end; which gave me occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to reflect on the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> as thoſe that did him ſome wrong,
troubling him with their Notions about the neceſſity of Rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>zation
(or being Dipped) which prov'd injurious to him in his
weakneſs and ſtrange confuſion of Mind: The other concerning what I
have written of their practiſing the like upon many others in much like
Caſes, troubling the weak and unſetled Chriſtians, eagerly urging
them to be dipt, and, as I ſaid, making it a Salve for every Sore. In
doing this I will conſider the moſt material Paſſages in that Piece,
laying open the Ignorance and Injuſtice of the Publiſher, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Slanders, Falſhoods, and ſuch other things as make it appear to
the World, that what I wrote of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſo far as I had
knowledge of them, was true and ſincere; and that their Reply is a
mere Slander, and bold and impudent Denial and Contradiction;
whereas they have nothing to object in Truth and Sobriety.
The firſt thing which I conſider, and is very material, is the Perſon
who makes the Reply, and goes about to lay grievous Matters to
my Charge, as though I had wickedly forged all I have written againſt
the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> In the Concluſion <hi>(p. 23.)</hi> he writes thus of himſelf
and the Matter: <hi>Sir, I am a Stranger to you,</hi> N. B. <hi>and to the whole
Matter, any otherwiſe than as I meet it in your Book (and ſome Friends
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear you gives ſome Account) which hath loaded us with a greater weight
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>han is fit to be born.</hi> Now ſurely this is a ſtrange thing, and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
unjuſt, and, it may be, unparalell'd, for a Perſon who
owns himſelf a perfect Stranger to me (as indeed he was, and is) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reporting a Matter to him, to Write and Print at <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his rate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me. What, <hi>a Stranger to the whole Matter,</hi> and yet to Print at
this confident rate, aſperſing, and ſlandring me for what I have
written; and yet he knows not but it may be all true; as indeed it
is, and will be made appear? But Mr. <hi>Wells,</hi> (for I think he that is a
Preacher, and is entruſted to Print on the behalf of his Brethren, may
deſerve this Title; though what he is, or his Quality or Calling I
know not) was told what I had written was all falſe; and of this
<hi>ſome Friends gave him an account:</hi> What then, is Mr. <hi>Wells</hi>'s Pen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Mercenary? And will he be a Champion for his Friends, right
or wrong, though perchance he fight againſt the Truth? How is it
otherwiſe than ſo, ſeeing he knew not the contrary, never hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but one ſide? but ſurely Charity ſhould have believed better, and
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oped better of a Man of whom he knew nothing; and I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to think that no Crime was laid to my Charge by his Friends
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65213:5"/>
(and mine Adverſaries) ſave only, I charged them thus and thus;
and I cannot elſe imagine how he comes to give me that honeſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Worthy Sir.</hi> Strange, that he ſhould Print againſt me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
peremptorily to the World, that I was guilty of all the Evil he
ſays of me, and not firſt vouchſafe to ſend a few Lines, and enquire
whether I could make any defence for my ſelf, or had any thing to
ſay before he paſs'd Sentence, and openly condemn'd me: What,
did he think I had nothing indeed to ſay, not one Word; no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
to be produced, nor any Proofs of what I had alledged?
That good old Sentence, <hi>Audi alteram partem,</hi> which was ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
ſo neceſſary a Rule in Judgment, is quite laid aſide, and
not at all regarded; it ſeems Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> never thought of it, and,
to ſpeak the truth, I vehemently ſuſpect he never knew it. Should
a Judge ſentence a Man upon report only of his Accuſers, never
examining him, nor hearing what he had to ſay for himſelf, it would,
no doubt, be conſtrued the greateſt piece of Injuſtice and Cruelty:
Such as that of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt; who coming out of <hi>Scotland</hi>
to <hi>London</hi> to take the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> firſt diſcover'd his Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to Arbitrary Government, ſaith my Author at <hi>Newark;</hi> for
being told that one had cut a Purſe in <hi>Newark,</hi> the King, without
any legal Proceſs, or the defence of the Party, ſigned a Warrant
to the Sheriff of <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> to hang him, which was executed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:
And this, ſaith he, was a Blot in the Scutcheon of
King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt. The <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo juſt as never to put
any Man to death in this manner. This is indeed againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Light of Nature, to judge and condemn upon meer Reports,
without hearing the other ſide. Not only Life, but a good Name
are too precious to be caſt away at this rate. One would think
that Mr. <hi>Well</hi>'s never went to a <hi>Latin</hi> School, or was read in ſuch
Authors, or how could he but have called to mind that Golden Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Seneca, Qui ſtatuit aliquid parte inaudita altera, Aequam li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet
ſtatuerit, haud aequus fuerit?</hi> Had his Sentence been juſt, yet
without hearing firſt what I had to ſay for my ſelf, it had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
from him. But ſtill they were ſome Friends gave him this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
Were his Friends therefore Infallible? Could they not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
miſinform him? What an <hi>implicite Faith</hi> was this? How juſt
like the Proceedings of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition? The Tribunal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<hi>de propaganda fide!</hi> wherein the Accuſers are examined in
ſecret; and the poor Priſoner is a Stranger to all that paſſeth,
till they begin to thunder againſt him, and proceed to torture,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65213:6"/>
and Sentence, and Execution. But might not theſe Men, my
Accuſers to Mr. <hi>Wells,</hi> after ſo many Months running to and
fro, and ſtirring in the matter, at laſt give in ſome falſe Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?
I am ſure they did, and that notoriouſly, as I will evince
by and by; and I will perſwade my ſelf, having ſo much Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for him, that Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> will own it. Had but the Letter he
had ſent me with his Book, been ſent but ſome Months before,
his pains and trouble might have been ſpared, and his Credit
ſaved; whereas now, he hath brought himſelf into a Snare,
to gratifie his Friends, who impos'd upon his Credulity, ſo that he
Prints groſs Falſehoods, never ſeeking to clear the matters to
himſelf, before he ſet Pen to Paper. How vain was it for him
to write thus to me in his private Letter; <hi>Worthy Sir, Its very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
to me to be troubleſome to any, but I cannot well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
giving you the trouble of theſe Lines.</hi> Alas! the trouble of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Letter is not much; but ſurely it would trouble any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
to be thus ſlandered in Print; eſpecially when writing a
few Lines a little ſooner, and taking that ſmall trouble, might
have prevented ſo great Calumnies: What was this but to ſhoot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
at me, and alſo to wound me openly, and then to deſire
me not to be troubled, becauſe he is ſo kind to tell me what he
hath done? Like thoſe rude Perſons, who cry, <hi>By your leave, Sir,</hi>
when they have firſt ſhewed you ſome Incivility, or done a Man
ſome diskindneſs. But then he deſires me not to take unkindly
what he hath Printed; for, ſaith he, <hi>I have been as tender of you
as the matter will bear; but if you ſuppoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me to be mistaken, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
wherein, and I ſhall, God, willing, labour to give you ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
&amp;c. Great Tenderneſs indeed! and a wonderful Care not to
grieve me with what was Printed: But wherein doth it appear?
Reſolved, it ſeems, he was, or his Friends rather (for he ſaith in his
Reply, <hi>p. laſt, He was ſure he did it unwillingly)</hi> or both were ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
and eager to expoſe me in Print. But what ſatisfaction
ſhall I now have? Will Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> confeſs his Fault as publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and declare himſelf in an Errour? yea, that he hath wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an innocent Perſon, and a Stranger? That he hath traduced me
in a very ſhameful manner? That he hath acted moſt unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Hand, over Head, as we ſay) and very Unchriſtianly, not
ſeeking out the Truth, as he ought, and eaſily might, before he
paſt Sentence, and condemned me openly? Truly, at the firſt
of my Books coming forth, and the Noiſe and Speeches of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65213:6"/>
               <hi>Anabaptists</hi> about me, threatning grievouſly, I did expect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Print (for what do they not dare to do of this nature,
yea and delight in it alſo?) but when it had lain by ſo many Months,
I was a little ſurprized to find it done; but eſpecially to be managed
by a Stranger, whoſe Name I know not, I ever heard before, I
read it in his Letters; Nay, I find, by their own Confeſſion, he
is a Stranger to thoſe very Men (ſome at leaſt, by the Confeſſion
of one of them to me) who ſet him on Work <hi>(i. e)</hi> him, or any
body elſe could be procured. If my Neighbours could not write
themſelves (and yet three of them are Teachers, and one hath been
offering at it, ſcribling out many Sheets in the point of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie)
nor find a Man nearer than <hi>London,</hi> yet ſurely he ſhould
have conſidered better with himſelf, and not have been ſo hardy,
as to have written in a Caſe wherein he knew not one thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
not the Perſon accuſed, nor what defence he could make,
and how he could juſtifie himſelf, and make good his Charge, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
being informed by thoſe whoſe Intereſt it was to blaſt what I
had written. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had heard of the Diſorders
in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> How doth he write to them about it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
Why thus; <hi>When ye come together in the Church, I hear that there b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
diviſions among you; and I partly believe it:</hi> He partly believed what
he only heard by report; but Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> roundly takes up the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reported to him by his Friends againſt me, and believes every
Word which the wiſe Man brands for Simplicity: <hi>The Simple,</hi> ſaith
he, believes every Word. Ah! <hi>Mr. Wells,</hi> had you acted mor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
charitably, and cautiouſly, you had not diſcover'd your ſelf ſo fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
nor done me this wrong; your Folly had not been manifeſted
nor had I ſuffered ſo much as this groundleſs Suſpicion of evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

But I hope <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> will pardon me that I bear ſo hard upon him
For my Vindication doth not a little depend upon it, though yet
have clear Proofs to produce alſo. It was not only Folly and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice

               <hi>His great end is to find out the Offenders, and that this is his great
Enquiry,</hi> let him know that therein he doth abuſe his Readers, and
ſuggeſt Falſehoods in ſo ſaying: For his very Title confutes him; it
is this? <hi>A brief Reply,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wherein the unjuſt Charge of Mr.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
James <hi>againſt them</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Baptiſts) is removed: N. B.</hi> is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
What doth this imply, but that he hath clear'd the matter
fully? proved his Party innocent; convincing me of Falſhood in
all I have written; making me a Slanderer, a Lyar, and what not?
But more fully yet, after the Preface to the Reader, in the
Title again, <hi>A Brief Reply,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wherein he hath falſely charged them,</hi>
N. B. <hi>as will appear in the following Diſcourſe.</hi> I pray in what Page or
Line is this Appearance found? Where are the Proofs? Is there
any thing ſhewed, but only confidently ſaid, and a gainſaying of
what I had written? Let impartial Readers judge if <hi>Mr. Wells</hi>'s
Book do not center in this, and all he brings be only a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
the matters I publiſhed, and averring that I wrote not a
Word of Truth. If his Title had run after this manner, (and he
had kept to it) <hi>A Challenge to Mr.</hi> J. <hi>to prove what he hath Printed
againſt the</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>about</hi> Aſhford, it had been tolerable; but to
talk of making all appear, is like the reſt of his Piece. Thus
he ſtumbles in the Threſhold, and that is very ominous for him;
for he falls worſe and worſe ever after (beginning with a very
Foul Lye, as I ſhall ſhew by and by, and ending with a Paſſage
that overthrows all he writes.) Juſt ſo it is with his dealing with
the Text of Scripture; a Text in the very next place, which he

One cries Victory, and makes Bonfires, and ſings <hi>Te Deum;</hi> and
yet it may be comes off with the loſs: Another ſaith nothing
was done; and it may be it was a great Action: I think when we
ſearch to know the truth, we do more than hear what Parties
in the Caſe ſay, and intereſted Perſons ſay of it: Not that I
think it is impoſſible to know the truth by one Party, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
Witneſſes on one ſide; but when Life or Credit are at
Stake, it is highly unjuſt to go this way, to believe all that is
ſaid, and then boldly tell the World in Print, I have ſearched out
the whole matter, and he is a Slanderer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is one thing
further concerning <hi>Mr. Wells</hi>'s Carriage, which I obſerve, and
then diſmiſs this Head <hi>(ſc.)</hi> how unchriſtianly, how uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he carried it. Why ſhould he, being a ſtranger to me, and
the whole matter, believe his <hi>Aſhford</hi> Friends againſt me altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when he ſaw my Deſign in writing that little Piece was
good; and that wherein I reflected on their Carriage, it was
done ſo candidly, as though I were unwilling to ſay what I ſaid
out of a reſpect to them? Let the Reader conſider it, if I did not
write candidly, and expreſs'd the matter with moderation. Theſe
are the Words I began the Reflection with; <hi>'Tis beſide my purpoſe
to make Reflections upon Perſons of any Opinion or Perſuaſion in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
beſides Atheiſts, who are its avowed Enemies. The</hi> Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
<hi>(or</hi> Baptiſts, <hi>as they rather chuſe to call themſelves) are Men to
whom I bear no ſuch Grudge, or Envy, as to bring up any evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
upon them, as a Calumny or unjust Accuſation: God forbid, that
while I am writing for Chriſtianity, I ſhould act ſo contrary to one of its
Principles, as to do thus: They are Chriſtians, and will, I doubt not, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe
this Cauſe of our Lord with my ſelf; and there are ſome of them
my worthy good Friends, pious, judicious Perſons; but this I muſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
upon this ſad occaſion; and I pray God the Guilty would conſider
it,</hi> &amp;c. If this were not Courteous, Candid, Charitable, what is?
Yea, <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> doth own it ſometimes, though he forgets what he
writ at other times; for he calls it <hi>Flattery,</hi> and a <hi>meer Pretence,
p.</hi> 16, 17. which ſhews what he could not but think of it, that it
was very fair, only he judges my Heart, and acts uncharitably,
rendring me Evil for Good: For I ſeriouſly proteſt, I wrote this
out of good Will, and not fawningly. But becauſe this is the
proper place, I cannot but take notice of his Ignorance alſo, in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65213:8"/>
quarrelling, and thinking to faſten a Reproach upon me for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Chriſtian Friendſhip to the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and ſtiling them
my pious and judicious Friends, and yet at the ſame time pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
ſuch matters againſt them; this he obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 16, 17.
once and again. Now this, I ſay, is groſs Ignorance in <hi>Mr. Wells,</hi>
or worſe, that he could not, or would not diſtinguiſh and ſee the
difference I made between ſome and others of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Innocent and Guilty, and thoſe who were my Friends
and others. I ſaid plainly thus, <hi>They are Chriſtians,</hi> &amp;c. and then
I declare of ſome of them thus; <hi>And there are ſome of them my
worthy good Friends, pious, and judicious Perſons then; and I pray God
the guilty would conſider it:</hi> Now all this he jumbles together, and
makes all the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> my worthy, pious, and judicious Friends;
and then Wonders that I dealt ſo by them, as to accuſe them
thus; <hi>and is not this tragical,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to cut the Throat of your Friends
Reputation?</hi> But ſurely <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> is no Logician, or the meaneſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
known, who cannot diſtinguiſh, nor perceive a difference in
ſo plain a Caſe, not to apprehend that <hi>ſome</hi> hath <hi>others</hi> for its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite;
yea, that <hi>ſome</hi> imports a few out of many in ſuch Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as theſe: But whether he knew it or no, he hath hapned
upon an unlucky <hi>Fallacy</hi> in Logick (which is his natural Logick
it ſeems, and I would not have him proud of it) to compound
what ſhould be divided, to huddle all together, and ſo to impoſe a
wrong Senſe; whereas it is true taken diſtinctly and apart as it
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought: And what is more common than to ſpeak of a Multitude,
and not to mean every individual of them. What will he think
of St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he affirmed that to be true of the <hi>Cretians,</hi> which
one of their own Poets had written of them: <hi>The Cretians are always
Lyars, evil Beasts, ſlow Bellies</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Epimenides.) This Witneſs is true,</hi> ſaith he. What, every Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Child in <hi>Crete</hi> Lyars, beaſtly, and ſlothful, Pagans and
Chriſtians too? No ſure, but it was <hi>vitium gentis,</hi> an Epidemical
Evil, a Fault they were too much guilty of: As if I ſhould
ſay, <hi>The Patriarchs were guilty of Poligamy;</hi> yet not all therefore,
not <hi>Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c. But what would <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> think at this rate of that
place were it is ſaid, <hi>the Diſciples had indignation at the Ointment pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
on Chriſt's Head?</hi> Would he condemn them all for <hi>Judas,</hi> of
whom it is written? and calumniate the Holy Text, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65213:8"/>
not knowing it was a figurative Expreſſion. However, to ſatisfie
him and his Friends, I will explain my ſelf, and declare my own
Senſe, though it be plain enough I called all of them Chriſtians,
and ſome my Friends, and ſome guilty; I count the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in
general Chriſtians, but ſome few of them I called my Friends, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and judicious Perſons; But I will aſſure him, thoſe whoſe
Practices I have known about <hi>Aſhford,</hi> and written againſt, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
none of this ſort; and whoever acts in like manner, as
far as I have Knowledge thereof, ſhall for ever be diſcharged
by me of that Character, pious and judicious. But it is time to
leave <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> himſelf. Come we now to the matters of Fact:
And here he urgeth wonderfully, <hi>to aſſign the Perſon or Perſons guilty
of what I charge the</hi> Baptiſts <hi>with:</hi> Thus in the Epiſtle Dedicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in the Letter to me Printed before the Body of the Reply,
and in the Reply it ſelf, at every turn he urgeth this; and if I
ſhould fail herein he commends it to my Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> to ſee that
publick ſatisfaction be given; and to my Church to take a Courſe
with me. But now, what if the Caſe do not require all this?
what if it be not neceſſary or convenient? What, muſt a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
tell the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and all the World, what every one in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diſcover'd to him? Muſt he publiſh the Names of every
one concerned? It may be an Husband or Wife is concerned, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and Children, Maſters and Servants, and the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are ſuch that it is no ways fit or meet to name or aſſign Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
poſſibly it may breed Variance and Strife, and promote great
Diſorders in Families, and in the Neighbourhood: It may be ſome
<hi>Nabals</hi> are concerned, ſome <hi>Shimei</hi>'s, who would trouble their own
Houſes, and fill the Town with Raillery. May not a Miniſter
ſpare Names in ſuch a Caſe, but he muſt be cryed down for one
that ſpreads Slanders? But it ſeems <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> and his Friends care
not what becomes of any Perſon, nor conſider what is meet and
fit, what miſchief they pull down upon others Heads, ſo they may
but ſalve their own Credit, as they would perſwade themſelves:
But, I doubt not, the World will judge this an extravagant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
to urge the Printing the Names of private Perſons:
And indeed I cannot conceive what good it will do thoſe who
know not theſe Parts, to read the Names of ſtrange Places and
Perſons, which will ſound as harſh as <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
to <hi>Mr. Wells.</hi> As for thoſe of their own Party who did
theſe evil things, I am ſenſible they have their Evaſions to caſt off
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65213:9"/>
the Reproach, (and it is likely they lie upon the catch) ſuch an
one is none of them; ſuch an one they own not; though it
may be a Teacher, or an old <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> Perſons certainly dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> or nothing. But ſo it is, many times they
ſhift the matter off thus; and, as the Hiſtorian ſaid of ſome Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<hi>Difficilius eſt invenies quàm vincere.</hi> But is not this crying out
for aſſigning Perſons a mere Artifice, to be ſo impatient of this
kind of proof, and ſo long a time laps'd ſince the matter was
firſt publiſhed; and ſince <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> concerned to give their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are their own Friends? And who will doubt but that by this
time they are taught their Leſſon, to ſpeak but ſparingly, not the
whole Truth, or ſo fully as to prejudice their own Cauſe? But I do
but ſhew how vain it is for <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> to urge this aſſigning Perſons;
they need not encourage themſelves to hope to eſcape by this Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem:
Proofs I have to produce ſufficient and abundant, and yet
will be ſparing of Names, even of the moſt Criminal.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As for the Caſe of that poor melancholy Man, <hi>R. M.</hi>
who made that Tragical <hi>Exit.</hi> The Caſe, as far as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned,
was this: One of the ſame Name, and of his Kindred,
deſired me to go and viſit him upon the account of his deplorable
Condition; and he importuned me not a little, uſing this as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Argument, That he was continually aſſaulted by the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi>
who in this weakneſs of Body and Mind were like to work
their Will upon him. Upon this I went once (and never more)
and my Carriage was as I Printed in the Narrative of his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and in diſcourſing with me, he did declare himſelf in ſuch a
manner, tht I was ſatisfied that the Opinion of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>
about <hi>Rebaptization</hi> was a great trouble and vexation to him. It
is now ſeveral Years ſince my being with him at that time (about
five Years ſince, his Death was about four Years and an half, and
his Trouble laſted about three quarters of a Year, as I have learnt
from his Siſter, a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who lived all the time with him;) and
ſo I think no wiſe Man will expect I ſhould be poſitive as to the
Words of our Diſcourſe; truly my Memory is not ſo happy;
yea, I am ſorry the matter is ſo far gone from me; for I am ſure
he ſpake ſo much as made that clear to me, which was a Motive
to carry me to him. <hi>(ſc.)</hi> that he was troubled about the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
Doctrine of Dipping; and that his Infant Baptiſm was null;
and that he muſt be rebaptized. Now, what if I could not find
out one <hi>Baptiſt</hi> had been with him? Can it be thought when his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65213:9"/>
Siſter who kept his Houſe was one of them, that in all his
Trouble none came near him? No, not when he had follow'd
them formerly, and now in his Trouble return'd to hear them
again, as <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 15. and his own Siſters owned to
me. Surely what I learn'd from himſelf was a thouſand Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
to me, and what was clear enough by other Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But ſee how it pleaſeth God to put them to ſhame, and to
condemn them out of their own Mouth. One of their Teachers
(one of the three who was with me upon the Account of my
Book, did own to us, that he was with him the ſame Day, or the
very next, after my being there, and that he diſcourſed with him
of theſe matters, and that <hi>he urged Believers Baptiſm</hi> to him (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dipping upon Profeſſion of Faith.) Now ſuppoſing no more
Evidence could be produced; yet upon this alone, how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
was it for Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> to publiſh thus, <hi>p. 11. First, We obſerve,
that you were the only Man that viſited, diſcourſed, and adviſed this
poor Man in his deplorable Eſtate;</hi> and <hi>p. 11. Mr.</hi> James <hi>was the Man
chiefly concerned with him in his Hurry and Trouble of Mind;
but to the end he may not be thought remiſs, and the better to ſeem
clear, he finds out ſome to be mentioned, that, he ſays, did ſo much wrong.</hi>
O ſhameful! Was ever any matter turned ſo fouly againſt another?
What, when I was deſired to viſit him by one of his Kindred, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
his Condition; when a Miniſter was carried to viſit a poor
diſturbed Man, muſt he therefore ſuffer in his Reputation; and
have the Odium of all caſt upon him? But, alas! 'tis too plain
for them, that he was wounded by the <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> and I found
him with an Arrow ſhot in, ſticking faſt, and tormenting him;
and to keep him in their Bonds, one of their Teachers, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
owned, and is certain, is with him the ſame Day (for ſo the
Woman, his <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Siſter is poſitive, though he were not) urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Believers Baptiſm: whether he were there accidentally or not,
or upon deſign, I know not; but there he was, and diſcourſed;
and adviſed him. Yea, further, at another time, as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
confeſſed to me in preſence of a Gentleman who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
me to her Houſe, <hi>June</hi> 12. there was one <hi>F</hi>—another
Teacher among them, who viſited him, and had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Diſcourſe with him about an hour which <hi>F</hi>—;ſaith
another Siſter, he was carried to hear preach, and ſhewed ſome
uneaſineſs as he went, and, as ſhe judged, she was diſſatisfied; but
one of the Neighbours, a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and his Siſter, ſhe found go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65213:10"/>
along with him; which Neighbour had been at the Houſe,
and, ſhe doubts not, brought him thither; and out of pity to him
in his condition ſhe went along with him alſo, and heard the ſame
Man. Yet <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> ſaith, <hi>We obſerve, that you were the only Man
that viſited, diſcourſed, and adviſed this poor Man in his deplorable
Eſtate:</hi> What will the World think of this? What can they?
To begin his Reply thus, <hi>Firſt, We obſerve:</hi> Truly, if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
at this rate, you may obſerve <hi>Firſt, Secondly, Thirdly,</hi> and
infinitely, even as far as you pleaſe, or can invent. But, <hi>Mr.
Wells,</hi> did you obſerve this at <hi>London</hi> by your ſelfe, or did your
<hi>Aſhford</hi> Friends give you theſe Inſtructions? If you did it alone,
it was a wonderful Obſervation indeed; you had better Eyes
than <hi>Lynceus,</hi> and more ſurely than <hi>Argus;</hi> but if your Friends
gave you this Inſtruction, it was ſo much the worſe: For one
of them, (as another confeſt to me) whoſe Hand was to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to get a Reply ſet forth, was one who confeſt that he was
with the Man in his Trouble, and diſcourſed, and adviſed him:
So then here are two of your Teachers found to be with him;
and who will not think but there were others alſo of your opinion
in the ſpace of about nine Months of his illneſs? But, again, I
pray, <hi>Mr. Wells,</hi> how was I <hi>converſant with him,</hi> as you write, <hi>p.
14.</hi> when I never ſpake to him but that one time in my life? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
but once in his Company, ſo as to be able to diſcourſe with
him? I had thought, to <hi>be converſant,</hi> had implied a Familiarity
and frequenting a Perſons Company; ſo that this is no good <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
and that is the beſt Interpretation of it, or I know not how
to excuſe the ſame from a Falſhood.</p>
            <p>But I begin to grow weary of tracing our theſe Slanders, and
Untruths; I will take notice only of one thing more (about the
Caſe of this <hi>R. M.)</hi> and diſmiſs this Head: And really it is a ſad
thing, to conſider how theſe Men ſtrive and ſtruggle, and are
reſtleſs till they entangle themſelves, and Write and Print at that
rate that doth ill become Chriſtians, whom I was willing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
yet to own as ſuch. Pray, Reader, now obſerve what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in theſe Words, <hi>p. 15. Mr.</hi> James <hi>beſtirs himſelf to perſuade
him, that his Infant Baptiſm was true Baptiſm,</hi> N. B. <hi>and to go
to Town to board, and make uſe of a Phyſician of his own way,
and to bear him; which was done: But the poor Man grew weary,
not liking the means that was uſed. And it ſeems, and as he told
his Siſter, that they were in a conſult what to do about him (one
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65213:10"/>
day) and, unexpected to them, he over-heard them; and one ſaid, he
was in love; and another ſaid, he had not a Dram of true Grace;
but he, hearing this, it made an addition to his weak diſturbed
Head,</hi> N. B. <hi>and gets away, and relates the matter to his Siſter, and
ſo waxes worſe and worſe, till at laſt he ends his Life.</hi> For my part,
when I read and conſider this I am amazed; ſo many Lyes in
one Story! Such Falſhoods ſent forth ſo bare-fac'd! If my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
gave theſe Inſtructions to their Brother <hi>Wells,</hi> they are
what I never took them to be; if he Printed it of himſelf, it
is little better in him. Did I deſign a large Anſwer, here is a
large Field for it, and matter enough for one of no great Parts to
work upon, enough to wind and toſs, and for ever ſhame <hi>Mr.
Wells,</hi> and all his Friends who have acted in this Buſineſs: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome body owed them an ill turn, and ſecretly wrought it
this way. But however it were, and though my Neighbours
might deſerve moſt, yet I muſt keep to <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> only; and
truly he hath diſcovered himſelf all along to be an unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Writer: Once before, he obſerved that I was the only Man
was with <hi>R. M.</hi> during his trouble of mind; this he ſaw,
it ſeems, at <hi>London;</hi> there he could tell who went in and out,
and diſcourſed him; and here he ſaw him at Board at <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
which no Creature in <hi>Aſhford</hi> ever ſaw, no, not any of
his <hi>Anabaptist</hi> Friends; ſince <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> ſent out this ſtrange
Relation, we have ask'd his Friends here, and they are ignorant
of the matter: When I diſcourſed his Siſter, the <hi>Baptist,</hi> who
was his Houſe-keeper, ſhe only ſaid, ſhe thinks he was one Night
at <hi>Aſhford</hi> at his Couſins, <hi>R. M.</hi> (the Perſon who carried me o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to viſit him) and her Son who went with him, will ſay,
he was: But the Family deny it, and all ſay it was no ſuch
thing, and are certain he never lodged there one Night, he dined
indeed one Day there (as they tell me) and went up into a
Chamber, and lay down on a Bed to refreſh him; but never
lay one Night in their Houſe. But ſuppoſe it, that he were one
Night in Town; What is this to Boarding, and being there a
time, conſiſting of ſome Days at leaſt; and <hi>getting away</hi> from
thence, as though he were under ſome Confinement in the uſe of
Means for his Recovery? Well, it ſeems <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> is good at <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi>
and that is a notable part of an Orator; but it is juſt as
his natural Logick I obſerved before: I dare ſay, no Maſter of
Rhetorick did ever teach him to invent after this manner: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65213:11"/>
Cicero, Quintilian,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would have been aſhamed of it,
though they were Heathens: And though we may ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
Truth, and this we have Preſidents in Scripture for, yet
neither the Light of Nature, nor the written Word, will allow
us to forge after this manner. But who made this <hi>Officious Lye</hi>
I know not, only this I obſerve, that becauſe they would Print
ſomewhat, and had little to go upon (nothing in truth) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have ſet up all this Sail, and run themſelves a ground.
<hi>Mr.</hi> James <hi>beſtirs himſelf,</hi> ſaith he; ſtrange, that one Viſit, and
but a very ſhort one, ſhould be a beſtirring a Man's ſelf, when
it was but a few Miles off, and the Man lay ſo long in trouble,
that I might have been there many ſcores of times for one,
or as oft as ſome of my Adverſaries take occaſion to talk with
thoſe they hope to bring over to their Opinion. But what did
I perſuade him him to? Why, <hi>to go to Town to board:</hi> Juſt
as much as to go to <hi>London</hi> (or elſewhere) to be dipt by
<hi>Mr. Wells;</hi> of whoſe Name, at that time, I know not that I had
ever heard: And, how ſhould any know that I perſwaded him
to ſuch a thing as this? My Friend with me, who heard all our
Diſcourſe, is a perfect Stranger to it; and his Siſter declares, ſhe
heard nothing of all we ſaid. But now, leaſt I do them wrong,
and give not the true ſenſe and meaning of the Words; and to
do <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> wrong, (though indeed it would prove well for him
if he had only written falſe <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and miſtook in the Senſe)
I appeal to all <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and deſire every Reader to ſay, if this
be not the true meaning of the Words, That I perſwaded the
Man <hi>(R. M)</hi> to go to Town to Board, and make uſe of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
of my own way, which was done <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Man took my
Counſel, and came to <hi>Aſhford</hi> to board) and while he was here,
after ſometime (longer or ſhorter it matters not, ſo it be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be but ſome Days, for ſo he writes, of <hi>one Day)</hi> while they
were conſulting together (ſurely he means the Phyſician and my
ſelf; for he mentioned no other before, and his Senſe carries it
this way) he heard them ſay thus and thus; and ſo he gets
away. Now if I have given his Senſe right, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
his <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which ſurely is even ſo, if <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> write
intelligibly, then here is a wild Romance, and a Tale told, and
a foul pack of Lyes, and all to make me ridiculous. But I
would fain know, who of all <hi>Aſhford</hi> Town can ſay, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>R. M.</hi> was here at Board, during his Melancholy? What
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65213:11"/>
               <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> can ſtand forth, and help <hi>Mr. Wells,</hi> or his Friends,
out of this Mire? In whoſe Houſe did he board or lodge?
As for my own part, I proteſt I do not know, nor can I call
to mind that ever I ſaw that poor Man but once at his own
Houſe, and once or twice while I was in the Pulpit: But
that the Doctor and my ſelf ſhould ever diſcourſe of him thus,
and he near enough to over-hear us, is too like ſome other
Paſſages in the Reply. Yea, if they would turn it upon his
Couſin <hi>R. M.</hi> and his Wife, that they ſaid ſo, and talked ſo
fooliſhly (as I find they harp upon it) yet that will not ſerve
their turn; for they not only deny it, but <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> hath written
and Printed it (as I think I have ſhewed) quite otherwiſe. Well;
upon this wonderful Relation, he gravely proceeds: <hi>Now if
this be ſo, then all this ſtirr to beſpatter the</hi> Baptiſts, <hi>is to clear your
ſelf: But you are the more intangled, and are taken in the Snare you
laid; and I could wiſh there had been no occaſion to diſcover it.</hi>
Diſcover it! A wonderful diſcovery indeed. I am perſwaded
when this Vindication comes forth, <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> will wiſh indeed,
with all his Heart, there had not one been Word written by him,
and that his Friends had been tongue-tied when they told him
ſuch a Story. Are theſe the Bonds and Fetters <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> and
his Friends have put upon me? And do they think to bring
me forth and expoſe me thus to make them Sport? Alas! I
can as eaſily break them as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did his Withs and Cords;
and I am certain they themſelves have pull'd down an Houſe
upon their Heads. For ſhame let <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> write a Retractation,
though it be but for the ſake of this ſingle Story; and ſeeing it is
reſolved, that he or ſome other ſhall anſwer again, write what I
will, as one of them told me (it ſeems they are greatly in love
with Printing, and are proud of appearing ſuch able Perſons)
by all means let them clear this foul matter, but let them take
care leaſt their ſtirring too far make it worſe.</p>
            <p>But it is high time to come to other things; and that, in the laſt
place, to anſwer the Accuſations brought againſt me, as though
I had ſlandered the <hi>Baptists,</hi> in repreſenting them as Perſons wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

yet I will do him no wrong (if I ſhould it would appear, and not
be to my advantage;) but I propound the Caſe plainly, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
it home. Theſe are the things then he quarrels with me for, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reflected on the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> as induſtrious to make Proſelytes;
and urging Dipping, as though all Religion did conſiſt in going
down into the Water; and, in ſhort, he challenges me to aſſign the
guilty, or elſe, he ſaith, <hi>p. 21. It muſt be concluded, you cannot?
and then in what a ſhameful Caſe will you appear?</hi> Now, as to my
aſſigning the Criminals, I have already ſaid a little in anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
it is not always fit and meet, nor is it material: <hi>Cui bono?</hi>
To what good would it be? I have named ſome to their Teachers,
and inſtead of taking a courſe with them, they thought to take a
courſe with me, and promiſed one <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> to print againſt me
for juſtifying my Charge, and to tell the World confidently all was
a Slander. What ſhould I name any Perſons to the World, when
they have been named publickly enough, and they take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
(not at leaſt to be openly known of) but ſhut their Eyes,
and ſtop their Ears, and run upon me, and cry out, That I will
give no Proofs or Satisfaction? I appeal to thoſe few preſent at
that time, when <hi>they attended me</hi> (to uſe <hi>Mr. Well</hi>'s own Words,
<hi>(p. 9.) after the publiſhing my Book,</hi> I appeal, I ſay, to the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their Three Teachers, whether I did not name ſeveral guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the things I laid to their Charge. But to clear all at once, and
to ſatisfie their longing deſires (ſo far as is any ways meet and

my ſelf, and ſhew how able I am every way to vindicate
my ſelf from the foul Slanders caſt on me, and to make
my Charge good to a tittle; let <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> know that I

I, <hi>N. N.</hi> do own and teſtifie, That <hi>N. N.</hi> hath divers times, and
to my great Vexation and diſquietude, urged me to be Dipped; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth the abſolute neceſſity thereof to Salvation; inveighing againſt
thoſe who practiſed Infant Baptiſm, as Antichriſtian, and urging
me to be Dipped, as ever I expected to enter into the Kingdom of
God.</p>
            <p>Witneſs my Hand,</p>
            <p>N. N.</p>
            <p>But, alas! ſhould I go about to lay open the Practiſes of the
<hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> (about us) and reveal what many poor weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
have told me, with great bitterneſs of Spirit, how
burthenſome their very Life was to them by reaſon of their
importunate Sollicitations to bring them to be dipped, and their
Deſperate Speeches ſtriking an Horrour into their Minds, vexing
their Souls continually, it would, I doubt, ſound very ſtrange
to many Readers: But ſo it is in truth; and yet, forſooth, theſe
Perſons would fain be counted innocent, and cry out of the
wrong I have done them. One inſtance I cannot but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
and that a little largely, it being ſo material; and I am
glad (as the Caſe is) to take the opportunity to let the World
know it, and judge thereof. And becauſe <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> hath
ſprinkled here and there a little of the point of Controverſie,
and his <hi>Aſhford</hi> Friends make advantage of his Reply (ſuch as
it is) to ſcatter their Books among us (and ſurely the like
was never known: for to this Book of his they have tack'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
(ſtitch'd them together) yea, and more than ſo, at the
end of his Reply there are theſe few Lines Printed to couple
them together; <hi>And, as to the point of Baptiſm, we refer that to
the following Treatiſe, formerly written by another Hand, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
The Reaſon why,</hi> &amp;c. Good <hi>Mr. Wells,</hi> why did you not
ſend me a perfect Copy? But I ſuppoſe you thought I ſhould
hardly be caught with your Chaff, and therefore a few Books
were provided for my ſelf, and ſuch as could better judge
what was written; Truly this was civilly done, not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
me with any more Books than your own; and now it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65213:13"/>
ſeems I have nothing to do to anſwer any thing but your Reply;
this is a kindneſs I acknowledge (I ſay) becauſe <hi>Mr. Wells</hi>
hath ſcattered up and down ſomewhat of Controverſie, I think
it convenient to give a touch or two to the ſame, to prevent
Miſtakes and Error, and to ſend forth an Antidote for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as well as a Vindication for my ſelf. The inſtance by
which I take occaſion to write this, was this: A Woman aged
near Forty Years came to me to be baptized: Upon inſtructing
her in the Principles of Chriſtian Religion, and her anſwering to
ſuch Queſtions about the ſame, as ſeemed to me neceſſary,
(firſt having conſulted the Practice of other Churches in like
Caſes) and profeſſing her Faith and Repentance, I baptized her
on a Lord's Day in the Evening before the Communicants:
Now, quickly upon her being ſo baptized, the matter being
noiſed abroad, ſhe was ſet upon by the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> even as I
have repreſented the too common Practice of ſome of them;
and one of them in their Communion (which they cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own)
did exceedingly perplex this poor Woman with Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
and Cavillings, asking her what Faith ſhe had in what
was done, and ſpeaking againſt it as no Baptiſm, ſeeing ſhe
was not dipped: This really diſturbed her, ſo that ſhe lamented
it to me; not that ſhe was unſetled, or believed them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they followed her with ſuch Diſcourſes, giving her no
reſt: Yea, at the very time of writing this (which is now about
two Years ſince her being ſo baptized) the Deſign is carried on
very buſily to proſelite her: She declares to me, how ſhe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
diſquieted by that Party; ſhe now tells it me with Tears,
that ſhe is wearied by them, and hath deſired them to let her
reſt, being well ſatisfied in her Baptiſm. But that which is yet
more conſiderable, is this: At the time when thoſe three Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were with me about about my Book, among others whom
they preſs'd me to name, and inſtance in, I named this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and repreſented the Evil of this Practice, in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thus to diſquiet a poor weak Woman, who was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
ſo authentickly (as one would think all Chriſtians ſhould
allow) being an adult Perſon, having profeſs'd her Faith and
Repentance before the Adminiſtration of the Sacrament. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
one of them had the confidence to tell me, it was indeed
no Baptiſm. Monſtrous Doctrine! What will become of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
at this rate? and what hope can Millions have, to whom
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65213:13"/>
it hath been applied in any other way than that of the <hi>Baptists?</hi>
What, can a Mode deſtroy the Eſſence of the Ordinance? and
ſhall the Application of Water in a leſs quantity render it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ineffectual, and deſtroy its end and efficacy? When the
Name of the true God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is
put upon the Perſon; and the true Element of Water is uſed;
and the principal end of its application ſignified, which is waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Soul with Chriſt's Blood, and purifying it by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Spirit; and all is done by a Miniſter ordained to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
Is not this Baptiſm? O, but ſhe was not dipped, and that
is Baptiſm, and that only. Poor, ignorant, confident Men, thus
to cavil! The Word <gap reason="foreign">

not only a Dipping, but other applications of Water to
waſh: Yea, it is certain, that ſome of thoſe <hi>diverſe Waſhings</hi> under

is a ſignificant Word, as well as <hi>Imprimis:</hi> Every Tradeſman
knows this. Indeed at the rate ſome <hi>Baptiſts</hi> writ and report the
Words of the Learned, they would perſwade ſilly People all
the learned Men were almoſt <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> yea, and (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
Self-condemned, being as <hi>they</hi> are in Opinion, though of
a contrary Practice. They make ſome ſpeak a few Words, and
ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is to Dip, to plunge in Water; but then, as it were,
ſtop their Mouths, and cry hold; whereas good Men, might
they go on, they would add, to Waſh, to pour on Water, to
Sprinkle: And their Quotations are much of this kind, very
deceitful, <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> and keeping back a material part, and ſo
making them to ſpeak very favourably for them; the very
thing we are upon proves this, Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> ſaith, <hi>Baptiſo</hi> is to Dip,
as Lexicons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſay, as though that were all, and it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to make a Digreſſion to ſhew it by their Quotations of <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
Piſcater, Calvin, Poole,</hi> &amp;c. But I would fain know, who
can prove our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf was Dipped, or Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in his Baptiſm; or that any of thoſe Baptized ones ſpoken of
in the New Teſtament, were ſo Dipped or Plunged? Not a
Word that ever I yet read did prove, I ſay, ſoundly prove it:
Probability is no proof of this Degree; Opinion is not Faith.
An immerſion there might be, and yet not a total one; or, it may
be ſome other application, as by pouring on of Water. That
Baptiſm was oft performed of old by Dipping, I gainſay not;
but that there were other ways, is certain alſo. Pray let <hi>Mr. Wells</hi>
conſtrue theſe Words. <hi>Fundere aquam, infundere,</hi> and ſometimes
<hi>Javare, abluere,</hi> found oftentimes in the Writings of the Antients;
yea, and ſometimes <hi>Aſpergere,</hi> for Baptizing? Alſo let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle,
how they Baptized ſome in Priſons, and in their Beds,
ſick of Feavours, in Sweats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells us at large of a
Friend of his? If this were not done by ſome other way than
by Dipping the whole Body, let Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> declare how that could
be. But ſhall we call in queſtion at this day the Baptiſm of
all thoſe in former Ages who were not Dipp'd? and ſtrike ſo
many Saints and Martyrs out of the Roll of the Baptized, who
are now in Heaven? An horrible boldneſs to ſpeak at this
rate! But let them take heed; for how, as I ſaid, can they
prove our Lord himſelf was ſo Dipped? I am ſure one anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Writer was of another mind, (and ſurely he was not alone)
even <hi>Aurelius Prudentius,</hi> who ſings thus of it (being a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65213:14"/>
Chriſtian Poet flouriſhing about thirteen hundred Years
ſince)
<q>Perfundit fluvio paſtus Baptista locuſtis.</q>
               <hi>i. e. John the Baptist</hi> poured ſome of the Water of the River on
him; our <hi>Baptiſt</hi> would teach him to ſay, <hi>Immergit fluvio,</hi> &amp;c.
but it ſeems he knew better, or at leaſt thought otherwiſe: And
<hi>Bernard</hi> (a later Writer by far, and yet not very late neither,
for he lived about five hundred Years ago; and hath the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
if I miſtake not, to be called by ſome, the laſt of the
Fathers) hath this notable Expreſſion, <hi>Infundit aquam capiti creato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
creatura-nobilior, &amp; Dei verticem mortalis dextra contrectat &amp;
contingit;</hi> i. e. John the Baptiſt, <hi>that noble Creature, poured Water
on the Head of the Creator, and the Right Hand of a Man touched and
handled the Head of God.</hi> I do not produce theſe Teſtimonies, as
though I would maintain that our Lord Jeſus was not Dipped but
only to ſhew the boldneſs of thoſe Perſons, who cavil at the
Baptiſm of all ſuch as are not plunged in Water, and do, by
crying up Dipp'd or Damn'd, trouble the weak, and drive them
into a dangerous Melancholy. Yea, what if the Eunuch went
down into the Water, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 38. or Chriſt came up out
of the Water, <hi>Matth. 3. 16, Mark.</hi> 1. 10. (though by the way
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is only, he came up <hi>from</hi> the Water, not <hi>out</hi>
of it) What doth this prove? Dipping a total immerſion? Surely
they that ſay this may ſay any thing. But now we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Baptiſm, I cannot but take notice of Mr. <hi>Wells</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
to call Infant Baptiſm a <hi>Scriptureleſs Notion, p.</hi> 14. and <hi>p.

Eccleſia turbas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Whereas in this Age ſome phrenſical
(or enthuſiaſtical) Perſons have raiſed great ſtirs in the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Infant Baptiſm, and do not ceaſe at this day to cauſe the
ſame Tumults, I cannot but ſubjoin this Appendix to reſtrain
their Fury. Now the Paſſage I would quote out of this notable
Chapter, is this: <hi>Quod autem apud ſimplicem vulgum diſſeminaret,
longam annorum ſeriem poſt Chriſti reſurrectionem praeteriiſſe, quibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitus
erat Poedobaptiſmus; in eo Foediſſimè Mentiuntur: Siquidem
nullus est ſcriptor tam vetuſtus, qui non ejus originem ad Apoſtolorum
ſeculum pro certo referat (i. e.)</hi> Whereas they talk up and down among
the ſilly people, that it was many Ages after Chriſt's Reſurrection
before Infant Baptiſm was known, in that they tell a <hi>moſt foul
Lye;</hi> foraſmuch as there is no Writer ſo ancient, who doth
not for certain refer the Original thereof to the Apoſtles Age.
But why doth Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> tell us of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the Old Teſtament?
Who thinks Baptiſm was the Sacrament then in uſe? But verily he
hath laid himſelfe open by this unwary Expreſſion: For I can tell him
of a multitude of Children Baptized within that time (and that
by Sprinkling alſo, through the dropping of the Cloud and the
daſhing of the Waters, as many Learned doubt not) and prove
it out of Holy Scripture. Let him read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. and ſee if the
Apoſtle do not ſay, That <hi>all the Congregation of Iſrael</hi> which paſſed
through the Red-Sea, were <hi>baptized unto Moſes in the Cloud, and in
the Sea;</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which I leave to <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret.
Were there not <hi>many Children,</hi> thouſands of them,
when the Men alone were above ſix hundred thouſand? Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of all Ages undoubtedly? Though <hi>Paul</hi> calls them all <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
in the firſt Verſe, yet I ſuppoſe that muſt be taken in this
Senſe, that as the Children came to Age, they alſo were all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> their Fore-fathers: Yea, and this was typical in
ſome Senſe of our Sacrament of Baptiſm, as he ſheweth in the
next Verſes, that their drinking of the Water of the Rock, was of
the Lord's Supper: But why is <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> ſo over-confident? It is a
dangerous caſe, ſure, to declare againſt Infant Baptiſm at this
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate, as a <hi>new Doctrine,</hi> when <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian,
Origen,</hi> and thoſe Ancients who lived in the very next Age to the
Apoſtles, ſpeak plainly of it, as a Practice in their Days, and
write of it as no other than Apoſtolical: Or why is he ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to call it a <hi>Scriptureleſs thing;</hi> when ſeveral <hi>Houſeholds</hi> are ſaid
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Scripture to be Baptized; and all the ſtrength of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65213:15"/>
can never make it clear there were no Children in them?
But ſurely if Families might be without them, yet there muſt
be Children in Nations, and they were to be made Diſciples and
Baptized by Chriſt's Commiſſion to his Goſpel Miniſtry: But
we do not lay our ſtreſs on theſe things, and build only on Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities.
No, but we are ſure, that Infants are the Subjects of
Baptiſm, becauſe they were of old of Circumciſion; the Church
of the Old and the New Teſtament being one, only the Seals of
the Covenant altered; waſhing being a more gentle way of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating,
than cutting of the Fleſh: If we had not this Priviledge
under the Goſpel to have our Children viſibly entred and taken
into God's Church, the <hi>Jews</hi> were really in a far better State than
we, unleſs we will deſpiſe God's Sacraments and Ordinances, and
care not whither our Children partake of them, or go without
them: Yea, 'tis certain, we are concerned in God's Covenant,
which he made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, as the Holy Ghoſt
witneſſes in divers places, and have the ſame Spiritual Priviledges:
<hi>Niſi fortè arbitramur, Chriſtum ſuo adventu Patris gratiam imminuiſſe
aut decurtaſſe, quod ex ecrabili blaſphemia non vacat;</hi> as ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>
in the former place; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> unleſs we think that Chriſt by his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
cut ſhort his Father's Love and Grace, which thought can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be excuſed from Blaſphemy it ſelf. But where is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of that Priviledge? Where is it ſaid, I did indeed receive
their Children, but as for yours I will not be ſo gracious to
them? Alas! Chriſt declares quite the contrary: He ſhewed his
Love to little Children both by Words and Actions: And that
good Shepherd who marked his Lambs of old as well as his Sheep,
would have them now waſhed alike in the Laver of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But I muſt remember I write a Vindication, and it is not
my work to meddle with the Queſtions in debate between us;
only I have touched at theſe things, being led to them by <hi>Mr.
Wells,</hi> and to ſhew the Vanity and ſtrange Confidence of theſe
Men in theſe matters; it being that whereby they take the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
and undiſcerning Souls.</p>
            <p>But I grow weary of writing; and indeed this is the great Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<hi>Mr. Wells</hi> hath done me; he hath created me ſome Trouble,
and many Thoughts, whereas my Hands are full enough of
Work, the Work of my Miniſtry; not being ſo happy as many of
them, to mind a Flock, and a Family, and a Trade alſo, and yet find
time for Diſputing, Printing, and what not, upon every little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence?
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65213:16"/>
Were it not that I were afraid leaſt I ſhould betray the
Truth, and the Souls of ſome poor People, who, it may be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
this, as well as ſtand in need of it, I could be very well
content to be ſilent; but foraſmuch as I am ſet for a defence
of the Goſpel, I cannot let ſuch matters paſs without taking
ſome pains, in a caſe where ſo many round me are ſo deeply
concerned: Not ſo much that I need to fear my ſelf as others;
I think nothing hath befallen me, but what hath happened to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Miniſters of the Goſpel far above me. I did but touch
them, and they have kicked againſt me, and made a ſad noiſe.
But, thanks be to God, they have prevailed but little hitherto,
in thoſe endeavours they have uſed to make Proſelytes; of which
I had reaſon to complain, and did ſeriouſly warn them. In ſix
Years I have loſt but one of my Flock, and that a young Man,
who was but a little while under my Care, and ſo ſuddenly gone,
that I was ſcarce aware of it before his Departure: It was but
once I had opportunity to ſpeak to him before his being Dipped,
and then he utterly refuſed my Offer to Diſcourſe with thoſe
<hi>Anabaptists</hi> in his preſence for his ſake, who had perverted him;
nay, nor would he be brought to read a little Piece I would have
put into his Hands, but raſhly he would be Dipped, and renounce
his firſt Baptiſm: And who could have ſtopped ſo reſolute a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
Miſguided Zeal did ſtrangely tranſport him, and ſince his
Dipping he hath done me ſome wrong by miſrepreſenting ſome
things I had ſaid of Baptiſm; but I forgive him. Surely <hi>Mr.
Wells</hi> hath loſt his Wit (and that is pity indeed, he ſheweth ſo
little all along) in that Expreſſion, <hi>p. 17. Alas! 'tis to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
you have loſt ſome of your Diſciples (which) makes you ſo
peeviſh, pettiſh, froward, and unkind to your Friends.</hi> No, <hi>Mr. Wells,</hi>
not ſome, but one; and my place is not thinn'd, but much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
yea, rather than fail, your Friends (it ſeems) have a ſtrong
deſire of doing me that Honour to be my Hearers: One of
them who lived and dyed of your Communion, a zealous Perſon
in your way, hath oft ſpoke to me and others of being my
Hearer moſt gladly, but refrain'd leſt it ſhould give Offence: And
another, who it ſeems (as one of your Teachers told me) had been
inclined to your Opinion many Years, yet having been my Hearer
for ſome time, after her being Dipp'd lamented it with Tears, that
ſhe muſt leave ſuch Preaching. Truly in this I am become a Fool,
in glorying, but ye have compelled me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65213:16"/>
One thing more, and I conclude: Whereas <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> makes
a Challenge to diſpute with me, in his Reply, eſpecially in his
private Letter, I am afraid it would be but a ſpending time idly, to
argue with that Man, who knows not how to put the Queſtions
fairly he would diſpute upon: His ſecond Offer is this, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>We are ready to try the Cauſe, whether Dipping or Sprinkling be
moſt ancient?</hi> But what, I pray, would this come to? Who ſpeaks
againſt the Antiquity of Dipping? But was it a total immerſion,
a Dipping the whole Perſon, certainly, infallibly, without Gueſſes,
Conjectures, and Probabilities? Yea, but what if ſo? If Chriſt
give his Churches liberty to Baptize by pouring on Water, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Application (as the Word will bear, as <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> may ſee in
Lexicons, if he can read and underſtand them) then this
Queſtion is meerly trifling. Dipping there might be in Chriſt's
time, yea, and that the beſt way of Baptizing, but yet not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary way; not abſolutely ſo; if in caſe of Neceſſity and
Mercy Men might break the Sabbath,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and be blameleſs; or on
the ſame Account they might eat the Paſſover on another Month
and Day then God inſtituted it; ſurely then, in caſe Dipping
were uſed of old, yet it is not of that abſolute neceſſity as our <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi>
pretend, but in Caſe of Weakneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be diſpenc'd with;
and where we have our Liberty, why ſhould we not make uſe of
it? But then his fourth Aſſertion is more frivolous: Fourthly,
<hi>We are ready to prove, That Dipping is Baptizing, and that it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Chriſt's Inſtitution.</hi> This indeed will require no great proof,
and <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> may manage it, no doubt; but the Queſtion is,
whether a total immerſion, Dipping all the Body, be the only Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of Chriſt, and nothing leſs, nothing elſe; whither it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
of any other Application of Water; and this we deny;
let who can prove it. Only the third Queſtion is of any Moment,
Thirdly, <hi>Whether the Sprinkling of Infants be the Baptiſm of Chriſt?</hi>
this he roundly denies; and this comprehends both the Subject
and manner of Application of the Water; ſo that it is all in one,
and muſt be divided to be rightly handled. But I think it will not
be worth while to diſpute with <hi>Mr. Wells,</hi> of whom I do not
know, nor doth he make it appear, that he hath the leaſt Learning
that might be a means to keep him in Order, and repreſs Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſneſs
and Confidence. But if <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> have ſo much lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and his Zeal be ſo great as to bring him to <hi>Aſhford,</hi> and my
Circumſtances fairly permit it, I will not ſay but I may meet him
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65213:17"/>
upon this Score; I do not think to hide my Head, but to give
him an Anſwer: But ſtill I muſt profeſs, I am yet afraid of this,
and cannot but perſwade my ſelf, that if it ſhould come to a Tryal,
<hi>Mr. Wells</hi> would argue much after the ſame manner he writes <hi>(i. e.)</hi>
poorly, and foully; not handſomly nor honeſtly, being over-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of what he hath no ground for; and ſo he would create a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of trouble to me, and perplex the matter he takes in
hand.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I do forgive <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> the wrong he hath
done me, only deſiring him, not to act ſo raſhly for the future,
judging in a Cauſe, and condemning a Perſon he is wholly a ſtranger
to. As for my Neighbours, who ſtirred him up, and were ſo eager
for ſome body to Print againſt me, and gave ſuch falſe Witneſs, I
freely forgive them alſo; only deſiring them to mind their own
Buſineſs and to be quiet; above all, to beware how they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in Printing, leaſt they prejudice their own Cauſe, and
bring Shame and Diſgrace upon themſelves and their Brethren
alſo.</p>

               <hi>In the Epistle to the Reader (near the end)</hi> there is a very <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtical</hi>
Paſſage, reflecting upon the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in general: But
though it be hard, yet being nothing to <hi>our purpoſe,</hi> only a piece <hi>of
Raillery,</hi> which it would be eaſie, but unchriſtian, to retaliate, let
it paſs; only I am ſorry that <hi>Mr. Wells,</hi> who (as it ſeems by his
private Letter to me) is <hi>an old Man,</hi> and who in his Reply ſhews
a great deſire of <hi>Moderation,</hi> ſhould make ſuch <hi>a Blot</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the beginning of the Letter to me.</hi> Worthy Sir, Whatever
your Ends and Aims were in ſetting forth thoſe Tragical inſtances in
your Book, we cannot but take notice, that ſome part of your matter
was to ridicule, and repreſent the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> to the World, as a very
weak inſipid People, and yet crafty and induſtrious to catch Men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
to make a Party.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:65213:18"/>
As for my Ends and Aims, in ſetting forth that Book, they
were good, even ſuch as I expreſs'd, to bear my Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Atheiſm of this Age, and to employ ſome part of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
God had given me that way. What need you ſay, <hi>Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they were,</hi> when I declared they were ſuch as theſe? But my
deſign was far from ridiculing the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in ſuch a manner as
<hi>Mr. Wells</hi> ſets it forth: It was indeed to warn and adviſe them;
and who cannot ſee how it came in? Who will think, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
I wrote that Piece to reproach the <hi>Anabaptiſts?</hi> No, it was
far from my Heart and Thoughts; but in writing, this came in,
and it ſeemed to me not amiſs to make uſe of it, hoping it might
do good, and might be ſerviceable to good ends, not to Cavillings,
and Contradictions as it proves: But the Succeſs I leave to God.</p>
            <p>'Tis very hard and unkind to beſpatter us all with the miſcarriage
of a Perſon, or Perſons (if any ſuch be.)</p>
            <p>How little need there is of this Reflection may appear by what
I have written in my Vindication. Surely none will think me
ſo weak (or malicious, which Yet I am ſorry <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> ever and
anon ſuggeſts) as to charge this Evil upon every individual <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> or the whole World, who are far enough out of
my knowledge: My Words import no ſuch thing, as I have
cleared them, and ſhewed it was his Ignorance ſo to take them.
But why that Parentheſis <hi>(if any fuch be?)</hi> Verily I had not written
ſo, if I had not known it, or could not have proved it: But if
<hi>Mr. Wells</hi> would not believe me, it was uncivilly done in him to go
about to perſwade the World to do the like.</p>
            <p>We deſire you to aſſign the guilty, that we may clear our ſelves of that
foul Scandal, or elſe we prefume all is a Fiction of your own Brain, and
with a malicious deſign to beſpatter and abuſe us.</p>
            <p>For aſſigning the guilty I have already anſwer'd at large, and
done enough toward that (I doubt not) to clear my ſelf, that it
was no Fiction of mine, much leſs a malicious deſign: But is not
this very? unchriſtian in <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> to ſurmize thus, and ſuggeſt
ſuch foul things as theſe ever and anon? even ſuch as one
would not ſuſpect of any who are not very obnoxious upon ſome
evil account or other? What, to forge ſuch matters as theſe? To
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65213:18"/>
lay a malicious deſign to abuſe a Party? This is ſad indeed: I
am ſorry <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> could harbour ſuch thoughts of me, and
Print them too; but the beſt of it is, he had no reaſon, unleſs
he were confident that all his Friends and Society, were pure and
infallible.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>James</hi> was the Man chiefly concerned with him <hi>(i. e.</hi> R. M.)
in his hurry and trouble of mind; but to the end he may not be thought
remiſs, and the better to ſeem clear, he finds out ſome to be mentioned
that he ſays did ſo much wrong. <hi>And to the ſame purpoſe:</hi> Upon your
ill Succeſs you raiſe a clamour upon others to clear you; and having dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
a Pit for them, fall in your ſelf, and muſt be expoſed to open ſhame
and reproach.</p>
            <p>The former Anſwer may ſerve very well for this. For it is all
of one piece; ſtill unchriſtian, uncharitable, ſurmiſing and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Heart, and miſ-judging. Truly this is a very falſe and
wicked Aſperſion; and 'tis ſtrange to me that a Man ſhould dare
to hint ſuch a thing as this, which ſurely he could not expect that
any Reader (but deeply prejudiced) ſhould believe, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abhor his Suggeſtion. I pray what was there that I ſhould
ſeek occaſion to clear my ſelf, or find out ſome to take off any
reproach might fall upon me? I was deſired by a Kinſman of <hi>R.
M.</hi> to viſit him, and to obviate (what I could) the deſigns of ſome
<hi>Anabaptists;</hi> What hurt, I pray, in my conſenting and going
thereupon? Or what need I to fear any ſhame if he did not
hearken to my Advice and comply therewith (Yea, how knows
<hi>Mr. Wells</hi> but he did?) But I was ſo far from looking after this,
that after that one Viſit I never ſpake more to him. How vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and wickedly then doth <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> ſuggeſt ſuch Slanders? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he takes a liberty to write almoſt any thing in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You do ſay, they preſently ſat in with him; and told him
his way to have Peace and Comfort was to be Dipped: Now this
Mr. <hi>James</hi> doth particularly charge upon them, and therefore <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
what.</p>
            <p>No Man, I think, will underſtand me that I ſaid they told him
<hi>in totidem verbis,</hi> but <hi>in ſenſu,</hi> that they perſwaded him to this <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
a way to peace and comfort. Now this I did hear, though no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſpoken to him, yet by a Kinſman of his, who, as I ſaid, uſed <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
as a ſpecial Argument to induce me to viſit him; yea, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
heard ſo much from his own Mouth that ſatisfied me, that it was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65213:19"/>
even ſo: and I have proved it <hi>(a poſteriori)</hi> in the former Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that there were ſome who did act thus, adviſing him about
Dipping as the way to Peace (for ſurely they did it not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him, as I told <hi>K. L.</hi> when he owned his diſcourſing with him,
and adviſing him upon that Head.)</p>
            <p>But that Dipping ſhould be a new Doctrine in your eſteem, ſeems
ſtrange to us, or that any that pretends to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel (and
eſpecially a Scholar) ſhould ſo affirm.</p>
            <p>The Dipping thoſe already Baptized (or if you will, ſuch as
were Baptized in Infancy) is indeed a new Doctrine, and that
is the Caſe before us. Which of the Ancients did ever do this?
Who ever pleaded for it till of yeſterday? Of very late Years?
Let this be ſhewed by any of the <hi>Baptiſts.</hi> Though Dipping be a
Baptizing, yet Dipping thoſe already Baptized (though but in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
or by pouring on of Water) is a new Doctrine. Where
was this practiced in Primitive times? In what Volume do we
read it? Indeed one or two (and I never ſaw more quoted) were
againſt Baptizing in Infancy (but for other Reaſons than our
<hi>Baptiſts)</hi> ſome even deferring it to a Death-bed; but not one that
I have met with did declare, that if a Child were Baptized it was
nothing, and the Perſon muſt be rebatized, when adult profeſſing
Faith and Repentance.</p>
            <p>Its very probable Mr. <hi>James</hi> might very much puzzle his weak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
Head, if he preſs'd him to believe his new Doctrine of Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Infants, or that his Infant Baptiſm would yield him any ſpiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
or Comfort.</p>
            <p>It was not my Work to preſs him thus, only I told him, it
was no time now to think of new Baptiſm, and being Dipped:
I applied other Remedies than <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> ſuggeſts; but I
thought it proper (as the Caſe ſtood) to ſhew him that it
was no ways neceſſary to have his Thoughts working
at this time about Dipping, but to reſt where he was
as to that point, and to call upon God, and reſiſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But was this ſolid and ſuitable to his Malady, to instruct him, and
make him believe his Infant Baptiſm was comfortable and profitable to
him?</p>
            <p>I pray how doth <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> know that I did thus? What tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
is it to Write and Print at this rate? Is this a Reply? To
whom, or to what? If he had matter enough to write, ſurely
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65213:19"/>
he would have ſpared ſuch Paſſages. Juſt before he ſaid, <hi>if he
preſs'd him,</hi> and in the next Page, <hi>if he alledged this;</hi> but here he
takes it for granted, that I took this Courſe, and then ſaith,
<hi>But was this ſolid,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> is of and on, and knows
not what to write: But then he goes on boldly on this Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
adding within a few Lines,</p>
            <p>And thus he was hurried in his Mind, and ſuffered (it is probable) not
a little by that blind Zeal of yours, or Scriptureleſs Notion.</p>
            <p>It is probable I hope to none but <hi>Mr. Wells:</hi> And who but
he would look upon what I did as acted with blind Zeal, when
I did not run before I was ſent; nor ſought occaſion, but was
invited, and importuried, and then how could I do leſs out of
reſpect to my Office, as a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt? I went
not with a deſign to make a Proſelyte (as <hi>Mr. Wells</hi> hints, <hi>p.</hi> 10.
ſaying, <hi>You could not proſclyte him)</hi> yet if Mr. <hi>Wells</hi>'s Friends had
not been with him preſently after me, 'tis probable my Advice
might have done more good; but now it is in vain to gueſs at it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
for if I did him any good; it ſeems they quickly marr'd it.</p>
            <p>If that Salve of Sprinkling in his Infancy were applied to him for his
Spiritual Sore, it might very well diſtract him.</p>
            <p>What if it were not applied? then here is juſt nothing ſaid,
a Reply to no purpoſe. But what a dreadful conſequence doth
<hi>Mr. Wells</hi> draw from thence (ſuppoſing it were ſo) <hi>then it might
very well diſtract him:</hi> A dreadful Reflection indeed a terrible
Charge againſt Infant Baptiſm. For my part, I reflected on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the unadviſed Carriage of ſome <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and their raſh
Zeal to promote their Opinion, and to make Proſelytes; their
indirect and evil Practices; their bold and bitter Speeches; but
I ſhould have been aſhamed to have branded their Doctrine thus
Where Mr. <hi>Wells</hi>'s Moderation is I know not; it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in his Reply. But I hope he doth not mean a perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,
but only a little hurry of mind, and that his next
Words are exegetical, and leſſen the Senſe, as it follows, <hi>and he n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
ſuffer a little by ſuch inconſiderate and blind Zeal:</hi> Let it b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>
groſe.</p>
            <p>And that the World may be ſure to know who you mean, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the name <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> as you falſely put upon them, and ſay, wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
they rather choſe to call themſelves <hi>Baptiſts.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65213:20"/>
Good Mr. <hi>Wells,</hi> how did you read this? Methinks you read
as badly as you writ: How could you ſay I repeated the Name
<hi>Anabaptiſts?</hi> What, did you miſtake <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in the Lines before
for <hi>Anabaptiſts?</hi> For I never repeated this Word: Read <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>
twice if you can; and ſurely <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> and <hi>Baptiſt</hi> are not
one and the ſame Name; for you write your ſelf a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi>
yet ſay I falſely put the Name <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> upon you. But why
falſely put upon you? 'Tis the proper Name of thoſe of your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
though it may be you like it not; and if we call you
<hi>Baptists</hi> it is a Favour, which Favour I was willing to ſhew you
(I mean thoſe of your Opinion) but you acknowledge it not; but
are angry; yea, if we call you not <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> we do in a ſort
diſown our own Baptiſm and Principles about that point: For we
ſay (and doubt not we are able to prove it) that Infants are
truly Baptized, as well as the Adult: But you Baptize ſuch as
were ſo Baptized in Infancy, and therefore are <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi>
and the Name truly agrees to you, which ſignifies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizers.
For my part I am not for long and hard
Names <hi>(Seſquipedalia verba)</hi> or elſe I had us'd that Name of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>apaedobaptiſts;</hi>
but I judged the other both proper, and beſt known;
and I do not ſee why it ſhould be a matter of Offence to you to
uſe it; I am ſure 'tis of no great Moment; however I uſed theſe
two promiſcuouſly <hi>(Anabaptiſt</hi> and <hi>Baptiſt)</hi> not deſigning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you by the Name (no nor any otherwiſe ſeeking occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſo to do, as you have too oft ſuggeſted) but only to write
moſt properly; which is according to common ſpeech, and as may
be beſt underſtood.</p>
