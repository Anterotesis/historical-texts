            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Never so much prized my rude conceptions, as to judge them worthy of a publication; and the just diffidence of my immature yeares and shallow judgement, hath often caused me to withstand friends im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunacy.</p>
            <p>I well know to use <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his expression, <hi>non esse abs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que periculo multorum judiciis ingenium tenue &amp; exile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere</hi>; it were far more safe for my slender Shallop to be confined within the narrow River of a private Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then to launch out into the Worlds main Ocean. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I sadly observe the curiosity of the times, the variety of mens humours; what one approveth, another rejects; one thinks it is too facile; another, too obscure; one sayth it is too loose; another, too elaborare. And (which is yet worse) such is the perversness of this Age that novell fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, jangling controversies, (which like <hi>Rebecca's</hi> Twins cause a sore strugling in the wombe of our Church) nay, horrid Blasphemies finde more acceptance then solid and sacred Verities. So that might this Sermon have died the common death of others, it should have been buried out of sight.<note place="margin">Psal. 57.41. <hi>Detractoria ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ba sunt arma &amp; sagittae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arma propè slantes, saggitae longè absentes vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi> Ugo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis.</note> But considering how slanderous tongues (sharp as swords that wound neer hand, yea, as Spears and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that hurt further off) have sought to put it to a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ignominious death, I am enforced to revive it, that innocencies plea may reach as far as Envies accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Adversaries of these weak labours stand both on the right and left, to wit, furious Novelists and fiery Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65906:4"/>As for the former, I wonder not that they contemne them; Since here are neither known truths clothed in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth phrases, nor (which is viler) old errours in a new dresse, the only fashions that Sectaries are enamoured with.</p>
            <p>As for the latter, I lesse marvell that they should tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them; the very subject, and occasion of them being their shame and anguish.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am ascended this sacred Mount with joy and feare. Joy in that blest occasion of this solemne meeting; feare of my too too unfit abilities for this weighty service.

            <p>If forward on the difficulty of the businesse in hand, I feare least through my steril invention, and stammering tongue, the worke should miscarry and prove abortive. If round about on this numerous Assembly, judicious Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, I feare, as knowing my empty notions cannot satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your solid apprehensions. If backward to those Silver Trumpets which have formerly proclaimed the praises of God in this Sanctuary, I may well be afraid to sound my crack'd pipe and bruised reed. Last, if upward to that awfull Majesty, in whose place I stand, I desire most of all to fear and tremble, lest either through my dulness or unfaithfulnesse I should betray my Masters message. Yet on this last object I fix my eye. It was his providence, not my desert or desire called me hither. It is his glory, not my own honour I set before me; in his, not my own strength; I shall endeavour to performe my taske, not medling with matters of State, but only the state of the matter; for which purpose I shall intreat you to turne your eyes to that sage Apothegme of the Kingly Prophet

The Impressions of Gods marvellous acts upon us must not be like that which the stone makes in the water, raising circles, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one wave on another, and for a time making a noyse, but soon after it sinkes down, and the water returneth to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer smoothnesse: so we while judgement is fresh, to publish it from man to man, and soone after let it sinke into the depth of oblivion, and we returne to our old sinnes. <hi>David</hi> was of another mind, who resolveth to <hi>remember the yeeres of the right hand of the most high, Psalm</hi> 77.11. The Heathen had three graces inseparable sisters; the one to give, the other to receive, the third to returne, and all painted young; to learne us, that benefits should never wax old in our rememberance.</p>
            <p>For this cause the Saints of old composed songs, appointed Daies, penned Chronicles, erected Monum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>For our cleerer and quicker dispatch, be pleased to walke with me through these three Stages. The enemies worke, Gods work, our worke; what they would have done, what God did doe, what we should and ought to doe. The worke of mischief in which they were snared. The worke of judgement wherein, if ever, God was known. Our work of duty, now and ever to be performed.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The adversaries work. <hi>Opus mirabiliter singulare, &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulariter mirabile.</hi> Such as the present age may well admire, the future age will hardly believe, and no former age can parallel. A treason without a reason; yea to use S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hieroms</hi> expression,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65906:15"/>
of the face of the fourth Monarchy, without a name, <hi>quia crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas fine modo,</hi> cruelty without measure. A worke without a match, though to have been acted by a Match; in a word, a plot so odious, a Tragedy so direfull, that the actors would not have owned it when effected: but as <hi>Nero</hi> fathered the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Rome</hi> on the Christians, so had they prepared a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to cast it on the Puritans.</p>
            <p>If you aske who were the authors of this worke, the word in the Text well fits them, they were <hi>wicked,</hi> seditious, yea traiterous troublers of Israel; the word is singular in the Text, and it was one wicked incendiary, <hi>Faux Orci,</hi> a Firebrand of Hell, that should have put the <hi>consummatum est</hi> to this horrid worke. But withall the word is taken collectively, and there wanted not a combination of wicked men in this designe; those in the Text are called in the former verse Heathen; these in the plot were Papists; so much the worse, because pretending Christians.</p>
            <p>We shall doe no wrong to that <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> high Priest of Rome, and man of sinne, not <hi>caput,</hi> but <hi>canda Ecclesiae,</hi> if we attibute, at least, the encouragement of the worke to him, as being, though not an actor, yet by his Buls an abettor of it; such have their Popes indeed ever been, their <hi>Vrbanes Turbanes, Pii Impii, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Inclement, Hildebrand Helbrands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall do as little injury to the Jesuites, Jebusites, Judasites rather, if we impute to them the contrivement of the worke. These indeed are the onely Schoolmen that fetch argumets out of the Shambles, and conclude all their Syllogismes in <hi>Ferio</hi>; the best Pulpit men to strike to the heart with dead, not lively, occisory, not operatory Sermons. They may well be called <hi>Cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theirs was the head worke, and tongue worke in this plot, to absolve, resolve, pray, prophecy. You have heard their Psalmody, <hi>The memory of novelties shall perish with a cracke.</hi> That when it had come to passe, it might have been said, <hi>The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</hi> They were the men who justified as lawfull, nay sanctified as pious, yea, would
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65906:15"/>
have glorified as meritorious, this hellish worke.</p>
            <p>The actuall managing of the worke, was by a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of English Gentlemen, but with Romish hearts, who drew together like an Impostume to an head; theirs was the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke to hire a Cellar, digge through the wall, buy in the provision, and execute the project; and so the accomplishment of the worke was theirs; the Jesuites as the Poet, and they as Actors in this Tragedy.</p>
            <p>If you inquire what moved them to the designe, they tel us in their Confessions, Religion, Necessity, Conscience; wicked men indeed to defend slaughter with conscience, cover mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe with necessity; patronize Rebellion with Religion; no wonder their rage was fierce, when grounded on a false zeale. It is the worst madnesse <hi>insanire cumratione,</hi> nay <hi>religione</hi>; to be madde with an opinion not onely of reason, but religion; men are never more violent, then when they thinke God is of their party; and as charity is accounted coldnesse of Religion, so a pretended zeale of Religion causeth coldnesse of charity.</p>
            <p>But what was the intent, or rather extent of their worke? In sum it was a Parliamentary breakfast, an irrevocable writ of dismission to that high Court; our Enemies will tell us where our strength lyeth; it was to have <hi>cut off head and taile, root and branch in one day</hi> as the Prophets expression is. <hi>Esay.</hi> 9.14.

            <p>The hand of mischief was ready to have done the work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was known to be lift up; the snare on our heeles, before it was discovered to be laid; the poyson almost at our throats, before we could see what maner of liquor it was.

I say no more, but know that Religion is the Soul of the body of a Common-wealth, and guesse your selves what a monster that Kingdom will be that is informed with an 100 Souls; yea, undoubtedly the toleration of many will prove in time the subversion of the one Orthodox Religion in that Church wherein it is granted.</p>
            <p>I have onely one request before I leave this exhortation, to you famous Citizens (it will be a work well becomming your thankfull hearts; and a part of answer to <hi>Davids</hi> question; <hi>what shall I render)</hi> that now while you are piously consulting to settle,<note place="margin">Psal. 116<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12.</note> and advance the maintenance of your preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters? you would take into your thoughts, the erecting and endowing a Colledge or Society of able instructed Scribes, who with their pens dipt in the Nectar of Sacred Writ; may (as with swords) cut off all superstitious Idolatry, and the head of that <hi>Hydra</hi> of Heresie which riseth up so fast in this declining age.</p>
            <p>The Crocodiles about the Banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> if rub'd or but prickt with a Quill of <hi>Ibis,</hi> are so stupified that they cannot stir, and the pens of Orthodox Writers are the presentest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against the poyson of errours; how might this prove as a Towre of <hi>David,</hi> where the Horsmen of <hi>Israel</hi> might have Shields and Targets to fight the Lords Battails.</p>
