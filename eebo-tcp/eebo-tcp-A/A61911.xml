            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>May it please your Majesty,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have had strong impulses upon my mind for some dayes, to present this Paper to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> and I humbly hope it will not be made to suffer much under an <hi>evil Resentment,</hi> upon its presentation to your hand, because it bears a Testimony about it, of the Authors good affections to your <hi>Royal Self</hi>; for my witness is on High, that I did not write this Paper because I <hi>love</hi> you not, because I <hi>honour</hi> you not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I <hi>own</hi> you not, in your <hi>Royal</hi> capacitie of <hi>Magistracy</hi> and Civil Power; God knoweth that you have not any Subject more Christianly real or cordial unto you; and I humbly beg that your <hi>Majesty</hi> would be pleased so far to deny your self, as to read it with patience, and to judge of it as you shall see cause.</p>
            <p>I beseech your <hi>Majestie</hi> to Consider, That it is one of the Soveraign and high Concernments of your Soul, to understand, and to be acquainted with the Counsels and mind of God, and to find time to search throughly into those worthy Mysteries, which the blessed Angels (those great Princes of Heaven) judge it no wayes beneath them to pry into; and when they,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119400:3"/>
who are Gods by institution shall narrowly and with delight contemplate the Real Excellency of his Glory,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 12.</note> who is a God by nature, they must needs be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into his likeness, according to that most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable Passage of the great Apostle; <hi>But we all with open face beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> and when the gods on Earth, shall be changed into the same Image with the God of Heaven; not doubt but blessedness is coming on a pace upon the world.</p>
            <p>Now if your <hi>Majesty</hi> be pleased to look into the excellent proceedings of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, towards men; he doth not take away his favour, or withdraw his grace from all men, because some abuse it, &amp; render themselves so fearfully wicked, as not onely to sin against the Law of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, but against that glorious Gospel of grace sealed and confirmed, by the blood of ever blessed Jesus;<note place="margin">Eze. 18. 20.</note> nor will he <hi>punish the Innocent for the guilty: but the soul that sins shall die; the Father shall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for the Son, nor the Son for the Father, but every soul shall bear the burthen of his own sin.</hi> O that your Princely Mind might be Eluminated or enlightned by this heavenly instance, that your <hi>Majesties</hi> Actions to all your Subjects, (from the Peere to the poorest) may be guided by that Rule which God himself hath been pleased to lay before you.</p>
            <p>I shall humbly take leave to mind your <hi>Majesty</hi> of the <hi>Liberty of tender Consciences,</hi> which your <hi>Majesty</hi> declared to indulge in your <hi>Declaration</hi> from <hi>Breda,</hi> for which many thousands did in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity blesse the most High God, who put it into
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119400:3"/>
your <hi>Majesties</hi> heart to declare your Resolution to provide in that particular, That such as did uot <hi>disturb the Peace of the Kingdom, might Worship God according to their Light</hi>; and that <hi>no man should be molested or disquieted for differing Opinions in matters of Religion, who could not joyn in the Publick service of worship</hi>; Yet in regard of some Rebellious persons in the City of <hi>London,</hi> who pretended to the like Liberty of worshipping God apart from the Parochial Assembly; who made Insurrections and committed Murder, under groundless pretences, of fighting for the Kingdom of Christ; whereupon your <hi>Majesty</hi> by <hi>Proclamation</hi> hath forbid all <hi>Meetings</hi> whatsoever, in private houses, or houses built, or purchased for the use of Prayer, and other Ordinances of Gods Worship; whereby the <hi>Innocent suffer for the Guilty;</hi> and many of your <hi>Majesties</hi> Loyal and obedient Subjects are questioned, and publickly suspected to their great prejudice in their reputations, the consequence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is very mischievous to them and their Families.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine how your <hi>Majesty</hi> can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied, as to the Innocency of the <hi>Baptized People</hi> and others,<note place="margin">
                  <p>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie of the Baptized People of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kentish Petition</hi>; and many more to that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               </note> who have not onely disclaimed the wicked Rebellion of the said persons, but they have pressed their Innocency from the very thought or Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any such wickedness; If your <hi>Majesty</hi> please to consider that in case three or four of your Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick servants should have committed, or done fome unworthy Act, whereby they had incurred your just displeasure, upon which your <hi>Majesty</hi> should have discharged all your servants from any further attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in your <hi>Royal Court,</hi> although they never had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119400:4"/>
any thing to do with the Offenders, or their wayes; It may be supposed, that the Innocent would have thought this a very severe Act? I shall Humbly leave Your <hi>Majesty</hi> to make the Application.</p>
            <p>But if it be said, the Law is against that Indulgence formerly granted unto us, by your <hi>Majesty</hi> (as was hinted in the Answer to the Petition of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in <hi>London,</hi> given at your <hi>Majesties</hi> most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Privy Council,</hi> to the said Petitioners) and therefore no longer to be continued unto us, unless the next <hi>Parliament</hi> (to whom we are referred) provide for the same.</p>
            <p>Upon which <hi>Answer,</hi> some make this Observation; That seeing the discontinuance of Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Indulgence, proceedeth from the Aspect of some <hi>Old Law,</hi> then we should have felt the influence thereof, although <hi>Venner</hi> and his disciples had never been born: Moreover, if there be any such Law, it was in being before Your <hi>Majesty</hi> sent that Dove, with the <hi>Olive-Branch of Liberty of Conscience,</hi> (viz.) Your <hi>Declaration</hi> that granted us <hi>Toleration</hi>; for no Law was made against our Meetings by that <hi>Parliament,</hi> which Your Majesty tearmed, the <hi>Healing and Blessed Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Your Majesty saw Reason to suspend the Execution of those Laws, they being hurtful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious to men of Tender Consciences; then there is the same Reason for Your Majesty to suspend them still, out of Tendernesse to all such as have in no wise abused Your Clemency and Grace, to them vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in that Particular.</p>
            <p>And whoever have, or shall move Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119400:4"/>
continue Your <hi>Proclamation</hi> against Meetings, to worship God, or to take occasion by those Laws, to Grieve and Afflict poor Men and Women, who have Opinions different from those of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (for such endeavours are not wanting, by them that know not what spirit they are of) and this is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Astonishment and Wonder, if Your <hi>Majesty</hi> consider it, how far such men are from improving Your Excellent <hi>Proclamation</hi> against <hi>Swearing, Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery</hi> and <hi>Drunkennesse,</hi> or being in <hi>Taverns</hi> after <hi>nine of the clock at night.</hi> Oh! how little notice is taken of these <hi>Proclamations,</hi> or of the Laws to which they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, either by the <hi>Swearing Debauched Persons</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or by Your Majesties Subordinate Ministers? and how few (if any) have been prosecuted upon those two <hi>Proclamations,</hi> and what Multitudes upon the other? And this is much to be lamented, that men may with lesse danger, meet at <hi>Taverns, Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houses,</hi> and other places of Debauchery, to <hi>Drink</hi> above measure, or <hi>Swear, Game, Rant</hi> and <hi>Tear,</hi> as if there were neither Heaven nor Hell, God nor Magistrates; but if a few poor Men and Women, meet together in the Fear of the Lord, having mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Faith, and Oneness of Heart, to pray unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; a part of whose Petition is, that God would Blesse &amp; Guide Your Majesty, and all that are in Authority, that we may <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godliness and Honesty,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. at such Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings many are offended.</p>
            <p>And may it further please Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> to consider Your afflicted and innocent Subjects, how they have been haled from their Peaceable Habitations, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119400:5"/>
thrust into Prisons, almost in all Counties in <hi>England,</hi> and many are still detained, to the utter undoing of themselves and Families; and most of them are poor men, whose Lively-hood (under God) depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the labour of their own hands; so that they lie under more then an ordinary Calamity, there being so many thrust into little rooms together, that they are an anoyance each to other; especially in the City of <hi>London,</hi> where the <hi>Lord-Mayor</hi> crouds them very close together; that it hath been observed, the Keepers have complained, they have had too many guests; and whilest they suffer there, some of their Wives and tender Babes want bread at home.</p>
            <p>And how long this will be the portion of some, I know not, unless Your <hi>Majesty</hi> extend the like Grace to other Prisoners, as Your <hi>Majesty</hi> did most Princely to them at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in giving Order to Discharge them, they acknowledging by Subscription, Your Majesty to be the Supream Magistrate of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of all others of Your Majesties Kingdoms and Dominions, without pressing the Oath of <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> which some are not free to take, by Reason Christ saith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> and in St. <hi>Iames</hi> 5.12. <hi>Above all things my Brethren, Swear not;</hi> they mistaking these two places, understand that Christians should not Swear in any Case; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of meer fear, lest they should offend against a Divine Law, have fallen under the Penalty of that Humane Law, which requireth us to Swear, our <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> to Your <hi>Majesty.</hi> O, that Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency might enterpose, that their weaknesse on the one hand, and the Severity of the Law on the other, might not ruine many hundred Families.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:119400:5"/>But to return to that for which I am in Travel <hi>(viz.)</hi> that we may worship God, according to our light and measure of understanding, unto which we have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without being restrained from the exercise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by the Magistrate, or by having any thing impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon us, as <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Rules of Worship</hi>; in the behalf of which, I humbly tender these six <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> following;</p>

and Humane, and in the Promotion and Propagation, of it, so inhumane and dishonourable to Christ; it may serve the <hi>Turk</hi> to support his <hi>Alkoron,</hi> but it will much dishonor Christianity, to offer to support it by that which good men believe to be a distinctive cognizance of the <hi>Mahometon</hi> Religion, from the Excellency and Piety of Christianity, whose sence and Spirit, is excellently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24. <hi>The Servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, in meeknesse In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing those that oppose themselves</hi>; If then any man will smite those that are his Opposites in Opinion, he must quit the Title of being <hi>Gods Servant</hi> for his pains; nor can a Distinction of Persons Ecclesiastical and Secular, give advantage for an escape; for even the Secular Power, if it be Christian, must not be strikers of others for the Matters of their Faith, for God alone is judge of erring Persons, as that Learned Doctor <hi>Ieremiah Taylor,</hi> now <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Down,</hi> saith in his thirteenth page of his <hi>Epistle Dedicatory,</hi> to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Book, entituled, <hi>The Liberty of Prophesie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> 2. The second <hi>Reason</hi> against restraining or using force in Matters of Religion; is, Because Christ, who is the Only Law-giver to his Church, gives this Precept for the Regulation of the Conversation of his Disciples;<note place="margin">Mat. 7.12</note> 
               <hi>Whatsoever you would have men do unto you, do ye even so unto them</hi>; than which there is no Law more reasonable, nor more just: It cannot be supposed that Kings sitting in the Throne of Government, or place of Trust and Rule, are exempted from the observation of this Commandment; which if so, then if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates be of this Perswasion, that Christ dyed for all men, and the people believe as <hi>Calvin</hi> did, that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Elect onely; What can the Magistrates do
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119400:6"/>
in this case? for if they make a Law in favour of the Peoples Judgement, then they wrong themselves, which I suppose they will not do, if a Law be made in favour of their own Opinion against the Peoples, then besides the injury which is done to the people, they break that Royal Law before mentioned, and thereby become guilty before God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> 3. The third Reason against restraining, or using force in matters of Religion, is taken from the unreasonablenesse of such proceedings; for what is more unreasonable, then to deny men the use of their Reason, in choice of their Religion? for if <hi>Scripture Tradition, Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> be the evidence in a question; yet Reason is the judge; that is, we being the Persons that are to be perswaded, we must see that we be perswaded reasonably, and it is against Reason to assent to a lesser evidence, when a greater is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, but every man for himself is to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, if he be able to judge, but if he be not, then he is not bound under the tye of necessity to know it, nor will God punish him for not knowing it; and not onely the unreasonablenesse, but the impiety of using force in this case, may be further seen, if it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that there is nothing under God hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the understanding of a man, God commanding us to believe his Revelations, perswades and satisfies the understanding, by his commanding and revealing it; for there is no greater probation in the World, that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is true, then because God hath commanded it to be believed; but then it must certainly be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us, that God hath so commanded it; but no man hath any Efficacy or Authority on the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another, but by Proposal &amp; Perswasion, and then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119400:7"/>
a man is bound to assent according to the operation of the Argument, and strength of the Perswasion; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed can he assent sooner, or other wayes though he would never so fain; he therefore that in this case useth force or punishment, punisheth a man for keeping a good Conscience, or forceth him into a bad; he both punisheth sincerity, and perswades hypocrisie, he presecutes a truth, and drives into an errour; he teacheth a man to dissemble, to be safe, but never to be honest nor acceptable to God. Learned Doctor <hi>Taylors</hi> Argument for <hi>Tolleration</hi> is very Excellent, in his Epistle to his <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Prophecie,</hi> in page 14. <hi>This very thing</hi> (saith he) <hi>being one of the Arguments I use to perswade permissions, left compulsion introduce hypocrisie, and make sinceritie troublesome and unsafe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> 4. The fourth Reason which I humbly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to consideration, That persecution for Conscience, or the Civil Magistrate using force in the matters of Religion; is, because it came in through corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the times, so that it is so far from being of Divine Sanction, that it is <hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>sensual</hi>; for the proof of this I shall onely transcribe a passage out of that worthy Author, Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> in his aforesaid <hi>Epistle</hi> to his <hi>Liberty of Prophecie,</hi> Page the 18, 19. Which is as followeth; <hi>That against this I have laid prejudice enough from the Dictates of holy Scripture, it is observable that this with its Appendent degrees, I mean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of Prophesying, imposing upon other mens understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, being masters of their Consciences, and Lording it over their Faith, came in with the retinue and train of Antichrist; that is, they came as other abuses and corruption of the Church did, by reason of the Iniquity of times, and the cooling of the first heats of Christianity, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119400:7"/>
of Interest, and the abatement of Christian simplicity, when the Churches fortune grew better, and her sons grew worse, and some of her Fathers worst of all; For in the first three hundred years there was no sign of persecuting any man for his opinion, though at that time there were very horrid opinions commenced, and such which were Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary and parallel enough to determine this question; for they then were assaulted by new Sects which destroyed the common Principles of Nature, of Christianity, of Innocency and publick Society, and they who used all the means Christian and spiritual, for their disimprovement and conviction, thought not of using corporal force, other wayes than by blaming such proceedings; and therefore I do not urge their not doing it, as an Argument of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness of such proceedings, but their defying it, and speaking against such Practices, as unreasonable and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to Christianty;</hi> for which the Learned Doctor cites all these Fathers, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian, Lactantius,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary, Minuitius, Felix Sulpitius, Severus,</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Austin, Damascon, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact, Socrates, Scholasticus,</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard</hi>; and he further saith, <hi>that all wise Princes till they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born with Faction or solicited by Peevish Persons, gave Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration to differing Sects, whose Opinions did not disturb the publick Interest</hi>; and in page 20. <hi>till</hi> 400. <hi>years after Christ, no Catholick Person, or very few did provoke the secular arm, or implore its aide.</hi> So far he. From which it is evident, that the Magistrates imposing in matters of Religion, is an <hi>Evil,</hi> from which I pray God deliver your <hi>Majesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason.</hi> 5. The fifth Reason is taken from the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of some <hi>great Princes,</hi> who did both give and perswade <hi>Tolleration;</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:119400:8"/>
your <hi>Majesties</hi> Royal Grand-Father, in his Letter to the States of the <hi>united Provinces</hi> dated the sixth of <hi>March,</hi> 1613. amongst other things thus wrote, <hi>Etdistrictè imperetis ut Pacem Colant seinvicem tolerando in ista opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionum ac sententiaram, discere pacitià Eoque Iustius vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demur vobìs hoc ipsum suadere, debere quod Neutrum Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimus adeo deviam, ut non possint cum Fidei Christiana veritate, &amp; cum Animarum Salute consistore</hi>: (Englished for common Benefit) <hi>That you charge them to maintain peace by bearing one with another in such difference of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Iudgements</hi>;<note place="margin">There were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sharp contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about Religion amongst the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters; at that time King <hi>Iames</hi> adviseth the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to moderate them, not to kill or punish them, for they may both be saved.</note> Therefore it seemeth more Right, that you should be thus perswaded, seeing neither of the Judgements is found so dangerous, but that it may stand with the true Faith of a Christian, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls.</p>
            <p>The like Counsel in the divisions of <hi>Germany</hi> at the first <hi>Reformation,</hi> was thought reasonable by the Emperour <hi>Fardinand,</hi> and his Excellent son <hi>Maximilion, they had</hi> observed that violence did <hi>Exasperate,</hi> was <hi>unbles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, unsuccessful,</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi>; and therefore they made Decrees of <hi>Tolleration,</hi> and appointed Tempors and Expediences to be drawn up by discreet Persons; and <hi>George Cassander</hi> was designed to this great work, and did some thing towards it; and <hi>Immanuel Phillibert</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> repenting of his War undertaken for <hi>Religion</hi> against the <hi>Pedimontans,</hi> promised then <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,</hi> and was as good as his word; as much is done by the Nobilitie of <hi>Polonia</hi>; and <hi>Theodoricus</hi> the Sage, King of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> asswaging the vemency of the <hi>Arians</hi> against the Orthodox, <hi>No belief</hi> (saith he) <hi>is carryed on by blowes;</hi> nor is that Excellent saying of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth to be forgotten, he being soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to put a <hi>Heretick</hi> to death, made this wise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,

               </gap> this, the <hi>French King</hi> (although he be the second son of the Church of <hi>Roome</hi>) gives <hi>Tolleration</hi> to different perswasions in matters of <hi>Religion;</hi> for the <hi>Hugonets</hi> have their Churches and Places of meeting for to worship God in according as they are perswaded by order from their <hi>King;</hi> and the world is witness how prosperous they have been, since they have left fighting for <hi>Religion</hi> among themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. The sixt and last Reason, I have taken from the ill success, that alwayes attends such proceedings; for whoever used force upon the body to change the mind, or to make men believe something they are not perswaded of, or to disbelieve something they have received for truth, or to leave off worshipping God, in that way which they think is most agreeable to his will; they will have no better success than that man had, that clapt his shoulder to the ground to stop the <hi>earth-quake:</hi> and the experiences which <hi>Christendom</hi> hath had in this last Age, are sufficient instances; when <hi>France</hi> fought amongst themselves, the <hi>Catholicks</hi> against the <hi>Hugonets,</hi> the spilling of their own blood was Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough, of the imprudence of that way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting <hi>Religion,</hi> and that all the blood shed in open Arms, and private Massacres could not prevent their further growth, nor extinguish that light that sprung up amongst that People; and the name of the <hi>Hugonets</hi> is not onely still in <hi>France,</hi> but they and their Religion <hi>Tollerated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the great instance is in the differing temper, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and success, which <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had; the clemency of the first, had almost extinguished the Flame, but when she was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

            <p>And we are not without example nearer home, in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, what Force and Violence was there used, to make the People believe, as the <hi>Queen</hi> and her <hi>Bishops</hi> believed, some was burnt to death, some destroyed in Persons, and many that scaped with life, were undone in their estates and lively-hood; and all this was so unsuccesful, as to the suppressing their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther growth, that it did the quite contrary, for the more they were <hi>opprest,</hi> the more they <hi>grew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall onely add a passage out of Learned <hi>Bishop Taylor,</hi> in his Epistle to his <hi>Liberty of Prophesie,</hi> page 25. <hi>But it is</hi> (saith he) <hi>observed by</hi> Socrates, <hi>that when the first Persecution was made against them</hi> (that is) <hi>such as differed in Opinion from the Bishop at</hi> Rome, <hi>by</hi> Pope Innocent <hi>the first; at the same instant, the</hi> Gothes <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded Italy, and become Lords of all</hi>; it being just in God, to bring a persecution upon them, for true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, who with an incompetent Authority, and insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Grounds, do persecute an errour lesse material, in persons agreeing with them, in the profession of the same common Faith.</p>
            <p>The next thing I humbly offer to Your Princely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, is the Divine Bond upon our Hearts, to worship God according to our Light; and the crying sin, we must commit, if we shall resist our own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and refuse to obey the Command of God upon our Conscience, to assemble our selves together for his Worship,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 25.</note> and that we ought to esteem our

duty to God, much dearer than our <hi>Estates, Liberty</hi> or <hi>Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our Souls are fully perswaded, that it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to meet together, and <hi>speak often one to another,</hi> to <hi>exhort</hi> each other daily, to <hi>take heed of sin,</hi> and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>after vertue,</hi> and to <hi>presse after the Mark of our High Calling of God, in Christ Iesus our Lord;</hi> and to <hi>provoke to love and good works,</hi> and <hi>if any be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in a fault, to restore them in the Spirit of meekness; and to relieve the poor, and to support the weak,</hi> that by <hi>bearing</hi> one anothers burthens we may fulfill the Law of Christ; and to walk so inoffensively in our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, as to give <hi>no Iust occasion</hi> neither to your <hi>Majesty</hi> as Supream Magistrate, nor to any of your <hi>Ministers</hi> under you; nor to any of the People or Neighbours about us; but to observe that excellent Law of Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them</hi>; and if any shall persecute us for our Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-sake, to bear it with patience and not to return <hi>evil</hi> for <hi>evil,</hi> nor <hi>reviling</hi> for <hi>reviling</hi>; but contrary-wise to do them <hi>good</hi> for <hi>evil,</hi> and to <hi>pray for them,</hi>
