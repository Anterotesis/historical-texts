            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as much (as by way of example) in the Chollericke, is knowne an inclination to yre: in the Melancholicke, to ware: in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, to myrth: and in the Flegmaticke, to slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnesse. All which inclinations, are reported to be the vtterers hath of the naturall Motions and conditions in men, which by reason and wisedome
<pb facs="tcp:28360:5"/>
be well gouerned. Which well appeared by <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochrates,</hi> who by his face was iudged wicked; yet thorow Phylosophy knowne to be well condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. But in beastes for the lacke of reason, are these affections and conditions, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in his booke <hi>de secretis se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>retorum,</hi> may not bee gouerned: in that they liue and perseuer after their sense and appetite. By which euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that Phisiognomie to be a necessarie and lawdable Science, seeing by the same a man may so readily pronounce and foretell the naturall apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto the affections, and conditions in Men, by the outward notes of the body: which although a man may thus foretell the natural motions, and actuall conditions: yet of this, it is not accounted so perfect and <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>me a Science: séeing by the same a man may erre, in sundry subiects hauing Grace and wisedome.</p>
            <p>But in that men (for the more part) do liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sensuall wil in themselues, and that none but the wise and godly (which is by an inward work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the spirit) do liue after reason: for that cause is this Phisiognomy accounted and named a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: which instructeth a man by the outwarde notes to foretell the naturall motions, and actuall conditions, that consist and dwel in many persons especially in those, which liue after their affection and appetites, rather then gouerning themselues
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:28360:5"/>
by reason. And of this did the learned (<hi>Bias Priae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>) report, that there liued and were more of the wicked, than of good persons: in that so manie are ledde and mooued after a sensuall will, than procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by reason: which causeth that man (as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> affirmeth) to swarue and fall from a meane in many manners: but the same is approached vnto and purchased, by one manner of way. And two kindes there are of these Notes: as certaine, which of the Elementary qualitie conceiued, that vtter and signifie the affections of the minde: as dooth the hayrinesse of the Brest, which is a note of yre, thorough the hote heart. And certaine are of propertie, as the declining of the head to the right side in the Walking, which is the note of a Cynede as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth: and this like is neyther gathered of a hotte, nor cold cause, but of the property.</p>
            <p>Yet do the Perypateticks (as writeth <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle secundo priorum</hi>) vtter, that not any one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to consist and be in man, or any condition of nature, but that a like note is outwardly to be séen on the body: by which not only that passion or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition may be vttred, but the fortune vnto good or euil by the accidentall notes may be iudged: And althogh the spirit (as vnto vnderstanding) is from the body eleuated, yet (as vnto the other parts and powers) is the spirite comprehended of the bodie.
<pb facs="tcp:28360:6"/>
Although the inner affectes of the spirite cannot bee iudged by the outward notes of the body: yet may the accidentes of the spirit and minde, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those which together alter both Spirit and body be iudged, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth in <hi>secundo priorum. Auerrois</hi> vttereth, that the accidentes not naturall, cause no note but in the Spirite: as if any knoweth the Arte of Musicke: hee hath the note in the spirite, and not in bodie formed of the same.</p>
            <p>The lookes also of men, although they doe not differ in the essentiall kinde: yet do these differ in the kinde accidentall. So that the accidentall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of lookes in man, doth onely suffice, for the difference of conditions. But if any shall héere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect that sentence written in the seuenth chapter of Saint Johns Gospel: where our Sauiour willeth none to iudge rashly, after the vtter appearance of the face or look, but to pronounce and iudge arigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous iudgement. To this may thus be answered, that the same saying of the Lord was spoken vnto them, which in very déed were wicked persons, of malicious conditions: yet not of the matter and cause do they procure a iudgement, but thorough the accepting of personnes, and in the hate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of men, are they so alienated from the truth of the matter in iudging, which otherwise must be eschewed, and that especially where the person is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:28360:6"/>
occupied in the celestiall Doctrine. This is also to bee learned and noted, that any person (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vttered) to iudge alone by the face, mightilie to erre and bee deceiued, so that necessarie it is, to gather and marke sundrie other Notes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and after to pronounce Judgement, and the same not firmely, but coniecturally: As by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may well appeare, that if the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer earnestly beholding and viewing any merrie person by nature, doth sée him at that instant time (through some hap) very sadde of countinance, and doth of the same iudge him to be sadde by Nature, where he contrarywise is of Nature merrie: or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise appearing then merry, shall iudge him of the same to bée of Nature merrie, where perhaps, by Nature he is giuen to bee sadde: must néedes (through these like) greatly erre, and bée deceiued in iudgement. Héere also note, that there are two manner of passions, as the one naturall, and the other accidentall.</p>
            <p>The accidentall are those, which consist of the spirit, and for the same, that they consist of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, no alteration in body is caused: as of the Art &amp; Science: and these by notes in the bodye are not indicated. But the natural, which for that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in vs, as afore taught: for that cause doth some <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>acion appeare in the bodie: as yre, feare, and such like, of which héereafter (in this worke) shall
<pb facs="tcp:28360:7"/>
be intreated. To be briefe, this Phisiognomy is a knowledge which leadeth a man to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and knowing both of the naturall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conditions of the spirite: and the good or euill fortune, by the outwarde notes and lines of the face and bodie. Yea, by the pases many times is the heart bewrayed, and the voyce, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth, are notes and vtterers of the inner thoughtes: all which, vnder the Phisiognomicall Science are contained. <hi>Lucius Scylla,</hi> and <hi>Cesare Dictatoure</hi> by the helpe of this Science found out and iudged the wilye craftes and deceites of their aduersaries many times, that secretly couerd their malicious minds, by their faire shewes. The most singular and prudent <hi>Plato,</hi> in his Phisiognomie, vttereth these words: That the man which hath members like to any beast insueth his nature: as he which hath an Aquiline or hauked nose, vseth and exerciseth Aquiline conditions, as magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, cruelnesse and greedy catching. The common sort of this day, without any reason and learning, do pronounce and iudge certaine matters verie strange of men: as when he saith of any fowl look, this person pleaseth me nothing. They also say, God defend and kéepe mee from the fellowship of that person marked; as are the bunch backed, and goggle eyed persons. By which euidently appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the bodily notes of Phisiognomating by
<pb facs="tcp:28360:7"/>
the naturall conditions of men, do procure &amp; cause a great probablenesse, although no necessitie. To conclude, all the workings and passions of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, appear to be matched and ioyned with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which especially appeareth in the passions of the concupiscible or desirefull spirite: as are yre, méeknesse, feare, pittifulnesse, mercie, &amp; such like: which are not caused, without the locall motion of the heart dilating, and drawing together. Of this the bodies of diuers men, are diuersly disposed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diuers dispositions of spirits, in that mens spirits throgh diuers members, are diuersly disposed in their passions. To end, the conditions and naturall affections, that consist in the sensitiue part: is reported of the Phylosopher <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> to be the sense giuer, being common both to men and beasts.</p>

            <p>For the iudging of colours, except the propper effect be adioyned to his cause: error to the iudger, must in many happen. So that their Natures and qualities cannot easily be iudged, except a man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently consider the proper Country in which each be borne: for that we sée in many places, &amp; chéefely in Italy, many Nations dwelling together, like as the Jew, Turke, Schauone, Gréeke, and high Almayne, and many others. Whose mixte Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures must be considered, if a man will rightly phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomate, and iudge vppon any of these aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, or of any other Nation besides. Séeing those people dwelling farre North, bee strong of body, comely of colour, softe of flesh, bigge bellied, yet simple, yrefull, of small Learning, meane of counsell, vnstable, lyers, deceiuers, and boasters. And on such wise, temper your iudgement, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the place and Country, where such are borne: which in another Chapter happily I will further write of.</p>
            <p>But to returne vnto the matter, vnderstande, that the white, wanne, and yellowish colour, is a note of the deminished decoction: if this diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore hapneth, the goodnesse of nature shall like be diminished. For which cause, flie and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the company of a wanne and yellow colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

For, the wan and yellow colour, doeth héere rather argue coldnes. Further, the wan colour, is the way and beginning of the mortifying of naturall heat, and extinction of the same: by which reason appeareth, that the wan colour doth no otherwise differ from the blacke, but as to the remission of the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And by this wan colour, is to be vnderstoode the Leadie colour. The Learned <hi>Auicen</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the whitenesse of colour, is a note of the depriuing of bloud, or the scarsity of it with a cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for if this colour should procéed of a hotnesse, and that with the Chollericke humor, then should it tend vnto a cytrinesse. Further, <hi>Auicen</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the ruddie colour, doth signifie the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of bloud: the red, and somewhat redde colour, doth declare the hotnesse of quality: yet more doth the somewhat red colour, declare the red Choller: and the redde colour, the Sanguine Choller. Héere further is to bée noted, that the colour some-what red, doth signifie the depriuing of bloud: although there appeareth not the red Choller, as the like

And this we name a wan or yellowe colour, according to the intensiue and remissiue domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The hony colour, signifieth a coldnes and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, forasmuch as the colour is the same which ensueth a pure blacke choller. So that the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of colour, followeth the condition of Flegme, and quality of the moysture, but the greannesse of colour, doth rather argu the blood congealed, which then tendeth to a blacknesse, so that the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed to the Flegme, is made gréene: yet doth the whitish gray colour, rather signifie a Flegmatick coldnesse, mixed with a little red choller. And after the opinion of many Physitians, the colour is for the more part chaunged, through the Liuer, vnto a reddishnesse and whitenesse: and thorough the Milt, into a swartnesse. Further <hi>Auicen</hi> writeth, that the swart yellowe colour, dooeth argue the redde Choller: but the Dark Browne colour, doth signifie the black choller.

doth declare that the redde Choller, to gouerne the chollericke: but the darke browne colour, doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie in the same climat, the dominion of the black cholier. <hi>Auicen</hi> also writeth, that the body becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth red, through the dominion of bloud, &amp; white in colour (as the Juorie) of the flegmatick humor. Besides these, the complexion hauing a mixte co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, both of the white and red, is after the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a meane temperated.</p>

For the White and Swartish colour, and of a White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Graynesse mixed: and the wanne and Leadie colour, do intimate a colde Complexion. But the red, reddish, the high red, and bleake red, all these Demonstrate a hotnesse of Complexion; and if a clearenesse and thinnesse bée conioyned to the colour, the clearenesse and thinnesse of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, are then declared. But if a troublednesse and grosenesse bée mixed to it, the grosenesse of Humours is then signified. The White colour besides, to which a rednesse, with the thinnesse and clearenesse is admixed, dooth demonstrate an equallity of the Complexion. That if a rednesse shall abound, and the clearenesse shall be lesser, the dominion of bloud is there signified. But if the
<pb facs="tcp:28360:21"/>
rednesse shall so much bée diminished, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth to the colour of Juorie, it dooth innuate the paucitie of bloud, Which if the same shall yet be more diminished, in such manner, that of the same appeareth in a manner nothing at all, the darke wanne colour procéedeth: which portendeth the paucitie both of choller and bloud, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Flegme in the body. But if this colour approacheth to a Whitenesse, to which a Gréene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is admixed, then ensueth the same, which of the Physitians is named a Leadie colour: which declareth a diminution of the bloud and red chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and indicateth the dominion of the black chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and Flegme. The swartish colour, if the same shall approch to a rednesse, or that to it this admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth demonstrate a grosse blood to beare sway, according to the quantitie, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o it is approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or if a rednesse to it bée admixed. And the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour perfectly Swartish, which is approached to a Gréennesse, doth declare the dominion of the black Choller. But bodies coloured with a redde Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which is found to draw nearer to a White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, are of a colde Complexion. If the colour, shall appeare nearer to a Gréenenesse or Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, shall be of a hot complexion. But the other, are Cytrine bodies, which to a whitenesse pertake a néere subtilnesse: which colour in the healthfull, or in whom the multitude of blood consisteth, and
<pb facs="tcp:28360:21"/>
not for the dominion of choller. So that these bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not Cytrins, but accidentally, or by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Yet the other bodies perfectly Cytrine, are somewhat cleare, which like perseuer at any time. And these are chollericke bodies.

The Liuer and milt, hauing the like quality and condition, are for the most part diseased: and the health of these bodies, is not firme, nor permanent or continuing. But the bodies hauing a darke colour, which are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to a Cytrinesse, are of a hot Complexion, and neare to the red choller.

<pb facs="tcp:28360:25"/>
matter is applied, as well vnto a necessity, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reason of a helpe and succour. For necessary it was, that the hayrs should be, both for the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the Braine, and seames of the Scull. For where the moyst quantitie of humours and heate is, there of necessity must the great plenty of hairs grow, for the reason and cause of a defence, that the daily encreasing and growing of the Hayres couering the heade, may so defend and succour it from the extreame colde, and mightie heate. Sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mans Braine in proportion, is greatest and moystest, for that cause it néedeth especiallie a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Isidore</hi> reporteth, that the hayres of the Head were ordained of nature, to couer and beseeme the head, &amp; that these might so defend the Brain from the cold and heat of the Sunne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albertus in lib. de animalibus, cap.</hi> 3. repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the haires procéede of the grosser vapors, issuing by the poores of the Skinne of the Heade, sent foorth by heate, thorough the narrow holes of the Skinne, which dried and hardned in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth, through the outward cold of the ayre. And the haires of the head, which slowly encrease (thorough the lacke of bloude) is a note, that the complexion to be very moyst. That if these spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily encrease, is a note that the body declineth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a drines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28360:25"/>But to come to the matter, the Hayres of the head do naturally declare, the qualities and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of humours, and the conditions of the spirite or minde.</p>
            <p>The Phylosopher also (in 5. <hi>de generatione a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalium. cap.</hi> 4.) saith, that the cause of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and smalnes of the haires of the head, is most chiefly caused, and grow out of the skinne, and not out of the flesh, when the humor in them is euapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and breatheth forth: séeing we sée, that the grose haires do spring out of a thick and grose skin, and the small haires out of a thinne and soft skin. These hitherto <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that when hotnes and drines bee conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the haires of the head doe much sooner grow, and waxe matny and thicke. Forasmuch, as the much quantity signifieth a hotnes: and the bignes of them, a much fumositie. And for that cause, in young men, there is much more quantity, than in children: for as much as the matter of children, is vaporous, and not humorous. And the contraries of these, do follow their contraries. Further, the signification by the part of the Figure, is that the crispednes thereof, declareth a hotnes and drines: for the same is caused, when it findeth a tortuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes both of the holes and powers: but this doubt, is not héer resolued, when as the complexion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, although the two first matters be changed.
<pb facs="tcp:28360:26"/>
The plainnesse and flat lying of the hayres of the head, doth signify a contrary, that is, coldnesse and moistnesse, as euidently appeareth.</p>
            <p>As touching the part of the colour, the blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse signifieth a hotnesse: which blacknesse, is héer meant like to the cleare horne: with a roughnesse, and somewhat tortuous. The whitishnesse signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a coldnesse: but the citrinnesse and rednesse, signifieth an equality: and the whitishnes doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argue a vehement coldnesse, as the hoarines, or a strong and mighty drinesse, which hapneth in the Uegetalles, when they are dried: which from their blacknes or gréennesse, passe into a whitenes and this like hapneth not to men, but in the end of drying sicknesses.</p>

               <hi>Auerrois (quarto colligit capitulo)</hi> of the notes of the complexion of the whole body reporteth, that the signification of the colour of the hayres of the head, is not verified (for the most part) but in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate climates, although in euery climate may be somewhat comprehended, in comparing the men of that climate, dwelling there vnder. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Germaines and Moores, of which, the Moores are black, and their hayres are crisped with an vttermost tortuousnesse: yet not for this is their complexion hot, but rather these notes ought to be attributed to the outward heate, séeing they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e knowne rather to be cold, through the heat va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:28360:26"/>
But the Germanes, Wendenland peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and those which dwell in the cold Countreyes, are white of body, their haires yellow and plaine: yet not for this, is it generally to be said, that they be colde, but rather that their complexion is verie hot, in that the heat is included in the inward par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of their bodies, as the like hapneth in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time. <hi>Gallen</hi> vttereth, that the white hayres of the head, do declare a cold comple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Auerroys</hi> Writeth, that in whom coldnesse is lesser than hotnesse, hath golden or yellow hayres on the heade, in that the yellownesse doth signifye the Complexion of a diminished coldnesse. And the rednesse of hayres on the head, dooth declare a Complexion of lesser hotnesse, than is the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hauing blacke Haires: and this (for a truth) is true, in that the rednesse is néere, and a neighbour vnto blacknesse: and like the yellownes &amp; white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The Golden colour of the hayres, hath an equall and temperate qualitie, of the yellowe and red mixt and compound together. These hitherto <hi>Auerroys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ayres and Countryes, haue an operation, in the cause of the hayres of the heade, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
<pb facs="tcp:28360:27"/>
is to bee obserued and noted, seeing it is not to be made any question at all, that so well in the blacke haires, as the yellow, is the equality of a like complexion declared: héere we apply <hi>Iupiter</hi> séeing it hath any yreall Nature. Nor in the haires of the <hi>Illyrian,</hi> the blacknes, which of his quality, signifieth a hotnes, when as their kinde hath the same.</p>
            <p>The ages also doe worke, in the matter of the haires of the head, for that yong men bee like to the Meridionals, children like to the Septentrionals, and old age as a meane betwéene both.</p>
            <p>The haires of the head much in a child, argueth that his quality (as he groweth) turneth into the Melancholy: and in an old man the like, signifieth that he is presently Melancholike.</p>
            <p>By these we vnderstand, that the haires of the head lying plaine, do denote a coldnes of the brain, especialy when they are soft in the féeling: for these do then declare a fearefulnes, and pusilanimity, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Indians and Shéep, forasmuch as this is a moyst complexion, as the Learned <hi>Albertus</hi> writeth.</p>
            <p>Those persons which haue the hairs of the head so much crisped, that these bée in condition like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dried Pepper, as the Indians are, which dwell vnder such hot places, that do make blacke &amp; Cris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the haires so much, euenlike to the dried Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
<pb facs="tcp:28360:27"/>
by which, most writers do digestiuely note a weaknes. When in them shall be a most great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution wrought: and that moysture is diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then doth old age fast come on. For such which dwell in those countries, become old at xxx. yeares, and their hearts are fearfull and weak of courage, which well declareth, that the kinds of them, hee much resolued.</p>
            <p>The bodies dwelling in hot countries, are ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than others: as the same witnesseth <hi>Aristotle in Methaphoricis,</hi> where he puttteth a difference of the Countries, in Phisiognomating.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conciliatore in</hi> 10. <hi>partic. proble.</hi> reporteth, that for the much hotnes, causing the moysture to euaporate forth, by which accident their members are like winded and writhed, and generally, the liuing things of those climates, which euidently is declared by gréene woode dried, which depriued of the proper moysture, appeareth winded and wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thine, when the moysture doth not equally breake forth thorow out, except it hath a viscous moisture verie vnctious. For which cause (in Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating) it behooueth to consider many matters and notes.</p>
            <p>The colour of the hayres of the head yellowish, like to Honey, doth declare the Dominion of cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, thorough the heate couered in the moysture as the like are in Children: yet the Persons dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Northerly, haue the like condition thorough the Region, which much beguileth in Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating vpon the like subiect. And such persons to <hi>Venus</hi> are attributed: so that the same be either of Nature, or by Art. The haires of the head, grosse and blacke, are applied to <hi>Saturne</hi>: yet is not the same to be like considered of them, as of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, for this declareth them to be subiect to the earthly and shadowy moisture.</p>
            <p>The haires blacke and rough, and not plaine lying, doe signifie a hotnesse in that person, as the white haires do indicate a cold complexion.</p>

The blacke colour proceedeth from the great and much quantity of the kindled Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or by the much combustion of the blood: but the red colour, thorough the mightinesse of heate, not adust, of which the haires are alwaies caused red: the flaxine colour, procéedeth of the aboundance of Melancholy: but the hoary white, is caused of the ouer-much lacke of naturall heat, and through the effect of rotten Flegme: and this for the most part is caused in old persons. And these sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the venerial conditions.</p>
            <p>The colour of the hayres, like to the cléer horne, are attributed to the nature of <hi>Mars</hi>: So that the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:28360:28"/>
haires be not grose, but somewhat small, and this through the subtlenes of the humors. And that it is black through an intensed heat, like bred baked on coales from which the moisture flyeth; so that by the long lying thereon is made blacke. When in the other parts of the body, there is ouer-much hairinesse seene, there do the stars of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> worke their vertue, who are noted to be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers on the high-way, especially when the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browes be very thick ioyning ouer the Nose, and that the eyelids be hairy, but when the breast shal be only hairy, declareth a hot and stout person.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The whole bodie couered with hayre, both thicke and rough: dooth denote such a person to be of a more brutish will and nature, than manly.

            <p>When the Physiognomer (by any occasion) came to Princes Courts, or Noblemens houses: he would at the first thoroughly behold and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on euery side, the Officers and seruants about the Prince, or Lorde: but most especially the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>It chanced on a time (at the request of some) to view and earnestly mark the faces both of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and seruants attendant on the noble Prince <hi>Astorgius Fauent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was small of stature, in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy slender, his face and skin wan of colour: a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle necke, and somewhat short, <hi>Mercuries</hi> line in the forhead, conditioned in a retrograde manner: the other positures of the face and body answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the rest.</p>
            <p>Touching the iesture of body, he went vpright, making short paces, but trod very fast withal. And the Phisiognomer considering the others about this Nobleman, perceiued sundry of them subtle &amp; crafty deceiuers by whom their Lord was greatly abused and indammaged, especially thorough the meanes of his Secretary that notable deceiuer.

these words: That he as an Angelical rose, was in a maner suffocated and choked by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thornes daily conuersant about him.</p>
            <p>Thus may a man by outward signes, find out the qualities of people.

But the other notes of hir body (for breuity sake) was omitted.

            <p>These Italian verses of <hi>Franciscus Asculanus</hi> may aptly be applied to this place, touching the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding great deceit &amp; subtilties of many strumpets in their wanton deckings and alurements, to the vtter vndoing of many men, as hath bin heard of by that afore described woman, who drew (by her singular beauty) many a worthy Captaine &amp; Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to hir company.

Which the Philosopher seemeth to distinguish and deuide into seauen formes, of these the first form he vttereth to haue no imminency or bearing out before, but behind: the second forme, that an imminency containeth in the forepart, and not in the hinder: the third forme, that the head againe lacketh an imminency before, and not behind, and that the same be formally round: the fourth form, that the temples, in respect, haue a more bearing out, then either the forepart or the hinder: the fift forme, that it be in forme like to the Pine Apple: the sixt forme, that there be a great distance from the eares before, then behind: the seauenth form, that it be in a most comely manner proportioned: and in these do <hi>Gallen, Auicen, Auerroys,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other learned agrée.</p>
            <p>So that the head béeing either ouer big or ouer small porportioned, is nothing at al liked of them: in that the same is corrupted and hindered of the proper vertue. For such hauing the like forme, when they approach vnto an vnderstanding, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare euidently to be harmed and hindered. As a small head is euermore corrupted: euen so a bigge head appeareth sometimes good, and sometimes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:28360:35"/>
viciated and euill.</p>
            <p>But the best formed head, allowed of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is that, which hath an exact roundnesse, and is on eyther side a little depressed, with an immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency before and after: so that where the temples are, a certaine plainnesse may appeare: as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that a certaine ball of Waxe made exactlie round, should bee some-what depressed of eyther side: then should that round form (as the Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians affirme) most apt to receiue formes, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to proportion.</p>
            <p>For which cause, the more lawdable head, is that, which hath a meane forme in the proportion and bignesse, and containeth a decent roundnesse, which besides enioyeth an imminency, before and after tempered with a little compression or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>Auicen</hi> writeth, that the cause of smalnesse of the head in the creature, is the paucity or small quantity of matter: but the cause of bignes of the head, is the great quantity of matter, being sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rasis</hi> answering to the forme of the scull: for if the scull shall be small, then will the braine be like, <hi>Et econtra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The figure also of the scull, if the same be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, then is the forme of the braine like corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Besides the head in smalnesse superfluous, must of necessitie be euill.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So that mans head (among all other beastes) hath proportionally much braines. The males (of knowledge vttered) haue more braines than the Females: although the effect may sometimes shew a contrary to this.

And in these (saith the Phisiognomer) haue I found and learned a singuler practise, and an infallible or most certaine truth, which I attained by a long time of practise. So that this worthy Jewell, and most rare secret, he purchased after the manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue vttered, not minding to hide the skill, but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:28360:51"/>
rather furthering the same to the vttermost of his power, which he thought most agréeable, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish next after this Chapter of the forehead, as in a most apt place to ensue.</p>
            <p>The instruction &amp; knowledge of which is on this wise: first conceiue that in the flat and euen fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, you shall sometimes see there seuerall lines, reaching out the length of the forehead: which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the minde of the Phisiognomer, do import and signifie thrée ages: that is to say, childhood, youth, and old age. This childhood doth he héere meane from birth, vnto xxv. yeares: and youth, from xxv. vnto fifty yeares: and old age, from fifty, to the tearme and end of naturall life: as the same hereafter shall plainer appeare, in the condition of the liues. But for a readier intelligence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words, conceiue this example here vnder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, which euidently to the eie vttereth these thrée lines, representing the thrée ages in most persons.</p>
            <p>To come vnto the matter, the two neather lines, being vnder the thrée principall, which make some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the form of an angle aboue: are attributed, the one vnto <hi>Saturne,</hi> standing on the right side, and the other vnto the <hi>Moone,</hi> appearing on the left side. Of these, that line also on the right side, ascribed vnto the father: and the other on the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>So that in the same place where these lines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare whole, there (of knowledge) we affirme the good hap and fortune to be: specially, if these she<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The second line vpward (named <hi>Iupiters</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth the second age, which the Phisio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:28360:53"/>
show of descent, condicions, &amp; liberality vttered: yea, both the stability in religion, &amp; discretions in men, and their lawdable actions. Further, where vertues are imbraced, vices left and detested. Where also is (in men) a fruitfull and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable wit vttered: where besides is the mother of honesty indirated: all which by <hi>Iupiters</hi> line, are (after the agréement of sundry Writers) represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and expressed.</p>
            <p>The third line (after the mind of the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer) representeth a third age: which of all men is knowne to be the time of sadnesse and couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: yea, the wearing out of pleasures, and the end of naturall life. If this line be fortunate, the same then doth indicate an increase by husbandry, land, houses, and al such matters which appertain vnto the office of olde age: so that to such a third line, are all these agréeable, which are attributed to <hi>Saturne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some perhaps will argue and say to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer, that this is the age of deuotion: to which I thus aunswere, that old men, in verie deede be then more inclined and bent to serue God séeing that age is then dissolued, and become impotent vnto the wanton pleasure and luxuries: through which these are the more prone, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vnto prayer, and the faithfull seruing of God.</p>
            <p>

            <p>So that in the same place, where this line is broken, there the infortune is: as either sicknesse, impouerishment, or any other hindrance.</p>
            <p>If the two neather lines (next the Nose) bée whole, and that these, forme as it were an angle and cone about: do then denote (as the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer hath many times experienced) that such persons to haue a notable fortune vnto the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and purchasing both of riches, and promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

doth then denote a competent fortune vnto such a person, and this according to the strength of the lines there seene. For where these lines are broken off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lacking, or crooked: there they witnesse and signifie the infortune to succeed.</p>

            <p>The place of the ouerbrowes (as writeth <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>) is a part of the Fore-head, and formed of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that seate, where the bones knit and ioyne together. The ouerbrowes also were ordained to man (as reporteth <hi>Thaddaeus</hi>) both for profite, and comelinesse sake: these for profit, that the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
<pb facs="tcp:28360:57"/>
and sweat falling from the forehead, might (as penthouse to the eies) so cast off the moysture distilling, and like the humours and moisture fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the head (thorough the same eueising) shoote them off, without harme to the eyes. The like words in a manner, vttereth the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Cocles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ouerbrowes (as reporteth <hi>Cocles</hi>) were appointed by God and Nature, in the knitting and ioyning of the bones: for that in manie Old<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> persons they grow and waxe so long, that of nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, and for comelinesse sake also, they must bee clipped.</p>
            <p>The causes of the haires (as writeth the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer) are noted to bee foure: as the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the Materiall, the Formall, and Finall. The efficient cause of the hairs, is procured two waies: the one is naturall heate, which eleuateth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from the moysture of the body, and sendeth or carrieth them forth vnto the skinny parts. The other is the cold ayre, which both thickneth and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aguleth those humors, and reduceth them into the forme of haires.</p>
            <p>The materiall cause, is two wayes, the first is farre off, and is the corporal moysture: the second cause is néere, and is the earthly vapor or humor, which is euaporated from the moysture. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall cause, is the forme of the haires, as the length
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:28360:57"/>
and roundnesse of them. The finall cause, is the diuersity of haires, as to the decking &amp; beseeming of the body, like as the haires of the ouerbrowes, of which our intentes is to write at large in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>The ouerbrowes haue a hid vertue, to expresse the affections of the mind: of which this prouerbe that the person raiseth or lifteth vp the ouerbrow: meant by the same, that such a one to be arrogant and proud. And such appearing like, doth the ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Thaddeus,</hi> rightly name hawty, and sowre of countenance.</p>
            <p>The right ouerbrow is more raised, and bended than the lefte: in that all the partes thorough the cause of mouing, do decline and lean vnto the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sight. The right kidny in like maner is known to be higher placed, than is the left: as the aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide <hi>Thaddeus</hi> writeth.</p>
            <p>Such hauing the ouer-browes verie hayrie, be noted péeuish, and ouerthwart in wordes: the reason is, for that the much quantitie of hayres, doth argue the great plentie of hotte and addust matter, through the cause of heate and adustion: of which insueth, or is procured, the vncomelinesse of spéech, through the swiftnesse of words, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty talke.

His pace musingly, or as one full of thought, with the eye-liddes drawn or gathered together, and ouer-browes ioyning, through the thicknesse of haires ouer the Cone of the Nose: the eyes hollow or déepe standing, and Peacockes pace. The eyes thus low situated, did denote a Saturnine disposition in him: and this especially, the fewnesse of wordes, and hardnesse in vttering them. The longnesse of

The ouerbrowes arcuated, the lips small, the sharpnesse of chin, and the Fossils of them: the decking or eeuen dressing of the hairs, and fine apparrelling of the whole body: fine feete with the heeles small and flat, indicated a venerial disposition. The glistering eies and spotty, were by reason of the drinesse of the Animall Spirits consisting in the braine: For that the same firi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and adustion procureth men (without the Grace of God) vnto thefts and robberies <hi>Saturne</hi> also increaseth drinesse in that person: of the Sun, the Moone, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> I write not, in that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not the notes agréeable, at the writing of this.</p>

And heereof it succéeded, that this person had a small and thin beard. To conclude, this conceiue, that the members which possesse a cold and moyst matter, the Phisiognomer attributeth vnto the Moone: the members which inioy a hot and dry quality, he applyeth to <hi>Mars</hi>: the members which

            <p>Certaine affirme, that the ouerbrowes long, do argue such a person to be arrogant, leacherous, and verie vnshamefast: which matters truly are increased, for the most part in olde age. As the Physiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> noted in sundry indiuidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates.</p>

Physiognomer) is noted, to exercise iesting, and to play the ieaster, and to take great feltcity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, except his education otherwise contrarie the same.</p>
            <p>The haires of the ouerbrowes, if they shall be stretched, and lye so strait as a line in length, and these long, doe demonstrate an euill, weake, and feminine minde: applied by the like, to weomen. And these manner of eye-browes (saith the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer) do I attribute to <hi>Venus</hi>: and such hee saw (for the more part) to be Cynedes: or els ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry luxurious.</p>

denote a Weake minde, and féeble of Courage. The Ouerbrowes so much crooking, that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare almost ioyned to the nose, do denote a verie subtle, and an ingenuous person. Such ouerbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes (saith the Physiognomer) declare a studious person: and applied for that reason to the Planet <hi>Mercury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the ouerbrowes shall be thinne, in the diameter commensurated, &amp; that these are large: this person (by report of the Phisiognomer) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be of a quick &amp; ready vnderstanding.

Here in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath the Phisiognomer diligently gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither, the sayings of the learned <hi>Concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atore,</hi> and others, although but a fewe notes of them were to be founde.</p>
            <p>The eie liddes, which on the eie aproched nigh the angle, in the lacrimall part, if the same be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding small and thinne: doth denote the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the maner, and malice of the forme. The cause of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> smalnesse of heares, doth litle the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indicate.</p>
            <p>The thinnesse of the heares, doth argue the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilnesse of matter, that is, of the humours, and the dominion of choller. Such are knowne to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, vicious &amp; wicked: yet consider diligently, all the other passions of choller. When that place shalbe fleshier, like to the Kites eien, then doth the same denote craftinesse, and an euill hotnesse, and
<pb facs="tcp:28360:69"/>
               <figure/>
is also a chollericke foole. For which cause (sayth the Phisiognomer) beware of the chollericke, not regenerated of the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>The lacrymall or inner corner of the eie, when the same is little and narrowe: doth signifie a craftie person, as <hi>Auicen</hi> reporteth, <hi>primo de Animalibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vpper eie lidde bearing out, rather blowne vp: then full appearing, and somewhat declining ouer the eie: doth argue that person to be hawtie and disdainfull.</p>
            <p>If the eie lyddes doe decline downewards, full and very thicke, especially when they be couered with a rednesse: doth indicate such a person to be a ruinous and wastefull drunkarde. The reason is, for that these signifie a weakenesse of the eies:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:28360:69"/>
and by the consequent, of the braine. So that
<figure/>
through such a weakenesse, the like persons feare the drinking of wine. As the same, Phisiognomer obserued and noted in many, haunting tauernes, and such ofte drinking Maulmeste: of which one, the like was a certaine Countryman of his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an excéeding quaffer and drinker of Wines.</p>
            <p>That if the neather eye lidde shall be small, &amp; narrow drawne togyther, in such maner, that it couereth but the whyte of the eye: doth denote the body to be gouerned of a drinesse of humours. If this like hapneth in any cause, of verie sharpe passions: vnlesse nature hath so wrought the same (as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> wytnesseth) doth then pronounce death at hande.</p>

            <p>The auncient <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that when the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Why the liddes are placed on the eyes, doth <hi>Gulielmus Nurice</hi> thus define: that by them, the condition and qualitie of the eyes, might the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and better be defended and preserued from the outwarde matters: euen as the sheath, on a sworde: for that cause, such a person which hath a grosser or thicker eie lidde, doth further sée from him: for as much as these preserue the light of the eyes, from the outwarde heate, and cold. And of this, manye beastes sée further off, than men:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:28360:70"/>
through the grossenesse or thicknesse of the Eye-lids.</p>
            <p>The corners of the eies, when they be delated, doe then argue a sicknesse or disease of the eyes. And if these haue any flesh bearing out, do denote drunkennesse: especially when the eyes are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out, and the eye-lids be dry: as in many the like, the Phisiognomer hath obserued and noted.</p>
            <p>The vpper eye-lids couering the neather, doe argue (by the report of <hi>Conciliatore, Albertus,</hi> and others) long life.</p>
            <p>The corners of the Eyes dylated and large, through the cause of a smiling eye: doth indicate a letcherous person: and this note, applyed (of the Philosopher) to <hi>Venus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The often beating or panting of the eye-lids, doth argue such a person to be fearefull, and vexed often with a frenzinesse: as <hi>Palemon, Loxius,</hi> and sundry others report.</p>

            <p>THe Phisiognomers confirme their sayinges, by the signes and notes of the eyes: in that the notes which are discerned in the eies, be figurs and vtterers of the affections of the heart.</p>
            <p>The eye is the instrumentall member of sight, whose quality is moist, in a round forme figured, with a certaine plainnesse: and formed with seuen co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tes, and thrée humors, as writeth the learned <hi>Sillanus (super nono Almansoris.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The passions of the minde, as trouble, myrth, loue, hatred, and such like: are especially declared and vttered by the eyes: after the agréement of all Writers.</p>
            <p>The especiall colours of the eyes, are knowne to be foure: as the blacke, whitish, variable, and
<pb facs="tcp:28360:72"/>
gray: as the worthy <hi>Canamusalis (in libro ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, cap. tertio)</hi> reporteth, and the like <hi>Iehu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The round forme of the eyes, is better moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, perfiter, and vncorruptible, through the lacking of corners: as all the learned agrée in the fame.</p>
            <p>The cornered eyes, haue very often superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moysture standing in them: as writeth the singular <hi>Constantine, in libro oculorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A perfit forme and condition of the eyes, doth denote an honest person: as writeth <hi>Gulielmus Nurice, Conciliatore, Albertus,</hi> and others.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The eies big and eminent, doe argue weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and a féeble courage: in that these be so cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:28360:72"/>
bigge, thorough the much aboundance of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the brain: in which is coldnesse, that shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth along by the Members, and extinguisheth the bloud. So thrt such a Braine is more col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and moister than it ought to bee: and in such a body should bee the lacke both of naturall bloude and courage. And as the spirit and store of bloude, procureth boldnesse in men, euen so doth the colde and moyst quallity, contrarie worke and cause fearefulnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that the Eyes béeing verie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and bigge: doth argue such a creature to be fearefull, and applied to the Hare, Cunny, and Frogge.</p>
            <p>The eyes outward extended, do denote (after the mind of <hi>Rasis</hi>) such a person to be foolish: but the eyes déep standing, doe denote such a person to be subtill, and of euil conditions, through the part of the wicked quality: yet such be of a good &amp; sharp sight, and sée further, than the eminent eyes do in that the visible spirit is more gathered in the déepe eyes, and the séeing vertue stronger, yea, the light is receiued in greater quantity, as by experience is known in the Gunner, which minding to shoote strait, winketh with the one eye: &amp; like the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, in the laying of his line right: Hitherto <hi>Auerroys.</hi> But through the contrary cause, such hauing the eies eminent be weake of sight, and sée
<pb facs="tcp:28360:75"/>
nothing so farre off. The large eyes tending into a breadth of the body, like to the eyes of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, do indicate the moisture of bodie in that creature.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Such hauing the eies eleuated, and standing hie out, do sée from them (as aboue vttered) but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way: the cause is, that when the eye is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter, it is then further distant from the braine: which is noted the Well-spring of the Eyes. So that through the farre distance from their Spring, that is the braine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such eyes are hindered to sée far: where otherwise the eyes standing déepe, do sée s<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:28360:75"/>
so that such in a short time, can iudge of matters: They are also bablers, through the moist forepart of the fore head. And thereby are noted vnshamefast and foolish: the selfsame (in a maner) doth the learned <hi>Asculanus</hi> write (in his mother tongue) in <hi>libro Cerbae,</hi> as followeth.</p>

And such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Phisiognomer noted to bee of wicked conditions: and prone to some violent, shamefull, or euill death. Yea, the Physiognomer hath often times obserued it, in many that Rob by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>

Further, such a colour indicateth the dominion of choler, with gret adustion: of which occasion cannot otherwise bee caused, but the dominion of malignity.</p>

            <p>The eyes mouing swiftly, with a sharpnesse of sight, are noted théeues vnfaithfull, &amp; deceyuers: yea such a note hath the Phisiognomer séene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which were after hanged.</p>
            <p>One of these, was the sonne of M. <hi>Iulianus de Pontremulo,</hi> brought vp and trained couragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a child) vnder a valiant and politick Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, named <hi>Francesco Rouerso,</hi> on whom hee pronounced iudgment, in the year 1492. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the presence of M. <hi>Bartholomew (de S. Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:28360:73"/>
a famous Chirurgian, and a most special frend of the Physiognomers. And as this <hi>Cocles</hi> had afore pronounced and iudged of the young man, euen so came it to passe (through the lack of grace) that hee was hanged, in the yeare of our Lorde, 1496.</p>
            <p>And this Physiognomer on another, named <hi>Tadeus Guidottus,</hi> pronounced a like iudgment, which (as he reporteth) was also hangd for theft, by sentence of the law. For these are wel known to haue a subtle wit, alwaies ready and prone to euill. The like confirmeth that worthy <hi>Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore,</hi> saying, that the eyes swiftly mouing, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing sharpe of looke, are noted crafty, vnfayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and théeues: as of nature these are vttered. The cause is, in that through the subtlenes of wit Theft procéedeth, and the strange deceiuing. For the subtle wit procéedeth through the subtlenes of humors, insuing of the hotnesse of complexion, as aboue vttered. And the mouing procéeds through a hotnesse: so that when the hotnesse is great, then is the switnesse intensed.</p>
            <p>The looke fixed, is not caused but of the ouer-much and fixed thought, and of the often desire to deceiue. By which reason, for two causes are the like in such a subiect, that is, the moouing, which the intensed hotnesse signifieth: the other is, the sharpnes of wit, to the déep cogitation and thoght,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:28360:73"/>
               <figure/>
to worke euill. The selfsame <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that those whose eies moue fast, and be sharp of look, is a deceiuer, crafty, and a théefe. Yet some may say, that Théeues are melancholy, in that Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procéedeth of a cold and dry humour: for which cause, the contrary of this is, as afore vttred. To the same, doth the Physiognomer thus aunswer, that this is not alwayes certaine or true, in that there hath béene séene (saith <hi>Cocles</hi>) that Martiall persons were Théeues and robbers by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and that those were found chollericke and Melancholicke, as shal after appeare, in the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomy of the Planets, &amp; Chyromaucy (to come
<pb facs="tcp:28360:76"/>
forth) of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> yet may it be, through
the accidents of the minde, that these are caused
Melancholy adust: the same accident did the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer
obserue, in sundry Bawdes, common
Dicers, and Robbers, which applied their mindes
and wits in these.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The Wanne and yellow Colour, doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indicate the complexion or quality of Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler adust: yet the same tending vnto Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If to a Whitenesse, to which a Gréenenesse is admixed, heate insueth, which of the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is properly named a leady colour, as writeth <hi>Almansore, lib. secundo capit.</hi> 1. So that this is a Swartish colour, if the same appeareth nigh vnto
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:28360:76"/>
a rednesse (or a rednesse mixed to it) which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strateth that the grosse bloud to beare sway, euen as the quantity which approached to it, or as the rednesse which is mixed to it. This colour (by the agreement of the Physitians) is as the colour of the lungs, when the same is newly drawne foorth of a beast, that is properly named wan of colour. The same of the lunges which after the drawing forth, beginneth to putrifye, and swell vp, and a wan or leady colour appeareth in the same.

Such a colour the Phisiognomer noted in sundry Cardinals, that were wicked in their déeds. Yea these of like colour he noted to be drunkards, luxurious, and practisers of false and wicked matters, without any shame: as the like of experience the Phisiognomer reporteth to haue knowne. He further writeth, that the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like adust, are leacherous vnlearned and exercise Swinish conditions: when as their heads be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, or Pineaple like, and hauing fat chéeks. Yea when the ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:28360:77"/>
foolish: and of these two were Students at that time, who after the increase of this Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, became foolish, according to the iudgement of the Phisiognomer.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The eyes small, do argue such a person to bée peruerse, foolish, and faint-hearted, applied of the philosopher to the Ape: the reason is, in that when the creature is hot and dry, he is then malicious of the humors and spirits: and is a betraier through the hotnesse and drines, procéeding of the cholerick adustion. For which cause, such are deceiuers and partake of the Melancholy humours: of which fearfulnes &amp; foolishnes insueth through a drinesse. The déepenesse of the eyes procéedeth thorough a drinesse, which drieth vp the moisture of the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:28360:77"/>
and lygaments. Or which insueth a drawing together into the inner parts, and the braine to bee exhausted. And the paucity of the matter of the eyes, doth signifye in the moysture proportioned the dominion of drinesse and melancholy adust, or a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inesse adustiue: and for this, are fearefull, and deceiuers, like to the Ape: as the same experience demonstrateth.</p>
            <p>When the eyes are situated after length of the bodie (for that these Naturall in Mankinde, are scituated according to the bredth of the same) this is then named monstrous, that is, not agréeable to Nature: the cause of which, is the great hote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as afore sufficiently vttered. Of which a deceiuing and enuy ensueth, thorough a dayly or continuall desire vnto the exercising and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of euill facts, for the firinesse of the spirits, and dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of the same, <hi>Rasys</hi> vttereth, that when the eyes shall bee placed or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated as into length of the bodie, it doth then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the like creature, to bee subtile, and a deceiuer. And one like to these by the report of the Physiognomer was the Brother of <hi>Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Sauonarola,</hi> who in verie déed, was known to be a great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seducer, and beguiler of the people: yea, a deceyuer of deceyuers, and the propper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of deceite consisted in him, so that not his like was knowne or to be found in his time: this

great deceiuer, as <hi>Cocles</hi> vttereth, for the more colouring and hiding of his frauds, published new Statutes and lawes for the people, in the rich Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Florence. The Phisiognomy of whom was

thus: he had a smal head, his eyes were acording to length of the body, his nose crooked like to the Eagles bill, the lips thicke, the colour of his Face was wan adust, and the neck leaning or bending to one side: and a note of the great hotnesse of his complexion was, that hee could not endure to

The same eleuation of the eyes, procéedeth by accidence: in that this is caused through the ouermuch hotnes, whose note is the red colour, or the red colour indicateth.

            <p>The eyes appearing retort, if they tend to the right side, do denote foolishnesse: but if these tend to the left side, then they pronounce incontinency, as the learned <hi>Palemone</hi> in his phisiognomy vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth.</p>
            <p>The extensed eyes, with the extension of the countenance, doth denote such persons to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and wicked: the reason is, for that the same extension is procured of drinesse, and hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, through which the hot Spirit is caused e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</p>
            <p>He which hath the eies like to the Asse, is noted foolish, and dull of Nature: the reason is, in that they be of a cold and dry quality, of which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of kindes is hard to enter: so that by the same reason, such are foolish: referred after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to the slow Asse.</p>

            <p>The eyes appearing as they were hidde in the head, that is, standing hollow inward, do further sée: and such a person these argue to be suspitious, malicious, of a wicked yre, and peruerse conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet very mindfull, especially of iniuries, bold, cruell, deceitfull, a lyar, enuious, leacherous, &amp;c. as that <hi>Michael Scotus</hi> reporteth.</p>

            <p>The Phylosopher <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his Treatise of Phisiognomy (of the members) sayeth, that hée which hath a fleshy face, is indicated to be lesse sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient, importunate, a lyar, and a glutton.</p>

            <p>The worthy Phylosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that both of horses and men the same is knowne: that those whose face is wrinkled of nature, and not by accident, is begotten of féeble parents, for that the strength of the hart, whereas the same is féebled, draweth the skin together.

            <p>The nose stretched and retching vnto the mouth, with a decent bignes, argueth the bignesse of the Cartylage, and the multitude or much quantity of flesh, which compasseth the same Cartilage, in that the same cannot be caused, but thorough a great hotnesse.

Of the grose hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, is the grosenesse and bignesse of members procured, and by the consequent are the Spirites grosse: so that of this grosenesse, is the rudenesse of wit caused, as the Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth, (<hi>in lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de part.

Of which, this rule seldome fayleth, except by accident: as eyther thorough a sicknesse, or by the often fractions with the hand: which practise (as the Phisiognomer reporteth) is more commonlie exercised of the Cynedes or effeminate personnes: which by that manner of dealing, haue greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased this Member: as hée of experience, hath knowne in many.

And such of this are knowne to be ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, reuenging, and doing vnlawfull things. For this drawing together of the nose, is caused by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the hotnes: as euidently appeareth in a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther skinne, throwne into the fire: which through heat of the fire, gathereth together: so that of the same such are knowne to be hot, and by the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent chollericke &amp; stout, by reason of the hotnesse bearing sway. Also these for the other part &amp; cause,
<pb facs="tcp:28360:107"/>
are yrefull and reuenging (as afore vttred) in that such workings procéede, of an excessiue hotnesse. Of the Aquiline nose, doth the skilfull <hi>Asculanus</hi> write (in the mother tongue) after this manner, in his booke <hi>de Cerbae.</hi>

            <p>The experience of which, the Phisiognomer had many times, especially in sundry Princes: and of these, one was an Italian King, whose fame was sufficiently divulgated, and knowne to all Italy. But here riseth a doubtfull question, worthy to bee knowne: and the same is, which the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> graunteth vnto, that there be two chollericke Subiectes found, hauing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:28360:107"/>
both Aquiline or hawked noses: and of these, the one knowne and found to be of a Chollerick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and the habitude Chollericke: the colour also of that Creature, seene to be Cytrine or wan adust. But the habitude of the other person, knowne to bée perfit, and of a good complexion, that is sanguine: yet the same tending vnto chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>
            <p>Of the first (in aunswering vnto this doubt) I say (saith the Phisiognomer) that he is of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensad malignity, by reason of the corroboration <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rough the same Spirite, which is conioyned wholly in the Chollericke subiect, both of nature, and by accidence. By accidence (saith <hi>Cocles</hi>) I speake through the wanne colour, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a cold complexion, and Melancholick adust: which that colour properly causeth. As the like, the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> obserued and noted, in a certaine Italian Prince, which altogether was a wicked person, and causer of the destruction of much people, and a sower of discord and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate among many. But the end of this Creature was detestable, vnto the vtter infamy both of him and his linage. But of the second and other person I say, that when the habitude is Sanguine, it is possible, that of the Chollericke, to be made or caused Sanguine, and of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Chollericke by accidence, when the ages
<pb facs="tcp:28360:108"/>
alter these. So that a man may conclude, that when this in a Sanguine body, the same is then of a remissiue or qualified malignity. The reason is, for that the blood is a Snaffle or Bridle vnto the choller, by which the mallice of it is depressed. And one of like condition (saith the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) was that famous Chyromancer <hi>Galasius ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grisolus Carpensis</hi>: For as much as his complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was knowne to be Sanguine, and a little fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke: and very effeminate hee was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet from the shoulders vpward, tending vnto the Cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke quality: so that not frée he was, from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aboue noted. And sometimes is the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, through the part of the complexion and composition, as afore vttered.</p>
            <p>The Aquiline or hawked nose (after the mind of <hi>Conciliatore</hi>) seene in a body very Chollericke, that is, Cytrine or wan adust, is noted the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedder conditioned: by the wordes aboue vttered of the Phisiognomer.</p>
            <p>The Aquyline or Hawked Nose, decerned in a Sanguine Bodie, or of such a like qualitie, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto Choller: is of <hi>Auicen</hi> iudged not so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</p>
            <p>The Aquiline nose in ioynt manner ioyned to the forehead, dooth indicate such a person to bée stowt, and hardy: applyed after forme vnto the Eagle. This manner of ioynting or to be ioynted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:28360:108"/>
vnto the fore-head, is vnderstoode and meant of him which hath the eminency or bearing out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the forehead, and such are named to be grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Catchers, of the head and drith cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth also such to be yrefull, violent in Wrath, and chollericke.</p>
            <p>Héer the Phisiognomer taketh in hand, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe <hi>Charles</hi> the French King, whose picture was most liuely counterfaited with colours, by a singular painter in a Table, was brought &amp; she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnto the Phisiognomer, for him dilligently to behold: which at their requests he did. Also he further learned of a religious Hermit, the whole composition of this Kings body, which was thus: He had a big head, the nose excéeding hawked and great, the lips somwhat thin the chin round, and pitted or dented in, the eyes bigge, and somwhat bearing out, the necke short, yet not sufficiently strong, the breast and backe large, the loynes and flankes sufficient great, the belly fleshy, the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes reasonable large: the haunches and legges slender: yet sufficient big vnto the length: of the féet doth the Physiognomer héere nothing vtter. Thus in proportioning al the members together, the Physiognomer pronounced, that this mighty King was short liued: and that his death procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Catheral and féeble matter, fuming from the stomacke, and like discending again from the
<pb facs="tcp:28360:109"/>
               <figure/>
head to the stomacke, and of such causes answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, &amp;c. Although some there bee which report, that he died of poysoning.</p>
            <p>The Physiognomers reason of this Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, in that his heade, nose, and breast, &amp;c. were bigge, and indicated the multitude of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the same inobedient consisting in him: thorough which the vertue ruling, could not direct the whole Bodie, for his euill composition. Of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:28360:109"/>
which is to be learned, that euery signe is a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter of his proper note, forasmuch as the same slendernesse in the hippes, signified the vertue and strength of the braine, to be feeble and weake, and caused an euill quality or condition of the sinnes: &amp; disorder of the royall members: without whose good agréement it is impossible that life could bee long in that creature.</p>
            <p>Hée was also knowne to bée Luxurious, and the reason agréeable (is about vttered of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer) which confirmeth that the norishment which ought by due nature to bee conuerted, and runne vnto the hanches and legges, was by that maner of life, otherwise conuerted into Sperme. So that this King was of like Nature and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, as aboue described of the Phisiognomer: yet the quality (as it should séeme) of lesser Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in the members, contrarie Working vnto a hotenesse of the heart: and he was wanne of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which by accident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> signifyed the Dominion of Coldnesse and Melancholike to consist in him. And the selfe-same (hee reporteth) that the Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line or hawked nose, did somwhat depresse. But the eminencie or bearing out of the eyes, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the fore ventricle of the braine, was Flegmaticke: which to conclude, fortified (as he saieth) the shortnesse of life: and according as the Phisiognomer had iudged on this King, euen
<pb facs="tcp:28360:110"/>
it fell out, who raigned but a short time after.</p>
            <p>The French King, that raigned in the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomers time, for his euill habitude and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of body, liued and raigned bur a while, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Phisiognomer had before pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the sight of his picture brought vnto him,
<figure/>
earnestly to view and behold it: the personage or counterfaite of whom, was thus described: he had the head somewhat sharpe in composition, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:28360:110"/>
narrow, the eyes appearing bigge and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: the face shewed leane, the haires of the head séemed of nature short: the Nosthrils appearing large and bearing vp, the lips shewed thicke, but the chin appeared sharpe, the necke short and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der formed: the shoulders shewed leane and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: the armes and hands were discerned slender and long in forme: the <hi>epiglotis</hi> eminent, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the breast appeared narrow, and the breast like narrow in forme: the stature of this King, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared rather crooked or stooping, then vpright: the body of this Creature, was founde Chollericke: the moouing of the eyes descerned, and knowne to be swift and rolled or turned vpwardes in the motion: the legges (to be briefe) wer séene slender in composition. As touching the lawdable praises of this King, the Physiognomer found not anie iustly to report: in that his vices were so knowne vnto many, and divulgated (in a manner) euerie where.</p>
            <p>But in returning vnto the purpose, there was another Aquiline nose, which could not so wel put in practise, or exercise his gouerment, as the other aboue vttered, whose name was <hi>Codrus</hi> (a man knowne) to be a singuler learned Poet in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue, and had the fame and seigniority for the Gréeke tongue, whose corporature and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage was thus: he hadde the head congruent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:28360:111"/>
of the body, the heeles found flat, the féete were long and slender.</p>
            <p>Of which notes, <hi>Almansor secundus</hi> vttreth, that the sharpenesse of the nose, the long neck, the voice sharpe or small, and the comlinesse of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, demonstrated togither a drynesse in that creature, thorough the part of the chollericke qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But his composition of bodie, was founde small: and the place of the Stomacke, descerned narrow: his digestion also of meate, was known to be both weake and small, through the litle and narrow stomack: his heart was found to be colde through the length of his necke: hée was besides couetous and fearefull, which is contrarie vnto magnanimitie or boldnesse: in that the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth of a hot quality. Yet hadde this person a ready wit, through the comely forme of the head, forasmuch as the knitting and conioyning of the spirits was lawdable, by which, the descent Organe aptly serued vnto reason: especially, for the eminencie of the fore-heade in breadth: But the breast, the Ribbes, the Héeles, and the necke, were founde all effeminate, which (as aboue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered) bée contrarie vnto magnanimitie: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiline or hawked Nose indicated (as the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomer reporteth) his Couetousnesse: that so mightily (by his report) bare sway in him. Thus saith he, a man must proportionate all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb facs="tcp:28360:112"/>
togither: for otherwise it shall be in vaine, to iudge or pronounce any matter at all (after the minde of the Phisiognomer) on any subiect.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The nose séene flat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth signifie such a person to be luxurious, hasty in wrath, and faint-harted: for the dominion of the moysture, and Flegme in that creature, as the learned <hi>Conciliatore</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
            <p>Héere conceiue (saith the Phisiognomer <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:28360:112"/>
that when the nose appeareth flat, then is a hotnesse and moysture indicated in that person: for as much as the hotnes of the Aqualine or hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nose, is caused with a drynesse. So that the flat noses are procured through a hotnesse &amp; moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, in that the moysture causeth the inlarging of the nose: of which, such are knowne hot and moyst, that properly cause the luxury in them.</p>
            <p>When any report such persons, that they are hasty in wrath, the same procéedeth (as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer reporteth) of an ouer-much hotnesse: and the inflamation of spirits mooued and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, through the aboundance of matter: and of that inflamation (by the report of <hi>Cocles</hi>) is the yrefulnesse caused in such. Another cause, shall héere be vttered, in that the inflamation of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, cannot soone or spéedily be cooled, through the narrow passage: as shal appeare in the matter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>Of which, the singuler Philosopher <hi>Ascula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in the mother tongue, wrote these worthy verses following.</p>

            <p>The person which hath a short Nose, and the same flat: is iudged (after the mind of the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomer) to be lasciuious: and as some write, to be a Théefe.</p>
            <p>The nose séene short, the mouth formed small, and the téeth found short and big: do denote (after the mind of the worthy <hi>Conciliatore</hi>) a moist and cold complexion.</p>
            <p>The sharpenesse of the Nose séene, the Necke found long, the voyce heard small and comly: are apparant notes of a temperate chollericke quality: as the learned <hi>Rasis,</hi> the worthy <hi>Albertus, Ptho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus paruus,</hi> and other report, and <hi>Cocles</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>Here conceiue, that the nose formed broade in the middle, and appearing bended vnto the toppe, doth indicate such a Creature to be full of wordes, a lyar, and irefull. The reason is, in that the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leuation or rising of the nose, and hollownesse vnto the middle: is procured of the Chollericke quality, and paueity of the Cartylage: For as much as choller hath consumed that persons heat, and caused a drawing together of the skin in that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:28360:113"/>
               <figure/>
part, as aboue vttered (of the Aqualine Nose) so that the parts, which shall not be impouerished or lessened (by the same) of flesh: is because the fleshy part hath a viscous and clammy moisture, thorow which the same is not so soone and lightly resolued. The cause of the irefulnesse in that Creature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth of choller, and through the passages hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, as shall appeare in the proper place.</p>
            <p>The Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> reporteth, that hée hath many times noted of experience in infinite subiects: and in all his life time, he neuer saw any which were not possessed with a heape of vices, especially for lying, or for their imagining lyes: and this caused by the Chollericknesse consisting

in them: for which cause, this <hi>Cocles</hi> willeth a man to take héed of the fellowship of such, as of all which (saith he) experience in short time, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct thée perfit.</p>
            <p>The nose formed sharpe of the end, doth indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate such a person to bee a lyar, contentions, and yrefull: the reason is (as the Phisiognomer repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) in that such are of a chollerick quality, for as much as the leannesse and sharpenesse of the nose, doth for the most part happen through the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of choller. The same end also, hath narrow passages, in which the ayre cannot passe to coole the heart: so that of this, it long remaineth infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which is the cause of contending and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling in that person.</p>

            <p>The eares hairie, doe pronounce a good and ready hearing, which is a note of the kinde and heate: and for that cause, I report the same. But

the eares perhaps of some man are ouer-great, and of some small, of some meane, of some stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding farre off from the head, of some contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise lesse flat to the head, some being of a meane <figure/>

            <p>When the lips are formed big, these do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the multitude of matter, drawne vnto them through heat: and the grossenesse or bignesse of them, is caused through the grosse humours and spirits, of which the dulnesse of wit and foolishnes ensueth, procured by reason of the hotnesse, except the neather lip be discerned loose hanging, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try running.</p>
            <p>But if the lip be discerned vpright, and thicke in forme, that is, compact or stiffe: in such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, doth the Phisiognomer (of experience) apply there the Planet <hi>Mars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A like reason the Phisiognomer vttered, that when the mouth is formed great, if that the lippes appeare loose and hanging: in that part of the Creature is the Moone of him, and others aptly applyed.</p>

            <p>The neather lippe decerned loose hanging, and that the same appeareth very red in colour: dooth argue (hapning in the woman) to bee a most sure note, of the great desire vnto the veneriall act, and shamefastnesse in that Creature: as the same, the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> noted in a famous Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zane of <hi>Rome,</hi> named <hi>Isabella di Luna.</hi> The like note séene in Children, signifyeth the Creature in

            <p>In briefe, all the other members according to the nature and property of them, are each attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto his proper Planet: as shall after appeare in the third Booke of the Physiognomers to come forth, intituled the Phisiognomy of the Planets.</p>
            <p>The worthy <hi>Loxius, Philemon, Plato, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, Albertus,</hi> and <hi>Conciliatore</hi> report: that the lips decerned cheerefull, and somwhat smiling, hapning with a mercy countenance: do argue such a Creature to be wantonly disposed, &amp; libidinous: yea, such sometimes are knowne to be crafty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, and theeues: of which, was that wicked Chirurgian (a Countrey-man of the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers) named <hi>Seraph nus de pisis,</hi> that he diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Philosopher <hi>Aristotle (in Methaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis)</hi> vttereth, that such which haue the lips formed thinne, and in the edges appearing to hang loose out: in such manner, that the vpper lippe is séene stretched ouer the neather, at the closing and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the lips, are denoted to be bold, stout, and of great courage: applied for the forme, vnto the couragious Lyon.

            <p>Such which haue the Lippes hard, and thinne formed, and a bearing out decerned about the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine or sharp téeth: do indicate a rude vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in that Creature, vnapt to learne, and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in actions: applied for the forme, vnto the grunting Hog.</p>
            <p>The cause of these (as the Phisiognomer <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> supposeth) is the paucity of matter, &amp; the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of drith: in that it consumeth the moisture of the lips but this about the canine téeth, it canot so wast or consume: for as much as the moysture
<pb facs="tcp:28360:134"/>

Such also by reason of the dryeth, (saith the Phisiognomer) multiplied in the brain, are noted to be foolish: applied after the maner, vnto the Swine.

            <p>Such which haue the Lips formed grosse, and the vpper hanging ouer the neather Lippe, are denoted (by report of the Phylosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi>)
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:28360:134"/>

            <p>Such hauing the vpper lip so eleuated, that the Gums that is, the flesh on the téeth, and the téeth themselues are decerned, are known (as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer reporteth of experience) to be ful of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, and contumelious: yea, often rebuking: applied for the forme vnto the Dogge, especiallie, and the same, according to the apparant congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency séen. For the dog when he purposeth to bite, sheweth then the téeth by the gathering vp of the lips.</p>
            <p>The Lippes formed small and thinne, and the mouth discerned little: doth indicate the imbecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of minde, and craftinesse to dwell or consist in that person.</p>

Phisiognomy of the members, that such a person which hath thick lips, is knowne to be foolish, and of a simple capacity.</p>
            <p>The much bearing out of the lippes, doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse such a person (after the mind of the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer) to be foolish, ful of words, contentious, and hardy.</p>
            <p>Certaine report, that whose lips shall be formed congruently thin and not much folded or turned outward: doth denote such a person to be secret in all matters, wary, of a good perseuerance, yet yre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at times, and of a singular or ready wit. The cause is, for that the same declareth a congruent matter, vnto the subtilnesse of the humors &amp; spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which is the reason and cause of the wit. But the irefulnesse consisting in that creature, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth through the subtilnesse of the spirits, prone and apt vnto the kindling of it.</p>
            <p>Such hauing the lips with the gummes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the téeth prominent or bearing out, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate an euill tongued person, a wrangler, yreful, and inclined to worke iniuries: for these properly referred vnto the Dogge: as the singuler <hi>Palemon</hi> vttereth.</p>

            <p>Whose lips are decerned not sufficient equall, or a like throughout, in such manner, that the one be grosser or thicker then the other: doth witnesse such a person to be more simple then wise: and of a variable fortune, as certaine report.</p>
            <p>The philosopher <hi>Ptholomeus paruus,</hi> vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the outward lippes formed small, and somewhat folded or turned outward, do denote such a person to be full of wordes, very enuious, and an accuser. The reason is, for that the pauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:28360:136"/>
or smalnesse of the lips, doth witnesse the small quantity of matter, and the dominion of coldnes, but the folding or turning outward of them, doth declare a drinesse drawing together the hairy sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes: of which ensueth that the animall spirits are incongruent, vnto the decerning of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is spoken: and the enuy through the same, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, and is like caused.</p>
            <p>The worthy <hi>Ptolomeus Paruus</hi> vttereth that the vpper lip folding or turning vpward, and the neather downeward: do signifie a misery or wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse of life, and vncomely conditions. Of this the Phisiognomer saw, and found a singuler experience, especially in the poore and néedy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For the weaknesse of the animall Spirits, (saith he) is signified to consist in them: of which the wit properly hath not place or seat in that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The lips formed thin, if the vpper be turned and folding outward, and the same loose hanging: doe denote such a creature to be a deceiuer, subtile, and a Théefe for the most part.</p>
            <p>The lippes decerned grosse or thicke, like to the Dogs: doe indicate such a person to be a deceiuer, an accuser, and wicked in conditions: these hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to borrowed out of the phisiognomy of <hi>Ptolomeus Paruus.</hi>

            <p>THe toong is a member which is extended out of white flesh, both hard &amp; well moouing, and this the colour and vse of it declareth: the rednes consisting in it, is caused of many small vains and litle arteries which procéed and come vnto it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnto the neather part of the same, thorough which this appeareth in the neather part Redder, than in the vpper: and this is known to be a spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy matter full of powers: For experience instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs, that the same is bloody, for that the solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the continuity of the same, is only cured in short time, with the simple Rosed Hony.</p>
            <p>The tongue not onely serueth for the cleane
<pb facs="tcp:28360:140"/>
and perfect vttering of words in smiting the téeth to cause the sound of them, in the issuing foorth: but the same also helpeth to distinguish all manner of tasts, yea the letters perfectly expresse, as the learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith.</p>
            <p>The tongue folded or turned downeward, and stutting or stammering, doth argue an humorall laske of the belly, as the woorthy <hi>Hipocrates</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, in 32. <hi>Aphoris. sexrae secto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as are encombred with this Humorall laske, become Stutterers or Stammerers, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the matter descending from the head which entreth, and is drunke into the Spunginesse and Lacertes of the tongue: and of this ingrossed or caused thicke, through which enlarging, the same of necessity must be shortned. So that of the same cause, such stut or stammer: yea, <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that the stammering doth innuate the moystnesse of quality. Some there be, which are caused to stut of nature: of which, that Noble Phisitien <hi>Etius</hi> writeth.</p>
            <p>Such hauing the tongue tyed before, cannot perfectly pronounce the letter S. but sounde the same like C. and such are named of <hi>Etius,</hi> proper stammerers.</p>
            <p>The tongue tied behind, cannot pronounce the Letters, R. and T. as <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth: but breaking the Letter R. sounde the same like to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:28360:140"/>
the letter L. and such of him, are aptly named Lispers.</p>
            <p>The Flix named <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> is a Flix or laske of the belly, with the onely shedding of humour, without an inflamation or exulceration: when the humors especially discend from the head. So that when any vttereth the wordes with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is then a note of <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> to mollest that creature. With which disease, the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reporteth himselfe to haue béene encombred in his Child-hood: forasmuch as in many subiects this sicknesse much mollesteth and aboundeth in this age, but growne vnto riper yeares, the same then seaceth.</p>
            <p>The Stammerers (saith the Phisiognomer) do many times feare to drinke any heddy Wine, in that these are soone drunke, through the brains weaknes. Hence it is that the drunkard so stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mereth, that he readily cannot pronounce (thirtie thrée. Forasmuch as the vapors of the Wine, are drunke into the spunginesse of the tongue, so that it is hindered of the naturall scite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hypocrates in suis secretis</hi> saith, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse of the tongue happening in a young man, pronounceth after the lightnes of the same sodain death: the like affirmeth <hi>Galen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the tongue is discerned grosse, big and large, argueth a rude witte, as the Phisiognomer
<pb facs="tcp:28360:141"/>
               <figure/>
many times noted: this also doth represent Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke humours, to consist in the brain of that creature, or in the other parts of his body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conciliatore</hi> saieth, that the stammering and often repeating of the fore sillable and worde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the full vttering and speaking of the Worde, doth denote such an one to be prone vnto the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy quality.</p>
            <p>The tongue by a swift motion drawne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and through the corrupting and breaking of the words, causing a repetition: dooth Witnesse such a person to be foolish, hasty in wrath, and yre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

            <p>THe cause why in some persons, the voyce is heard big, in some small in some big &amp; small togither: and in some after a hoarse maner: is for that (as the Philosopher saieth) there are thrée principal conditions that concurre vnto the voice. The one, is the vertue of the lunges in forcing or procuring forward the breath, in reuerberating to the roote of the tongue, or to the pipe of the lunges. The other and second is, through the ayre expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:28360:143"/>
againe, to reuerberate the same. The third is, the pipe of the Lungs, vnto the roote of the tongue where the ayre and breath is reuerberated. Of which, how much the sounding vertue consisteth strong, to expell much breath, and the pipe of the lungs formed large, that the same receiueth great plenty of ayre, so much the greater and lesser ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth the voice: but how much the vertue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth weak, and the weason or pipe of the lungs consisteth weake, so much the smalnesse and shril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of voice appeareth, according to the mouing or swiftnesse of the breath.</p>
            <p>The grosnesse of the voice, procéedeth thorough the slownesse of mouing in that creature: of which how much the vertue doth lesser moue the aire or breath, so much the more subtilnesse or smalnesse, and shrilnesse hath the voice: through which, this procéedeth and is caused (after the mind of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer) the swifter.</p>
            <p>How much the more ayre or breath (saith hée) shall be gathered and receiued into the subiect, so much the grosser or bigger will the voice succéede and be, and the same procured thorough the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mouing.</p>

            <p>The voice decerned bigge, yet the sound of wordes perceiued very corrupt: is an apparant note of a franticke Creature, iniurious, and a glutton.</p>
            <p>The strength of the voyce, ensueth the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of vaines, &amp; multitude of the spirits, which altogether are caused of heat: as the Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth.</p>

            <p>Such a person which hath a grosse, high, and sounding voyce: is reported to be eloquent, bol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The voyce decerned small and low, doth indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate such a Creature to be fearefull, and enuious. By this low voyce, is héere meant (saith the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer) the small and faint voice, and not the big in any manner.</p>
            <p>Here conceiue, that the voice is diuers of sound, forasmuch as the voyce is a sound with an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by the mouth of the creature, vttered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate any effect. But sound is any kind, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding of the sounding, which vnto the hearing procureth a passion. And the speach is a third kind, hauing a diuersity vnto either of these.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:28360:146"/>
fearefulnesse to consist in that Creature, and to be effeminate.</p>
            <p>The voyce heard slow, doth indicate (after the mind of the Philosopher) such a person to be slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish in actions, rash at times, and impudent.</p>
            <p>The voyce decerned weake, doth argue a straightnesse of the Arteries, and paucity of the spirits, which are especially caused by the meanes of cold.</p>
            <p>The voyce decerned soft, without retching, doth indicate such a person to be gentle, and tractable: applyed vnto the shéepe, for the similitude of the voyce: euen as the others, applied vnto Beastes of like condition.</p>
            <p>The voyce heard grosse and high, doth indicate a hotnesse of the heart and Lunges, and a large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Wezand, that both fréely draweth and expelleth the ayre or breath, without impediment: for which cause, the voyce heard lowd, dooth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note such a creature to be talkatiue, bold, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious.</p>
            <p>The Philosopher <hi>Aristotle (in de secretis secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris)</hi> vttereth, that whose voyce appeareth a meane, betwéene a smalnesse and bignesse: is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a person sapient, a fore-séer, true, and iust, and these through the contrary cause.</p>
            <p>Such a person which is decerned quicke of spéech, especially if he hath a shrill voyce, is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:28360:146"/>
to be a Creature yrefull, obstinate, foolish, importunate, a lyar, and euermore euill conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>But if the voyce shall be perceiued or decerned grosse, or rather bigge: doth signifie such a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be irefull, hasty, of an euil nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>The creature which hath a swéete and pleasant voyce, is iudged (of the Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi>) to be enuious, irefull at times, and maruailous sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting.</p>
            <p>The delectablenesse of voyce, decerned in a proper subiect (as the worthy <hi>Palemon</hi>) vttereth, doth indicate a dull capacity, yet a stowtnesse of courage to consist in him.</p>
            <p>The quicknesse and hastinesse of words or spéech decerned, as the (learned <hi>Albertus</hi>) reporteth, doth argue a hot complexion to consist in that Creature. The like doe <hi>Phylemon, Loxius, Palemon,</hi> and <hi>Conciliatore</hi> vtter, vnder these wordes: that whose voyce is heard, grosse, and big vttered, is reported to be ireful, rash, and hasty in his actions, and suspected to be of an euil nature: the reason of these (is reported of them to bee) through the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate hotnesse.</p>
            <p>The person hasty in spéech, especially when he hath a small voyce, is reported to bée wicked, a Foole, importunate, a lyar, yrefull, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more

            <p>Whose voyce shall be decerned pleasant (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vttered) is iudged enuious and suspitious: the reason hath bin opened in another place, for as much as the same is effeminate. Further the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctablenesse of voyce, doth denote small wisedome or simplenesse, and veneriall conditions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that the voyce decerned bigge, doth indicate the hotnesse of complexion, but the small voyce, doth witnesse the coldnes of complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that creature.</p>
            <p>The voyce perceiued rough and hoarse, like vnto the Cranes, doth testifie an enuious person, and one that retaineth a mischiefe secretly in the heart, the same person also is by report of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, melanchollike in quality.</p>
            <p>Whose voice shall be decerned, not fully vttered or spoken with a long breath: is noted to be a vile person, through the coldnesse of the hart, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture with moystnesse applied.</p>
            <p>The Creature which hath a very big voyce, is noted to be a Seruant, vnto his owne belley. The reason of this is, for as much as the Graue or bigge voyce, procéedeth through the debillitie of vertue, which canot breath out the sufficient plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ayre, to moue the Muscles of the breast: of which insueth sluggishnesse, that such a person of the same, can neither apply his wit to any study,

               <figure/>
nor frame or exercise his body with any corporall or painefull labour.</p>
            <p>They which vtter the voyce in cutting of the breath: doe promise liberally, but performe little, and such are knowne to be deceiuers.</p>
            <p>They which are decerned to vtter the voice (as it were) by a moouement of the breast, sturdily big, are denoted to be manly, yet vnapt to learne, and stoute of courage: applied for the forme vnto the Lyon.</p>
            <p>They which haue a slow and big voyce, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted to be quiet and merrie: such also for the most part, are knowne to bee iust persons, and gentle conditioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28360:148"/>They which are heard to sound the voice shrill like vnto birds, are noted to be prone vnto the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriall act, vnstable, and vaine.</p>
            <p>A breathing discerned small and faint in voice, doth innuate such a creature to be sad for the more part, froward and suspitious.</p>
            <p>The creature which mooueth often himselfe, and speaketh with the mouing of hands, is thoght vncleanely, yet of a very readie wit, and quicke vtterance, and sometimes knowne to be a decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. But he which refraineth from the moouing of hands when he speaketh, is of a perfect vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, of a good disposition, and of a sounde counsell.</p>
            <p>The person which speaketh and soundeth the voice through the Nosthrils, is affirmed to be full of words, a lyar, malicious, enuious, and ioyeth in the harmes of another: and such a creature dooth imitate the nature of the Ducke. This the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomer obserued and noted in a certaine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman of his.</p>
            <p>Further, the voice heard vehement, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a noise, as a sounde vndecently mixed, doth denote an vniust person, violent, and bearing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in heart.

            <p>Such persons which are séene seldom to laugh are indicated to be of a déepe vnderstanding, and knowne faithfull as certaine report: and this the Phisiognomer obserued and noted in sundrie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and vertuous persons, which he knew to bée searchers of déepe and hid secrets.

<pb facs="tcp:28360:152"/>

               </gap>odlinesse and pittifulnesse: such a one (saith the Phisiognomer) is iudged to bee then taken and wrapped with the furious passion of loue.</p>
            <p>The singuler Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> vttereth,
<pb facs="tcp:28360:153"/>
vnto the mighty King <hi>Alexander,</hi> that when he saith, you shall sée a person much and long together beholding: yea, and earnestly looking on your face, and that when you againe behold him so looking, is of the same abashed, and therwith blusheth, and giueth specially (at that instant) a sigh against the will, and that teares appeare standing in his eies: such a person vndoubtedly loueth and feareth you. But if you sée the contrary vnto this, then iudge that creature to regard you little: and to be one, that is both enuious and disdainefull.</p>
            <p>The breath decerned lowd, cut betwéene, and the sigh appearing the like, doth witnesse sorrow, and heauinesse, for some losses happened to that Creature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hipocrates, Galen,</hi> and certaine other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions report, that the breath perceiued passing forth cold by the mouth and Nostrils, in a sharpe sicknesse: doth innuate death, shortly after to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.</p>

            <p>The breath (by report of <hi>Michael Scotus</hi>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out so soft, that the same can scant be heard, doth denote such a person to be greatly encombred with thought: which condition of thought, the eyes in a manner will declare.</p>

            <p>The breath which is decerned sometimes still, and within a good while after, is drawne (and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in) ouerfast: dooth argue such a creature (as that <hi>Scotus</hi> writeth) to bée then occupied with a present great heauinesse of the mind.</p>
            <p>The head if it shaketh as he sigheth (according to the mind of <hi>Scotus</hi>) then for the weight of the matter euill handled, and euill spoken off, it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to be sorry.</p>

            <p>The breath heard light, breathing out by little
<pb facs="tcp:28360:154"/>
and little without noyse, dooth denote (after the mind of <hi>Scotus</hi>) such a person to be of an vpright mind.</p>
            <p>The person which is heard to breath loud, and smileth withall: is iudged (of <hi>Michael Scotus</hi>) to be furious and a drunkard.</p>
            <p>Such a person decerned breathing, troubled, and thicke, as though he had lately run, is denoted to be wilfull, foole hardy, irefull, and of a wicked mind, desiring all things what he séeth, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things that he heareth.</p>
            <p>He which breatheth on high, and that the breath séemeth to passe through the nostrils thick &amp; quick, doth argue such a creature (after the mind of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>) to be fearefull and sorrowfull. Such also are noted to bee effeminate, when as the other notes fortifie the same.</p>
            <p>The breath so comming forth, as if the subiect were encombred with the hardnesse of fetching breath, such a Creature is reported (of <hi>Michaell Scotus</hi>) to be simple, of a peruerse minde, full of words, and desirous of all things that he séeth.</p>

            <p>Héere conceiue saith the Phisiognomer, that such haires doe procéede and appeare through the superfluousnesse of meates, and the fumosities of them, which daily ascend on high vnto the parts of the Lawes: much like to the smoak of an Oue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the same, vntill those passages, through the heat are wholly stopped, that no more smoake can after passe through them. Euen the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e do the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities of man issue foorth, into the manner of haires: which are properly named the hairs of the Beard.</p>
            <p>The colour of the Beard, doth sometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the qualities and quantities of the humors, yet hitherto hath not the same béene heard of, that any man saw a flaxen white Beard: for as much as the flegmaticke humor is not found so mighty, as to engender haires of the like colour, through the depriuing and lacke of naturall heat, to eleuate the sufficient matter vnto the engendring of the like coloured haires.</p>
            <p>Héere perhaps some will argue and affirme, (saith the Phisiognomer) that there is sundry times séene Women bearded, yet these are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound of a Flegmaticke qualitie, but rather the same doth happen in that the humors are so subtil, that of Nature such are procured to bée hot. For out of these Creatures doe haires spring, yea they sometimes appeare on their Jawes, but proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these appeare about the mouth, where the more heate doth abound: and su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h Women (séene the like) is named of all men bearded: héere conceiue (saith <hi>Cocles</hi>) that the like Woman found, is iudged to be very luxurious through her heat, and
<pb facs="tcp:28360:159"/>
moyst quality: of which the like Creature séen, is not onely strong of nature, but to be of a stout cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and manly in her facts.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The perfit woman is known to be sufficiently naked of haires, especially about the mouth: such a creature after Phisiognomy, is reported to be of a good quality: that is to say, bashfull, fearefull, honest, weake of courage, gentle of behauiour, and obedient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:28360:159"/>Héere (saith the Phisiognomer) doth a solemne doubt arise, and the same is, why men are séene bearded and not women for the more part, which doubt séemeth to be put forth by the learned <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lielmus Nurice</hi>: to which <hi>Cocles</hi> aunswereth in this manner, that the same may bée gathered to procéede, of the efficient, the materiall, and small cause: for as much as these properly serue vnto an ornament, and comely beautifying of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and in euerie kinde, the Males are séene comelier beautified with the same, than the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males. Which condition of the haires, properlie serueth vnto a defence of the iawes in man, that the Woman (for the like defence and necessitie) nothing néedeth, at the least so much as the Man: through which, the sense of feeling is knowne to be of greater force in Man. So that the Man by this reason, may better endure to goe barehea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and naked in other partes, in the bitter cold weather, than the Woman: and suffer greater stormes on the Bodie, than shée may, without harme to ensue. A stronger reason may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and giuen of the efficient, and materiall cause, séeing the Males in generall, are knowne to be hotter than the Females. For which cause, the Fume in men, that is the matter procuring the Haires, is found both more and mightyer, than in women: which séeing the same is known
<pb facs="tcp:28360:160"/>
not able to be consumed: for that cause (God and nature together) ordained two apt places in man, for the passages of them: as the one by the head, and other fitly by the chin and iawes, which forme the beard of man. Which manner of fumes consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in the woman, for as much as they appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not to bee so many and mighty, as well knowne they are to rest in the man: for this cause are these properly and naturally sent forth by the head. And a note of the like effect, wee sundry times know and sée by Women found of a hot and moyst com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, that appeare bearded: wee sée contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that in the colde and dry men these (for the more part) haue very little or no Beards. By which reason we gather (saith the Phisiognomer) that the séemely Beard waxeth not in the gelded person: for as much as those parts haue then lost the benefit of their hotter qualitie through which, these should engender the hot humors and fumes, that properly are the matter of the haires in them. And by a like reason of the former wordes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth: that the thicknesse of the Beard, and great hairinesse in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is an euident note and iudgement of the substantiall heate and moisture, and of naturall strength consisting in that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Héere may this argument also be propowned, that séeing Children are knowne to bee hot and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:28360:160"/>
moyst, why they waxe not bearded as men: to which the Phisiognomer thus answereth, that the smoky superfluousnesse, which is the especiall matter of the haires that issueth from the heade, &amp; other parts of the bodye, dooth passe and serue for their increase and norishment. The l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Conceiue (saith the Phisiognomer) that how much the force and plenty of heat consisteth by so much more the quantity of haires succeeds in that person. For which cause, a man must carefullie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of those which ouermuch abound in the store and plenty of haire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on the body, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of such is especially found adust.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cocles</hi> willeth a man to beware of such which haue red beards, for that the said colour indicateth an aboundance of adustion, and a mighty hotnesse to consist in these creatures: thorough which, such are knowne to be <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The beard decerned comly, and well fashioned, doth innuate such a creature to be of a good nature, of reasonable conditions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> congruent to all thinges, and manured after his bringing vp. Contrariwise iudge of those which haue the bearde not séemely

            <p>The neck with apparant sinewes, and il shaped doth witnesse by the report of the Phisiognomer) a foolish person and vnapt to learne.</p>

            <p>Such that about the ioynt of the necke aboue, are séene ouer fleshy, be those which haue the knot bearing out, and the neck hardly mouing: and be also without feeling, to exercise the same orderly: yea, such are knowne to be dul, and vnapt to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise good workes: yet these in the euill or wicked actions, and to do iniuries very prone &amp; forward: as afore in another place the Phisiognomer obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p>And certaine Apostates and Princes this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> noted, that mooued their neckes neuer vnto the right nor left side, without the mouing of the whole body togither: and such were known to be double tongued, dissemblers, and very wicked. But such hauing the contrary to this, is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disposition, that is, honest conditioned, and of gentle behauiour.</p>
            <p>The necke formed long, with a largenes in the positure, denotes such a person to be yrefull, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to learne, applied for the forme vnto the grun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sow.</p>
            <p>The necke bigge and fleshy, and short withal, doth argue such a person to be a foole, and a verie great féeder.</p>
            <p>When a certaine bearing out shal be betwéene
<pb facs="tcp:28360:167"/>
the knitting of the shoulder points, and beginning of the neck, that the growing out of the knottes be sharp: doth indicate such a Creature (for the most part) to be proud and arrogant: as the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Cocles</hi> noted many the like.</p>
            <p>The necke declining or leaning vnto one side, doth innuate such a creature to be of a dull capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and vnapt to learne.</p>
            <p>The necke bearing too much vpright, doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that creature, not onely to be vnapt to learne, but high minded, and selfe-willed: and one that will not be admonished of nothing he doth.</p>
            <p>The neck decerned stiffe, and as the same were immoueable: doth like declare such a person, to be vnapt to learne, and vndiscreet in his doings, by which note (for the most part) such are knowne to be fooles.</p>
            <p>The difference betweene the moouing and not moouing of the neck, is easily discerned: so that the neck appearing fast or stiffe, or quick mouing, doth witnesse the more foolishnes to consist in that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but if the same appeare stiffe, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fixed doth demonstrate dull capacity, and the vnaptnesse to learne.</p>
            <p>That you may not much erre, the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doth here discouer and open, that there bée some (which minding to hide this note) in them the rather to beguile the Judger: do vse customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

The Philosopher in <hi>Methaphoricis,</hi> vttereth a reason of this, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that the shoulder points being sufficiently so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, that is, sufficiently distant from the spondile or knottinesse: in such manner, that the space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them be equall: do denote that such indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduates readily receiue, that is, easily the sensitiue motion. For these haue the note or sensitiue power easily moueable, that is, lightly reducible from the power, vnto the act of perceiuing. But such which about the spondiles of the necke appeare hidden: are noted to be persons lacking wit, forasmuch as these hardly (being soluble) which about the knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse are decerned weake, to receiue the motion of the senses.</p>
            <p>The Shoulder pointes decerned sufficiently distaunt-asunder, doe denote such a Creature to bee liberall after Nature, applied for the same, vnto the decent apparancy and forme: for that liberality, aunswereth and agreeth to such a forms: and the like formed, are the Shoulder-points

            <p>The shoulder points appearing sufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant asunder, and decently spaced from the knot or ioynt of the neck, argueth such a person to be of a simple perseuerance and vnderstanding, and by the consequent knowne to be a dullard, as the ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth.</p>

crooke backed, which were of a good nature: but that these hauing the like bearing out, or bunche on the shoulders, were rather Trayterous, and verie wicked in their actions. And such (saith the Phisiognomer) were knowne in his time, to bee the founders of all wicked deceits, yea wily vn de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miners and gropers of the people, and had a déepe retching wit, and wylie fetches, in wicked actions. So that it seemeth impossible after Nature, that such deformed persons should possesse in them law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable actions, forasmuch as the spirite connexed in such an habitude, dooth yéelde a retrograde forme and property: which (saith the Phisiognomer) is knowne for the most part to bee Melancholicke. For which cause, a man ought carefully to beware and take héede, of fellowshipping or kéeping Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with such vnfortunate personnes, for the abouesaide reason and Worke of Nature. For these (sayeth the Physiognomer) are the like to bée eschewed, as a man of skill would refuse and shun the companie of a person lacking any chéef or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Member of the Bodie. And the like <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle (in secretis secretorum)</hi> saith, that a man ought verie diligently and carefully to beware of such an vnfortunate person, lacking any speciall member, as much as he would of his most dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:28360:173"/>
the creatures marked: and in another place, of the persons marked in any member, that a man trust not them. The reason is, for that the Spirits like insue vnto the forme of the body, so that out of an euill shaped body, can no lawdable actions proceed or be caused, as afore vttered: and this of him vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Phisiognomically.</p>
            <p>The Philosopher also vttereth, that the great number of Children liuing, is cause many tymes of the ill hap of Parents.

            <p>When such a length or longnesse is extended vnto the thighes or hammes, it doth intimate wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conditions, and such as reioyce at other mens harmes, in that those persons are excéeding malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and enuious.

            <p>Hee also reporteth, <hi>in differentia,</hi> 54. that the naile is a body extensed thinne, produced and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the superfluities, and hardned on the fingers ends, for a speciall helpe to them being there scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and groweth on the Fingers ends &amp; Toes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The nailes rough and hard, doe denote such a person to be prone to the veneriall act: as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Morbeth</hi> reporteth.</p>
            <p>The nailes ouer short, do argue wickednesse in that creature.

            <p>As touching the leane bodies after nature, these are in a contrary manner formed to the fatte: for as much as their principall members are knowne to be open, and able (by the report of the Phisiognomer) to indure but small matters, and traueyles.

Of which, their heate (by that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) is not so soone extinguished: as the singuler Phisition <hi>Galen</hi> vttereth. So that such an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:28360:194"/>
with the Phisiognomer, is accounted lawda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and this generally ment in all the body.</p>
            <p>Here conceaue (saith <hi>Cocles</hi>) that the heart in man, is cause of all the workings, if the principall members are duly formed: of which, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The thinnesse of flesh on the breast, with a due proportion of the other members: doth argue hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the heart, and by the consequent, a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like boldnesse: as appeareth in the chollericke.

            <p>The first note is, that such creatures which are decerned to be well ribbed, be accounted (after skil knowne) to be strong: and applyed for the forme, vnto the male kinde.</p>
            <p>But such séene and founde weake ribbed, are denoted feeble of strength (after nature) applyed for the forme, vnto the female kinde: which are knowne (saith the Philosopher) to haue but small and feeble ribbes, and weake muscles.</p>
            <p>The Lyon (of all beastes) is the strongest, and perfitest compowned in his partes: yea he for the proper composition, néerest agréeing vnto mans forme. The discription of whose forme, the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Aristotle</hi> Artly vttereth, in this manner.</p>
            <p>That he hath a mouth sufficient great, the face formed square, and not very bony: the vpper

And applyed for the forme, vnto the Male kinde: in that the same hath great ribbes, through the largenesse of the breast, and bredth of the backe: which properly procéedeth, of the nature of heate.

            <p>THe Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, by the quantity of the partes, which are betwéene the nauill and necke, and the mouth of the stomacke: saying on this wise, that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which haue the same space larger, which is from the nauill, vnto the bottome and ende of the breast: than that consisting from the end of the breast, vnto the neck: are iudged gluttenous, and of a dull perseuerance. The reason (why such are reported to be gluttons) is, for that such haue a big
<pb facs="tcp:28360:199"/>
belly, and great stomacke: and a great stomacke (saith the Philosopher) requireth much meate or foode, by reason of the great quantity, and not of the quality: of which, these (by an earnest desire) couet, to eate much meate. And such are knowne to be of a dull vnderstanding, and perseueraunce, through their mighty filling of meate, more then needeth: which, of the same, procureth weake sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in them.</p>
            <p>But such a creature which hath the space consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting from the nauill vnto the breast lesser in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then the same which is from the breast, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the necke, hath (by the report of the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) a great or large stomacke: the stomacke héere ment, for the proper belly: of which this person is knowne (of obseruation) to be weake of body, and short liued. The reason of this is, in that the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or rather the stomacke consisteth colde, through the smalnesse of the same of which, this ventricle or stomacke (saith the Phisiognomer) doth not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and well digest, but rather ingendreth su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities in it: and of the same, such are prone vnto diseases or sicknesses; and to be short liued.

            <head>The signification and iudgement by the notes of the belly. The xlvii. chapter.</head>
            <p>THe Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth héere instruct, how a man may Phisiognomate by the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the belly: in that the belly is knowne to be the same, which receiuing the meate (as <hi>Isidore</hi> reporteth) doth throughly digest it, and conueieth the excrements forth, that be superfluous, for which cause, this of nature formed, bearing and appearing outward.</p>
            <p>Such which are sufficient fatte about the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, well brawned, and that the belly beare not to much outwarde: are denoted strong after nature, applyed for the forme, vnto the male kind. And such a condition of it, is reported to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: so that the composition of the belly (after the minde of <hi>Constantine</hi>) is formed fleshlie after na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yea hotte, and moiste: and this, through the occasion of digestion properly. Of which <hi>Rasis</hi> vttereth, that such creatures which possesse bigge bellies after nature, are noted to be libidinous, great féeders, and that spéedily digest meates.</p>
            <p>Such creatures which are decerned in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

condition to this, as hauing flat bellies, not sufficient brawned, and these found soft, are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and iudged to be weake of body, and for the forme, applyed vnto the apparant congruency. In that we commonly see (saith the Phisiognomer) that such possessing leane bellies, proceeding of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accident, as eyther of too much fasting, or of a sicknesse caused, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth vtter also, <hi>in secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis secretorum,</hi> that he which possesseth a big bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is denoted and iudged to be an vndiscreete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, proud, foolish, and often desiring to coeate, for the hotnesse resting in him.</p>
            <p>A meane proportion and forme of the Belley discerned, with a narrownesse of the breast, dooth indicate such a Creature to bee of a déepe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, of a good discretion and witte, of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest conuersation and trusty. For a meannesse of the belly (saith the Phisiognomer) is procured of a hotnes, proportioned in that Creature, of which lawdable spirits ensue. Where the Philosopher
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:28360:201"/>
vttereth, with a straightnest of the breast: this is heere meant to be formed with a proportion of the same breast: for if this shold be compounded with an ouer-much largenesse, it would indicate a hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the heart in that Creature, to hinder vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. Of the same minde and iudgement, (by the report of the Phisiognomer) is the learned <hi>Loxius,</hi> where he witnesseth, that such a forme of the belly is knowne to be soft. <hi>Conciliatore</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that the bignesse of the belly, doth denote an ouermuch desire vnto the veneriall act. Whose stomacke and belley are discerned fleshier, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be strong.</p>
            <p>He also affirmeth, that the belly soft in youth, doth witnesse, that the same in many to become flat and drawne together in old age, <hi>&amp; econtra</hi>: of which this like, doth indicate a heauinesse in old age. The learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> vttered vnto the mighty K. <hi>Alexander,</hi> that the person hauing a great belly, to be vndiscréet, foolish, proud, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to coeate. A meanesse of the belly descerned, (as aboue taught) with a decent narrownesse of the breast: witnesseth a déepenesse of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ready counsaile in that Creature. These hitherto of <hi>Conciliatore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The bignesse of the Belley, procéedeth of the great heate, reuerberating in the empetnesse of the same: especially, vnto the Region of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors.
<pb facs="tcp:28360:202"/>
In that (as it is saide) the vertue Morrall or intellectiue, is not scituated in a body ouer hote: and of this, such are procured to be vndiscréete, and foolish. Such also are noted to be great drinkers, gluttonous féeders, and delighted in sluggishnesse: and giuing their minds much to luxury. As hath béene noted in sundry persons, which ledde an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie life.</p>
            <p>A hearinesse decereed on the belly, doth argue such a person to be full of wordes: applyed for the forme, vnto the kinde of birdes: in that it is knowne, that the property of such, which are thus heary on the bellye, to be talkatiue, and full of words: and this note onely conceiued and taken, of the chattering of birdes: which through their light spirits, are thus mooued to chatter: and the lesser birdes are knowne much louder to sing: and to haue many more notes, as the Nightingale, and such like, which are so procured and caused through the subtilnenesse of their bloud, and lightnesse of the spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s: in that these are of an ayrefull nature, through which, they are so lightly mooued vnto mirth, and diuers desires, which in their many songs, and chaunging of notes, endeuour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse. And the Cockes of those kinde, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise long, then the Hennes doe, forasmuch as they are formed hotter, and by the consequent haue subtiller bloud, and lighter spirites, than the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:28360:202"/>
Hennes. And that hearinesse, or many more feathers appearing on their bellies, procéedeth through the abundance of the heate vaporatiue, in that the same more aboundeth in this place, through the digestion there bearing greater sway: whose note is, that the flesh of their bellies is found farre swéeter, and more sauerie in taste, than any part of their bodies besides: so that of the like cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, sundry men are knowne to be very heary on the belly. Of which, to conclude, in that these pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse a subtill bloud, and light spirits, through the light motion of bloud, and the spirites. For that cause, are diuers fantasies in those subiectes, lightly procured and conceiued in minde, which, of them vttered in their spéech, and talke. So that of these, a certaine reason of the cause appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, why the chattering, and
many wordes in them, doe indicate a hearinesse to consist about their Bellies.</p>
            <p>The Phisiognomer knew sundry persons of the like condition, which were very leacherous, and that much desired to frequent the same. And the like conditioned creatures (saith <hi>Cocles</hi>) are these knowne to be, which possesse or haue but a short space, betwéene the heart and braine: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if such are found Collericke.

as the Hippes are well brawned, and bending to the out part: For then is it a note, of strength in that person. And the Phisiognomer hath noted, that such runne light and swift on the ground, and are great goers of iournies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Scotus</hi> hath truely vttered in this, which I much maruaile at (saith the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) séeing in all his Phisiognomy hee hath so mightily erred, not knowing what he wrote, as a person euill experienced in this Art: although hée durst attempt to vtter many matters.

               <hi>Michael Scotus</hi> vttereth a second note, that such hauing the Hippes bony, yet in such manner that the bones appeare not bigge, but much fleshy, with a smalnesse of the sinnewes: doe declare the like persons, to be weake of strength: and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the female kind.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Conciliatore</hi> reporteth, that the bones of the Hippes tended and bearing outward: doe denote strength, and a manly courage in that person: vnlesse a womanly fleshinesse in them, doth other

            <p>The Philosopher also vttered vnto the mightie King <hi>Alexander,</hi> that the much quantity of flesh discerned about the knées, and the same soft, doth indicate the weaknesse of strength, and féeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of courage, to consist in that Creature. And this caused through a weaknesse of the sinnewes: which by reason of the moysture, loosing the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ioynts, is like procured. And such persons (as the Phisiognomer reporteth of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) through the weakenesse or debility of the Joynts, cannot so well indure to beare any heauy burthens, no nor any other vnlawdable workes, in which the force of strength consisteth, or is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>Such creatures also are knowne to be so féeble of body, that they cannot long indure to walke on foot, at the least any reasonable distance: yea these besides are knowne to be effeminate. For the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perapparant manner is the same, which hapneth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:28360:207"/>
of purpose, with diligente study: as the like those inioy, which study of a speciall purpose, to procure and cause themselues amiable, &amp; gracious to men: or worke otherwise, besides the contrary dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: in that the manners or apparancy of such, are knowne to be accidentall: but these which are not wrought and caused of a set purpose, may aptly be reduced vnto the minde, euen as an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on naturall. And on such wise may their notes, of the conditions superapparaunt be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as the like vttered of the manners apparant. And the reductions a like caused into these, as the same in purpose consisteth: and as afore of the Phisiognomer (in many places) it hath béene taught.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Scotus</hi> in his Phisiognomy vttereth, that the knées full of fat flesh and fat: doe indicate a fearefull person, liberall, vaine, and of small la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>The said <hi>Michaell Scotus</hi> reporteth, that the knées leane and thinne of flesh, do argue a strong person, bold, well induring labour, secret, and a good goer on foot.</p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Albertus,</hi> by the authoritie of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> vttereth, that the knées which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are turned, as they (in a manner) knocked together: are applyed to the feminine propertie, vnlesse this may otherwise happen, by reason of

            <p>A third Note, the Phylosopher vttereth, that the Shankes ouer bigge, by reason of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much fleshinesse, and not with an equality or iust proportion, so that beneath the Anckles, these are bigge and fleshy, as the weomans are, doe denote such a person to be weake of strength, grosse wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of a dull perseuerance, vnshamefast and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as writeth <hi>Rasis.</hi>

            <p>The singuler Phylosopher <hi>Aristotle,</hi> vnto King <hi>Alexander</hi> wrote, that the thinnesse and slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the legs argueth a weak person and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.

            <p>The Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> saith, that the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the feet arguing the like aforesaide, ought not to be conditioned, or possesse an ouermuch fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shines, in that (according to <hi>Rasis</hi>) the feet apea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring very fleshy, and that these are formed fast or hard in the composition, do innuate such a person to be of a dul vnderstanding, and slender capacity, applied for the imperfiter vnderstanding vnto the female kind.</p>
            <p>The singular Phylosopher <hi>Aristotle (in libro de secretis secretorum)</hi> saith, that the féete formed fleshy, dooth denote such a creature to bee foolish, vnaduised, and a moouer or procurer of iniuries to men.</p>
            <p>The féet discerned small add slender in form, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth him to be strong and stout of courage: after the minde of <hi>Nuntius Naturae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> also reporteth, that such as haue their feete formed contrarie vnto the first manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as appearing narrow in the breadth, in which the ioynts seeme not to appeare, are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted weake of strength, feeble of courage, and to be effeminate.</p>
            <p>The Féet (sayth <hi>Cocles</hi>) which are decerned flender and in the forme appeare amiable: in such maner that these are found rather more soft, than
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:28360:211"/>
strong: are applied according to the passions of the minde, vnto the Female kind: that is such haue the naturall conditions atributed vnto the female kinde.</p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Rasis</hi> vttereth, that the féete for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med small, comely, and faire, dooth demonstrate such a creature to be prone vnto the veneriall acte, or a leacher, merry, ful of iests and sports the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of these dispositions, are the complexional qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities consisting in him.</p>
            <p>Heere conceiue (saith the Phisiognomer) that the hotnesse and moisture in euery creature, are the special causes procuring the bignes of the feete. But the coldnes is knowne to bee the consequent cause, occasioning the smalnesse of féet. Of which according to the diuers forme and condition of the feet, are the diuers qualities answerably caused, &amp; do likewise ensue, as is afore spoken of in diuerse places.</p>
            <p>Such which haue the Toes and the nayles of them crooking, like vnto the Hawkes Tallents or clawes, are denoted (after the minde of <hi>Aristotle</hi>) to be Deceiuers, Theeues, violent Catchers, and Filthy talkers. The like iudgement is to be giuen of the Fingers and Nayles so crooking. For the Phisiognomer alwayes obserued, and knewe these, which possessed the nayles and fingers thus proportioned and formed, to be of a Chollericke

quality: yet this note I saw (saith he) to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in iolly Warriors, and right good Soldiers, and in those which <hi>Marses</hi> beame séemed to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned in their great attempts.</p>
            <p>Certaine report (saith the Phisiognomer) that <hi>Aristotle</hi> héere meaneth, by the vnshamefast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, these naturally théeues, violent prollers, and euill tongued. I affirme (saith <hi>Cocles</hi>) that by the martiall théeues, the Philosopher doth meane the worthy souldiers: forasmuch, as such which liue and apply their wits and minds in the wars, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise none other then warlike attemptes (after the maner of the common spoilers and théeues) in pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chasing great booties and spoiles héere and there, whether these attaine it by right or wrong, after a warlike custom as we daily sée. And as further in the Phisiognomy of the Planet <hi>Mars</hi> shall be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and in the positure of <hi>Mars</hi> in the hand, &amp;c. to come forth.</p>
            <p>The Toes decerned close ioyned together, doe denote such a person to haue a natural scowring or Flixe of the belly: and such a creature applied for the forme vnto that kinde of Quaile (which sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his food by fresh Waters) for his often and much dunging.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that when the héeles are séene small in forme, indicateth such a person to be weak of strength, and fearefull.</p>

And this easily receiueth formes, inasmuch as that the same is of a light cause mooued of the weake mouer. And of this is the craftinesse in that subiect caused.</p>
            <p>The Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> vttreth, that whose inner part of the sole of the foote, shall not be decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hollow, but on such wise filled, that with the whole foot (in the treading) the same toucheth the ground, is denoted to be a creature wily, mutable, and full of deceits.</p>

            <p>THe Philosopher (<hi>in libro regimine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum</hi>) sayeth, that the ouermuch swiftnesse in treading, doth argue a hot quality. Such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb facs="tcp:28360:214"/>
which goeth a soft pace, is of a cold and flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick quality. But he which goeth a meane pace, is of a temperate quality.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The paces large and slow, do procéede of a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable discourse, and that such a person shal prosper (for the most part) in his works and déeds, as the Phisiognomer obserued in his Patron <hi>Alexander Bentiuolus,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iohn Bentiuolus,</hi> the second of that name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:28360:214"/>The shortnesse of the paces, dooth innuate the contrary, that is, froward conditions, and to bee euill disposed in his workes.</p>
            <p>The same affirmeth <hi>Rasis,</hi> who saith, that the paces large, and slow or softly, denoteth a friendly person, and the paces quicke and short, to be a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty person, and very carefull in all his busines, yet is hee ignorant to bring them about, and to end them.</p>
            <p>That famous <hi>Albertus</hi> reporteth, that the pace of a man procéeding of the inclination of Nature: doth demonstrate of the same, what the quallities of the mind and conditions are.</p>
            <p>Such which take long paces in their goinges, are noted bold of courage, and strong, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of <hi>Albertus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such hauing disordered paces, are denoted to be of an euill disposed minde, niggards, most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly sad and disquieted with many cares. Such encombred with a maruellous sorrow and heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, tread with contrary paces from the former. And if such bee Craftes-men, then are they close minded.</p>
            <p>The swiftnes of pace, in bearing the body vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and in a séemely personage, argueth a quick witted person, and subtle: and one which better beginneth matters, than endeth them.</p>
            <p>The creature which mooueth the eyes quicke,
<pb facs="tcp:28360:215"/>
and often shutteth them together, and bending his body, is he goeth is iudged to be fearful, a niggard crafty, and full of deceit.</p>
            <p>If any through his swiftnes of going, hath a troubling of the eies the head steddily standing, &amp; breatheth fast, such a one is denoted to be bold, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and very crafty.</p>
            <p>Such as tread with short paces, and hastening or quicked, are weake of strength, fearfull, and a niggard.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:28360:215"/>When the hands and feet moue togither with the bodie in the going (and that seemely) and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they be carried and mooue: with a little decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning both of the heade and necke, after a séemelie manner, is iudged (after the mind of the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer) to be a person strong, bold, and valiant of courage, applied to the Lion: as hath béene noted in sundry folks. Such a person the Phisiognomer noted that worthy <hi>Hanniball Bentiuolus,</hi> the son of the mighty <hi>Iohn Bentiuolus,</hi> his singuler Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor.</p>
            <p>A slow pace by nature, doth indicate a dulnesse of wit, except some mightier notes contrarie the same.</p>
            <p>If any hath a curious slownesse of pace (that sometimes staying) turneth the head, and looketh about him: doth bewray such a person to be high-minded.</p>
            <p>Such which in the moouing and going, haue the shoulder points brawned straight out &amp; large: are boasters, and full of Wordes, applied to the horse.</p>
            <p>Such which moue the shoulder-points, and that these shalbe crooked, are noted witty persons, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Lyon.</p>
            <p>Such which turne the féete thwartly (or in a contrary maner) in the going, that the toes séeme to crosse one before the other, and make (the
<pb facs="tcp:28360:216"/>
forme of a Tryangle) by that manner of going: and that through their weake legges also such doe stagger, as though these were broken or loose in the ioynts, are conditioned to the woman, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine report: such the Philosopher in the Chapter of the shankes doth affirme to be hatefull, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uericundious.</p>
            <p>Whose pace is slow in going, argueth such a person to be weake of strength, and of a dull Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
            <p>The moouing of the Nose, with the moouing of the Muscles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Cheeke Bones in the going, doth denote such a person to bee yrefull: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to this in the going, that the Nose turning vpward, doth like argue such a person, to bee yre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Such which lift vp the shoulders in the going disorderly or that the one member be bigger then the other, are windy and troubled as it were, with a certaine kind of Melancholy. This note is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially verified when as the neck is leaning to the one side, as the phisiognomer obserued in a certain Scholler and Countryman of his, and in certaine of the Religious.</p>
            <p>Such which shrugge too and fro with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and rubbing themselues, and if these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be eloquent: are noted mighty flatterers, and dissemblers, applied to the Spaniell: which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <figure/>
for feare, and partly for reliefe at his Maysters hands, doth so shrug together, and fleete or fawne on his Maister. Of which, these (as I may tearm them Spaniels) are with diligent care and héed to be considered, in that the greater part of them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and attempteth treasons. <hi>Albertus</hi> &amp; <hi>Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatore,</hi> do partly affirme this. Of these was one <hi>Seraphinus a Pisis,</hi> a perfit Chirurgian.</p>
            <p>Such which go with a leaping or dancing pace, and bearing out the buttocke, and with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance borne vpright: are noted to be Cynedes and womanly persons.</p>
            <p>Such whose knées bend in the going, do either fal vnder the thraldome of seruice, or else into some great misery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28360:217"/>The reason of this is, in that the debility of the sinnewes, doth protend the weakenesse of braine, and by the consequent, the imbecility of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>Such which treade on the toes, in (such sort) going outward with them, that the héeles séeme to make an angle behinde: are noted of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly Nature, yea and Cyneds: especiallie if the knées seeme to knock together, and bend in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Such which haue an artificiall pace, and by measure goeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that swiftly, and their eyes moue quicke, with a smiling countenance: for the passion, are mooued vnto euery difference of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>Such a person which hath a childish looke when hee beholdeth any pleasant thing: these shall you suppose to be giuen (or at the least prone) to picking and stealing.</p>
            <p>Such a person which hath the pace of that foule named a Storke, with the shoulder pointes and Neck drawn together in the going, and with the like positure of the eies: is iudged like in conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Storke.</p>

            <p>Such which with straight and strong Legges, doe orderly go, are noted bold, and vnpacient: yet is boldnesse, with a valiantnesse of courage signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>Such which haue a quicker pace, and more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly are hasting in their pace: are noted rash and foolish.</p>
            <p>Such which tread and go (after the manner of the Hart) with the head and eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vsing the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said walking in these: are not onely iudged to bee vnstable, but to dye an euill death.</p>

            <p>Such which tread with strong and fast soales of the féete: are noted strong and manly, vnlesse the body otherwise be weake, and that the knées bond in the going. Hitherto of the nature and iesture of the paces and going, shall héere suffice.</p>

And that the largenesse or breadth of his body, to be like so much: for how much the distance is, betwéene the two endes of the middle fingers; (the armes and hands) stretched out: and so much is the distance betwéene the crowne of the head &amp; sole of the foote. By this reason also (the olde wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) named man, the little world: in that if a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle were drawn about him, he wold then be found as wholy round. For which cause, if any person doth excéed this quantity of length, hee is then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be of a tal stature: but the person which lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of this, or is lesser of stature (then this discrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>The Phylosopher <hi>Aristotle,</hi> doth Physiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate by the quantity of the Bodye, as by the smalnesse and bignesse of the same. First, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the quantitie of the Bodie very small, hee reporteth, that the small persons in quantity and stature, are of a ready and quicke wit, and prompt in attaining anie thing, and passing both in the conceyuing and knowing of matters. And this in as much as to the quantity of body absolut, and in as much as is by reason of the space, in which the same is: To which, <hi>Gulielmus</hi> adding a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this matter, reporteth: that those in which the arteriall Bloude, and both the spirit and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally heate spéedily and forthwith procéede from the heart vnto the braine, and vnto the cogitatiue vertues: those are of a sharpe and prompt wit, in taking, and generally in conceiuing. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as by the rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on of the space in which such a motion is: and I héere name, that an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or conceiuing, and knowledge: and of that knowne iudgement and discretion: of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and condition, are the persons small or little
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:28360:221"/>
of quantity. For in those (as the Phisiognomer affirmeth) the bloud, the linely Spirit, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat hastily and swiftly proceede, and are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the heart vnto the braine, or vnto the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue vertues: in which such a motion is on the small, and short space: and euen the same is in very small persons, in as much as by the quantity of the body.</p>
            <p>Although the Philosopher séemeth in the fiest, to Phisiognomate by the smalnesse of the body, in comparing vnto the chollericke complexion, or the hot and dry quality. And the Philosopher mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that although the smalnesse signifieth a sharpnesse of wit, and the goodnesse of perceiuing, in as much as is of that quantity: yet by reason of the complexion may the contrary be. For the smal which are of a dry quality, which he meaneth, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hot and dry meates: and such which abound in the hotnesse of body, as if he said, the smal chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke in quality, and in whom a drinesse and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous hotnesse consisteth, and that lesser beare sway, doe performe little or nothing, that is, they are alwaies vnapt or vnable vnto the performing and perceiuing, especially vnto the well iudging or discerning.</p>
            <p>The motion of the spirits in them is ouer swift, and by reason of the smalnesse of the space, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer much hotnesse causing them cursible, that they
<pb facs="tcp:28360:222"/>
neuer can consist in the same, as this in perfitly perceiuing and knowing.</p>
            <p>In the second, the Philosopher instructeth to Phisiognomate by the greatnesse of body, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the same vnto the cold complexion &amp; moyst of flegmaticke. In the third the Philosopher vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, to Phisiognomate by the smalnesse of bodie, in comparing the same vnto the colde and moyst complexion. And he meaneth, that the smal which are of a cold and moist complexion: ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> perfit, that is, apt vnto the performing: although the Bloud and spirit in these are moued vnto the heart spéedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the smalnesse of space: yet neuerthelesse, caused vnmooueable, by reason of the complexion or coldnesse, in that moysture restrayneth, the dryth and heate: and thus of the short and swift motion of those Spirites, by reason of the space: and in a slow manner, by reason of the moisture of those Spirits, shall the motion bee caused com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurated, and both a meane and temperate, apt vnto the performing. In the fourth he Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth by the greatnesse of body, by a comparison vnto the hot and dry complexion: in that such are perfit and quicke in conceiuing. Although in those the space of the motion be great, yet the blood and Spirit in them are very swift mouing, by reason of the great heate: and on such wise in these, is a temperament of motion caused, and are apt vnto
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:28360:222"/>
the performing.</p>
            <p>Here is to be conceiued, that although the hot and dry, and generally the chollerio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, are of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficill or hard conceiuing, and of a dull wit by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the dryth, which hardly receiueth: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the chollericke bigge in body, are more perfit, and apter to conceiue then the small in quantitie of body. For when these giue and apply their wit vnto the conceiuing and attaining of any thing, they long retaine the same with them: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue the Spirit and blood moueable, yet for that the space of the motion is great, for that cause, before any other thing or matter occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, they first conceiue and take, and strongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. For a more drynesse then moysture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the hinder part of the braine of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that drinesse hath the property to attain and receiue with difficulty, and when this hath receiued a forme, the same purchased, it retaineth for a long time: which contrary is of the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. For the moysture or moist braine behind doth lightly receiue a forme, and soone looseth the same: in that the formes which are imprinted in the moysture, are not preserued any long time: but soone vanish away. And for as much as the chollerick small in body, do not so long consist in any maner, that any forme in their spirit can be fixed: yet are these neuerthelesse noted perfite, as
<pb facs="tcp:28360:223"/>
is afore vttered. For the learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> héere meaneth, that the more chollericke in body, are perfit simply, but this vnderstood in the comparison vnto the chollericke small of body. The Sanguine of complexion, and big in body, are very perfit: in that they be of a temperate moyst quality, and of a good receiuing or retaining.</p>
            <p>In the excéeding, the Philosopher dooth Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomate by the quantity of the body, betwéene a very small and very big, as vnderstanding of a meane. Of which such hauing bodies ouer-much excéeding in greatnesse and height, or ouer-much lacking in the smalnesse of body and stature, are perfit by hap: in that these sometime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that by the consequent, such ouer smal, and ouer big, are vnperfit, in as much as vnto the extending: which may be on such wise, and otehr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the ouer small forme: so that the vnperfit is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the Court of <hi>Frederick</hi> the third, &amp; <hi>Charles,</hi> Emperors, did the worthy <hi>Indagines</hi> note certain persons very tall, and maruellous leane: who in conditions, were knowne to be very froward and foolish.

               <p>Another example is, that if any hath the notes of an yreful person, and that anger doth then but a little disquiet him, then it is to be iudged, that he hath wel repressed and brideled the passions of yre: and euen the like iudgement may bee giuen in al others.

               <p>Yet the more open and manifester Signes are they, which be caused and appear in the principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest places, and these named the principall oft, that are about the eyes, the forehead, the head, and the face. But the second and next place is the same, which is knowne to be about the Shoulders, the breast, the belly, the legges, and the Féete. But the last, is the part which is to be considered about the belly. But the generall difficulty or hardnesse of these, consisteth of the iudgement, euen as the like dooth the same both in the Art of <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and Phisicke practise depend.</p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Galen</hi> affirmeth, that the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may erre in his iudgement, for diuers causes. First in that to any one note a man may not trust except the same bee propper of it selfe, as is aboue declared. Therefore no one note alone may beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of any especiall part of the Bodie: in that by the nature of one perticuler, doth not the Nature of man in generall consist.

Others affirm those to be the mightier notes, which are taken of those members, by which the passion is exercised: as the notes which declareth the yre of the brest &amp; ribs, which is exercised by the heart, within those parts placed.</p>
               <p>Further, in that by the shoulders, armes, legs, &amp; féet, strength is exercised, therefore are the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier notes for strength, gathered of them. And thus by the other members also, may you gather and iudge.</p>

            <head>The Conclusion to the Gentle Reader.</head>
            <p>THus after the possibility of my skill, haue I performed my Booke, though not altogither in so learned an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as I would, to please my Countrymen withal: for wel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>low, that nothing dooth more content and satisfie the cares of men, than to vnderstand and know straunge mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the hid properties and natures consisting in vs, which this worthy Art of Phisiognomy liuely setteth forth. In the same I haue vttered such pleasant matter, as I think both delectable to read, and necessary to the furtheraunce of that singuler Art. If to some men I shall seeme not fully to haue satisfied their desires heerein, according to their expectation, or haue not so cunningly handled the same, as the liuely matter it-selfe offereth, and is woorthy of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n respect of the great comodity that this lawdable Art brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and causeth in a Common-weale, being thoroughly knowne to men: I referre me then wholy to the learned correction of the wise, beseeching them friendly to giue me know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edge of it, that so being detected of my fault, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> will willingly correct &amp; amend the same. For well I know, that no Treatise can alwayes bee so workemanly handled, but that somewhat sometimes may fal our amisse, contrary to the expectation of the Reader. Wherefore (Gentle Reader) my petition to thee is, to accept these my traue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> with as good a will, as they are offered vnto thee: and to take that gently, which I giue gladly: and in so dooing, I shall thinke my paines well bestowed and shalbe encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged heereafter to trust more vnto thy courtesie.</p>
            <p>Heere may I compare my selfe with two or three exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, not altogither impertinent to my purpose. It is Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of one <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arus Thebanus,</hi> a Captaine, who being in the field with his Army, ready to giue battaile notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was meruailously vexed (at that instant) with a sore
<pb facs="tcp:28360:239"/>
disease of the Lungs, yet couragiously he set vpon his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: in the ioyning of which he fought himselfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then stroken on the breast with a speare, his griefe cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sed, and was for euer healed of the same.</p>
            <p>Alike example to this, we haue of <hi>Mamillus Bubulus,</hi> King of the <hi>Tuscans,</hi> who hauing a stripe in the necke, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained behind a peece of iron, which through the smalnes of it, could be by no meanes got out. He on a time Riding on hunting, his horse hapned to ouerthrow him, that with the fall thereof, the little piece of Iron flewe out of his mouth, and so was healed.</p>
            <p>As those two, <hi>Falarus</hi> and <hi>Mamillus,</hi> being both diseased men, were contrary to their expactation healed of their griefes: euen so, I being weake in skill and knowledg, and therefore doubting my successe, yet boldly publishing this my Booke, may by your gentle accepting of it (contrarie to my desert) be released of my feare. But I fear I shall not be so happy as either of these were: but rather chaunge that fortune with <hi>Cornelius Rufus,</hi> who dreaming he hadde lost his eye-sight, &amp; that one did lead him, in the morning when he awaked, found himselfe blind indeed. Euen so, I in doubtfull manner dreaming of <hi>Momus,</hi> when I lest think of him, shall finde me encountred of him. For what fault is there so small, which <hi>Momus</hi> will not find. If the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neder sort brought vp alwayes vnder <hi>Minerua,</hi> are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times touched of him: much more I, who neuer tasted of the Learned Lake, but rather alwaies rudely taught amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Smiths of <hi>Vulcanus</hi> forge, must needs be stung of him. And yet I doubt not, but the wise wil consider my good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to please the common sort, for whose sake only haue I taken this pains in publishing this book: regarding not so much the wel or il handling of the matter, as my good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Therfore (gentle Reader) once again I craue of thee the kind acceptance of my rude labours: and so farewell.</p>
