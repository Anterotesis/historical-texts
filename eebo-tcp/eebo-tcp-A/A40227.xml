         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Pr. <hi>And whereas you say you give the title of holinesse to the Pope after the same manner as was given to the high Priest in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and wicked Magistrates was called gods, and the Priests wear their titles upon their breasts, and</hi> Jacob <hi>called his wicked bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Esau <hi>Lord, and there is Scriptures enough to give honourable titles to wicked men.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> These are sutable proofs for the Pope, and sutable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. First, the Priest-hood is ended; they were never in that latitude, neither are you to be measured with them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do any true Christians. As for <hi>Esau</hi> and wicked Magistrates, the fruits of this amongst you has appeared, and the wicked must bow before the just, and <hi>Esau</hi> the <hi>elder</hi> must be <hi>a seruant to the younger</hi>; and salvation is come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> who judges the mount of <hi>Esau,</hi> and is gathering the elect <hi>Jacob,</hi> who rides over the high places of the earth, which have set up your Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but you have shewed the fruits of <hi>Esau,</hi> who are slaying and killing the just; But who be in the power of Christ, who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54752:4"/>
hath all power in heaven and earth given unto him, be out of <hi>Esau's,</hi> and be o'th top on his mount, and answers the Elect.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>He saith that Purgatory is a temporall punishment to faithfull persons after death, who have not done due pennance for their sins in their life time, so must do pennance after death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>Pr. <hi>I say again, that Christ is not without a body, and the same body which is in the Sacrament, is that which was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>which dyed for us, and now sitteth at the right hand of God, and none other.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Heaven is above, and earth is beneath, there is an earthly body, and there is a heavenly body, a naturall and a spirituall; and if that which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> be your bread after consecration, which body saw no corruption, though put in the grave. Now see if your bread which you call the body of Christ, will not corrupt after it lye a while, though you have consecrated it; then how can you say that is the body of Christ at the right hand of God? and outward bread which will corrupt, which the body of Christ saw none, which was born of the Virgin, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world; yet he did not corrupt, nor saw no corruption.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>And to say, is Christ to be looked for in the Saints, is so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found that he cannot reach the depth of the meaning, the Roman Catholiques use no such manner of speech.</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54752:8"/>
Catholiques, you have no such manner of speech, I do believe you; And so you put him in the Sacrament without you, and call the bread and wine his body and blood; so this is to prove your selves to be reprobates, so are judged by the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the Scripture. <hi>Know you not in your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you except ye be reprobates</hi>?</p>
            <p>Priest. <hi>The more honour we give to Saints, the more honour we give to Christ. Indeed to give godly honour to Saints, is to commit idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If that you do not give godly honour to the Saints, it is ungodly; and here in this you have again confounded your selves, and that honour which belongs to the Saints is of God, and godly, and not idolatry; but that honour which you give, which is not godly, is given to such which are not Saints, which is idolatry; and so that honour which you should give to God, you give to Images, in kneeling to them; and so in that you are as the heathen, and are found idolaters, which never did any of the Apostles kneel before an Image; but you that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ravened from the Spirit of God, and so lost the image of God, and fallen down to Images.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>A Crosse, a Crucifix, or an Image of Chirst or any Saint, whether they be made of silver, stone, or wood, are according to our doctrine but dead creatures; neverthelesse are profitable and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable memorials of them, and do much help our devotion, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate our love and affection to them, and they are not Idols, but they represent unto us Christ and his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> So then they being but dead things, and you bowing to dead things, is to Idols; for bowing to a dead stock or a stone is a bowing to Idols, as saith the Prophet, and dead images. Now you having them as you say, to represent unto you Christ, and to put you in minde of him and the Saints, shews that you have not Christs spirit in you, nor him in you, nor his mind in you, so are reprobates, and are none of his; for those that have Christ in them, and his minde in them, need no such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations as to put them in minde of Christ, or to fall down before Crosses, Crucifixes, Images, dead things, to stir up the love towards Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dead things do not stirre up the love of God in people, but the faith which works by love, this stirs up the love towards Christ who is the Author of it, and the Saints, to make Images of the Saints, and observing of dayes, shews that you are not come to just mens spirits; which who are, need no other thing to put them in mind, nor observe dayes; for they see over dayes, and so in these principles, I see ye are reprobates concerning the faith which works by love; for the love of God is not in you, you are not come to the j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Pr. <hi>In some particulars he saith, there is no difference between them and the heathens; as first I confesse their Idols are made of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, wood, and stone, and so are our Images; their Idols were but dead creatures which had eyes and see not, and so are our Images; they bow to their Idols, and we bow to our Images: so far the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance is good, and the heathens do believe that their Idols were able to help them, and we say our Images and Idols stirs up our love to Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> So therein the Images helps you as the Heathens do, and you may see that all those things are got up since the dayes of the Apostles, &amp; you that be inwardly ravened from the spiri of God, and gotten the sheeps cloathing as the Jews and the Gentiles which was astray from the spirit of God, worshipping Images &amp; Idols, which when the <hi>Jews</hi> was in the spirit of God they kept above them all: So you being gone from the spirit of the Lord, are fallen under Images and dead Idols since the days of the Apostles, and bows down to them as the heathens, &amp; they are dead a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for there was never any talk of worshipping of Images, and bowing to Images amongst them; but the <hi>Jewes</hi> while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the law of God, they broke down the Images of the Heathens: so all that be in the life of God will break down the founder of the Images amongst you Apostates, which sees not and hears not: And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> saying to them that worshipped Images, who said unto a stone, <hi>thou art my father, and to the wood thou hast brought me forth.</hi> So say you to your Images, Pictures, and Crosses, thou putst us in minde, thou art our similitude, and puts us in minde of Christ, of <hi>Mary,</hi> and shewing that you have not the minde of Christ in you; but dead stocks and stones must put you in minde, so this (of yours) is a higher mystery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity then that of the heathen.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>You say you account of the pictures no more then we account of any picture or pictures in our houses.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> That is not so, thou dost not speak with the bit in thy mouth, we do not fall down to them, but deny them.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>And the heathens did all kinde of godly honour directly to their Idols; but the small honour which we do to the Images or pictures of the Saints, is no more then an outward complement as I may say, just as it was the fashion in</hi> England <hi>to put off ones hat, or bow to the Kings Throne in honour of the King: Neither do we this honour to the pictures simply considered as pictures, but as they are representations of Christ and his Saints.</hi>

Amongst you who have lost the power of God, the Crosse of Christ, and the image of God, and has not the mind of Christ in you, so are fain to have dead images, crosses, and pictures, which you call re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations, to put your dead minds in remembrance of Christ, and to stir it up which kills and slayes the just, all that be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it; and the heathen and you do not differ, for they bow to Images, and so do you; but yours (as I have said) is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mistery of iniquity, who has fled from the true foundation of the true Church, which is the pillar and ground of truth, and so since have got up your images and idols.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>Now because the main thing which you do carp at is at our bowing before Images or pictures of the Saints, to the end that all your mouths may eternally be stopt, I will shew you out of the Scripture, that notwithstanding the bowing down to Idols is most strictly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the second command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54752:10"/>
was but a dead creature made of wood and other materials, by the hands of men; and upon this Arke were placed two Images, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of Cherubims, read the</hi> 7 <hi>of</hi> Joshua, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>and you will finde that he and all Israel did worship and fall down before this Ark and these Images, after the same manner that we fall down before a Crosse or a Crucifix, or the Images of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Joshua</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> falling down before the Ark, which was in prayer to the Lord, and the Lord heard him, and spoke to him, and answered him. Now he doth not say that he fell down to the Ark or to the Images, or bowed down to them; for the Law was contrary, which saith, <hi>thou shalt not bow down, &amp;c.</hi> But he and Israel fell down before the Ark to the Lord; and this is nothing to the bowing now to Images, and pictures, and crosses, for that was the time of the Figure, there was a Temple made, and many things, Tabernacle and Sanctuary, which was all in the types and figures, before the substance was come; But now the substance is come, Christ Jesus, who ends all types and figures, and similitudes, and the patterns, for he is the substance of those things that figured him forth, who hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened their mouths. So now your crosses, and your images, and your pictures, and your bowings before them w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you have made and set up is Antichristian, without any command of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ who is the substance. And if <hi>Joshua</hi> had bowed to the outward Arke, or Altar, or Temple, or any of the Figures, &amp;c. But it was not so, and the command of God was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and we say Christ is come, the everlasting covenant, the everlasting Priesthood; for in the first Covenant and priesthood was the Figures, and there was singings, &amp;c. But now they that sing must sing in the spirit, and they that pray must pray in the spirit, and they that worship must worship in the spirit; so it was the work of the Apostles to bring people off the shadows and changeable things, to Christ the substance, where there was no shadow not change, nor variablenesse, and to keep them from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and so all your idols, images, crosses, crucifixes, representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are set up since the Apostacy, from the Apostles, and so our mouths are eternally opened; and that Scripture in <hi>Joshua</hi> the 7. brings nothing for you, for the <hi>Jewes</hi> Ark is gone, and down now, and their Altar and Temple is down and gone, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54752:11"/>
denyed by them that be true Christians in the life; but them that have a name, but be dead, are setting up imitations and likenesses that has lost the life of Christ, and his minde, and the image of God, are falling down before dead Idols; but Christ is risen, <hi>and those that be risen with him are seeking those things that be above</hi>; for crosses, crucifixes, images, idols, be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low among the dirty mud where the Devill is, in the earth, the murtherer, and murthering one another about their Idols and these dead things which are all out of the truth.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>And even as</hi> Joshua <hi>and the Israelites made their prayers to God after this manner and Ceremony, so do we make our prayer unto Christ and the blessed Trinity; and because we have, or at least ought to have a sense of our own basenesse, and of the just indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ against us, we turne our selves to his Saints and blessed Mother, who are likewise represented unto us by these pictures, and do humbly beseech them to mediate between us and Christ.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Joshua</hi> his falling down before the Arke to pray to the Lord; your falling down &amp; praying before your Images and Idols, and Crosses, to put you in minde of Christ is not measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nor comparable with <hi>Joshua's</hi>; but for the Ark which <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> fell down before, it is ended, which Arke was a command of God, but yours God never commanded, but have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by you that have apostatized from the Apostles, who saith, <hi>Little children, keep your selves from idols</hi>; so that which God commanded being denyed which they fell before, much more ought yours to be denyed which God never commanded, and both are judged with the spirit of truth in which the Saints pray to God the Father of spirits, who can pray without Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or representations, or Idols; and the Saints, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Christ bade them pray in his name, not in the name of <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp; not in the name of the Saints, nor in the name of his Mother, but ask in his own name; for saith he, <hi>Who is my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sister, and brother, but those that do the will of my father</hi>: So this I say, though people be never so vile, they are not to ask in the name of the Apostles, nor of the Saints, nor in the name of <hi>Mary,</hi> but in the name of Christ; and he hears such who asks in his name, <hi>for there is no other name under heaven given by which any can be saved, then by the name of Jesus.</hi>

            <p>Pr. <hi>You take offence because the Roman faith doth teach it lawfull to punish Schismaticks and Hereticks with the sword; but if you will be mad, and say that those which seduce mens souls, &amp; cause schisms and heresies in the Church, and disturb the peace thereof, must be let alone, and may in no wise be punished, who can help it.</hi>

               <p>And now I come to the answer of the substance of thy Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Principles.</p>
               <p>First, thou says, <hi>This is good Catholique Doctrine, that a man may have the true faith, and yet lead a sinfull life: And further, that a wicked man and a godly hath true faith, and it doth not differ a whit in matter or substance in the godly and ungodly. Now to say one hath faith, and not the other, is against all sence and reason thou saith.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I do believe thee that this is thy Catholique doctrine, but I cannot call it good, for then I should erre like thy selfe; for this Doctrine is contrary to the doctrine of the Gospel, for true faith is that which the just lives by, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. And that which the just lives by is pure; the matter of it, by it he is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the faith of the godly stands in the power of God, and that is a pure thing: And he that hath the true faith, hath the faith of Christ, who is truth from whence it comes, and it leads out of sin, and a sinfull life; gives victory over sin. <hi>This is the victory even your faith.</hi> By faith the godly stands, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. And by faith the godly walks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, a wicked mans faith, if thou call it faith, is called a feigned faith, and a dead faith, and is centred in him who hath the power of death which is the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Remember, when you are in your wickednesse, and upon your death beds, you were warned in your life-time, and this light will let you see when evill thoughts get up in you, and evill affections, and evill desires, and check you, and reprove you, if you love it, and heed it; when you are walking up and down, when you are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting still by your selves, secretly it will bring you to think upon God, and when you are walking up and down abroad, yet it is present with you, there will be your teacher, there will be your condemnation if you hate it: The light of Christ, who saith, <hi>Learn of me, I am the way, the truth and the life.

                  </gap>rom the spirit of truth, <hi>that leads into all truth.</hi> You are erred from the Crosse of Christ, the power of God, and have set up outward Crosses, and falls down to that instead of falling down to the power of God. You have erred from the true Image of God the Saints were in, and have set up outward Images of wood and stone: You have erred from the Saints life and spirit, and from the spirits of just men, and so from the true Church, and so set up the Reliques, as pieces of Cloath, and old bones: So you know after the flesh, which the Apostles did not: And you are erred from the Rock, and falln into the waters, as in <hi>Revelations</hi>: And your Idols, Pictures, and Images have corrupted the earth; so you are erred from the true Church, and the true Spirit, which cryed against Idols in all ages, as <hi>Moses</hi> said in his command to the people, and the Apostles. Your Church is commanded to make Images and Idols, and the Church in <hi>Moses</hi> time, and the Apostles Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were commanded to keep from them. So no true Church you are, but apostates, but fallible, and erred in matter of faith and doctrine, and praised be the Lord who hath brought you to the Light. And multitudes of instances may be shewed, who compares the Church with what the Churches of Christians were in the dayes of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou saist, the difficulty is where the Church of Christ is to be found; for Papists, Lutherans, Calvinists, Anabaptists, Arminians, and all schismatical meetings, they do claim the title of Christs Church to themselves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
