         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

this preſent <hi>Presbytery,</hi> pretend to be
<hi>Presbyters</hi> by a power of <hi>Ordination</hi>
from <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters:</hi>
and if ſo, they are to make it
appear, that there is a true <hi>perſonal</hi>
ſucceſſion of <hi>Miniſtery</hi> from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and that
they do <hi>lineally</hi> ſucceed without interruption; for

nor <hi>infallibility</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of ſuch a <hi>power;</hi> and

and perpetual <hi>viſibility</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the opinion of all the Reformed Divines;)
and further, a <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Church-Miniſtery,</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
of Jeſus Chriſt in the <hi>Antichriſtian State,</hi> from
whence this <hi>Miniſtery</hi> of theirs comes, by which they
ſtand <hi>preſent-Presbyters;</hi> and how any true <hi>Ministery</hi>
can be found in that very Antichriſtian State, which
is called the <hi>man</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> the <hi>mystery</hi> of <hi>iniquity,</hi> the

and of <hi>Idols;</hi> I leave it to be judged.</p>
            <p>2. That theſe preſent <hi>pretended-Presbyters</hi> cannot
be found true <hi>Presbyters</hi> but by ſuch a perſonal and
ſucceſſively derived power, will appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from their
preſent <hi>Model</hi> of <hi>Ordination;</hi> they allowing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
none for <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Miniſters,</hi> but ſuch as
are ſent out by their perſonal Ordination, or were
formerly ordained by Biſhops; ſo as they make
theſe, and theſe muſt make others; and thus their
power is derived from a <hi>perſonal</hi> and <hi>lineal</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and <hi>demonſtratively</hi> proved from their own
practice: nor will it help them that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
had a <hi>Church,</hi> or ſome <hi>inviſible Saints</hi> under
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> becauſe they muſt both prove themſelvs
&amp; the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Miniſtery to ſucceed that very <hi>Church</hi>
or thoſe very <hi>inviſible Saints;</hi> and that, that <hi>Church</hi> or
thoſe very <hi>Saints,</hi> were <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Miniſters;</hi> for we

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:159635:4"/>
ſent;</hi> good <hi>men,</hi> but not good <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as in their
own way of practice will more appear: for if any
ſhall now call himſelf a true Preſbyter or Miniſter,
he muſt prove his ſending to them by a perſonal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination;
which proof of their Ordination we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from them, as they would do now from any
others.</p>
            <p>3.<note place="margin">See their <hi>Humble Advice.</hi>
               </note> How theſe things can ſtand together. That the
Divine Right is in the Congregational Presbytery, as
they acknowledge; and yet that there is a Claſſical,
Provincial, and National Preſbytery, which are but
Prudential and Humane, or Mixed Judicatures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to ſuch a diſtinction; and yet are allowed by
them a Power Supreme and coercive to the Divine
Right of the Congregational Presbytery, which is
the firſt and immediate ſubject of the Divine Right
of Preſbytery, as they themſelves acknowledge.
And now whether do not their own Principles
control that pretended Divine Right they plead
for and ſet up,<note place="margin">See in their <hi>Humble Advice, &amp;c.</hi> to the Parl. Manuſcr. <hi>Pag.</hi> 4.</note> a Preſbytery of Charity and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
over the Preſbytery in the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
which they ſay is onely of <hi>Divine
Right?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. How can that Preſbytery whoſe conſtitution
is ſo queſtionable, chalenge ſuch a Divine Right?
As firſt, their Preſbyters, or firſt conſtituting Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
are ordained by a queſtionable power, <hi>viz.</hi>
that of Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Their Ruling Elders by a power as queſtionable,
<hi>viz.</hi> by a <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
for trial, for election, becauſe of the general
corruption in this Kingdom both in Miniſters and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159635:5"/>
people; not by that very Apoſtolical Scripture-Rule
or Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Their Congregations Pariſhional, and of politick
conſtitution; not Congregational, according to
Scripture.</p>
            <p>Their way of conſtituting this preſent Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
extraordinary, by ſuch an Aſſembly, without
precept or example for ſuch a Way in the whole
New Teſtament, from whence the whole Order of
that diſpenſation ought to be framed, and not from
the Law, or Old Teſtament, or ſome caſes of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity

as they ſay in their Model to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Primitive Elders</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were qualified
immediately from the Spirit with <hi>gifts</hi> proper to
ſuch a Miniſtration; which theſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
being not, but moſt by gifts, and habits of Art
and Science acquired by induſtry: therefore theſe
preſent <hi>Presbyters</hi> cannot chalenge the ſame power
for <hi>Church-Cenſures,</hi> without the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> gifting
them, and <hi>anointing them</hi> to ſuch a <hi>power</hi> and <hi>admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi>
in the <hi>Church;</hi> but ought to be content
meerly with a <hi>mixed</hi> and partly prudential <hi>power,</hi>
becauſe of the <hi>mixture</hi> of their anointing and gifts,
if they will needs have ſuch a Government ſet up
for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, which is not all <hi>Christs,</hi> and moſt of that
<hi>all</hi> very queſtionable whether of <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all their proofs alleadged from <hi>Scripture</hi> for
the <hi>Presbytery</hi> by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> or of ſuch <hi>Presbyters</hi> as
were ordained either by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</hi>
or by a power from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or from ſuch
who in that power received from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> did

ſuch a <hi>power,</hi> and accompanying ſuch a <hi>power:</hi>
Now this preſent <hi>Presbytery</hi> can neither make it ſelf
appear to be ſo purely <hi>ordained,</hi> nor have they the
<hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Congregational power</hi> ſo preceding or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
ſuch an <hi>Ordination;</hi> nor is that act of
<hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> by which their <hi>preſent Presbyters</hi>
ſtand Miniſters, a meer ſigne of ſetting apart, or
meerly ſignificative, but an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> for <hi>gifts</hi> to be
conferred: under the <hi>Law,</hi> it was an empty and
bare Rite; but under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be ſuch an empty Rite; <hi>Goſpel</hi>-ſignes being but
<hi>few, full,</hi> and <hi>miniſterial</hi> to the <hi>Spirit;</hi> not meerly <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificatively-viſible,</hi>
as the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Rites</hi> under
the <hi>Law</hi> were. So as all being thus queſtionable
ſtill in this <hi>preſent Presbytery;</hi> how can they ſo <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolically</hi>
chalenge ſuch a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> their preſent
<hi>conſtitutions</hi> being <hi>mixt, queſtionable, fallible,</hi> not one
and the ſame with that <hi>primitive, pure, certain conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>practices?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas it appears in their Scripture-proofs,
that both in <hi>Jeruſalem, Epheſus, Crete,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Preby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
and <hi>Elders</hi> did conſtitute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and were moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with, and adviſed; and therefore they aſſume
the ſame power, and ſo force out rather then prove
out their frame of their preſent <hi>Presbytery</hi> from ſuch
<hi>practices:</hi> I deſire the Brethren to tell us whether
the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was then wholly in <hi>Scripture</hi> or
<hi>writing,</hi> but partly in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> or <hi>teaching:</hi>
and therefore the <hi>Elderſhip</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> then
were ſo <hi>gifted,</hi> as to <hi>direct, conſtitute, adviſe;</hi> and from
the <hi>miniſtration</hi> of <hi>gifts</hi> in the <hi>Elderſhip,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,

or <hi>writing;</hi> which <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>written Word</hi> is now in
the place of that <hi>infallible Primitive Elderſhip:</hi> and
therefore for any Presbytery or Elderſhip to aſſume
now ſuch a power as the firſt did, they do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without warrant ſubſtitute themſelves to ſuch
a <hi>Presbytery</hi> or <hi>Elderſhip</hi> which ſtood by another <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing</hi>
or <hi>ſpirit</hi> of gifts then themſelves do; but
they ſit down in the <hi>throne</hi> with the very <hi>Scripture</hi> or
<hi>written Word</hi> of God, caſting a <hi>ſhadow</hi> upon the <hi>glory</hi>
and <hi>infallibility</hi> of that Word, by that <hi>preſent autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
and <hi>power</hi> which they now chalenge in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of that Word in their <hi>Presbytery,</hi> becauſe
by ſuch a <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> power as <hi>Divine Right</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
them, they having not a ſure and infallible
Spirit for Church-cenſures, or the execution of ſuch
a power, may put forth a certain, ſure executive
power, by an uncertain, unſure, and fallible ſpirit.
And ſo how proportionable a power of Divine
Right, is with a ſpirit not purely Divine; and how
proportionable a power of Church-cenſures acted
by a gift not purely the Spirit's, but rather the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
and Schools; and to joyn ſuch an Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

according to the preſent corrupt conſtitution both
of Miniſters, and Elders, and People of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
cannot yeeld a Divine Right to a Preſbytery
ſo conſtituted; and therefore they are not to be

            <p>The State is to enjoy their liberty in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

enjoy the Presbytery at this day, having no Civil

            <p>And the other diſſenting Brethren may enjoy
their Divine Right too, being as fully perſwaded

         </div>
         <div type="principles">
            <head>Principles againſt the Divine Right
of their preſent Presbytery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from the Reaſons.</head>
            <p>1. THey are no ſuch Presbyters of Jeſus Chriſt as
the firſt were, becauſe ordained by an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
power of Biſhops; nor were Biſhops true
Presbyters, nor thoſe who joyned with them in
their Ordination who were made by them, nor is
there any ſucceſſion of Ordination, but it implies
both a Perpetuall Viſible Church, and a true
Church Miniſtery and Ordinances under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
which are all to be proved by them.</p>
            <p>2. If there were any ſuch true Church inviſible
under Antichriſt, to which they ſucceed in their
Miniſtery, then it muſt appeare that they ſucceed
that very inviſible Church, and that that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Church had a true Miniſtery or Presbytery
in it; for men may be Saints, or good men, yet not
good Presbyters, or Miniſterially ſent.</p>
            <p>3. As they now in their practice will not account
any for true Presbyters but ſuch who can prove to
them their perſonall Ordination from them, ſo we
demand of theſe Presbyters an account of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:159635:11"/>
ſucceſſion accordingly, which perſonall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
if it be falſe and interrupted anywhere in
the Line, muſt needs be all falſe, from ſuch a point
where the firſt interruption was made.</p>
            <p>4. Though Chriſts promiſe is enough to ground
a perpetuity of Church and Chriſts preſence, yet
not of his promiſe made good to ſuch particular
men, or to their pretended ſucceſſion.</p>
            <p>5. They that challenge a Divine Right to the
power they act by, muſt act by a gift as divine and
infallible as their right and power, and thus did the
primitive Presbyters and Elders; therefore the gift
now being but mixt, their right or power is but mixt
accordingly, and not Divine.</p>
            <p>6. They who were Elders or Presbyters in the
firſt Churches, as <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. were gifted by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which taught the very infallible Word which is
now written or Scripture, and ſo they then did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute,
adviſe, counſell in the place of this written
Word; and all Scripture Formes and Inſtitutions
were then in the gift, and perſons; but no ſuch
thing can be ſaid of any Elderſhip or Presbytery of
men now.</p>
            <p>7. They who ſet up an Elderſhip or Presbytery
now of Divine Right, to conſtitute, ordain, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
&amp;c. doe joyn to the Word written, or infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Scripture, a Power leſſe infallibly gifted, who by
ſuch a Divine Right and Power pretended, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll
the Word of Truth, by Interpretations of
that word leſſe then truth, which is not conſiſtent
with the glory of the Word.</p>
            <p>8. There is no Elderſhip or Presbytery in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:159635:11"/>
but either the Churches Act did precede it,
act it, or accompany it, by precept or practice,
which makes the Divine Right of the Presbytery
queſtionable, uncertaine, unſafe, becauſe of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Scripture, and precept.</p>
            <p>9. The Elderſhip and Presbytery which are
brought for inſtances are queſtionable; firſt for the
Perſons, who were not ſuch very Presbyters as they
would imply, but Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, &amp;c. or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
ordained, either by Apoſtles, or Church, or
otherwiſe gifted by ſpeciall unction, or elſe an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip
of eminency not of Office.</p>
            <p>10. They hold this Divine Right is in the firſt
ſubject in the Congregationall Presbytery, and yet
they ſet up a Claſſicall, Provinciall, Nationall Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
to compleat and controll this of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall;
and how this their Divine Right can
be ſubjected thus to a right leſſe Divine, is unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and unſcripturall to imagine.</p>
            <p>11. Suppoſe ſuch a power as a Nationall Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
collected from all parts of the Kingdome, every
Congregation having an Intereſt, or part there, and
this Presbytery ſo Nationall and Collective infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by a Divine Right, for judging ſins, &amp;c. ſhall
not this Nationall Presbytery take cognizance of
States, if ſinning, Eccleſiaſtically as well as others?
and if ſo, what proceeding, what cenſures will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from ſuch a body as univerſall as the body of
that State, &amp; of as much intereſt in the Kingdom as
they, &amp; of more intereſt, by how much more Divine

of no Divine Right, Aſſembly of a Divine Right,
and the Diſſenting Brethren of another Divine Right;
is not the way this, to let the Parliament have their
Liberty of Conſcience, to ſettle no Divine Right, by
a Power; and the Aſſembly to uſe their Liberty in a
Divine Right, with all that will peaceably joyn with
them in the Kingdome under that Power, and not to
trouble the Magiſtrate further; and the other Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
as peaceably to enjoy their other Divine Right,
as the Brethren of the Presbyteriall way theirs, and
all alike under the ſame Civill Power, and neither
of them with it, and all other Reformed Kingdoms,
in unity of the ſpirit, and love, to one another?</p>

               <p>THe Elderſhip, and Presbytery in the Primitive
Churches had a ſpirit anointing them to ſuch
Adminiſtrations; but now as the anointing is not ſo,
nor is the Office pure, peculiar, and diſtinct; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:159635:12"/>
and Parliament have gifts as ſpirituall as
there are any now in the pretended Presbytery, and
may therefore as well put forth a Power in their
Churches or Congregations, as they, unleſſe their

               <p>The Magiſtrate is unqueſtionably a Power of
God, and the preſent Presbyterie are Officers que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable
in their Offices, Gifts, &amp;c. therefore the

               <p>They that preſſe the Covenant for Vniformity
ſo penally as they doe, make it a ſnare of compulſion,
