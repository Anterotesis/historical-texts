            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is a wonder to ſee how <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate over <hi>Reaſon</hi> in Mankind; Nothing is done, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid, without ſome tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of either, or both. Even common Occurrences are uſually related as Men would have them to be, rather then as they are. <hi>Plain-dealing</hi> is almoſt fled: And and all things now a days, whether Private or Publick, Sacred or
<pb facs="tcp:108985:5"/>
Prophane, are according to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Inclinations, without regard to Truth promiſcuouſly made the Subject of a <hi>Satyr</hi> or <hi>Panegirick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An obvious example of this we have in the ſeveral Accounts given of the Tryal, Declaration, Demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and Death of the late Lord <hi>Stafford;</hi> concerning whoſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, though acted for the moſt part in the face of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet there have flown about in a manner as many, and thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory <hi>Stories,</hi> as there are <hi>Relaters</hi>; and ſuch as know <hi>leaſt,</hi> commonly talk <hi>moſt,</hi> to compleat the Error.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Printed Tryal ſet forth by Authority is no wiſe liable to theſe groſs miſtakes; But it hath ſwelled in the Preſs, by forms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ſo vaſt a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, that few can ſpare either
<pb facs="tcp:108985:5"/>
money to buy it, or time to read it. Beſides, it is in a manner ſilent of matters chiefly deſigned for the Subject of this Treatiſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> My Lords Comportment, Declaration, Devotion, Laſt Speech, and other Occurrences, which happened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively from the time of his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, to his final End.</p>
            <p>Having therefore attained to a moſt exact and certain knowledge of theſe particulars, I ſhall for the ſatisfaction of the curious, and manifeſtation of Truth, give (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an abſtract of the whole Tryal, and ſome occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces concerning it) a plain and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere relation of what I know, and can by unqueſtionable Evidence juſtifie to be true. And herein I ſhall alſo totally abſtain from any the leaſt moralizing upon tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whereby to <hi>foreſtal</hi> the

                     <hi>Smith</hi> in his <hi>Depoſition</hi> gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, <hi>That being as yet a</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>but troubled, it ſeems, with ſome doubts in matters of</hi> Religion; He applyed himſelf for ſatisfaction to certain <hi>Prieſts</hi> in <hi>France</hi>; They to ſettle his mind told him, <hi>They would ſhortly bring in their Religion into</hi> England, <hi>Right or Wrong.</hi> (a notable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to convince a well-meaning <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant.</hi>) But neither this (as you may well think,) nor all the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> could ſay, or do, would prevail with him; ſo that he lived and ſtudied with them ſeveral years (a likely ſtory,) remaining ſtill a profeſſed <hi>Protestant.</hi> At length the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> deſponding (as well they might) of their own abilities, herein, ſent him to

be Converted by <hi>Cardinal Grimaldi,</hi> and he it was did the Feat, which none of the <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Jeſuits</hi> could compaſs. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> (to remove all Scruples from the tender Conſcience of his new Convert; and further to convince his Judgment in the truth of his <hi>Religion,</hi>) entertain'd him one day with this Learned and Pious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>(viz) That he had great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, the</hi> Popiſh Religion <hi>would prevail in</hi> England, <hi>and that there was but one in the way, and that to accompliſh their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, they muſt take him out of the way.</hi> Thus the young Man being now well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his Faith; was made a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and ſent into <hi>England</hi> with Inſtructions to teach his Countrey-men; <hi>They were not obliged to obey their King; and that to Murder him was a Meritorious Act.</hi> But the misfortune was, that arriving in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> he quite miſtook his Errand. And though he continu'd firm in the belief of the <hi>Popiſh Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> yet made it his whole buſineſs to root out the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> (the <hi>Popes</hi> chief <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi>) and diſſwade <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> from ſending Moneys to <hi>Colledges</hi> beyond Seas.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Oates</hi> likewiſe relates, How that whilſt he was Chaplain to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> attempted the utmoſt of their skill, to perſwade him out of his <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> by telling him, <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>was upon it's laſt Legs.</hi> Surely the <hi>Priests</hi> took him to be either a notorious Fool or Knave, for otherwiſe they might doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have devis'd ſome more plauſible and leſs dangerous Argument to convert a <hi>Proteſtant Miniſter</hi>; Yet he feigned to be convinced by their reaſons, and was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon preſently entertain'd by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> (the ſottiſh careleſs <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>) who on a ſuddain intruſted this <hi>Neophite</hi> with all their concerns, made him privy to all their moſt <hi>Damnable-Intrigues</hi>; And in ſhort

                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer: To the firſt,</hi> If what the <hi>Managers</hi> alledge be true, then is <hi>Dugdale</hi> here alſo proved <hi>Perjur'd</hi> by the <hi>Managers</hi> themſelves; For he expreſly Swore at the ſaid Tryal of Sir <hi>George Wakeman, That Mr.</hi> Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge <hi>both heard and anſwer'd him.</hi> Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>He heard nothing of the News before.

Room, but could not ſay they heard, muſt leſs anſwered, to the diſcourſe of <hi>Dugdale</hi>; which is the chief matter of <hi>Perjury</hi> here charged upon him.

To the fourth,</hi> Though <hi>Morral</hi> was Poor, yet it doth not appear but that he was ſo honeſt, as not to be <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned</hi> to <hi>Perjury</hi> by <hi>Dugdale</hi>; And therefore his clear and poſitive <hi>Evidence</hi> in this matter ought to ſtand good.

Are they not rather the Scum and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of the Nation? Why muſt credit be denyed to <hi>Beggers</hi> or <hi>Knaves,</hi> when they accuſe their <hi>Co-equals</hi> in probable

Aſſociate to the Kings Evidence. In fine, he hath ſaid ſo much both for himſelf and <hi>Dugdale,</hi> the <hi>Papists</hi> know not what, or how to ſay more.</p>

                  <p>To obviate this Exception, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers</hi> brought in two Siſters, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Anne Elder</hi>; Theſe Siſters depos'd, That <hi>Dugdale</hi> coming one day to their Houſe with ſeveral Bundles of Papers in his Pockets and Breeches, deſir'd them to Burn them; ſaying, the Times were troubleſome, and he being to Travel to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108985:43"/>
divers places, if he were taken, People would think him a Plotter, having all thoſe Papers about him; That hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Burnt all the Papers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one Book, concerning which <hi>Anne</hi> ask'd <hi>Dugdale</hi> whether or no that alſo ſhould be Burnt? He anſwered no, lay that by, it may do good ſeven years hence; <hi>There is no Treaſon in it; Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abeth</hi> reply'd, Is there any thing of Treaſon in the others? He ſaid, <hi>Do you think there is?

                     <hi>To the anſwer therefore given by</hi> Dr. Oates, <hi>the</hi> Papiſts <hi>reply: Poverty</hi> is an Objection againſt <hi>Honeſty</hi> in a perſon addicted (as <hi>Oates</hi> was) to Idlenes, Vice, and <hi>Debauchery</hi>; And though a man may be Poor and Honeſt too, yet the ſame man, at the ſame time, and in the ſame Circumſtances <hi>Oates</hi> pretends to have been in, could never be <hi>Poor</hi> and a <hi>Plotter</hi> too: Could he be privy to all the Grand <hi>Commiſſions</hi>? Could he be employed in all the deep and Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Conſults</hi>? Could he have at his mercy the Lives and Fortunes of all the Chief <hi>Conſpirators</hi>?

Could this man nevertheleſs <hi>Starve</hi> in a manner for <hi>Bread</hi>? Could he Beg for an Alms at the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Doors?

This is ſuch a <hi>Paradox</hi> as none in their Senſes will ever believe.

To the ſecond, Oates</hi> Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon Oath he heard ſuch words, and circumſtanced them with ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of Time and Place, as plainly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108985:47"/>
denote he intended a full and home Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt the <hi>Queen.</hi> And gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his Evidence was not poſitive, yet the matter was of ſuch dangerous conſequence, as ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, eſpecially, at a time when he was upon his Oath, to ſpeak all he knew, and when he pretended by Diſcoveries to Save the <hi>Life of the King. To the third,</hi> Though <hi>Oates</hi> (left to himſelf) be very Stupid; yet he could not be ſo Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant us not to know, that a <hi>Queen</hi> deſigning to <hi>Murder the King her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> is guilty of <hi>Treaſon</hi>; And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther She was liable to a Tryal or no. <hi>Oates</hi> was guilty of <hi>Perjury</hi>; In that being Commanded and Encouraged by the Lords to make an entire Diſcovery of all he knew againſt any <hi>Perſon</hi> of what <hi>Degree</hi> or <hi>Quality ſoever</hi>; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly Swore, <hi>He had no more to Accuſe in</hi> England. Indeed the Tranſcendent Luſtre of the <hi>Queens Vertue, Innocence and Endeared Affection to His Majeſty,</hi> leaves no <hi>place for Calumny to fix upon.</hi> And the bare Charge of ſo ſoul a Crime, upon ſo Renowned a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is of it ſelf Independent of other Contradictions, a more then ſufficient Conviction of <hi>Oates</hi>'s <hi>Perjury.</hi>

                     <hi>To which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer: To the firſt,</hi> It is not improbable, but very likely, that <hi>Turbervil</hi> as yet not fully reſolved, to make Ship-wrack of his Conſcience and Honeſty, did often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, <hi>He knew nothing of the Plot</hi>; And if the poſitive atteſtation of two credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witneſſes may be admitted for good Evidence; It is not bare probability, but juſt and ſolid proof that he did ſo; And by conſequence, his preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries ought not to be regarded, otherwiſe then as the New and Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inventions of a <hi>Perjured</hi> Man. <hi>To the ſecond,</hi> The Teſtimony of <hi>Powel</hi> and <hi>Arnold,</hi> hath no manner of weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Lord's Evidence, but rather compleats the charge of <hi>Perjury</hi> againſt

                  </p>
                  <p>To qualify this Evidence, <hi>Thomas Mort</hi> was called, who depoſed,<note place="margin">Page 131.</note>
                     <q>That he being at <hi>Paris</hi> and deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England, Turbervil</hi> told him, his Brother the <hi>Monk,</hi> had introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him into the Favour of a Lord, by which means they might both of them have the convenience of paſſage in a <hi>Yacht,</hi> which ſtaid for my Lord at <hi>Diep.</hi> That hereupon they went
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108985:54"/>
to <hi>Diep,</hi> but finding no <hi>Yacht</hi> there, <hi>Turbervil</hi> told him, If they went to <hi>Calais,</hi> they might go over with my Lord from thence in the <hi>Yacht.</hi>
                     </q>
At laſt they lighted on a Fiſher-Boat at <hi>Diep,</hi> and ſo came over in it; But that this forementioned Lord was my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> or that he ever ſaw <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> in my Lords Lodgings, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at <hi>Paris,</hi> or elſe-where, he could not ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>UPon theſe Teſtimonies, the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers</hi> made this <hi>Obſervation, viz. The</hi> Prieſts <hi>had ſuch a tranſcendent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over my Lord, as might gain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance for any whom they pleaſed, not only into my Lords Houſe, but alſo into my Lords Heart, without the privity or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Servants. Now it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the atteſtation of</hi> Mort, <hi>that</hi> Turbervil, <hi>through his Brothers the</hi> Monk's <hi>means, was become my Lords Favourite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer</hi>: It is not proved, either that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had ſuch a tranſcendent Influence over my Lords <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> or that <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervil</hi> through their means, became a Favorite. <hi>Mort</hi> indeed tells us, <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervil</hi> told him, <hi>His Brother the</hi> Monk <hi>had Introduced him into the Favour of a Lord; And this Favour only, to come
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108985:54"/>
over with him in a</hi> Yacht. For the Truth of which alſo he had only <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervil</hi>'s word, and the thing it ſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver performed. Muſt we from hence infer, <hi>My Lord had given his Heart to the Prieſts,</hi> and they had Introduced <hi>Turbervil</hi> into it; A ſtrange Inference: But let it be granted, my Lord had a real Friendſhip and Kindneſs for the <hi>Monks</hi>; what then? How is it proved, they imployed their Intereſt with him, in Trayterous Deſigns? Why, <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Swears it. Thus one <hi>Forgery</hi> is made uſe of to ſupport another, and nothing but proofleſs Fictions to make all out: Yet to come more cloſe to the preſent Evidence. Had the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Introduced <hi>Turbervil</hi> into my Lords acquaintance and favour; this could not be done Inviſibly to the Servants; ſome body muſt needs ſee, and know, when they came in, and out; My Lord was then in Lodgings, and had none but two Servants about him; <hi>Turbervil</hi> never pretends either the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or he, made a ſecret of their viſits; Their acceſſes to my Lord (he ſaid) were very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, as the nature of the buſineſs, and pretended intimacy with my Lord, ſeem'd to require. The condition of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervil</hi> was alſo ſuch, as might well ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him deſirous of the Servants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and Friendſhip; eſpecially
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108985:55"/>
being then (as he ſaid) immediatly to go over in the <hi>Yacht</hi> with them, and to continue employed in my Lords De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Service at <hi>London.</hi> Now that a Man in theſe Circumſtances ſhould not know theſe Servants, nor be known, or ſo much as once ſeene by them; is Morally Impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>THirdly <hi>Turbervil</hi> Swears, That when he took leave of my Lord at <hi>Paris,</hi> to come for <hi>England,</hi> his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was troubled with the <hi>Gout</hi> in his Foot. Now my Lord proteſted in the preſence of all that knew him,<note place="margin">Page 108.</note> he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the <hi>Gout</hi> in all his life; his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants alſo who then lived with him, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Furneſs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> gave atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, They never knew him ſubject to that Infirmity; only ſeveral years ſince, he had been troubled with the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> which my Lord confeſſed, and the <hi>Earl of Stamford</hi> teſtified; made him ſometimes formerly (though never at <hi>Paris</hi>) walk with a Staff.</p>
                  <p>UPon theſe Teſtimonies, the <hi>Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> made no Obſervations.

of an Oath, and elude all proof of Perjury whatſoever: Mr. <hi>Turbervil</hi> Swears in down-right Terms, my <hi>Lord</hi> came over by the way of <hi>Calais</hi> in the Company of Count <hi>Gramount,</hi> without any addition, <hi>That he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſo.</hi> In which Oath he is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perjured; for he Swears as an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Truth, and without Reſtriction, what of it ſelf is an abſolute Lye, and what at beſt he could but Gueſs at, by report and hear-ſay.

            <p>SOon after my <hi>Lords Tryal,</hi> ſeveral of his Relations and Acquaintance, (ſome out of zeal againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and others out of kindneſs to my Lord,) were daily urgent with him to make Diſcoveries of all he knew, as the only remaining remedy whereby to ſave his Life, regain the Kings favour, and attract the applauſe of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My Lord always reply'd, <hi>He was moſt willing and ready out of a meer ſenſe of</hi> Duty <hi>and</hi> Conſcience (indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of any Temporal advantage to himſelf) <hi>to diſcover with all imaginable Sincerity, the utmost of what he knew, either to the</hi> King <hi>or</hi> Houſe of Lords, <hi>when ever they required it.</hi> The <hi>Lords</hi> being informed hereof, Ordered his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before them the next day. When he came, and had audience granted, he made his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to this effect.
<q>That he thought it no crime in any Man to wiſh his Neighbours might be of the ſame <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:108985:88"/>
wherein he himſelf hoped to be ſaved; Nay to ſeek, and promote it by ſuch ways and means, as the Laws of God, and the Nation allow. That there had been at divers times, and on ſundry occaſions, endeavours uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and overtures made to obtain an <hi>Abrogation,</hi> or at leaſt a <hi>Mitigation</hi> of Severities againſt <hi>Catholicks</hi>: But this to be procured no otherwiſe then by Legal and <hi>Parliamentary</hi> means. That he himſelf went to <hi>Breda,</hi> whilſt the King was there, and propounded 100000 <hi>l.</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to take off the penal Laws. That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King came in, there was a Bill brought into the Houſe, in favour of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> but it was oppoſed by my Lord <hi>Chancellour Hide.</hi> That there had likewiſe been framed by the Lord <hi>Bristol</hi> and others (in order to the propoſing of them in <hi>Parliament</hi>) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral forms of <hi>Oaths,</hi> conceived in ſuch terms as might fully expreſs all <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the King: yet not entangle <hi>tender Conſciences</hi> with Clauſes and Proviſoes, diſagreeable to <hi>Faith,</hi> and no wiſe appertaining to <hi>Loyalty</hi>; but neither did this ſucceed. That afterwards he had offered ſome propoſals, as well to the Lord <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi> at his Houſe at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> as to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> concerning ſome
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108985:89"/>
lawful expedients, conducing to the good (as he thought) both of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> and the whole Nation. And alſo about <hi>Diſſolving</hi> the long <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi>; the ſubſtance of which he likewiſe communicated to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>He doubted not, but that there would come great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the King by it.</hi> Theſe he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched were the chief, and only <hi>Deſigns</hi> he ever had, or knew of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Catholicks,</hi> for promoting their <hi>Religion</hi>: Of more then theſe he proteſted before <hi>Almighty God</hi> and their <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> he was wholly Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</q>
But this <hi>Declaration</hi> not being ſatisfactory towards the detecting any <hi>Damnable Conſpiracy,</hi> the Lords thought fit without any further Examination to remand him back to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this occaſion, there run about both Town and Countrey an univerſal Rumour, That the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> had now made a full and perfect <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of the whole <hi>Plot</hi>; And that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> could not for the future have the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to deny it, after the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (though to ſave his Life) of ſo <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> a <hi>Perſon</hi>; But this proved a miſtake. And by the way it was very obſervable, <hi>My Lords Adverſaries</hi> took this falſe Alarm with ſo much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and joy, as ſufficiently denoted,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108985:89"/>

            <head>AN APPENDIX. Containing ſome Remarques upon the late TRYAL OF STEPHEN COLLEDGE, In Relation to the Chief Witneſſes againſt my Lord Stafford: Here annexed for the more Ample Satisfaction of the Reader in that Particular.</head>
            <p>HAving in ſome meaſure performed what I purpoſed, and promiſed in the front of this <hi>Treatiſe</hi>; I might well have here put a ſtop to my Pen, had not an extraordinary Accident, raiſed new matter of Reflections upon the <hi>King's Evidence</hi> in point of <hi>Credit,</hi> and ſeemed to call me to a ſhort Survey of it, in the cloſe of my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Judgments</hi> of the <hi>Almighty</hi> are incomprehenſible; And St. <hi>Paul</hi> had good reaſon to Cry out, as it were in an Extaſy, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11.33.</note> 
               <hi>How unſearchable are his Judgments, and his ways paſt finding out</hi>; Who could
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:108985:113"/>
ever have imagined, That the three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and main <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt my <hi>Lord Stafford</hi> at his <hi>Tryal,</hi> ſhould all convene together, at another of a quite contrary ſtamp; And this is in ſo fatal a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, as to confound, and deſtroy by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>Perjury</hi> each others <hi>Teſtimony</hi>? My Lord (as you have ſeen) endeavour'd to ſhew the <hi>Infamy</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes:</hi> The <hi>Contradictions</hi> in their <hi>Evidence</hi>: The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherence</hi> of parts: And <hi>Incredibility</hi> of <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> throughout the whole <hi>Charge.</hi> To make out which he alledged many preſſing Arguments, and produc'd many <hi>Subſtantial Witneſſes,</hi> both <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in his behalf: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeem'd wanting, ſave only his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries themſelves, againſt themſelves,</hi> to compleat his <hi>Evidence.</hi> And here it is the <hi>Divine Goodneſs</hi> (ſay the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) who is the <hi>Defender of Innocence,</hi> and <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Truth,</hi> hath wonderfully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted what manner of <hi>Men,</hi> my <hi>Lord's Accuſers</hi> were, and what <hi>credit</hi> ought to be given them, Even by the proper <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of their own <hi>Mouths</hi>; Herein alſo fulfilling in ſome ſort, what my <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf (Prophetically) foretold in his laſt <hi>Speech (viz) I have a great confidence that it will pleaſe Almighty God; And that he will in a ſhort time bring Truth to Light. Then all the World will ſee and know, what Injury they</hi> (Oates, Dugdale, <hi>and</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervil) have done me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:108985:113"/>TO give a brief account of this affair, There are few who have not heard of the late <hi>Tryal</hi> of <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the <hi>Proteſtant Joyner</hi> (a man ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry active in the Death of my <hi>Lord Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and a zealous defender of <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales Honeſty</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is not my intent here, to <hi>Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize Colledges</hi> whole <hi>Tryal</hi>; Nor to give my Cenſure or Verdict upon it, But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inform the <hi>Reader</hi> of ſome Paſſages which chiefly relate to the main <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> againſt my <hi>Lord Stafford:</hi> And which are now become the Subject of Surpriſe, and Aſtoniſhment to all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Perſons.</p>
            <p>Pleaſe then to note, That <hi>Stephen Dugdale,</hi> and <hi>Edward Turbervil,</hi> (two of the Principal <hi>Witneſſes</hi> upon whoſe <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi> my <hi>Lord</hi> was <hi>Found Guilty,</hi>) and <hi>John Smith,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Smith</hi> (who at my <hi>Lords Tryal</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the only plauſible <hi>Deponent,</hi> as to the <hi>Plot in General</hi>) gave reſpective <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> againſt this <hi>Colledge</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as followeth.</p>

               <hi>A little before the Witneſſes were Sworn againſt</hi> Colledge <hi>at the</hi> Old Baily, <hi>I</hi> (Oates) <hi>met with Mr.</hi> Turbervil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>I was in a Coach; But ſeeing Mr.</hi> Turbervil; <hi>I ſtept out of the Coach, and ſpoke with him, For hearing that he was a Witneſs, I did ask him, whether he was a Witneſs or no againſt</hi> Colledge? <hi>Mr.</hi> Turbervil <hi>ſaid, He would
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108985:115"/>
break any ones head, that ſhould ſay ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; for he neither was a Witneſs; nor could give any Evidence againſt him So after he came from</hi> Oxon, <hi>I met with Mr</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Turbervil <hi>again; And hearing he had been there, I ask'd him, if he had Sworn any thing againſt</hi> Colledge? <hi>He ſaid, Yes, He had been ſworn before the Grand Jury. Said I, Did not you tell me ſo and ſo? Why (ſaid he) the Proteſtant Citizens have deſerted us; And God Damn him, He would not ſtarve. Theſe very words he ſeveral times repeated; But when I ask'd him, what he had ſworn? he ſaid, I am not bound to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Peoples curioſities.</hi> Upon the words of a Prieſt <hi>ſaid</hi> Oates) what I ſay is true; as I am a Miniſter, I ſpeak it ſincerely; In the preſence of God, this Gentleman did ſay theſe words to me; <hi>Which made me affraid of the man, And I went my ways, and never ſpoke with him afterwards, nor durſt I; For I thought,</hi> He that would Swear and Curſe, after that rate, was not fit to be talked with.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to all which, <hi>Turbervil</hi> Swore, <hi>That he met Dr.</hi> Oates <hi>juſt at his Lodgings, And the Dr. alighted out of his Coach, and ſpoke to him, and invited him to come to his old Friends. For he told him, They had ſome Jealouſie that he was not true to them; and he farther told him, If he would come to the</hi> King's-Head-Club, <hi>he ſhould be received with a great deal of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108985:116"/>
kindneſs But never afterwards (ſaid</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervil) <hi>did I ſpeak with the Dr. a tittle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any Evidence; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon my Oath (added he) I did not; And truly I always looked upon Dr.</hi> Oates, as a very Ill man, <hi>and never would converſe much with him.</hi>

            <p>AGainſt <hi>Smith, Oates</hi> gave this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,<note place="margin">Page 49</note> 
               <hi>viz To my knowledge Mr.</hi> Colledge <hi>and Mr.</hi> Smith <hi>had ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking words past betwixt them at</hi> Rich.

            <p>The whole ſubſtance of this atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Smith</hi> abſolutely forſwore; ſaying, <hi>Not one word of this is true, upon my Oath.

Turbervil and Smith</hi> againſt Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi> From which fatal manner of ſelf-condemning and <hi>Perjuring each other</hi>; The <hi>Papiſts</hi> (with two good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) draw theſe deductions.</p>
            <p>Either <hi>Oates</hi> atteſting theſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aforenamed Witneſſes, <hi>In the word of a Prieſt; As he was a Miniſter of the Goſpel, Sincerely; In the preſence of God and Man,</hi> &amp;c.
