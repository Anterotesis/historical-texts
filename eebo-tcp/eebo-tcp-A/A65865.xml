            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O My dear and tenderly beloved Friends, Brethren, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, from the greatest to the least in my Fathers family, who are raised up by the power of an endless life, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the word of truth and life into a living faith and confidence in him who is our Rock and Refuge in all tryals, afflictions, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings which we are exposed to, and undergo for the testimony of Righteousness and a good Conscience; unto you, even unto you who are partakers of this heavenly Calling, and whose hearts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly are set with a holy Resolution for the glory and honour of our God therein, is my heart filled with love unutterable, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from the fresh Springs of Life and Consolation made manifest from a living experience of the effectual power and work of God which hath given access into a heavenly habitation and Sanctuary wherein his presence is enjoyed, in which the fulness of Consolation and Joy resideth for the Righteous, and all such as wait upon the Lord our God in his own e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Crowned his own seed with glory, victory, and tryumph thorow sufferings and tribulations, (which glory and victory many in their own particulars are partakers of) so he will glorifie and renown his name and seed thorow those tryals and sufferings, which yet remain to be fulfilled amongst his faithful witnessess, servants, and people who are called, and chosen, and faithful, being endued with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nature, and properties of his Elect seed in which his soul delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and with whom the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper, and which shall out live the enmity, and Reign over its Adversaries and Oppressors, though they (for a time) be permitted to appear with a high hand, and the wicked so highly to lift their horns up against the seed of the Righteous; and to attempt the rooting out of the faithful from amongst men; yet we have no cause (in any of these things) to distrust the Lord, or to be weakened in our confidence which he hath raised up in us; for he is with us who is mighty to save, and his care, mercy, and tenderness is felt towards all that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear him, and obey his voice; and of this I am a living witness, who from time to time upon the weighty consideration, and feeling of the goodness of our God, and largeness of his love to his people, have been and am filled with the sense of his presence and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able glory over all that which would oppress or hurt, which cannot enter into the holy Mountain, and in that glory and life received, is my heart and bowels of tender love enlarged towards all the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart, who are come of a holy right seed, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33458:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>Oh my dear Friends both in the City of <hi>London, Bristol, Hartford, Reading, Colchester,</hi> and elsewhere in this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> who for the tryal and exercise of your faith and patience thorow many tribulations and sufferings, and who more particularly at this day and time are under a deep tryal and exercise, [the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and its Instruments being permitted to afflict you, and to break your harmless and innocent Meetings, and to hurry many of you into holes and prisons,] and yet you retain so much tenderness in your spirits towards God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and respect to his testimony and cause, that you dare not deny him, but must confess him and his truth and righteous testimony and worship before men, and for that cause have given your backs to the smiters, and exposed your selves to undergo the deep sufferings or penalties, that men may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to inflict upon you; and even to give up your lives for a prey, rather then the name of the Lord should be dishonoured by you; Oh dear hearts hold fast your confidence and resolution in the name and power of the everlasting Jehovah, in whom is your strength and safety, and keep within, and be retired in your minds when temptations or any discouragements would enter you to weaken any of your faith, for in the light and power of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> a safe habitation is known, out of, and above all the troubles of the world, and the persecutions that we meet with in it, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pavilion of the Almighty, and hiding places of the Lord, the oppressed that wait upon him find a Refuge in the time of trouble, and therein do see over all the blackness and darkness which hath covered the Earth, in which the enmity worketh against the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous seed, and do know a sweet repose in their deepest sufferings and tryals, and that Well-Spring of life is set open in them, which makes all easie to them, and sanctifies every state and condition of what tryal or exercise soever they meet with for the name of God or his testimony; and herein joy, and peace, and everlasting glory and triumph is seen and felt by all the faithful and sincere in heart over all their oppressors.</p>
            <p>And that all you sincere hearted and tender Friends, whose eyes are turned towards your maker, and whose faces are set Sion-ward may be so retire in your minds to the principle of truth, and so watchful in the light of the Lord, and to enjoy a peaceable habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and sanctuary in him in all your sufferings, for this hath my

over the heads of all the adversaries and oppressers of the righteous seed; and that testimony which we have stood up for in this Nation shall never be extinguished, but be had in everlasting remembrance; and this hath the Lord sealed and confirmed unto my soul, so as its neither imprisonment, nor exilement, nor death it self that I look out at; but as to what the Lord may suffer in these things I commit to him, as knowing a life in that faith that sees to the end of these things, and beyond the wrath of man and enmity of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which so highly is at work in our dayes, as had not the Lord in a great measure put a limit and restraint thereto it would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the taking away many of our lives, not onely by that covertly way of hard imprisonment, and lingering martyrdome therein, but also by speedy execution under pretence and colour of legal proceeding or justice (so called) on the persecutors part<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And our God is the same that ever he was to his own, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises fail not, but are now a fulfilling: And therefore O thou seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and off-spring of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom God hath chosen, fear thou not, nor be dismaid, for I am with thee, saith the Lord; I will strengthen thee, and help, and uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness, and all they that are insenced against thee, and they that strive with thee shall be ashamed and confounded, and shall be as nothing yea, they shall perish that war against thee: fear not thou worm <hi>Jacob</hi>; but arise in the power of the holy one; for to thee it is given to thresh the mountains, with thy sharp thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instrument, and to beat them small, and to make the hills as chaff, and thou shalt rejoyce in the Lord; and those that come of thee sha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
