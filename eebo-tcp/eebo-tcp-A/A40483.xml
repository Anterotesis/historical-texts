            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Sir</hi> JOHN FRIEND'<hi>s Paper.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>KNowing that I muſt immediately give Account to God of all my Actions, and that I ought to be eſpecially careful of what I ſay in theſe Laſt Hours, I do ſolemnly profeſs, That what I here deliver is from my very Soul, with all the Heartineſs and Sincerity of a Dying Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The Cauſe I am brought hither to ſuffer for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do firmly believe to be the Cauſe of God and true Religion, and to the beſt and utmoſt of my Knowledge and Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, agreeable to the Laws of the Land, which <hi>I</hi> have evermore heard do require a firm Duty and Allegiance to our Sovereign; and that as no Foreign, ſo neither any Domeſtick Power can alienate our Allegiance. For it is altogether new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible to me, that the King's Subjects can depoſe and dethrone him on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or conſtitute any that have not an immediate Right in his place. We ought, I think, not to do this; and ſurely when it is done, to aſſiſt him in the Recovery of his Right, is juſtifiable, and our Duty. And however things may ſeem at preſent, <hi>I</hi> do <hi>believe,</hi> I am ſure I heartily <hi>pray,</hi> That he ſhall be one day Reſtored to his Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Throne and Dominions.</p>
               <p>As for any ſudden Deſcent of his Majeſty upon theſe his Dominions, in order to the Recovery of them, I declare I had no certain knowledge of it, nor can I tell what grounds there was to believe it, ſo little reaſon had I to be in a preſent Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it. I ſuppoſe it is not expected I ſhould here endeavour to clear my ſelf of the Aſſaſſination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was not the Thing alledg'd againſt me; however, it was mentioned, through what means I know not: As it was inſinuated to my diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I forgive ſuch as were therein inſtrumental: And I do alſo from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my Soul, freely forgive, and beg of God to do ſo too, ſuch as were any ways acceſſary towards the taking away my Life, which I really look upon to be their Misfortune more than mine.</p>
               <p>I profeſs my ſelf, and I thank God I am ſo, a Member of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> though, God knows, a moſt unworthy and unprofitable part of it; of that Church which ſuffers ſo much at preſent for a ſtrict adherence to Loyalty, the Laws, and Chriſtian Principles.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>For this I Suffer, and for this I Die.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Though I have a perfect Charity for People of all Profeſſions, and do heartily wiſh well and would endeavour ſo to do to all my Fellow Subjects, of what Perſuaſions ſoever. And indeed, I have met with a great deal of Uprightneſs and Sincerity among ome People of very different Opinions in Religious Matters.</p>
               <p>And I hope and deſire it may not be taken as an uncharitable Cenſure, or undue Reflection, that I objected to the Legality of Popiſh Evidence, being adviſed ſo to do for my better Security, upon the Foundation of a Statute-Law.</p>
               <p>Having own'd my ſelf a Member of the Church of <hi>England, I</hi> muſt take this Opportunity, and I do it for God's Glory, to apply my ſelf to you that are Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts of that Church, and of the ſame Faith and Principles with my ſelf: And I
<pb facs="tcp:42096:2"/>
beg of you for God's ſake, and the love of your Souls, to be very conſtant and ſerious in all Religious Offices, and holy Duties of Divine Worſhip and Service, which I have too much neglected, as I own to my great Sorrow: Let no Excuſe, no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, prevent or hinder you in theſe moſt neceſſary and ſerious Matters; and be, I beſeech you, very careful and circumſpect in all your Actions, Behaviour, and Converſation, as I earneſtly exhorted all that came to me.</p>
               <p>I have, I thank God, a great deal of Satisfaction in my preſent Sufferings, and have found it ſo ever ſince I have been under them: And bleſſed be God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increaſe upon me. And I do now lay down my Life with all Chearfulneſs and Reſignation, in ſure and certain Hope of a Reſurrection to Eternal Life, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; through whoſe Merits alone I hope for the Pardon of my Sins, and the Salvation of my Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo, O Lord, into thy Hand I commend my Spirit, for thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I do heartily and humbly beſeech Thee Almighty God, and my moſt Gracious Father, to forgive and bleſs this Sinful Nation; Deliver it from the Guilt of Rebellion, Blood, and Perjury, that is now on all ſides more than ever, and from all thoſe other <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
