            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received your Present, and if I thank you for it, 'tis purely out of respects to the hand that sent it; I mean a Book bearing this Title, <hi>A Conference about the next Succession to the Crown of</hi> England, pretended to be written by <hi>R.

'Tis a <hi>dangerous</hi> Book indeed, and without doubt is published and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and down to serve a <hi>Turn</hi> in these Ticklish times, when some Ambitious men have taken Pepper in the Nose, and to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged for their disappointments endeavour to make another strong Pass at our Government, and would sain hurl the world into Confusion.</p>
            <p>Since you have lodged the Knave with me, I'le take care that for me he shall not go abroad to do <hi>mischief.</hi> But yet I cannot answer your Commands, unless I give you some account both of the <hi>Author,</hi> and the <hi>Book.</hi>

Party too. You may take this Character, as I find it given (and very deservedly) by a Popish Priest then living. <q>This (saith he) is that same <hi>Parsons,</hi> whom Pope,<note rend="inter">
                     <hi>Id.</hi> p. 236.</note> Prince and Peer with all true English hearts have cause to hate. This is he of whom his own General repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he was more troubled with one English man, than with all the rest of his Society. This is he of whom Cardinal <hi>Alan</hi> held this opinion, that he was a man very violent, and of an unquiet Spirit, and of whom Mr. <hi>Blackwell</hi> (now his Darling) said, that his turbulent and lewd life would be a discredit to the Catholick Cause. In short, the general conceit of all that ever have throughly conversed with him, is this, that he is of a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, passionate, hot, cholerick, exorbitant working humour, busie headed, and full of Ambition, Envy, Pride, Rancour, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Revenge: Whereunto, through his latter Machiavilian Practices, may be added, that he is a most diabolical, unnatural, and barbarous butcherly fellow, unworthy the Name (nay, cursed be the hour wherein he had the Name) of a Priest, nay, of a Religious Person, nay, of a Temporal Lay-man, Jesuit, nay, of a Catholick, nay, of a Christian, nay, of a Humane Creature; but of a Beast or a Devil; a violater of all Laws; a contemner of all Authority; a stain of Humanity, an Impostume of all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, a corrupter of all Honesty, and a Monopoly of all mischief.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the <hi>man,</hi> Sir, whose Book you sent me; and had I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look'd into the Book, yet considering <hi>who</hi> and <hi>what</hi> the Author of it was, I could not but blush and be ashamed to think, that any in <hi>our</hi> days (especially Pretenders to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion) should be such <hi>Enemies</hi> to Truth, to Religion, and to Common Honesty, as to bring such a wicked mans Issue to light again, and to dress it and set it out afresh for a Tool. What good can the indifferent world conceive of them, who of all Principles, espouse the Principles of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> who are the <hi>worst</hi> of Papists; and of <hi>them,</hi> do especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Admire and Recommend to our reading the Writings of this <hi>Parsons,</hi> who was one of the <hi>worst</hi> of all Jesuites?</p>
            <p>As touching the <hi>Book</hi> it self, Sir, there are divers things which are worthy your observation, and which may be of good use to you, and to every man in these times who is a zealous, impartial, and honest-hearted Protestant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60244:4"/>First, That it is so full of Principles that are apparently false, pestilent, and scandalous, that in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days when it was first Printed, it did not only exasperate our English Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but did likewise give such offence to the very Popish Faction, that several of them wrote Books on purpose in confutation of this Counterfeit <hi>Doleman,</hi> so ashamed they were of it: Nay, <hi>Parsons</hi> himself finding his <hi>Party</hi> so offended, and <hi>himself</hi> so rated and condemned upon the coming out of this Book,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Quodlibet,</hi> p. 286.</note> though he was shameless enough, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured nevertheless to shift and wash his hands of it, as if he had not been the Author of it, though 'twas notorious that he was.</p>
            <p>Secondly, 'tis to be noted that in the fatal year 1648, when that blessed Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> the First was so barbarously Murdered, the several Articles brought in charge against him were all ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Principles taken out of this Jesuites Book; nay, a great part of the very <hi>Book it self</hi> (so much as served the turn of those cursed Regicides) was <hi>Reprinted</hi> under another counterfeit Title, viz. <hi>Several Speeches delivered at a Conference, concerning the power of Parliaments to proceed against their Kings for misgovernment.</hi> They were forced to be beholden to this Jesuite for Principles to defend that Unnatural War, and that Unjust Sentence: For could the Protestant Religion (which they pretended to maintain) have born them out, it is not credible; they would have brought upon themselves so much Infamy, by raising up a Jesuites Ghost to speak for them. The sending of that Book abroad, did clearly demonstrate what they and their designs were.</p>
            <p>And I would sain know, whether an unprejudiced man will not conclude, that there is some ugly design on foot now, when this very Book is brought upon the Stage <hi>again?</hi> For, you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, in the next place, that the Present you sent me, is the very <hi>same</hi> Book, now lately Printed the <hi>Third</hi> time; the very <hi>same</hi> Book, that was first intended to tear the Government into pieces, and to turn this Land into a field of Bloud: the <hi>same</hi> Book, that laid the foundations of the late Rebellion: the very <hi>same</hi> Book, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat served to bring the best of Kings to the Scaffold: the very <hi>same</hi> Book, that helped them to justifie that villanous and most horrid Fact. And what can we gather hence, but that some extraordinary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60244:4"/>
Intrigue is in hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which needeth the help of this old Jesuit again? There are so many Knaves in the world already, that men need not fetch Father <hi>Parsons</hi> from the dead, only for a shew: And the world is so abundantly stockt with Books, that <hi>Doleman</hi> would not have been Re-printed for nothing.</p>
            <p>For, be pleased to observe too, what the state of Affairs was then, in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when this Book was published first under that Title. A zealous and wise Protestant Monarch was then Reigning; but she being not likely to have any Issue, the discourses of men were (as they are now) about the <hi>Succession. James</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was the next Heir by Bloud, but his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not please the Jesuits.</p>
            <p>For this reason they laid their Noddles together, to defeat him of the Crown, if it were possible; and that matchless man at mischief, Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> wrote (among other Books) this, which he called by the name of <hi>Doleman:</hi> wherein he indeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade the World, <hi>that all Monarchies are de jure</hi> Elective, and that Proximity of Bloud was not sufficient to intitle any man to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> without the <hi>Peoples Choice, Approbation,</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> (which by reason of the Numbers, Interest, and Policy of the Papists <hi>then,</hi> he did hope would never be given to King <hi>James.</hi>) As the ground of all this, he had the confidence to place the Plenitude of power, and all Absolute Soveraignty in the hands of the People; so that (according to his Principle, owned in this <hi>Doleman</hi>) the Commonwealth may Lawfully and at their pleasure fore-close and hinder the next Heir, if on the account of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or in any other Respect, they judg him unfit to Succeed; nay, that they may, without sin, Depose and Destroy a Prince, though actually <hi>vested</hi> and <hi>possest</hi> of the Throne, if in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Government he answer not that Trust, which was reposed in him by his Lords and Masters, the People. In fine, He told the Queens Subjects, that the Descent and Disposal of the Crown did depend wholly upon their pleasure, and that they had an unlimited power at any time to determine upon this or that form of Government, and might alter it when they thought fit, and chuse whether they would have a King, or no, and turn the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy into an Aristocracy, or Democracy, as they saw occasion, and judged it best.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60244:5"/>By these Popular Principles, this Jesuit and the rest hoped to serve these Ends; either to prevent the Succession of the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> (which was the first and Grand design) or in case he should Succeed, to prepare a ready way to Ruine him, and indeed to ruine his Family too, and to subvert his Government, if they did not answer the expectations of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nor did they fail of their ends in <hi>every</hi> particular. For though King <hi>James</hi> came peaceably to the Crown, yet these Principles did work so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that they laid Barrels and Trains of Gunpowder under the Parliament House, and afterwards made stirs in the Parliament it self, and in Forty One raised a Bloudy and Unnatural Rebellion, and in the end changed the Government into a Republick, and caused the Monarch and the Monarchy to be cut off together. <hi>Haec Ithacus voluit</hi>; these were the natural effects of this Book, called <hi>Doleman,</hi> which some now have thought convenient and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for their Turns to set out again in a new and more polish'd Edition.</p>
            <p>These things being observed touching the Author, and of the Design in Printing and Reprinting of this Book, I cannot fancy my self to have paid you all those Respects which are due from me, till I take a few steps further, and shew you a little, first, what Use hath been made of this Book and these <hi>Dolemanian</hi> Principles of late; and then what those Reasons are on which these Principles are founded. For affairs are Uncertain now, as they were when these Principles came first into the world: The Book is admirably well Calculated for our Meridian (otherwise it might have lain still in the dark, and no more regarded than an Almanack out of date:) Methinks I see in it some of <hi>Lilly</hi>'s Prognosticks, or Hopes at least, of some change of weather: and therefore 'tis necessary, that to preserve our Peace and good Government, we look a little into the Nature and Strength of the aforesaid Principles.</p>
            <p>And the rather, because I see they are very Pleasant and Taking with the People; their bare Popularity, though they have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Sense, is enough to recommend them to the favour and kind embraces of the Vulgar, who love dearly to be medling with Government, and cannot but be Tickled at Heart when they are told, that they have a Soveraign Power in them which they did not dream of, that they can Make and Unmake Kings, that Crowns
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60244:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Scepters lie at their Worships feet, that Princes must make court to them for Succession, and that they can, if they will, bar them out, and come like the Tribunes of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> with an uncontroulable <hi>Veto.</hi> These are fine and delicate Doctrines, and beyond the Fawnings of some others, who tell us, to please us, that we have power to chuse all our Bishops; though I confess we may think it fitting, that we should have power in <hi>both</hi> points, as well as in <hi>one</hi>; and as the world goes, Kings and Bishops way well expect to fare <hi>alike.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in good earnest, Sir, I am grieved at Heart (and 'tis enough to raise the Indignation of every Honest man) to find, that so many among us do <hi>inconsiderately</hi> (not to say, maliciously) run al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon this Jesuits Principles, and that in <hi>these</hi> times, when we are all so afraid of Popery, that one would think we should be most especially afraid of Jesuitism. Yet if you please to give your self the trouble to peruse those seditious Pamphlets which have been published of late, you will find what I note to be true; that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they borrow large portions out of this most wicked Libel, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a most wicked Wretch, on purpose to <hi>ruine</hi> the interest of the Protestant Cause: Nay, that the Authors of them have so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly followed the Scope, the Tenents, the Arguments, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and the very Phrase (many times) that we may well believe they had old <hi>Doleman</hi> open before them as they were writing.</p>
            <p>I shall give you Proof and Instances of this by and by. In the mean while we may conclude, that these men were not so straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as to be Constrained to do this. For they might have been abundantly furnished with Anti-Monarchical and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican Principles out of other Authors, such as <note n="a" rend="inter">

                  </gap>,</hi> and some more of that Age, who were main good Friends to the Jesuits in this point. But because Fa. <hi>Parsons</hi> hath made great Improvements of those Principles which others had vended a little before, and because his great design was to bar all Succession to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> by Natural Descent and Inheritance, and to that end hath used all the most plausible Arguments; and because all this is serviceable to the Designs of some Now, who consider
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60244:6"/>
more what is Expedient than what is Just, therefore they do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly chuse to make this Author (though a Jesuit) their Guide, and do take all their Measures from this Libel, rather than others.</p>
            <p>How they will answer this to God, to their own Consciences, and to the sober World, I do not know; but that the Truth of what I say may be manifest, I shall instance in some of the Principal Pamphlets, which have been written of late.</p>
            <p>And I shall begin with that which hath made the greatest Noise, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>History of Succession,</hi> which the Author saith is <hi>Collected out of the Records, and the most Authentick Historians.</hi> But had he said, <hi>Collected out of Doleman,</hi> he had spoken a more Ingenuous Truth, than perhaps he hath told us in the whole Book besides. For, though he hath adorned his Margin with div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs Quotations out of Records and Authors, (which I suppose he consulted to conceal his Theft, or to put a fair Colour upon it at least) yet the Matter is taken out of that Authentick Historian, <hi>Doleman.</hi> However he came by the Fringe and the Lace, 'twas his Friend, honest Fa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> that furnish'd him with the Stuff.</p>
            <p>I do not intend to examine the Candour, the Sincerity, or the Logick of this Collector, because it is a thing besides my Purpose, and for the consideration of those things I refer you, Sir, to that Learned and Solid Answer called, <hi>The great Point of Succession dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed,</hi> &amp;c. and to that excellent Tract entituled, <hi>Religion and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty supporting each other.</hi> For my business is only to shew matter of Fact, that this Collector hath filch'd his Pamphlet out of that Jesuit, who to cheat the world gave himself the Surname of <hi>Doleman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this blessed History we are to consider, first, the Design; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Principles of the Author; And thirdly, the Examples he useth to serve his Ends.</p>
            <p>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Now the Design is to prove, that the Government of <hi>England</hi> is not a setled Hereditary Monarchy; that Succession is not Title enough to make the next Heir King, but that the Election of him ought to be before his Coronation; that the Succession is wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Controul of Parliament, and that they can limit it, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it to Conditions, and alter the Course of it as they please.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60244:6"/>Now, this is the very Sum of the First, and the sixth Chapter in <hi>Doleman,</hi> Part. 1. For in the first Chapter he tells us, <q>That Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to Government by nearness of Bloud is not by Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Divine, but only by Humane and Positive Laws of every particular Commonwealth, and consequently may up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n just cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be altered by the same, <hi>pag.</hi> 1.</q> And in the sixth Chapter he affirms, <q>That though Priority and Propinquity of Bloud in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, is greatly to be honoured, regarded, and preferred in all affairs of Dignity and Principality, yet are we not so absolutely and peremptorily bound thereunto always, but that upon just and urgent occasions that course may be altered and broken, <hi>pag.</hi> 104.</q> He founds Regal Power in Succession and Election both, <hi>pag.</hi> 105. And being to answer that Question, What interest a Prince hath by Secession alone to any Crown, before he be Crowned or Admitted by the Commonwealth? He saith, <q>That an Heir Apparent before his Coronation and Admission by the Realm, hath the <hi>same</hi> (and no more) <hi>interest</hi> to the Kingdom, which the King of <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Caesar</hi> hath to the <hi>German</hi> Empire after his Election and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be Crowned; and to use a more familiar Example to to Englishmen, as the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> hath to the Mayoralty, after he is chosen, and before he be admitted, or have taken his Oath. For as this man in rigour is not truly Mayor, nor hath his Jurisdiction before his Oath, and Admission, nor the other is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Emperour before he be Crowned, so is not an Heir Apparent truly King, though his Predecessor be dead, until he be Crowned and admitted by the Commonwealth, <hi>pag.</hi> 106. In fine; He is Positive, that Heirs Apparent are not true Kings, until their Coronation, how just soever their Title of Succession otherwise be, and so, that no Allegiance is due unto them before they be Crowned, <hi>pag.</hi> 108.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To make these things out, is the Grand Design of Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> and his Plagiary, the Author of this History of Succession. And though you well know, that all this is contrary to the Laws of our Realm, which recognize all Succession to this Crown to be by Inheritance, and allow of no <hi>Interregnum,</hi> but say, that the King never dieth, because the next Heir is actually King that very minute after the breath of his Predecessor is gone; yet you see, how closely this Collector hath followed the steps of <hi>Doleman,</hi> all our Laws to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60244:7"/>II. As touching this Collectors Principles. 1. He is clearly of opinion, <q>That the Commonwealth hath Power to <hi>change</hi> the direct order of Succession, for otherwise the Government would want power to defend it self, by making such alterations as the variety of Accidents in several Ages may make absolutely necessary, <hi>p.</hi> 15. That in Parliament a Supreme Uncontroulable Power is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Ibid.</hi> That a <hi>Nation</hi> (in excluding a Successor) <hi>is to be</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for executing Justice Summarily, and without the Tedious Formalities of Law, when the necessity of things requires haste, <hi>pag.</hi> 19. And that the People are bound in Conscience to <hi>obey</hi> (the Parliaments) <hi>Laws,</hi> and must not pretend to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were made upon just grounds, <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now such simple men as you and I, have ever thought, and do think still, that all Humane Power is subordinate to Gods, under the Correction of it, and Controulable by it: That Law-givers ought to take their measures according to the rules of natural Justice, and Equity; That m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns Laws do not oblige, if they be contrary to the Laws of God or Nature; That Parliaments have not that Power, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (another Jesuit) gives the Pope, to make Good Evil, and Evil Good; That common Honesty ought to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the whole world; That Necessity cannot be pretended to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie an Evil Action; that no Commonwealth hath a Sovereign Power over the Commands of God and Nature; and that divers Statutes and Acts have been judged <hi>ipso facto</hi> void, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need of Repealing, being contrary to Divine or Natural Laws.</p>
            <p>But you see, that this Collector is of another Faith, telling us, <q>That a Commonwealth can do any thing, what they please, without any Controul.</q> But the reason is, because he takes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parsons</hi> for his Great Apostle. For he, speaking of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths Power to Exclude a Successor, though contrary to the ordinary course of Law, saith, <q>That our Common Law must needs have further consideration than of the bare Propinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Bloud only, for that otherwise it would be a very imperfect Law, that hath not provided for accidents so weighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, as these are, for saving and conserving of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; <hi>Preface to Doleman, pag. penult.</hi>
               </q> These are the words which the Collector hath in a manner Transcribed and copied out.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60244:7"/>
Moreover the Jesuit tells us,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Though 'tis hard that the same men should be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Judges too.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth hath Authority to judge of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Cause (for putting back the Prince;) That God doth allow for a just and sufficient cause in this behalf, the only Will and and Judgment of the Weal Publick it self: And seeing that they only are to be Judges of this case, we are to presume, that what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine is Just and Lawful for the Time; and that they being Lords and Owners of the whole business, it is enough for every particular man to subject himself to that which his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth doth in this behalf, and to obey simply without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquisition, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 159, 160. <hi>part.</hi> 1.</q> Now do but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this passage in <hi>Doleman</hi> with that cited above out of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Succession, and judge whether this Jesuit was not that Collectors Guide.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another of the Collectors Principles is this, <q>That though Government is of Nature, and derived from God; because nothing is more Natural in man than the Desire of Society, and without Government Society would be intolerable; yet it cannot be proved from hence that the Government cannot be moulded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several Forms, agreeable to the Interest and dispositions of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations, and may not be varied from time to time, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion requires, by the mutual consent of the Governours, and of those who are Governed, <hi>pag.</hi> 16.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is right Father <hi>Parsons</hi> all over, and so exactly, that as I was comparing the Books, I was like to have <hi>mistaken Doleman</hi> for the History of Succession. For thus saith the Jesuit, <q>Albeit So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciability or Inclination to live together in company, man with man, be of Nature, and consequently also of God, that is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature; and though Government in like manner, and Jurisdiction of Magistrates (which doth follow necessarily upon this living together in company) be also <note n="*" rend="inter">
                     <hi>For without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there is nothing else to be hoped, but Horrour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,</hi> Doleman, Pa. 6. ca. 1. part. 1.</note> of Nature, yet the particular Form or manner of this or that Government, in this or that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, as to have many Governours, few, or one: or that they should have this or that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, more or less, for longer or shorter time,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60244:8"/>
or be taken by Succession or Election, themselves and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or next in Bloud, all these <hi>things</hi> (saith the Jesuit, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Collector) <hi>are not by Law</hi> either Natural or Divine, but they are ordained by particular positive Laws of every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; <hi>Doleman, part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 2, 3.</q> I have seen many an <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia Evangelica</hi>; but never shall I see a fairer <hi>Harmonia Politica</hi> than between these two Brethren in iniquity, <hi>Parsons</hi> and the Collector of the History of Succession.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Especially if we add <hi>another</hi> Principle of his, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is no matter of what Stock or Lineage a Successor to the Crown is, or whether next Heir or not, if he doth but pass for one that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth well, and is likely to make a good King. And to let us know his mind in this, he tells us a remarkable Story, which I beg of you, Sir, to observe, because it is word for word in <hi>Doleman.</hi>
               <q>I cannot (saith our Collector) forbear reciting the Speech, which Embassadours sent from the States of <hi>France,</hi> made to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> when they had solemnly rejected him (though he was Brother to <hi>Louys d' Outremes,</hi> and next H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir to the Crown) and had Elected <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> for <hi>their King.</hi> They told him, that every one knew that the Succession to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, and not to <hi>Hugh Capet.</hi> But yet (say they) the very same Laws which give you this right of Succession, do judg you also unworthy of the same; for that you have not hitherto indeavoured to frame your manners according to the Prescript of those Laws, nor according to the Usages and Customs of your Country, but rather have allyed your self with the <hi>German</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our old Enemies, and have loved their vile and base manners. Wherefore seeing you have forsaken the ancient virtue and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your Country, we have also forsaken and abandoned you, and have chosen <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> for our King, and put you back; and this without any scruple of Conscience at all, esteeming it better and more just to live under him, enjoying our ancient Laws, Customs, Priviledges, and Liberties, than under You, the Heir by bloud, in oppression, strange Customs and Cruelty. For as those who are to make a Voyage at Sea, do not much consider whether the Pilot be Owner of the Ship, but whether he be Skilful and Wary, so our care is to have a Prince to govern us gently and happily (which is the End for which Princes were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60244:8"/>
appointed) and for these ends we judge this man fitter to be our King. <hi>Hist. of Succession, pag.</hi> 15.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>mistake</hi> in this Story: for <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was <hi>Son</hi> to one <hi>Louys,</hi> and <hi>Vncle</hi> to another. However thus our Collector sets it down, and quotes <hi>Gerard</hi> for it, when he ought (but that he would not betray himself) to have quoted his Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> who relates the same Story in the same words, and directed him to <hi>Gerard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it not amiss (saith the Jesuit) to put down here some part of the Oration or Speech, which the Embassadors that were sent from the State of <hi>France</hi> unto <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> after their Election of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and <hi>Charles's</hi> Exclusion, did use un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in their names, which Speech <hi>Gerard</hi> doth recount in these words: Every man knoweth (Lord <hi>Charles</hi>) that the Succession of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and so on, to the very Similitude of the Pilot, which our Collector useth, being of the same mind with the Jesuit, who speaking of a Successor to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> saith, <q>I for my part do feel my self much of the <hi>French</hi> opinion before alledged, that so the Ship be well and happily guided, I esteem it not much important of what Race or Nation the Pilot be.</q>

               <q>That this <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> had that Surname given him when he was a Boy, for that he was wont to snatch away his Fellows <hi>Caps</hi> from their heads, whence he was termed <hi>Snatch-cap,</hi> which some did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret as an Abodement that he would also also snatch a Crown from the true Owners head in time, as afterwards it fell out.</q> But this our Collector would take no notice of, lest <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> should be lookt upon as an Usurper, as indeed he was, notwithstanding the Election and Approbation of the Realm.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is an avowed Principle in <hi>Doleman,</hi> that 'tis both sinful in an high degree, and against all Wisdom and Policy to suffer a Prince of a contrary Religion to come to the Crown; <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>And thus much our Collector insinuates, when he saith, He will not dispute how far the difference of Religion, which will also
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60244:9"/>
necessarily draw on a change of the Gocernment, doth justifie men in seeking to preserve the two dearest things on earth in an orderly and lawful way. <hi>Pag.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But he doth <hi>confidently insist</hi> on this, that the Crown is not a bare Inheritance, but an Inheritance accompanying an Office of Trust, and that if a mans defects render him uncapable of the Trust, he has also forfeited the Inheritance. <hi>ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, if it be true, equally holds against the King himself, as well as against his Heir. For faileur in point of Trust may be (and has been) pleaded, for the Deposing of the King, as well as for the Exclusion of his Successor. And so <hi>Parsons</hi> reckons; who affirms likewise, that the Princes power is <hi>Potestas Vicaria,</hi> or <hi>delegata,</hi> that is to say, a Power <hi>delegate,</hi> or by <hi>Commission, given</hi> (by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth) with such <hi>Restrictions, Cautels,</hi> and <hi>Conditions,</hi> as if the same be not kept, but wilfully broken on either part, then is the other not bound, <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>Not to trouble you with every little particular, when you have already so much of a Specimen, I dare say, that let any man carefully peruse, observe, and remember the Contents of <hi>Doleman,</hi> and he will easily discover, that this Book is the Forge, out of which the Collector of the <hi>History of Succession</hi> hath taken all those Irons, which he hath sent abroad to set this Kingdom on Fire.</p>
            <p>But I must observe unto you, that as he hath followed the Jesuit over hedge and ditch in his Examples, so he hath followed him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly too in dealing <hi>basely</hi> with the world, by downright Falsities in some things, by gross Partiality and disingenuity in others, and by Illogical Consequences in the rest, forcing out such Conclusions as the instances do not really yield him, to serve his turn. But for this I must intreat you to consult well those two excellent Tracts which I recommended unto you above. And so much for that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60244:12"/>From whom we could not expect any other Notions, than what are serviceable to his secular Ends, because his Book argues him to be one that is a meer Politician, regardless of the Laws of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and governed only by his Interest: and he must thank your Charity, if you do not think him to be much of the mind of a Gentleman, famous now for his zeal (whether for his Countrey or himself you may judg it) who said once upon a time, <hi>That he is a Fool who hath any more of Religion than what will serve his Interest.</hi> And if that be true, I must give him that due Character, which he hath been meriting for above these 40 years, that he for his part is one of the wisest of men.</p>
            <p>But of all men living, I wonder at Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>; a person whose name I cannot mention without due respect, because in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Bishops Right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he hath shewed a great deal of good Learning in the Laws, and hath exprest his just Zeal for the Interest of the Church, and that deep sense (which I am perswaded he hath) of the Calamitous condition which this poor Nation is now in. So that I should have taken no notice of his writings, but what would have been entirely for his Honour, but that his Personal Worth (which I love and value) may probably give a Reputation to some Foreign and Groundless Opinions which he runs upon in his Postscript, and which the Jesuite Parsons hath furnisht even him with.</p>
            <p>I have heard say, that when our Government was lately in a fair way to be run down, he was prevailed with to write that Postscript partly by Fear, and partly as Penance and Satisfaction (to a Party) for the Argument which he had written before. This is clear, that the Bishops are more beholden to him than the King is: for he owns their Authority (as Bishops) to be Divine; but as for the Kings title to his Crown, he believes it, as <hi>Doleman</hi> (alias <hi>Parsons</hi>) did, to be a meer Human thing.</p>
            <p>If any of our Clergy deny this, I see no reason Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> hath to be so very angry with 'em; for they hold no more than what all good Christians have ever held, no more than what the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath <hi>declared,</hi> no more than what the Laws of our Country do <hi>own</hi> and will <hi>bear them out</hi> in.</p>
            <p>I have been told by many of them, that Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> hath done them wrong, and that he may convince himself, if he will but look
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60244:13"/>
into their Sentiments well, and consider them with an Indifferent and Candid mind: but where he pretends to Vindicate and to be Concern'd for them, there he accuseth'em, and the charge is unjust, and, had another drawn it up, I would have said malitious, design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on purpose to render the Clergy odious for being steady and true to the establisht Government, in a time when so many are longing for a Change. <q>Those Fancies and Dreams of his, that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>England</hi> are for a Popish Successor and no Parliaments, that they allow of Arbritrary Power, that they are ready to abett any Extravagancies in a Prince, and the like, are idle, evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy insinuations;</q> and if Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> please to enter the Lists, I will find him one that shall undertake the Cause in this point, out of that Veneration which we all ought to have for that Sacred Function, and out of just and due respects to our present Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, than which perhaps this Nation was never yet blest with a better.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, my business is to shew you, that Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> hath been foully imposed upon by the Jesuite <hi>Parsons,</hi> as to Principles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which concern the State. And for evidencing thereof, you may please to remember, that 'tis a fundamental Principle in <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> 
               <q>That all Power and Authority to Institute, to Modifie, or to Change the particular form of any Government, and to admit or exclude a Successor in Monarchy, is wholly and uncontroulably in the People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is taken for granted by Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> as if it were as clear as a Postulatum in the Mathematicks; and so he does not so much as offer at any solid and just proof of it, only now and then <hi>touches</hi> upon some notions in <hi>Doleman,</hi> which at first sight may seem to look a little that way.</p>
            <p>Sir, I would not willingly and knowingly do this Gentleman any the least wrong or unkindness; nay, I have that respect for him, that I could strain my Charity to believe, that he himself hath not borrowed of <hi>Doleman,</hi> but some body else for him.</p>
            <p>But that there has been borrowing in the case, you may easi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And a little before; if any Law should exceed the declared mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Legislative Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though in such a case men may have leave to doubt of the lawfulness of such a Law, yet if it be not against any express Law of God, they will upon a little Consideration determine it lawful, if it be necessary to the Commonweal, for that nothing can be the concerns of men united in any Policy, but may be govern'd and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Laws of their Legislature, for Publick good: for by the reason of all Political Societies, there is a submission made of all Rights, especially of the common Rights of the Community, to the Government of its own Laws. <hi>Id. ibid.</hi> pag. 32, 33.</cell>

            <p>According to these Principles, the Power of a Commonwealth is so unlimited, boundless and extensive, as that it can over-rule mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which are <hi>naturally</hi> just and right, and justifie any thing that is intrinsically evil, if it be for the publick good. And whether this be not against the tenor of Christianity, and clearly repugnant to the Apostolick Rule, that <hi>we must not do evil that good may come</hi>; and whether it be not perfectly introductive of a more <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> in the <hi>People,</hi> than can be feared in any <hi>English</hi> Prince, I leave to such Honest and Indifferent Persons as your selves to judg.</p>
            <p>It hath been a Doctrine hitherto received by all rational and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men, that <hi>Dominion is not founded in Grace,</hi> and that men do not hold their Estates and Civil Rights by their Religion. And I am confident, there is no Dissenter from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but would think himself <hi>hardly</hi> and <hi>unjustly</hi> dealt with, should he be bound to forfeit all he is worth in the World for his Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Now one would think that Princes should have the <hi>same</hi> priviledg, at least which all Ordinary and Private men have. But in this point some are very Partial, and would <hi>vary</hi> and <hi>alter</hi> the case, where a Successor to the Crown is concern'd.</p>
            <p>For thus saith the Jesuite <hi>Parsons</hi>; <q>of all other holds, I esteem the tenure of a Crown (if so it may be termed) the most irregular and extraordinary—Men may not judg of this as of

other Pleas of particular persons, nor is their trial alike; nor the common Maxims or Rules always of force in this thing as in others: For if a Private man have many <hi>daughters,</hi> and die seized of Lands in <hi>Fee-simple</hi> without Heir <hi>Male,</hi> his said <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> by Law shall have the said Lands, as Copartners, equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between them; but not the <hi>Daughters</hi> of a King, for that the <hi>Eldest</hi> must carry away all, as though she were Heir <hi>Male</hi>; <hi>Doleman, part</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 72.</q> And thus saith Mr, <hi>Hunt,</hi> as he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten just after <hi>Doleman,</hi> 
               <q>The descent of the Crown is governed according to the presumed will of the People, and the presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Peoples will is made, by measuring and considering what is most expedient to the publick good, whereas Private Estates are directed in their descent according to the Descendents. And this is the reason that the descent of the Crown is governed by other Rules than Private Estates: Only one Daughter, and not all, as in Private Estates, shall succeed to the Crown, <hi>Postscript. pag.</hi> 42.</q>

            <p>I did not think to have found so much of old Father <hi>Parsons</hi> his Paw in a New Book set forth for the preservation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion: For who could dream, that any man should make use of a Woolf to save and secure the Sheepfold? Yet I am willing to believe that Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> in all this has no Design which he thinks to be Evil, and am heartily sorry, that so zealous a Protestant hath so unfortunately run upon Jesuitical Principles.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> in <hi>page</hi> 33. of his <hi>Postscript</hi> directs us to a Pamphlet called, <hi>The great and weighty Consideration considered.</hi> And good Reason he had to <hi>recommend</hi> it, the Book is so very like his <hi>own,</hi> that a diligent Reader would believe them <hi>both</hi> to be the Off-spring of one Father, and as near of kin as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi.</hi> Old Father <hi>Parsons</hi> can never <hi>die,</hi> as long as he hath such an hopeful Issue, so like him in Lineaments and Spirits: And I begin to wonder, why some of late would be at the Expence to set out <hi>Doleman</hi> in a New Edition, since in <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>two former</hi> Pamphlets a true Protestant (so called) may find matter enough to compile a <hi>Dolemanian</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism, were <hi>old Doleman</hi> utterly <hi>lost</hi>; at least he might <hi>extract</hi> enough again to do the <hi>job</hi> of 41. and 48. and that, I suppose, is as <hi>much</hi> as some in the world do <hi>desire.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60244:17"/>Sir, you must well remember, that these are the Articles of <hi>Doleman</hi>'s Creed, <q>That though Government, in the general Notion of it, be of Natural and Divine Institution, yet the particular Forms of Governments depend upon the Consent and Good will of the People, that Kings are their Creatures; that Succession to the Crown is at their disposal, that they can <hi>alter</hi> Government and Succession if they please, and even Depose the King <hi>himself,</hi> if they judge it <hi>needful</hi>; and all this by a Boundless, and unlimited power of right belonging unto <hi>them.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Considerers</hi> Faith is just of the same piece for all the world. For he holdeth, <q>That though God commands us in our Nature, to form our selves into Governments, for that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind cannot tolerably subsist without them (which is <hi>Dolemans</hi> very Reason;) though Government, because it makes men equal and Reasonable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> seems to be the most principal Institution and Appointment of God in Nature, yet the Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Persons of the Governours, the Order of Succession, their respective Powers and Ministries, are of Mans appointment, and an Humane Creature, <hi>pag.</hi> 8.</q> exactly <hi>agreeable</hi> to what <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> delivers, <hi>pag.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
            <p>If you urge, that Soveraign Power is called in Scripture the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, Doleman</hi> will tell you in answer to it, that 'tis so called, because Gods Approbation and Concurrence goes along with the Peoples consent. And this is our <hi>Considerers</hi> very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <q>That Gods doing a thing is only the course of Natural and Second causes, to which because God gives the Direction and Motion, he both <hi>doth,</hi> and is <hi>said</hi> to do all that is done, <hi>pag.</hi> 13.</q> Whence he proceeds to tell us, <q>That every Form of Government is of our Creation, and not Gods, <hi>ibid.</hi> That the King hath his Authority from the Consent of the People in the first constitution of the Government, <hi>pag.</hi> 20.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis upon the strength of this Principle that he tells us, with the same Confidence as <hi>Doleman</hi> doth, <q>That no Laws of Men are so fundamental, but that they are Alterable, <hi>Consider. p.</hi> 4. That a Government made by Men is not to be left meerly to Chance and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60244:17"/>
the contingency of Birth,<note rend="inter">
                     <hi>But is not that Right of Power which a Father hath over his Child, and an Husband over his Wife, by Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 5. That all rights of Property are of Positive and Civil appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and institution, <hi>p.</hi> 7. That no man can have, or is entitled to any thing, but what, and as the Laws allots it to him, <hi>Ibid.</hi> And that (just according to <hi>Dolemans</hi> Notion) every Form of Government was never intended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, or at least inflexible, but was intended and made under Reservations, reasonable Exceptions of unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen Accidents, and rare Contingencies in Humane affairs, <hi>pag.</hi> 13.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now to prove all this, <hi>That every Form of Government is of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Institution,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Doleman</hi> offers and insisteth upon but <hi>one</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and 'tis this, viz. <q>
                  <hi>That had Forms of Government been prescribed by any Law of Nature or Divine, then they should be both immutable, and the self-same in all Countries, as God and Nature are one, and the same to all, without change, Doleman</hi> part. 1. pag. 2, 3.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is a very weak Argument; for God and Nature <hi>have</hi> been <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> to <hi>all,</hi> because Anciently every Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in all Countries was Monarchical: And it will no more follow, that this one Form of Government was not setled at first, because several other Forms of Government were set up afterwards, than it will follow, that one sort of Religion was not insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted at first, because so many sorts of Religion crept in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>However, this poor Argument of <hi>Dolemans</hi> is made use of by our <hi>Considerer,</hi> 
               <q>For (saith he) Nature hath made no Laws about Property, nor about Governments; otherwise all Laws of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Right, and all Governments would have been the same; for what she makes are Universal, as the Nature of man: <hi>Answer to a Letter,</hi> p. 29.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis an avowed Principle in <hi>Doleman,</hi> 
               <q>That it belongs to the Commonwealth to order all Succession to the Crown.</q> And this is our <hi>Considerers</hi> Principle, <q>That Succession is properly the Right of the Community, <hi>p.</hi> 20. That Succession to the Crown is the Peoples Right, the Right of the whole Community, <hi>their</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, <hi>their</hi> Constitution, and <hi>their</hi> Creature; <hi>Answer to a Letter,</hi> pag. 32, 33.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60244:18"/>Whereas it is urged well, that the King is <hi>by Nature,</hi> that he is our <hi>Natural Prince,</hi> our <hi>Natural</hi> Liege Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this <hi>Considerer</hi> calls this, <hi>Loathsom Pedantry; Answer to a Letter,</hi> p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>9. And in like manner saith <hi>Doleman,</hi> 
               <q>When men talk of a <hi>Natural</hi> Prince, or <hi>Natural</hi> Successor, if it be understood of one that is born within the same Realm or Country, and so of our own Natural bloud, it hath some sense: But if it be meant as though any Prince had his particular Government or interest to succeed by institution of Nature, it is Ridiculous, <hi>Doleman, part</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 11.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If you ask, What power a Commonwealth hath to deprive a Successor without such Causes and Reasons which in the Eye of the <hi>Law</hi> seem <hi>Just? Doleman</hi> will tell you up and down, <q>That the Peoples Power is Boundless, Uncontroulable, and Unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable; and that it is to be presumed and owned, that what they do in this case is just, because they do it.</q> And at the same rate our <hi>Considerer</hi> speaketh, <hi>That no Government can want a power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it self,</hi> (whether it be by Right or Wrong means he considers not) <hi>pag.</hi> 4.
<q>That <hi>no private</hi> Right but what is governable, and may be ordered as to the Legislature shall seem necessary to the preservation of the whole, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. That the King and his great Council, in providing for the establishment and security of the Government, in their Proceedings are not tied up to the Forms of Judicial proceedings; but are to act upon such inducements, and in such methods, whereby the wisest men govern their affairs, in which they are at perfect Liberty, and not under the restraint of Laws: And that they cannot do Unjustly, whatever Methods or Means they use, that are Prudentially and Morally necessary to this End, <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 21.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is justly demandable, How a Commonwealth <hi>came</hi> by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, Omnipotent, and Ungovernable Power, so as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Laws of Religion or Natural Equity? In answer whereunto Father <hi>Parsons</hi> saith, (what I noted before) <q>That it would be a very imperfect Law, that hath not provided for accidents so weighty and important, as some are, for saving and conserving of a Commonwealth, <hi>Preface to Doleman, part</hi> 1.</q> Answerable whereunto is that Question of our <hi>Considerer,</hi> 
               <q>Can we imagine a Government, which is of Humane contrivance, to be without a Power to Preserve it self, and an Authority in cases that threaten
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60244:18"/>
its Ruine, to interpose with apt remedies for its Preservation? <hi>Consider.</hi> p. 5.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If by apt Remedies he meant <hi>Honest</hi> and <hi>Lawful</hi> means, we deny it not. But we cannot yield, that any men have <hi>Authority</hi> to do <hi>Injustice.</hi> They may have Power and Force enough to do so; as some upon <hi>Shuters-Hill</hi> have Power to take away my Purse, and as the High-Court of Justice (so called) had to take away the late Kings Life; but this is not Authority, or <hi>Lawful</hi> Power, or <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Proceeding. No <hi>private</hi> man ought to lose his Estate, but for <hi>Legal</hi> Causes, and by <hi>Legal</hi> Proceedings: To evade the force of this Argument, <hi>Parsons</hi> the Jesuit saith, <q>That the Tenure of the Crown is irregular and extraordinary. Men may not judge of this as of other Pleas of particular persons, nor is their trial alike, nor the common Maxims or Rules always of force in this thing as in others.</q> To prove which he tells us, <q>That only one Daughter of a King (though he hath many) is to go away with the Crown; whereas Private Estates are Divideable among all the Daughters for want of Issue Male, <hi>Dolman, part</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 72.</q> It seems there is Law and Justice for <hi>Private</hi> persons, but not for <hi>Princes.</hi> And so this <hi>Considerer</hi> reckons too, <q>That the Right of Succession to Government is not placed in the same rank with <hi>Private</hi> Inheritances, nor to be governed by the <hi>same</hi> Rules. That there is one Rule for the Succession of the Crown; and another for the Succession of Private Estates: For the descent of the Crown is governed and directed according to the presumed will of the People, and this (saith he) gives us the Reason, (the very Reason in <hi>Doleman</hi>) why one Daughter or Female of the next degree shall succeed to the Crown, and not all, if more than one; whereas a Private Inheritance is equally divided amongst them all, <hi>Consider.</hi> p. 32.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Heirs Apparent are not true Kings until their Coronation; nor is Allegiance due unto them before they be crowned, saith <hi>Doleman, pag.</hi> 108. No Allegiance is due to any Prince, but whom the Law appoints, and as the Law appoints, saith this <hi>Considerer,</hi> pag. 30.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Doleman</hi> is <hi>Positive</hi> that Princes may lawfully be Deposed; and he observes too (as a Remarkable Circumstance, as he calls it,) <hi>That God hath wonderfully concurred (for the most part) with such ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60244:19"/>
Acts of the Commonwealth against their evil</hi> Princes, not only in Prospering the same, but by giving also some notable Successor in the place of the deposed, <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. Had Father <hi>Parsons</hi> been alive in our days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps he would have instanced in that blessed Bird <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> among the rest. But I leave it to you and to other Honest men to judge, whether our <hi>Considerer</hi> had an eye to that <hi>passage</hi> and <hi>observation</hi> in <hi>Doleman,</hi> when speaking of the Exclusion of the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> he saith, we know, and are most assured of the justness of the undertaking, and we have good Hope in the Goodness of God, that he will <hi>Succeed</hi> it, <hi>p.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Yet I do not much wonder at this, considering that he goes higher still, even from the Successor to the Possessor of the Crown. For thus his Politicks run, The Crown doth not lie in Dominion, but in Trust; not in Property, but in Care, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. This is exactly <hi>Dolemans</hi> Notion, that a Princes power is, <hi>Potestas Vicaria,</hi> or <hi>delegata</hi>; a power Delegate, or power by Commission from the Commonwealth, given him as their Trustee, or Proxy, <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Upon this Doctrine he builds that Position (and it naturally follows) that true Kings may be Deposed, <hi>ibid.</hi> and <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. wherein our <hi>Considerer</hi> follows the Jesuit at the heels, owning that the People may recall their Letters of Attourney, and exauctorate their lawful King, <hi>p.</hi> 6. where he saith, (and with base abusing Dr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> when he seems to commend him) <q>I will hope there are very few in this Nation so ill instructed, that doth not think it in the power of People to Depose a Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Here the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman speaks <hi>out</hi> and <hi>home</hi>; and insinuates, that for a man to be a Martyr, or to bear the Cross of Christ, is to be <hi>ill instructed.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Jesuitism is the only true Orthodox Principle; and so this <hi>Considerer</hi> hath lastily con'd <hi>Doleman</hi> thanks for all his Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox instructions.</p>
            <p>For, saith <hi>Doleman,</hi> the Commonwealth hath Authority above their Princes, <hi>pag</hi> 19. And this <hi>Considerer</hi> calls the Commons, the Greatest and Best part of the Nation, <hi>p.</hi> 6. which is plainly meant with respect to their Authority, because a King cannot be deposed but by some that are supposed to be Greater and Better than <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> And so you see in the end what it is which this Gentleman and others of his Party and Persuasion would fain be at. They
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60244:19"/>
pretend the Preservation of Religion, and at the same time ven'd such Principles as overthrow the very foundations of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so <hi>true</hi> is that <hi>common</hi> observation, that these Pamphleteers begin with his Royal Highness, and end at last with his Royal Majesty.</p>
            <p>I need not say any thing of this Considerer's <hi>short Historical Collection</hi> touching the Succession of the Crown. For you and every body may easily see, that 'tis taken out of <hi>Doleman.</hi> And so, let this Considerer and his Father <hi>Parsons</hi> go together.</p>
            <p>The next that comes to my hands is that Sir <hi>Positive Statesman,</hi> the Author of <hi>Plato Redivivus,</hi> who was so well pleased with the Comical Preface to <hi>Doleman</hi> (where the Jesuit, after a Poetical manner, brings in two Lawyers at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> discoursing about Succession to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi>) that he could not but imitate the Poetical Fancy himself, bringing in a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Gentleman, and a Doctor at <hi>London,</hi> all discoursing about the present Government in <hi>England:</hi> So that 'tis but altering the Scene, and the Quality of the Interlocutors, and then the Dramatick Farce is in a manner the same.</p>
            <p>I confess this Gentleman is not <hi>Doleman</hi> all over from Head to Foot, but seems to have only the Guts and Garbage of the Jesuit; I mean, his most Carrion-Principles, For in two respects <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> seems to have been the better man of the two: 1. First, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that Regard and Esteem for Religion, and for the Church, which the Jesuit expresseth with so much zeal, that he would have all other Interests to truckle to this: Whereas this Gentleman seems to own no Apostle but <hi>Machiavil</hi> the Divine (as he often calls him) but Ridicule's things Sacred, Scoffs at Ordination, maliciously De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves our Church Constitutions, and makes use of his best Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick (that is, Buffoonry and Scurrility) to reproach all our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, speaking plainly thus, (<hi>pag.</hi> 98.) <q>The truth is, I could wish there had never been any Clergy; the purity of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as also the good and orderly Government of the world, had been much better provided for without them.</q> Had the Bookseller been well advised, he might have been so respectful to the memory of the Divine <hi>Plato,</hi> as not to have put a Jewel of Gold in a Swines Snout, but should have entitled this Book rather, <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus Redivivus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60244:20"/>2. Then as touching Monarchy, even <hi>Doleman</hi> is so fair, that he allows it to be the most Excellent, most Perfect, and most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Form of Government, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. But this Gentlman looks upon it as the very worst, and to have proceeded from the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of better Governments, <hi>pag.</hi> 33.

            </p>
            <p>By the way, I do not wonder, that this Gentleman should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as he doth, to persuade the King (as if he could Cully him out of his Rights) to share those four great Branches of his Prerogative among the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But not to digress. Though <hi>Doleman</hi> and this Gentleman differ in some Points, yet they agreein the Main; <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Government, and the Power of making Princes, is in the People.</q> This (saith <hi>Doleman,</hi> p. 11.) is the ground of all the rest that I have to say: Meaning, that if this Power be once allowed, the rest of his Book must be granted, and the Peoples power to change their Government, to fore-close a Successor to the Crown, to Depose, Chastise, and Proceed against their King, to renounce their Allegiance, to forsake their Oaths, and the like; all this Pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> their Proxies and Trustees.</p>
            <p>And is not this the Faith of the Author of <hi>Plato Redivivus</hi>? For, <hi>pag.</hi> 32. <q>He slights the Plea of a Monarchs <hi>Divine right</hi> to his Crown, as a piece of Court-Flattery; just as <hi>Parsons</hi> doth in answer to <hi>Belloy, Dolman, part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap</hi> 6. He tells us, That the frame of Government was first made by the Persuasion and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of some wise and vertuous person, and Consented to by the whole number, <hi>p.</hi> 30. That our Ancestors made choice of this sort of Government (Monarchy,) <hi>p.</hi> 113. That the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Government is divided between the King and his Subjects, <hi>p.</hi> 116. That the Kings share in the Soveraignty is cut out to him by the Law, <hi>p.</hi> 120. That our Prince hath no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Own, but what was first Intrusted in him by the Government, of which he is the Head, <hi>p.</hi> 125.</q> 
               <q>He looks upon these Notions as meer Pretences, that the Kings Power came from God, that his Subjects cannot dispute it, and that he ought not to give an account of his Actions to any but God. <hi>p.</hi> 178. He excuseth the taking Arms by any People in opposition to their Prince, from their <hi>claim</hi> to a Lawful Jurisdiction or Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Besides all these Principles, exactly agreeable to those in <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> he hath a fine Similitude, <q>That as in some distempers in the Body, when the Head is out of order, though the distemper may begin from the disease of some other part, or from the mass of Bloud, or putresaction of other Humours; yet since that noble part is so affected by it, that Reason and Discourse fails, therefore to restore this again, Remedies must be applied to the <hi>Head,</hi> and Humours and Vapours must be drawn from the <hi>Head,</hi> that so it may be able to govern and reign over the Body as it did before, or else the whole man, like a Slave, must be ruled and guided <hi>ab Extrinsec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>How admirably well do good wits many times jump? I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber now, that a friend of ours dreamt about two years ago, that a great Consult was held somewhere at the Sign of the Nags-head, which afterwards adjourned somewhere else to the Sign of the Kings-Head, and that there Father <hi>Parsons</hi> the Jesuit sate Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, under the name of <hi>R. Doleman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among other things, my Friend dreamt too, that a wicked <hi>Political Catechism</hi> was a making there. But I lookt upon that as an Idle Fancy; for who could dream that such a seditious Pamphlet should come abroad at this time of day? But I perceive I was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken; for yesterday I hapned to read a new Assemblies Catechism bearing that Title, <hi>A Political Catechism:</hi> And I found it as full of the Jesuits Venom, as if it had been spitten out of <hi>Dolemans</hi> own mouth. For these are some of the Principles in it, word for word; <q>That the Government being a regulated Monarchy, the King is not above the Law, but is accountable to the Law, and not to God only, <hi>p.</hi> 1. 2. That whatsoever is done by the King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and beyond the limits of the Regulation, is not Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>p.</hi> 2. 3. That to resist the notorious Transgressions of that Regulation, is no resisting of Regal Authority, <hi>ibid.</hi> 4. That it is so far from being a resisting of the Ordinance of God, that it is not so much as resisting the Ordinance of men, <hi>ibid.</hi> 5. That the King hath not his power, solely, or immediately by Divine-right. But 6. That the immediate Original of it was from the People. 7. That in questioned cases the King is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Grant (for he hath no more than what was granted) and not the People to shew a Reservation. 8. That the good of the Subject is ever to be preferred before the greatness of the King, <hi>p.</hi> 5. 9. That it is lawful for the Two Houses to raise Arms to defend themselves in case an Army be raised against them, <hi>p.</hi> 7. 10. That <hi>They</hi> are the Legal Judges, when there is danger of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60244:21"/>
Tyranny, and that they have Legal Power to command their Judgment to be obeyed. 11. That they have Power to dispose of the Militia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Levy Moneys, Horse, Arms, &amp;c. even without or against the Kings Consent. 12. That of their Power they are the Legal Judges, and that all the Subjects of this Kingdom are bound by the Laws to obey them herein.</q>

            <p>Sir, you cannot but remember, that the late Rebellion was raised and maintain'd upon these Principles. And if there were no <hi>new</hi> Rebellion intended again, for what Reason can you imagine is there a Revival of <hi>these</hi> Principles, which serve for no <hi>other</hi> end: The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Plato Redivivus,</hi> who doth confess, (<hi>pag.</hi> 172.) <q>That we are to this day tugging with the same difficulties, managing the same debates, and giving the same disgusts to the Court, and Hopes to the Country,</q> which our Ancestors did before the Year, 1640. might have <hi>added</hi> too, if he had pleased to speak truth to the <hi>full,</hi> that we are acting to this day upon the same Principles, on which they acted in 1641. All which Principles are of their Fathers the Jesuites (who are of their Father the Devil) and are so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that he that runs may read them all in <hi>Doleman Redivivus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If now you chance to read <hi>the Character of a Popish Successor,</hi> you will find it there Asserted, (<hi>pag.</hi> 21.) <q>That in the Infancy of time, and in the first Original of Nations, Monarchy came by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Choice, who frequently in the beginning of the World, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And in the <hi>Vindication of that Character</hi> you will find another of <hi>Dolemans</hi> Pleas, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That the Succession of Kingly Government has not been so sacred, but upon some Occasions it has been chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Divine as well as Lawful Authority, <hi>pag.</hi> 14.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Vox Populi</hi> the zealous True Protestant speaks after the Jesuite, saying, <q>That the King has no Power, but what the Law gives him, <hi>pag.</hi> 2.</q> (And yet I ever thought, that the Law hath no Power but what the King gives it; and if the Law be His Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how can it be His Creator?) And again he tells us, <q>That the Kings share in the Sovereignty is cut out to him by Law; and

               </gap>t I must observe to you, that these Anti-Monarchical and Seditious Doctrines have come so thick into the World, by the Midwivery of a certain Speech which was made five years before, and which was Father'd upon a Noble Peer, who was then very active in the House of Lords. In which Speech you find these Positions, <q>That the King is King by Law, and by the same Law that a poor Man enjoys his Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: that to say, this Family are our Kings, and this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar frame of Government is our Lawful Constitution, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us, is owing only to the particular Laws of our Countrey.</q> Where the Author confesseth also, <q>That he cannot find that ever the Jesuites or Popish Clergy, only some of our Episcopal Clergy, owned Monarchy to be of <hi>Divine Right.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Of all this we had heard no N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You see the Gentleman doth <hi>own,</hi> that he had been Dealing and Consulting with the Jesuites and Popish Clergy; for he matches them against our Episcopal Clergy, and declares himself plainly on the Jesuites side. But had he <hi>held</hi> his <hi>tongue</hi> as to <hi>that,</hi> yet such as had <hi>Parsons</hi> his Libel in their Studies, clearly perceiv'd whom he had been Trucking with; for what he saith in that Speech, is the very substance of the first Chapter in <hi>Doleman.</hi> Our Clergy do not deny, but the King is King by Law, if he means, <hi>according</hi> to Law: for the Law doth <hi>Recognize</hi> his Sacred Authority; our Laws give him his <hi>Due,</hi> they <hi>Own</hi> and <hi>Acknowledg</hi> that Right of Sovereign Power which he hath by the Laws of God, by Natural Claim and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But the Law doth not <hi>Found</hi> his Right to the Crown, as it doth the poor mans right to his Cottage. For Kings were Kings before there were Laws; and our King would be our Rightful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, were there neither <hi>Statute-Book</hi> nor <hi>Magna-Charta</hi> in all <hi>England.</hi> For the Authority of Kings doth not originally depend upon the Laws, or Consent of the People, any more than it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60244:22"/>
upon the Consent of my Children that I should be their Father. The Kings Power is Antecedent to Law, which hath its force from Him; as my Being is Antecedent to the Being of my Children, which have (under God) their Life from me.</p>

            <p>That the Jesuites and Popish Clergy should be <hi>otherwise</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is not to be wondred at, because being ingaged by their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to pretend, that the Popes Supremacy is of Divine Right, they are forced in defence of his pretended Power over all Princes, to lay their Authority very <hi>low,</hi> as if it were a Mushrome of the Earth, a little Creature of yesterday, depending for its Being upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Courtesie.

            <p>Really, Sir, I am quite tired with looking into Libels of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and shall only add, that if you have Time and Patience enough to read over as many of them as I have done, you will find, that the most <hi>Considerable</hi> Writers of Sedition, have taken large <hi>Collops</hi> out of <hi>Dolemans</hi> sides, and that every <hi>little</hi> Pamphleteer has come in for a <hi>Snack</hi>; so that could Father <hi>Parsons</hi> now peep out of the Earth, he would bless himself to see what Filching and Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napping work hath been made of his Principles.</p>
            <p>But I must not forget to tell you of one very lewd Tenent, which Father <hi>Parsons</hi> had the Impudence to Publish to the World, to the great dishonour and scandal of Christianity. For speaking of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians Passive Obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence, under <hi>Julian</hi> and other evil Princes, he was not asham'd to give this as the Reason why they suffer'd so patiently and resisted not, because <hi>they wanted Arms to maintain their Quarrel, and had not Strength, Power and Force enough to cope with their Governours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I do not remember to have met with this Tenent in <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> but you may find it in another Book written by <hi>Parsons,</hi> which he called <hi>Philopater,</hi> though I have it not by me at present to refer you to the particular place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60244:23"/>I confess too, that it was not <hi>Parsons</hi> single conceit for that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and swinging J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I own too, that <hi>Buchanan</hi> spake at the same rate in his Book <hi>de jure regni apud Scotos:</hi> and whether <hi>Buchanan</hi> did borrow this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jesuites, or the Jesuites borrowed it of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> others are concern'd to dispute it out. This is evident<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that it is a Jesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notion; and I will add, a Notion which others even of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Clergy did detest when it was first broached, as being utterly against the constant sense of the whole Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>Yet the late angry Author of <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apostate</hi> confidently runs upon this very Notion. For speaking of the submission of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians under <hi>Julian,</hi> he saith, <hi>What would men have a few Defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Christians do, when they had lost all their strength, and so many of their Numbers?</hi> p. 94. <hi>Have they never heard a West-Country man say, Chud eat Cheese an Chad it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By applying which Boorish Proverb to his Purpose, our Author doth seem to intimate, that if the Primitive Christians had had Strength and Numbers sufficient, Rebellion would have been as welcom to them as their very Food, and that they would as gladly have resisted, as they would have relieved their Hunger: but it seems they wanted Cheese, and could not do what they had a mind and stomach to do. A most Monstrous expression from the Pen of a Christian, of a Protestant, of a Clergy-man!</p>
            <p>For, first, nothing can be more false: because it is notorious, that <hi>Julians</hi> own Army consisted for the most part of Christians, (if their Religion and Consciences would have given them leave) could soon have done the Emperors work, when their Swords were in their hands, and <hi>Julian</hi> was at the Head of them in the Field. In those
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60244:23"/>
days the Numbers of <hi>Pagans</hi> were inconsiderable in comparison. For Christianity gained ground every day at such a strange rate, that (before <hi>Julians</hi> time) St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us, the Heathens were <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matcht</hi> by Christians: for (said he to the Proconsul of <hi>Africa</hi>) <hi>None of us resisteth,</hi>

Of which, (to omit other pregnant instances) that passage in his Apologetick is a clear Demonstration. For saith he to the Emperor, <q>Had we (Christians) a mind to do like Enemies, could we want Numbers or Armies? such Foreigners as we are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we have filled all that belongs to you, your Cities, Islands, Castles, Towns, Camps, Tribes, your Palace, Senate, Courts: we have left your Temples only to your selves. We who are thus willingly killed, what War were we not fit, not ready for, but that by our Religion it is permitted us rather to be killed, than to slay? We could have fought against you even without the help of Arms, and without being actual Rebels, only by standing out, and holding off from your Assistance, out of spight for being severed from your Fellowships and Societies (for so I understand those words, <hi>solius divortii invidia.</hi>)</q>
            </p>
            <p>These Testimonies alone do plainly shew the horrible falshood of that Jesuitical Notion, which this Author hath entertained, and is pleased to revive. And were this all, it would not be so much.</p>
            <p>But I add, secondly, that 'tis a pretence which casteth such a Disgrace, such a reproach, such a scandal upon Christianity, and the Christian Church, that you can hardly find any thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with it (unless it be the lewdness of a certain virulent scribler, that pretending to write a Church-History, hath Calumniated the Christian Bishops, as if they had been a Race of the most Blood-thirsty and wicked men in the world,) what would not a <hi>Celsus,</hi> or a <hi>Porphyry,</hi> or <hi>Julian</hi> have given for a Clergy-man in those days, who would have given it under his hand, that Christians were a sort of men, that wanted only strength and opportunity to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels?

               </gap>y (as this Author doth at the Doctrine touching Prayers and Tears, <hi>pag.</hi> 30.) as a piece of Quackery and Mountebank-craft.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but all those in this Age who have no kindness for Religion, will make a great use of this Authors insinuations, and hereafter upon his credit believe, that the Primitive Christians were in their hearts so many Cut-throats and Rebels, whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the contrary while they wanted strength: and if this be not a scandal thrown upon the Catholick Church, a reproach cast upon Religion, and an horrible reflection made upon the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Author of it, I know not what is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60244:24"/>And since this Person hath been pleased thus to disparage Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and to ridicule the Doctrine of the Cross, by Drolling with the Doctrine of Passive Obedience, I do not at all wonder that he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th taken the confidence also, to fall so foul upon Dr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> as to bring both his Integrity and his Learning into Question.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First his Integrity. For he plainly intimates his suspition, that when the Doctor in his Sermon on the 30th of <hi>January</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Doctrine of Passive Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dience, he might have a secret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign <hi>to wheedle men out of their Lives:</hi> that he taught such Doctrine as <hi>is fit to turn a Nation into shambles, and enough to tempt and invite Tyranny and Cruelty into the World,</hi> pag. 88. Nay, he <hi>declareth</hi> his <hi>fears,</hi> that this <hi>Doctrine was calculated and fitted on purpose for the use of a Popish Successor, and to make us an easier prey to the Bloody Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> pag. 89.</p>
            <p>In such times as these, when it may soon cost any man his Life to lye under the displeasure of the Rabble, could this Author have any but a Black and Malicious design, in thus exposing a worthy Person to their Hatred and Fury?</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> is better known than to be suspected by any but ill men, and yet I do not see what Reason even such men can have to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect his Integrity for that Sermon. For, is not the purport of the day enough to excuse and justifie him? Or could a man Preach upon the point of Passive Obedience more seasonably than on that day? If you please to consult the Office appointed for that day, you will find that the Epistle ordered to be read contains and inculcates that very Doctrine; and I wonder how it should escap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this Authors Observation, if he useth to be at Church on the Anniversary of the Kings Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>The Doctors business was to Preach submission to our lawful Governours. This every Clergy-man ought to do, and every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Clergy-man will do, that loves and regards his Flock, and is careful to give them wholsom food, and to keep them from the Bane, (for it seems the Sermon was Preacht a year before in his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, where he Resides.) Now, could the Doctor pursue this good Design better than by shewing what the Doctrine and Practice of Christ himself was as to this matter, and how agreeable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Doctrine and Practice of the Primitive Christians was? Since therefore that Blessed Prince was Resisted and Murder'd by men,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60244:25"/>
whose Principles and Practices were of a far different nature and utterly inconsistent with Christianity, how could the Doctor chuse (unless he would have been a Tergiversator) but take notice thereof, and shew the difference by making a Comparison?</p>
            <p>And why should this be construed, as a Design to serve the turn of a Popish Successor? Surely the Doctor had no need to look so far: For I am bound to believe, upon this Authors Principle, what some would be doing even <hi>now,</hi> had they but opportunity and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: They have plainly shewn their Teeth, and we may read the West-Country-Proverb on their Grinns, <hi>Chud eat Cheese an chad it.</hi> But whatever these are for, the Ministers of the Gospel ought to be for Obedience and Peace; and I wish that the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our present times were such, as that they might think it an Unnecessary and Impertinent thing, to preach against Resisting even a Protestant Prince.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Besides this, he is pleased to disparage the Doctors Learning, as if he were better versed in the <hi>Dissenters Sayings,</hi> than in the Histories of <hi>England</hi> and had been behold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n to the <hi>Dissenters Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> for a great part of his Sermon.</p>
            <p>Truly I think this Gentleman may well forgive the injury, if he be abused with this complement, that he may compare with the Doctor for his Readings. But I am apt to think, that what Books soever he hath been poring into, he hath not read (at least, not considered) some of the Doctors. For in the Dedication of that Controverted Sermon, he tells that excellent good man, the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sent Lord Mayor, <hi>that he had made it a year ago,</hi> (before the <hi>Dissenters Sayings</hi> came abroad) and that <hi>since</hi> he had made that Discourse; New Collections had been made (meaning those <hi>Sayings</hi>) but, saith he, I have added very little, contenting my self with what I had before provided out of their Originals. He seems to have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the <hi>Dissenters Sayings,</hi> not upon his own account, as having been beholden to those Collections himself, but rather for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders sake, to direct him where he might find many more of the same nature with his own.</p>
            <p>Besides, Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> his several Citations in his <hi>Peculium Dei,</hi> which was not only <hi>framed,</hi> but Printed before the <hi>Dissenters Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> do sufficiently shew, that the Doctor had no need to consult them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60244:25"/>Into the bargain there was Printed about three years ago a very Useful Book (which I would recommend to you) whereof Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> is on all hands taken to have been the Author,) 'tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Spirit of Popery,</hi> &amp;c. And the Animadversions up and down in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Book upon the Speeches of <hi>Kid</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> give abundant Evidence, that the Doctor had been long conversant with the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Originals, and the Histories which give an account of them.</p>
            <p>I believe the Author of the <hi>Dissenters Sayings</hi> will not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self dishonoured, should it be said, that this Book furnisht him with some Materials. But suppose (which is common among Writers) that Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> had borrowed some Hints from Mr. <hi>L' Estrange,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>L' Estrange</hi> had borrowed others of Dr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> yet this is no more, than for one honest man to borrow of another; and that is far more Reputable than for a true Protestant to borrow of a true Jesuit, and then to be ashamed of his Creditor and Friend.</p>
            <p>For the Doctor had justly Arraigned the Author of <hi>the History of Succession,</hi> for having stoln his Pamphlet out of <hi>Doleman</hi> (the Book which you sent me, and which the Doctor in his Sermon calls, <hi>The most pestilent and dangerous piece, that ever was written against this Government,</hi> p.28.) <hi>Julian</hi> took snuff at this, that a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Pamphleteer was discovered to have been trading with a wretched Jesuit. And yet he confesseth it <hi>to be possible to write an History of the Succession without borrowing from</hi> Doleman, <hi>p.</hi> 60. Very good: And why then did not that Pamphleteer do it? Why, was he so Ill-advised, as to be beholden to a Jesuit at all? Or why was he so Immodest, as to borrow his whole stock? Or why was he so disingenuous, as not to own his Benefactor, in whose Book he had run a Tick thus? Or, why was he so Impudent, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that this Pamphlet was written by a Protestant hand, when 'twas taken out of the Closet of Father <hi>Parsons?</hi> All that <hi>Julian</hi> saith to it, is, That <hi>'tis impossible to write an History of the Succession, without having a great many passages which</hi> Doleman <hi>has got into his Book</hi> ibid. But, by his good leave, 'tis possible to write one History without stealing out of another. 'Tis possible to imitate a Book, without Transcribing it. 'Tis possible to observe another mans Method, without running upon his Principles. 'Tis possible to

treat of his Matter without using his Fancy, and to pursue his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign without using his Phrase: This is as possible, as 'tis possible for me to follow a Leader though I do not tread in his very steps. But let an indiff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that a man may well say, that the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer had a design, not to write a new piece, but new Vamp an old one; and to put a damned J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>suit into such a new Dress, that he might appear in the world like a true Protestant.</p>
            <p>All these things considered duly, I may Infer, that since there is now adays such Fresh Trading and Trucking with the Jesuits, it is high time for every honest man in this Kingdom to make a Pause, and consider seriously whose hands we are in, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>It is high time for all the honest men in the Kingdom to consider whose hands we <hi>are in:</hi> And I am glad, that you begin to consider what a sort of men these are, who out of a pretended zeal for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Cause, take such an extravagant course as they do. What, is there no way to prevent Popery, but by planting Jesuitism? Is this the way to uphold the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to fetch Shoars and Buttresses from the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Have we not good store of wholsom Lews on our side? Is not the Genius of the Nation so set against Popery, that they may as soon be persuaded to turn Turks? Is not our Church so firmly Establisht, that if we be but Faithful to Her, it is impossible for that Scarlet Whore (with whom so many Princes have committed Forni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation) ever to have again Joynture or Dower in this Kingdom? Besides, and above all this, are we not sure, that the good hand of God will be over us, if we be but careful to commit our selves to him in well-doing? But 'tis observable, that <hi>these</hi> men in all their Writings take so little notice of the Providence of God, that a sober man may Reasonably suspect, that God is not in all their thoughts. They begin at the wrong end, and thinking that all must be done by Humane Arts and Policy, even rake Hell and scum the Devil, as if <hi>that</hi> were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60244:26"/>
an effectual course to preserve the true Religion and Church of God.</p>
            <p>Setting aside the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith, and the Vow of blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, tell me wherein these men differ from the Disciples of <hi>Ignatius Loyola?</hi> Why, only these are Popish, and they Protestant Jesuits.</p>
            <p>"Of all Sects and Religions (saith Father <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>) the Jesuit and the Puritan come nearest,<note rend="inter">

And so he goes on <hi>comparing</hi> them, and making both of them equally <hi>alike</hi> for their Hypocrisie, for their Conspiracies, for their Schismatical humour, for their malice against Bishops, for their Insolence and Disobedience to Government, for their violation of Oaths, for their Commonwealth-opinions, for their Tyranny and Usurping a Power over Princes, for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the Laws sometimes to serve a Turn, for their Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with one another in case of Occasional Communion and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Perjury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He instanceth in no less than twenty four points; a full Double Jury (if that would do any good) by which if you try <hi>both</hi> Factions, you will find, that as they came into the world much about a time, so they have been sworn Brethren from the <hi>Womb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he abuseth the old moderate Puritans, for 'twas only some Rigid men among them that were so Ill-natured, so Imperious, and such Thorns and Goads in their Governours sides. However, one Faction has hither so shifted it self into another, that the old Puritan, that was peaceable and fair-conditioned, is quite gone out of the world; he has been long ago lost in the Presbyterian, and the Presbyterian too is upon the matter lost in the Independent, and all of them are so lost in the Jesuit, that if you go to unken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel the Fox, 'tis an even Lay whether you hunt a Jesuit or a Whig.</p>
            <p>What an odd thing is this, that men should turn Jesuits for fear of being Papists? As I am an honest man, 'tis matter of great Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to me, and a most horrid scandal to Religion, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should pretend such zeal for the Protestant Faith, and yet infect themselves with such Jesuitical Principles.</p>

            <p>Sir, if you think me somewhat sharp, I must desire your Excuse, because nothing is more hateful to me, than a Conscience that is Tender in Part only; a Conscience, that is much like an Animal in your Garden, which you call a Tortoise; a Creature that is so very Nice and Tender in some parts, that it shrinks up it self pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, if you touch it with a Straw; but yet is wrapt up in such a deadly hard, crusty shell, that you may drive Horses and Carts over it, and not hurt it. And really, Sir, as I was considering with my self, how mighty shy and scrupulous some are in things which are of an inconsiderable nature, (but Straws in comparison) and yet what little impression the weighty things of the Law make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, I thought presently of your Tortoise; and was minded (but that I do not care to give Names) to call that a Tortoise Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which some call a Tender, a True-Protestant, and an Ignoramus-Conscience.</p>

               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60244:28"/>That Learned and great man Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> hath in one of his incomparable Sermons this following passage:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm.</hi> 12. <hi>Ad Aulam,</hi> p. 166.</note> 
               <q>I remember (saith he) to have read long since a Story of one of the Popes (but who the man was, and what the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occasion I cannot now recal to mind) that having, in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation with some of his Cardinals, proposed unto them the course himself had thought of for the setling of some present Affairs to his most advantage, when one of the Cardinals told him, He might not go that way because it was not according to <hi>Justice</hi>; he made answer again, That though it might not be done <hi>per viam Justitiae,</hi> yet it was to be done <hi>per viam Expedientiae.</hi>
               </q> The Pope thought, that any thing was <hi>lawful</hi> for him to do, that was but <hi>expedient</hi> for his Turn and Interest.</p>
            <p>Are not our Factious men now clearly of that Popes Persuasion; (goodly Protestants, as they are!) Do they not break over all bounds of Justice, when it is expedient for them? Do they not Plead or Contemn the Laws, according as it is expedient for them? Do they not Obey or Disobey, as it is expedient? Do they not cry <hi>up</hi> or cry <hi>down</hi> Parliaments, as it is most expedient? Do they not go to a Church or a Conventicle, as it is expedient? Do they not Receive or Refuse the Holy Sacrament, as it is expedient? Do they not avoid or stickle for Offices, as it is expedient? Do they not observe or violate Oaths, as it is expedient? Do they not shake hands with the Jesuit, or give him a kick, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient?</p>
            <p>And yet these men would persuade us, that there is no Plot on their side, though <hi>Doleman</hi> be brought to life again: just as the Jesuits pretended, that there was no Plot on their side, though they plaid the like Pranks, and disseminated the like Principles, when <hi>Doleman</hi> saw the light first.</p>
            <p>I accuse no particular Persons, but if the Faction have no villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Design in hand, they are damnable Fools to make such broad signs, and have damnable ill luck to have so many ugly Marks upon them. For what courses have they omitted, which a cunning <hi>Achitophel</hi> would think necessary to be taken, <hi>supposing</hi> that there were a design to subvert our present Government?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:60244:28"/>As little a Politician as I am, yet were I a great man, and could I suffer my self to be an Ill Subject, I know not what more effectual course could be taken to rend all into pieces than this: First, I would make my self Popular, and would curry favour with City and Country, by pretending to be a very Consciencious man, and a zealous Protestant, whether I had any thing of Conscience or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in me, or no. My next care should be, the Populace ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entertained a great opinion of me, to tell my Fellow-Subjects and Admirers, that Kings are not such great men, nor Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment such a great matter, but that Monarchs and Monarchy it self ought to truckle to the Conveniences of a Kingdom. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, my business should be to possess the People throughly with this Opinion, that all Power is derived from them, that a Crown is a Donative and Gift of theirs, and that they have an Unlimited Power either to continue a King and his Government, or to lay aside both, as shall be most expedient. My fourth care should be to lay open my Princes Infirmities, to disparage his Judgment as Weak and Impolitick, to render his Authority contemptible, to Reflect upon all miscarriages in his Government, and to make his Person vile and hated. But then, for fear of falling into <hi>open</hi> Treason, my next care should be to traduce and accuse his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours, and to make the world believe, that they were all Papists, and perfectly designed the introduction of Arbitrary Power, that so I might wound the Prince himself through the sides of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. Sixthly, Under pretence of securing Religion, Liberty, and Property, I would make my Interest and Party strong, and gain over as many considerable men as I could, and persuade them to enter into a Mutual League, and throw the Government into the hands of such, and such only, as should subscribe and enter into the Association. After this, I would work so with my friends, that if one of our Allies and Confederates should be found out and Indicted, a Pannel should be packt of such True men to the Cause, as would stretch their Consciences a little to bring off a poor Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and keep him out of the reach of the King and his Laws. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I would load all the Kings Friends with Reproaches, and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Characters, and call'em Tories, Rogues, Popishly-affected Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals, Enemies to their Country, and the like. And at last, if a Parliament should happen to be called, especially to <hi>Oxford,</hi> I would

               </gap>r, and with a numerous train of such true Protestants as <hi>Stephen Colledge</hi>; and should be strongly guarded with Men, Horse, and Arms, so that nothing should be wanting but the sound of the Trumpet, and a Rendezvouz. Now, should I do thus, would not you think that I had a base Design a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Plot in my head? Would not any man think, that I had a mind to set things on a flame, when I had thus laid the Fewel together, and had blown the Coals, and was stirring up the Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e? Sir, I do not say, or mean, that my Conscience can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to do these things; but whether these things have not been done, let the world judge.</p>
            <p>Yet truly I do not believe, that there is a Protestant-Plot, nor would I have it called so; for the Principles of our Religion are such, that we dare not be seditious; we dare not be ungoverna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; we dare not be Enemies to the King; we dare not endeavour to pull down a Government that is so admirably well established; we dare not be dishonest, unless we will be Hypocrites; nor be Rebels, unless we will be damned. In a word our Religion is such, that we can lay no Plot, but this, How to be quiet while we live, and how to go to Heaven when we die. This is the business of a Right Protestant.</p>
            <p>Nor do I believe, that there is a Presbyterian-Plot neither (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called.) For that is such an odious, such an Ill-natured Sect, that the Genius of the Nation is set against them; and we have had already such abundant experience of their Hypocrisie, Knavery, and Tyranny, that 'tis not credible, that any man of Consideration will Plot, or venture his neck for them.</p>

            <p>Of this Design we had evidence abundant by the late famous Association, which opened the eyes of so many honest Royalists in the Kingdom. That <hi>alone</hi> gave a clear Demonstration of the matter, though we had reason enough to suspect it shrewdly before.</p>
            <p>For it was observed, that upon the Discovery of the Popish Plot, when the Church of <hi>England-men</hi> unanimously and vigorously fall upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Dissenters at the same time fell foul upon the Church of <hi>England.</hi> You know how maliciously active and zealous Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the rest have been in that Cause, and in that Cause only. This we were amazed to see, and could make no
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60244:30"/>
other Construction of it, but that they took an early care to destroy the establisht Church themselves, as if they believed not, that the Papists could be able to do it. For the Church of <hi>England</hi> being the only impregnable Fort against Popery, we could not conceive, that Protestants would endeavour to remove, or weaken, or pull down that, if they did believe really that the common Enemy had a Plot against it. How can this be, that men should fear an Enemy, and believe him to be under the Walls, and yet at the same time open the City Gates, and with a pretended Design to keep the Enemy out too? this is as unlikely, as that men should believe and fear that the Kings Life and Person is in imminent danger, and yet at the same time endeavour to remove his Guards and leave his Palace naked, pretending to preserve Him. How, I pray, can these things consist?</p>
            <p>Besides, we see how zealous the Factious have been and are, in stickling for Offices of Trust, which in <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>setled</hi> times they studied as much to <hi>avoid,</hi> as being only vexatious, troublesome and chargeable, but of <hi>no use than</hi> for the disturbance of a Profound Peace.</p>
            <p>We see how readily they themselves have confuted their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, touching the sinfulness (forsooth) of complying with some Laws, and Conforming to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For rather than stand out of play, when the Old Game is going again, they will (for once) abju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Covenant, and take the Test, and seal all this by receiving the Holy Sacrament according to Law, even when their own Consciences tell them (unless their Tongues lie) that it is Damnable to do so.</p>
            <p>Add to this, that the world rings of Ignoramus-Juries, when Full, clear and plentiful Evidence hath been given by men whose Credit in other cases has passed unquestioned. By which means Justice hath been obstructed, and the Law hath been over-ruled, or the edg of it hath been turned on one side only, so that the King himself hath been denied the benefit of it, and men that were noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for Dishonesty and Sedition have been Protected against him.</p>
            <p>Now, it is not credible, but that all this is in order to some very evil Design, which cannot be carried on but by these very evil means; because it cannot be supposed, that men would dare to be Hated by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60244:30"/>
the Government, to be Obnoxious to the Magistrates Sword, to mock Heaven, to forfeit their Reputation, and to play handy-dandy with their Consciences, did not some desperate Plot require such desperate Courses, as they cannot but know will one day rise up in Judgment against them even in this World, if the establisht Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment holdeth.</p>
            <p>The Consideration of these things is enough to convince all thinking Persons, that there is a Monstrous Intrigue in hand against the Government. But, to deal plainly with you, all these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to me seem to be <hi>over</hi> and <hi>above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, as I mistrusted something of an extraordinary nature above three years ago, when Pamphlets came every week abroad full of unworthy and base reflections upon the King, upon his Counsellors, upon the Bishops and all the Clergy, upon the Offices and Rites in the Service Book, upon the Long Loyal Parliament, and indeed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Frame and Constitution of our excellent Government (which reflections, had they been just, were surely altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less then, if nothing but an engagement against the Popish Interest was intended) so when I saw the Jesuites Principles brought upon the Stage again, and found it confidently Asserted, and by many Believed, that Monarchy is a meer Human Ordinance, that Kings hold their Crowns by the Consent of their Subjects, that all Power is Originally in the People, that this Power of theirs is Unlimited and Uncontroulable, and many the like Positions more, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Government once; then all my doubts vanished strait, and what I mistrusted before, then I firmly Believed, that an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Government was intended again, and that these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were vended about to prepare a way thereunto: for to what other purposes could these Principles serve?</p>
            <p>But now at last, when I saw that evil men were not contented to Skim and Retal these Principles out of <hi>Doleman,</hi> but moreover have reprinted <hi>Dolemans</hi> whole Book at large, it is impossible for me to force my Charity to believe otherwise, than that they have such a black Design against the whole Royal Family and the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as I am loth to mention. For Books are not wont to be sent abroad into the World, but with a Design; nor are Booksellers willing to run the hazard of a whole Impression, unless there be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60244:31"/>
strong probabilities that it will do either Good or Mischief: and the Reprinting of <hi>Doleman</hi> at this ticklish juncture, when the affairs of <hi>England</hi> are in such an U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>certain and Tottering Posture, is a plain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that 'twas done with a Design to possess the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with such Notions, that they might be ripe for a Rebellion, and ready <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or a total change of our Government, either according to the State of <hi>Venice</hi> (which is the drift of <hi>Plato Redivivus</hi>) or according to the Model of <hi>Holland</hi> (which other Factionists are generally more inclined unto.) Consider the thing well, Sir, and then tell me your thoughts, whether that might not be the intent of putting that Pestilent and Villanous Book again into the Press now, which at the Kings Restauration, and for many years since, was hardly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued so much as waste Paper in comparison.</p>
            <p>Men and Books rise or sink in their price according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Times. Twenty years ago it was Hony-moon in <hi>England,</hi> and, under God, nothing was so dear to our Souls then as our King and our Government: and had <hi>Doleman</hi> appeared abroad then, as he doth now, we should have thought that <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> had sent the Jesuite from Hell, and he would have been Executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> by the Hangmans hands, before he had done any further mischief. But now the Case is alter'd, and the smart of Rebellion and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is quite out of some mens fingers; and such as are for playing the Old Game over again, think it their best course to use the same Cards that were so lucky to 'em once before; and Father <hi>Parsons</hi> is called for to help 'em Deal.</p>
            <p>Sir, I will not give you any further trouble now, though when I first set Pen to Paper, I thought it necessary to Examin those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in <hi>Doleman,</hi> which are so Popular in these days. And because I find, that the Doctrine of the Kings <hi>Divine Right</hi> to his Crown is become odious to many, who look upon it to be full of dangerous Consequences, as well as unreasonable in it self: and because the Clergy of our Church are hated for that Doctrine sake; and the ashes of that Learned, Loyal, and Honourable Person, Sir <hi>Robert Filmir,</hi> have been of late polluted with a great deal of dirt out of the Kennel, for no other Reason but because he was such a Fatal Enemy to that Jesuitical Principle, that the Original of all Power and Government is in the People; therefore I judged it proper and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60244:31"/>
seasonable to shew you, what is meant by the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and what strong Reasons that Doctrine is founded upon, that so I might vindicate the Integrity and Honour of the Assertors of it. But I am not willing that this Letter should swell into a large Discourse. However, if it may be an acceptable thing to you, to be acquainted with my thoughts on that Subject, you know you may Command me, as my business shall give me leave. In the mean time I own my self, Sir,</p>
