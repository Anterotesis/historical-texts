         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER from a Friend concerning the ensuing CASES.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving perused the Papers you sent me, I can safely vouch them for Genuine, and not in the least Spurious, by that resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance they wear of their Reverend Author; and therefore you need not fear to bring them to the Publick Test, and let them look the Sun in the face.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, their first Commission was but short, and long since expired, they being designed only to visit and respectively satisfie some private Friends; yet I cannot see what injury you will offer to his sacred ashes, if, by renewing that, you send them on a little farther Embassie for the common good.</p>
            <p>Indeed the least remains of so matchless a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, so invincible an Advocate <hi>in foro Theologico,</hi> like the filings and fragments of Gold, ought not to be lost; and pity the world was not worthy many more of his learned Labours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105198:3"/>But — <hi>Praestat de Carthagine tacere quàm pauca dicere,</hi> far be it from me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pinion the wings of his Fame, with any rude Letters of Commendation; or, by way of precarious Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to court any man into a belief of his worth, since that were to attempt <hi>Iliads</hi> after <hi>Homer,</hi> and spoil a Piece done already to the life by his own Pencil, the works whereof do sufficiently <hi>praise him in the gates</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All I aim at is, to commend and promote your pious intention, to give the world security, by making these Papers publick, that they shall never hereafter stand in need of any other hand to snatch them out of the fire, a doom (you say) once written upon them.</p>
            <p>I have no farther trouble to give you, but to thank you for those excellent Pieces of the same Hand and Stamp (as every Intelligent Reader will easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern) with which as an accession to this Edition, your Care and Piety hath obliged the Publick: Only again let me bespeak your vigilance over the Press, which by her daily teeming and expertness, or (at least) negligence of the Midwife, is wont of late to spoil good births with monstrous deformities, and unpardonable <hi>Errata;</hi> so you will avoid a double guilt contracted by some without fear or wit, of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your critical Reader on the one hand, and your most judiciously exact Writer on the other; and (if that may contribute any thing more) very much gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the most unworthy of his Admirers.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen by your former Letter, you desired my present Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in two Questions therein proposed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath: although I might not then satisfie your whole desire (being loath to give in my opinion before I had well weighed it) yet that I might not seem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to decline the task imposed on me by you, I engaged my self by promise, within short time, to send you what upon further consideration I should conceive thereof. Which promise, so far as my many distractions and occasions would permit, I endeavoured to perform by perusing the Books you sent me, (in the one whereof, I found written on the spare paper with your hand, a Note moving a third Question, about the Name of the Sabbath also;) and by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105198:5"/>
looking up, and reviewing such scattered Notes as I had touching that Subject. But then I met with difficulties so many and great (whereof the more I considered, the more still I found them to encrease) that I saw it would be a long work, and take up far more time then I could spare, to digest and enlarge what seemed needful to be said in the three Questions in such sort as was requisite, to give any tollerable satisfaction either to my self or others. Wherefore I was eftsoons minded to have excused my self by Letter to you, from farther medling with these Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, and to have remitted you over for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfaction to those men, that have both better leisure to go about such a business, and better abilities to go through with it than I have; for to questions of importance, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothing be said, than not enough: And the rather was I minded so to do, when I perceived there were rumors spread in these parts, (occasioned, as I verily suppose, by some speeches of your good friend Mr. <hi>Tho. A.</hi>) as if I were writing a Treatise of the morality of the Sabbath. Which besides that, it might raise an expectation of some great matters which I could in no wise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; it might also expose that little I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105198:5"/>
should have done to the mis-censures of men wedded to their own opinions, if after I had laid mine open, it should have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any thing (as in some things like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough it would) to have disagreed from theirs. Yet, because by your late kind Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (wherein, whilst I was slack in making it, you have prevented mine excuse,) I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the continuance of your former desire; I have therefore since resolved to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, though not so much as I first intended, hoping that you will in friendly manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret my purpose therein. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now sent you but a naked summary of my thoughts concerning the three Questions, abstracted from all those Explanations, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Testimonies of Authors, removals of Objections, and other such Enlargements as might have given further both lustre and strength thereunto.</p>
            <p>Howsoever, by what I presently send, you may sufficiently see what my opinion is; which I shall be ready to clear, so far as my understanding will serve, in any particular wherein you shall remain doubtful; and as ready to alter when any man shall instruct me better, if he bring good evidence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Reason, or of Scripture-Text for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105198:6"/>
what he affirmeth: The Questions are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Which is the fittest Name where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to call the day of our Christian weekly-rest? whether the Sabbath, the Lord's-day, or Sunday?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is the meaning of that Prayer appointed to be used in our Church; [<hi>Lord have Mercy upon us, and encline, &amp;c.</hi>] as it is repeated after, and applied to the words of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether it be lawful to use any bodily recreation upon the Lord's-day? and if so, then what kind of Recreations may be used?</p>
            <p n="1">I. Concerning the Name <hi>Sabbatum,</hi> or Sabbath, I thus conceive;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in Scripture, Antiquity, and all Ecclesiastical Writers, it is constantly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the day of the Jews Sabbath, or Saturday; and not at all (till of late years) used to signifie our Lord's-day, or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That to call Sunday, by the name of the Sabbath-day, (<hi>rebus sic stantibus</hi>) may for sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry respects be allowed in the Christian Church without any great inconveniency: and that therefore men (otherwise sober and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105198:6"/>
moderate) ought not to be censured with too much severity, neither charged with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism, if sometimes they so speak.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That yet for sundry other respects it were perhaps much more expedient, if the word Sabbath (in that notion) were either not all, or else more sparingly used.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Concerning the name <hi>Dominica,</hi> or the Lord's-day:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it was taken up in memory of our Lord Christ's Resurrection, and the great work of our Redemption accomplished therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it hath warrant from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.10.) and hath been of long continued use in the Christian Church, to signifie the first day of the week, or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Concerning the name <hi>Dies Solis,</hi> or Sunday.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is taken from the courses of the Planets, as the names of the other daies are: the reason whereof is to be learned from Astronomers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it hath been used generally, and of long time, in most parts of the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is not justly chargeable with Heathenism; and that it proceedeth from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105198:7"/>
much weakness at the least, (if not rather superstition) that some men condemn the use of it, as prophane, heathenish, or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Of the fitness of the aforesaid three names compared one with another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That according to the several matter or occasions of speech, each of the three may be fitter in some respect, and more proper to be used than either of the other two; As, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Name <hi>Sabbath</hi>: when we speak of a time of rest <hi>indeterminatè,</hi> and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, without reference to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar day: and the other two, when we speak determinately of that day which is observed in the Christian Church. Of which two again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That of the <hi>Lord's-day</hi> is fitter, in the Theological and Ecclesiastical; and,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That of <hi>Sunday,</hi> in the civil, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and common use.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet so as that none of the three be condemned as utterly unlawful, whatsoever the matter or occasion be, but that every man be left to his Christian liberty herein, so long as so long as superior Authority doth not restrain it. Provided ever, that what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105198:7"/>
he doth herein, he do it without vanity or affectation in himself, or without uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly judging or despising his Brother that doth otherwise than himself doth.</p>
            <div n="2" type="question">
               <head>To the second Question.</head>
               <p n="5">V. The words of that Prayer, [<hi>Lord have mercy, &amp;c.</hi>] repeated after the fourth Commandment, do evidently import, as they do in each of the other ten.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An acknowledgment of three things, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the words of that particular Commandment contain in them a Law, whereunto we are subject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is our bounden duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour with our uttermost power to keep the said Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That our naughty hearts have (of themselves) no inclination to keep it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til God, by the work of his Grace, shall encline them thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A double supplication, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For mercy, in respect of the time past, because we have failed of our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den duty heretofore.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For Grace, in respect of the time
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105198:8"/>
to come, that we may perform our duties better hereafter.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But how far forth the words of the fourth Commandment are to be taken as a Law binding Christians, and by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they have that binding power, is the main difficulty.</p>
               <p>For the resolution whereof, it may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice every sober minded Christian, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Prayer appointed by the Church, in that meaning which the words do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately import, and without over-curious inquiry into those things that are more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, to believe these few points follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ought to be taken as certain and granted amongst Christians; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That no part of the Law delivered by <hi>Moses</hi> to the Jews, doth bind Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans under the Gospel, as by vertue of that delivery; no, not the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lves, but least of all the fourth, which all confess to be (at least) in some part Ceremonial.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the particular determination of the time to the seventh day of the week, was Ceremonial. And so the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the fourth Commandment in that respect, (although it were <hi>Iuris divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105198:8"/>
positivi</hi> to the Jew, yet) is ceased toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other legal Ceremonies since the publishing of the Gospel, and bindeth not Christian Consciences.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the substance of the fourth Commandment in the general, (<hi>viz.</hi> that some certain time should be set apart from secular imployments, to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to an holy rest, for the better attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God's publick and solemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) is moral and perpetual, and of Divine right, as a branch of the Law of Nature, whereunto Christians under the Gospel are still bound.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That <hi>de facto,</hi> the Lord's-day, or Sunday, is the time appointed to us for that purpose by such sufficient Authority, as we stand bound in Conscience to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: <hi>abs<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> hoc,</hi> whether that Authority be immediately Divine, or but mediately through the power of the Church.</p>
               <p>This is sufficient to regulate the judgment and Conscience of every ordinary Christian; yet is it not unlawful for Scholars (soberly and fairly) to argue and debate a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s which are questionable, for the better finding out of the Truth.</p>
               <p>And the points in this Argument that are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105198:9"/>
most in controversy, are these two, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the observation of a weekly Sabbath; whether it be of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to keep one day of every seven? And by what right we are tied so to do?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the change of the Jewish Sabbath into the Lord's-day; and by what Authority it was done.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. As touching the observation of a weekly Sabbath; there are these three differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent opinions, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is <hi>de jure naturali,</hi> as a branch properly of the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is properly and directly <hi>de jure divino positivo</hi>; established by God's express positive Ordinance in his Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is meerly <hi>de jure humano &amp; Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastico</hi>; introduced by Authority, and established by the custom and consent of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Touching which three opinions, I leave it to the judicious to consider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the last of them might not hap to be of evil consequence, by leaving i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the power of the Church, at her pleasure to change the old proportion of one in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (which hath continued ever since the daies of <hi>Moses</hi>) into any other greater o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> lesser proportion of time?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105198:9"/>2. Whether the two former opinions (though they do indeed avoid that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience) do not yet stand upon such weak grounds otherwise, that they are by many degrees more improbable than the third?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether a fourth opinion going in a middle way, might not be proposed with greater probability, and entertained with better safety than any of the former three? <hi>viz.</hi> That the keeping holy of one day in seven, is of Divine positive right, taking <hi>jus divinum</hi> in a large signification: not for that only which is primarily, properly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly such, according to the tenor of the second opinion; but including withal that which is Secondarily, Consequently, and Analogically such.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. For the better understanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we are to consider;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That those things are <hi>de jure divino</hi> in the first and strict sense: which either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Are enjoyned by the express Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Commandment of God in his holy Word; or else,</p>
               <p n="2">2. May be deduced there-from by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, evident, and demonstrative illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In which sense, there are not many things
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105198:10"/>
                  <hi>de jure divino</hi> under the New Testament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That for a thing to be <hi>de jure divino</hi> in the latter and larger sense, it sufficeth that it may be by humane Discourse upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Congruity probably deduced from the Word of God, as a thing most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be observed by all such as desire unfeignedly to order their waies according to God's holy Will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this kind of <hi>Ius divinum</hi> may be reasonably discerned by the concurrence of all, or the chiefest of these four things following, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A foundation of Equity for the thing in general, either in the Law of Nature, or by vertue of Divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Analogie held for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar determination, with such Laws and directions as were given to the Jewish people in the Old Testament, so far as the reason of Equity holdeth alike.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some probable insinuations thereof in the Scriptures of the New Testament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The continued practise of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, so far as the condition of the times in the several Ages thereof would permit. For, <hi>Lex currit cum praxi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:105198:10"/>4. That all these do in some measure concur for the observation of a weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; as upon the examination of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral particulars will easily appear.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. This distinction of <hi>Ius divinum</hi> is to be observed the rather, because it may be of very good use, (if rightly understood and applied.)</p>
               <p n="1">1. For cutting off the most material in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which are usually brought by the Romish Party for the maintenance of their unwritten Traditions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the clearing of some, and the silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of other some Controversies in the Church, which are disputed <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> with much heat; as, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Government of the Church by Bishops.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Distinction of Bishops, Priests and Deacons.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Exercise of Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, as Suspension, Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Building and Consecrating of Churches for the service of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The assembling of Synods upon needful occasions, for the maintenance of the Truth, and for the setling of Church Affairs.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:105198:11"/>6. The forbidding of Marriages to be made within certain degrees of Consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>finity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Baptizing of Infants born of Christian Parents.</p>
               <p n="7">8. The maintenance of the Clergy by the Tithes of the people, and sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: none of all which (to my understanding) seem to be <hi>de jure divino</hi> in that first and proper sense; but yet all (or most) of them to be <hi>de jure divino</hi> in this latter and larger signification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the right bounding of the Churches power, that she be neither denied her law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful liberty in some things, nor yet assume to her self a greater power than of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto her in other some. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In things that are meerly <hi>de jure humano</hi>; every particular Church hath power in her self from time to time, to order, and alter them at her pleasure, and may exercise that power when she think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Things that are <hi>de jure divino</hi> in that first sense, the Universal Church may not (and much less then may any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) at all take upon her to alter, but must observe them inviolably, whatsoever ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105198:11"/>
or distresses she be put unto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Things that are <hi>de jure divino</hi> in this latter sense; every particular Church (but much more the Universal) hath a power to alter in a case of necessity: But the exercise of that Power is so limited to extraordinary cases, that it may not be safe for her at all to exercise it; unless it be for the avoiding of mighty inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, not otherwise to be avoided.</p>
               <p n="10">X. As for the other controversed Point, touching the change of the day, from the last day of the week, or Saturday, (which was the Jews Sabbath) to the first day of the week, or Sunday, which is our Lord's-day: My opinion is, that the observation of the Lord's-day among Christians instead of the Jewish Sabbath,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is not grounded upon any command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given by Christ to his Apostles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor yet upon any Apostolical Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution given by the Apostles unto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in that behalf. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it was taken up by the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church; partly in imitation of some of the Apostles, who used (especially in the Churches of the Gentiles; for in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Iudea</hi> the old Sabbath was still ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105198:12"/>
to Celebrate their Holy Assemblies upon the first day of the week, in the honour of Christ and his Resurrection; and partly for the avoiding of Judaism, wherewith false Teachers in those first times were ever and anon attempting to enthral the Christian Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the observation of the Lord's-day, having been confirmed by so many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions both Ecclesiastical and Imperial, and having withal continued with such uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form consent throughout the whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World, for so many Ages ever since the Apostles times; the Church (not to dispute what she may or may not do <hi>in plenitudine potestatis,</hi> yet) ought not to attempt the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of it to any other day of the week.</p>

               <head>To the third Question.</head>
               <p n="11">XI. In this matter touching Recreations to be used on the Lords-day, much need not be said, there being little difficulty in it, and His Majesties last Declaration in that behalf having put it past Disputation. I say then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For the Thing.</hi> That no man can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably condemn the moderate use of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

               <p n="1">1. To the Publick Laws of the State. Such games or sports as are by Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, (though in themselves otherwise lawful) being unlawful to them that are under the obedience of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the condition of the Person.

For the <hi>evil consequents</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to ensue upon such Marriages, are so many and great, that the conveniences which men may promise to themselves from the same (if they should answer expectation, as seldom they do to the full) laid in an equal ballance there-against, would not turn the scale; and in one respect the danger is greater to marry with a Papist, than with one of a worse Religion; for that the main Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his Religion, (as a <hi>Papist</hi>) is more destructive of the comfort of a Conjugal Society, than are the Principles of most Hereticks; yea, than those of <hi>Pagans,</hi> or <hi>Atheists</hi>; for holding that there is no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility but in the Church; and that none is in the Church, but such as acknowledg Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the See of <hi>Rome</hi>; it is not possible, but that the Husband must needs conclude his Wife to be in the <hi>state of Damnation,</hi> so long as she continueth <hi>Protestant</hi>: whence one of these two great inconveniences will unavoidably follow; that either he will use all endeavors, engins, and artifices, to draw her to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (as indeed who can blame him to bring his Wife into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of everlasting Salvation?) the rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

            <p>First, whether the Parents of the young Person be living or no, one or both? if both
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105198:17"/>
be dead, the <hi>Temptations</hi> from them (which in such <hi>Cases</hi> are wont to prevail very much) are by their Death clearly <hi>superseded</hi>; and then the danger is by so much less: but if either be living, there can be little security of the Sons <hi>continuance</hi> in the <hi>Protestants Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> (notwithstanding his present Profession thereof) when he shall be <hi>assaulted</hi> with the <hi>whole Authority</hi> of them, to whom he oweth <hi>Reverence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> with what degree of <hi>Confidence,</hi> and with what kind of <hi>asseverations</hi> he <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>denieth</hi> the <hi>other Religion</hi>; for although they out of <hi>design</hi> put on a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit vizor, use all the art they can to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it</hi>; yet very seldom can it be done so <hi>cunningly, warily,</hi> and <hi>constantly,</hi> but that at some time or other, the <hi>dissimulation</hi> will unawares bewray it self to the <hi>eye</hi> of a <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious observer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> what measure of understanding the young Person (who is, you say, of <hi>great Abilities</hi> for his Age) hath in the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Articles</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi>; those I mean, wherein the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Romish Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> are at <hi>agreement,</hi> for in <hi>those</hi> the <hi>substance</hi> of <hi>Christianity consisteth</hi>; he that rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands those <hi>Catholick Truths</hi> taught in

the <hi>Catechisms</hi> of both Churches, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which all <hi>Christendom</hi> (in a manner) are at a <hi>perfect accord</hi>; and then will but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himself to consider, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth not <hi>impose</hi> upon the <hi>judgments</hi> and <hi>consciences</hi> of her <hi>Members,</hi> any thing to be <hi>believed,</hi> or received, as of <hi>necessity</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> than what is <hi>truly Catholick,</hi> and by her Adversaries confessed so to be; and consequently, that the <hi>difference</hi> betwixt <hi>her</hi> and the <hi>Romish Party,</hi> is wholly about those <hi>Additionals</hi> or <hi>Superstructures,</hi> which they of the <hi>Roman Faith</hi> require to be <hi>believed,</hi> and <hi>received</hi> with like <hi>necessity</hi> as the <hi>former</hi>; but appear to us of this <hi>Church respectively,</hi> either <hi>evidently false,</hi> or of <hi>doubtful truth,</hi> or not of <hi>absolute necessity</hi> to be <hi>believed</hi>: I say, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever well considereth this, may rest <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> in his <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>conscience,</hi> that the <hi>Faith taught</hi> and <hi>professed</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>safe way</hi> to lead a <hi>Christian Believer</hi> to <hi>Eternal Salvation,</hi> if he withal lead his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>conversation</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable thereunto.</p>
            <p>To the last particular in your Letter, all the return I have to make, is no more but an humble acknowledgment and sense of his <hi>Lordships</hi> noble favors towards me, in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

is conversant; as when a man <hi>voweth</hi> to do something, which is not in it self, and for the substance of the matter <hi>simply unlawful</hi> to be done; but yet <hi>voweth</hi> it, either rashly, and without due advertisement, or for some indirect and unwarrantable end, or upon slight and insufficient inducements, or the like, any of these <hi>Obliquities</hi> are enough to make the <hi>vow unlawful,</hi> in respect of the act of <hi>vowing</hi>; yet because these <hi>Obliquities</hi> do not necessarily pass upon the matter it self, or the thing <hi>vowed,</hi> but may be severed from it; therefore, though the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>vowing</hi> were sinful, the <hi>Vow</hi> it self for all that may stand good, and bind the Party to performance; but where the <hi>sinful obliquity</hi> passeth upon the substance of the matter, or adhereth insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably thereunto; there not only the act of vowing is sinful, but the <hi>performance</hi> also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh unlawful: In which <hi>Cases</hi> those other saying ought rather to have place, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramentum non debet esse vinculum iniquitatis, in malis promissis rescinde fidem, in turpi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105198:27"/>
because here the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>promise</hi> seemeth not to be in it self <hi>unlawful,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on her part; for if the Gentleman her Friend, were presently free from the Bond of Matrimony by the death of his Wife, as the Gentlewoman now is by the death of her Husband, they might perform what they had promised either to other, by joyning themselves in Matrimony, and that without sin, which is an argument that the <hi>sinful obliquity</hi> was only in the act of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; which therefore they ought to repent of: but doth not cleave to the matter of the promise, which therefore they ought not to <hi>violate.</hi> To this I answer, what in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is true, That if both the Parties were now actually free from the Marriage bond, they not only <hi>lawfully</hi> might, but were in Conscience bound (unless some other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful impediment should hinder) to joyn themselves together in <hi>Matrimony,</hi> because none of the fore-mentioned <hi>Obliquities,</hi> which made the former act of promising unlawful, would fall upon the after-<hi>act</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi> to make it unlawful. But that <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> is not direct to the Point in hand, nor to the Case as it is propounded; for it may be observed from the very form of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105198:27"/>
that the matter of the promise, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Parties interchangeably bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, was not to <hi>Marry</hi> together, when they should be both free; upon which false ground the Objection runneth; that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the thing they aimed at therein; but the end is one thing, and the matter another: but the very matter of the promise was, the continuance of their mutual affection either to other, with a resolution to stay the one for the other, when either Party should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be free from the bond of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Matrimony, till the other should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so free. The continuance of which <hi>affection</hi> and resolution, will upon examination be found subject to all, or some of the three <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquities</hi> aforesaid; and therefore as such an affection and resolution, could not be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the first without sin; so neither can they be now continued in without sin; for so long as they continue, the first of the said <hi>Obliquities</hi> remaineth still, both on his part and hers; the second indeed by the death of the Husband is ceased on her part, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth still on his, and the third contrarily being on his part ceased, remaineth still on hers, as will evidently appear to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of any man that shall take the pains to examine it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the Gentlewoman out of the serious consideration of the Promises, be brought to a through feeling of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousness of those sins which she hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against God, and wherein she hath so long continued, that so she may not only be humbled in his sight with true contrition of heart, and remorse for the same, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the greatness thereof; but also be provoked to a proportionable measure of thankfulness unto him, for his gracious goodness in restraining her unlawful affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from breaking out into actual unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and preserving her when she had run out so far in an evil way, from rushing into more desperate Extremities; for <hi>Erranti nullus terminus:</hi> as a stone that tumbleth down a steep hill, so mans corruption, when it is once set on going, hath no stay of it self till it come to the bottom of <hi>Hell,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Lord lay a stop in the way: and it is to be acknowledged a blessed act of God's merciful Providence, when we have let loose
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105198:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the reins to our own <hi>lusts</hi> in any kind, if they be bridled from running headlong into all excess of wickedness; great sins require more than ordinary Repentance, and great mercies more than ordinary Thankfulness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That having thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her self before God by inward Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, she also make an outward free Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of her said sins, to him whom God hath delegated a Ministerial Power to remit sins, that she may receive Comfort and Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his Mouth; I mean the Priest: and this I think meetest to be done to the Bishop of the Diocess, with one or more of his <hi>Presbytery,</hi> such as he shall think good to take to him to assist him; or else to some other by his appointment; because the Bishop is the chief Pastor, to whom the care of souls most immediately belongeth, within his own Diocess: besides that, both the quality of the person, (if she be of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and Rank) and the weightiness of the case, make it so much the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for his <hi>cognisance</hi>: But howsoever it would be done to a Man of <hi>approved Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and such an one as will be both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate, and secret, wherein the more freely she shall make confession of her said
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105198:30"/>
sins, and the more chearfully she shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject her self to perform such further Acts, whether of <hi>Humiliation</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> as the Bishop or Priest shall advise to be done, in testimony of her <hi>unfeigned Repentance,</hi> the more sound comfort undoubtedly will the <hi>sentence</hi> of <hi>Absolution</hi> bring unto the <hi>soul.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. This done, then <hi>thirdly,</hi> that she endeavor by all <hi>fair means,</hi> that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman also her <hi>friend</hi> and <hi>partner,</hi> in the aforesaid Promise, may be brought to the like sight and acknowledgment of the great sins that were enwrapped in that <hi>act,</hi> and to a true perswasion withal, that so long as he continueth in the former unlawful affection and resolution, he is not only still under the guilt of those sins, but also in <hi>near danger</hi> (without God's great mercy preventing it) of falling into other and greater sins, for which purpose it will be expedient, that he be truly and effectually dealt withal, (yet with as much <hi>lenity</hi> as the <hi>state</hi> of his <hi>Soul</hi> will suffer, and withall possible secresie) and that by some such person especially as he holdeth a <hi>reverend Opinion</hi> of both for <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi>; and to procure that this be done, the Gentlewoman ought to take it into her own especial care; which it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105198:31"/>
will concern her to do, not only in Christian Charity for the good of his Soul, but in <hi>Christian Wisdom</hi> also for her own future <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> and <hi>security.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. For when he shall be once throughly convinced in his judgment and conscience, of the unlawfulness of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made between them, and of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inconveniences that attend the <hi>continued purpose</hi> of <hi>fulfilling</hi> it, there is a fair way open for that which is <hi>next</hi> &amp; <hi>fourthly</hi> to be done, <hi>viz.</hi> That he be then earnestly moved for his <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the said <hi>Promise</hi> to the Gentlewoman, which (being it was but a <hi>meer Promise,</hi> and no <hi>Vow,</hi> as in the <hi>first Point</hi> hath already been shewed) he hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a <hi>full power</hi> to make, and this also to be done in the <hi>presence</hi> of such Persons, as they shall make choice of betwixt themselves to be <hi>witnesses</hi> of the said <hi>Release</hi>; for although the Promise being <hi>utterly unlawful,</hi> hath no power to bind, and so there needeth no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease,</hi> as of absolute necessity, in reward of the thing it self; yet such <hi>Release</hi> may be very <hi>behoveful</hi> in regard of the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans person, and for the quieting of her conscience, in case there should remain any fears or scruples behind, lest perhaps her
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105198:31"/>
                  <hi>promise</hi> should <hi>still bind</hi> her; for as <hi>Satan</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to <hi>benum</hi> the <hi>Conscience</hi> with <hi>security,</hi> to make men bold to commit sins without scruple, till he has drawn them into the <hi>snare</hi>; so when he seeth them offer to get out of the <hi>snare</hi> again by <hi>Repentance,</hi> he is very cunning to inject <hi>needless scruples</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> if possibly he can, to hold them in by means thereof; wherefore I hold it very expedient, that such a <hi>Release,</hi> if it may be obtained, be not neglected; for thereby the binding power of the <hi>Promise,</hi> though we should suppose it lawful, should be quite taken away, so as there need no scruple to remain: <hi>Abundans Cautela non nocet,</hi> is a safe <hi>Aphorism</hi>; as wary men when they pay mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, besides seeing the <hi>Book</hi> crost, will crave to have an <hi>Acquittance</hi>: So it may be some <hi>satisfaction</hi> to the Gentlewomans mind, to have a solemn <hi>Release</hi> before <hi>witness,</hi> which say it should be more than needeth, yet can do no harm howsoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that the Gentlewoman all the while before, and so ever after (that time only excepted, when the <hi>Relaxation</hi> should be made, for then it is requisite she should be personally present) carefully avoid the company of that Gentleman, and <hi>he</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:105198:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
likewise <hi>hers,</hi> so far as conveniently may be; but at leastwise, by no means <hi>converse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> with any familiarity, especially in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; lest the former <hi>unlawful affection</hi> should rekindle in either Party, and so the <hi>disease</hi> after some measure of <hi>Cure</hi> grow to a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps,</hi> which many times proves more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than the <hi>first malady</hi>; for commonly when the <hi>unclean spirit</hi> is ejected by <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> if once he make himself <hi>master</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> again (as he will attempt it, and without a good watch happily effect it) he will be sure at the <hi>re-entry,</hi> to come with a <hi>new strength,</hi> and that <hi>seven-fold</hi> to what he had before, and <hi>needs must the end of that man be worse than the beginning:</hi> she must therefore resolve to shun all <hi>likely occasions</hi> of falling again into the same snare, so far as the quality of her person and condition, and the <hi>common affairs</hi> of <hi>life</hi> will permit: And she had need also to use her best care and diligence (praying to God daily for Grace to strengthen her thereunto) to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> all <hi>wicked temptations</hi> of the <hi>flesh,</hi> that she be no more <hi>foiled</hi> thereby, neither <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled</hi> again in such <hi>sinful inconveniences,</hi> as by God's Mercy she shall be now <hi>freed</hi> from.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. If in these <hi>Directions,</hi> I be thought to <hi>deal</hi> with too much <hi>rigour</hi> and <hi>strictness,</hi> it would be considered:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> that it's much better to put the <hi>Patient</hi> to a little more pain at the first, than by <hi>skinning</hi> the wound over, to heal it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully; and to suffer it to <hi>rankle inward</hi>; which will breed a great deal more <hi>grief</hi> at last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That since all men (through cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>Self-love,</hi> and privy <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> cleaving to our <hi>depraved nature</hi>) are <hi>partial</hi> towards <hi>themselves,</hi> and apt to deal more <hi>favourably</hi> with their own sins than they ought; it is therefore safest for them (in their own Cases especially) to encline to <hi>severity</hi> rather than <hi>indulgence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there may be a <hi>mitigation</hi> used of the <hi>present Directions,</hi> according as the state of the <hi>Patient</hi> (in the several va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations thereof) shall require; but that (for the avoiding of <hi>partiality</hi>) not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>sole liberty</hi> of the <hi>party himself,</hi> but rather to be done by the <hi>advice</hi> of a <hi>Ghostly Physitian,</hi> who if he be a man of such <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>moderation</hi> as is meet, will I doubt not allow a greater <hi>indulgence</hi> in case she see it expedient, than it could be safe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105198:33"/>
for the Party her self to take of her own head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That in all this Discourse, I take not upon me to write <hi>Edicts,</hi> but to give my advice, that is to say, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the <hi>judgment</hi> of others, if any shall see cause to <hi>dissent,</hi> but to deliver my <hi>own opinion</hi> (being requested thereunto by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Friend) with such a <hi>faithfulness</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> as becometh me to do; and truly those Parties whom it most concerneth, ought not to <hi>blame</hi> me for it howsoever; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as there can be no cause to <hi>suspect</hi> that I should be carried with any <hi>personal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects</hi> to be <hi>partial</hi> either for or against either of them; so God is my witness, whom I desire to serve, I had not any intimation at all given me, neither yet have so much as the least conjecture in the World, who either of them both might be.</p>

               <p n="1">1. MEns <hi>imployments</hi> are of two sorts. The <hi>one</hi> of such as any man may (without blame from <hi>others,</hi> or scruple with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himself) follow, meerly upon his own <hi>score,</hi> if he find himself in some measure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able for it, and have a mind thereunto; he hath a power in himself (and that <hi>jure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio,</hi> by a <hi>primitive</hi> and <hi>original right,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any necessary <hi>derivation</hi> from others) to dispose of himself, his time and industry in that way; for the exercise of which power,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105198:35"/>
there needeth no special or positive <hi>warrant</hi> from any other person, but it is presumed he is, (as in relation to others) sufficiently warranted thereunto in this, in that he is not by any <hi>Superior Authority,</hi> Divine or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, <hi>forbidden</hi> so to do; and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that men betake themselves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>liking,</hi> to <hi>Husbandry, Merchandize, Manual Occupations,</hi> the <hi>study of the Law,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But <hi>another sort</hi> of <hi>Imployments</hi> there are, whereunto a man hath not a <hi>just right</hi> primitively, and of himself, neither may he <hi>lawfully exercise</hi> the same meerly upon his own choice, but it is necessary, that that power should be derived upon him from some such person or persons, as have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authority to warrant him for so doing: Such is the <hi>Imployment</hi> of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> a <hi>Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> an <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bitrator, &amp;c.</hi> which are therefore said to be <hi>juris delegati,</hi> because the right that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y man hath to such <hi>Imployments,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crueth unto him by virtue of that Authority which he receiveth by <hi>Delegation</hi> of <hi>Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> from some other that hath a right by <hi>Command, Election, Nomination,</hi> or otherwise to <hi>Impower</hi> him thereunto, whence are those usual forms, <hi>Quo jure, Quo warranto? Who
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105198:35"/>
made thee a Iudge? By what Authority dost thou those things</hi>? Or, <hi>Who gave thee this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>? A man may betake himself to the <hi>Study,</hi> and so to the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Laws,</hi> of his own accord, but he may not take upon him to be a <hi>Iudge,</hi> without <hi>Commission</hi> from his <hi>Sovereign</hi>; so he may follow <hi>Husbandry,</hi> and <hi>Merchandry,</hi> upon his own choice, but he may not do the Office of a <hi>Constable,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he be chosen by the <hi>Neighbours</hi>; or of an <hi>Arbitrator,</hi> unless chosen by the Parties thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now, although as well the one sort as the other, after a man hath addicted himself to the one, or is deputed to the other, may not unfitly be termed his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling,</hi> and the <hi>latter</hi> perhaps with better <hi>propriety</hi> than the former, (for the word <hi>Calling</hi> properly importeth the <hi>Action</hi> of some other person) yet according to the common Notion, which by custom of speech among us, we have of these terms [<hi>The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and the Particular Calling</hi>] the <hi>Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the <hi>former sort,</hi> are usually taken to be the <hi>Particular Calling</hi> of Men, and those of the <hi>latter sort,</hi> will be found (if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) to fall rather under the <hi>General Calling,</hi> as branches or parts thereof, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105198:36"/>
as the exercise of such Imployments, is a part of that <hi>moral duty,</hi> which all men (according to their several respective Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) ought to perform to others, being by them <hi>impowred</hi> thereunto, upon the tie of <hi>Obedience, Contract, Friendship,</hi> &amp;c. but for <hi>distinction sake,</hi> as the <hi>Latins</hi> make a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between <hi>vitae institutum</hi> and <hi>munus,</hi> we may call those of the <hi>former sort, Mans Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> and those of the <hi>latter sort</hi> his <hi>Office</hi>; so a Man is by <hi>Profession</hi> a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> by <hi>Office</hi> a <hi>Iudge</hi>; by <hi>Profession</hi> an <hi>Husbandman</hi>; by <hi>Office</hi> a <hi>Constable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. To bring this <hi>Discourse</hi> home to the <hi>present business,</hi> we are next to enquire, to whether sort of the two, the Imployment of a <hi>Souldier</hi> doth more properly appertain; that is, whether we are to conceive of it as a <hi>Profession</hi> which a man may at his <hi>own choice</hi> fix upon, as his <hi>particular vocation</hi>; or rather as an <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>service,</hi> which he is to <hi>undergo,</hi> when by the <hi>command</hi> of his <hi>Prince,</hi> he shall be thereto <hi>appointed,</hi> and so to come rather under the notion of a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Calling</hi>? To me it seemeth clearly to be of the <hi>latter sort.</hi> For, (1.) in the passage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>No man that warreth, entangleth himself in the affairs of this life,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105198:36"/>
that he may please him that hath chosen him to be a Souldier</hi>; the word is <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) annexed,</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to imply, as if he <hi>supposed</hi> that no man might go to <hi>war,</hi> unless he were <hi>chosen</hi> for that <hi>service</hi> by some other person that might command it. Nor do I see (2.) what good construction can be otherwise made of that <hi>speech</hi> of our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 29.57. <hi>All they that take the Sword, shall perish with the Sword</hi>; or what should be the crime there intended to be signified, by this Phrase of <hi>taking the Sword,</hi> if it be not <hi>this,</hi> for a man to <hi>take</hi> the <hi>Sword</hi> into his <hi>hand</hi> by his <hi>own Authority,</hi> before it be <hi>put</hi> into his <hi>hand</hi> by that <hi>Supream Power,</hi> whom God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>trusted</hi> with the <hi>bearing</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging</hi> of it. Now, (3.) can that be said to be a <hi>Mans Profession,</hi> or <hi>particular Calling,</hi> which men of all Professions are (in <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to their <hi>Governors,</hi> and for the <hi>service</hi> of their <hi>Countrey) bound</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they shall be by <hi>Lawful Authority, called</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi> thereunto.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If these <hi>premises</hi> will be <hi>granted,</hi> it will soon appear, that the <hi>answer</hi> to the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion proposed,</hi> in the beginning of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

               <p n="2">2. Most certain it is, that properly and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally the <hi>power</hi> to <hi>dispose</hi> of Mans Life (<hi>Ius vitae &amp; necis</hi>) belongeth to <hi>God alone,</hi> who is, <hi>Dominus vitae &amp; necis,</hi> as the <hi>sole Author</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> so the <hi>sole Lord</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi>: some part of which <hi>power,</hi> since it hath pleased him for the good of <hi>humane Society,</hi> (in the preservation of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> and the punishment of such as are enemies to either) to communicate unto men, (which power so communicated, is that which we use to call <hi>Ius Gladii,</hi> or the

               <p n="3">3.

that with <hi>licence</hi> from his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> he may serve under another Prince, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do such execution as we now speak of; because the Sovereign by so licensing him, doth really refer him over from himself to <hi>anothers judgment,</hi> and consequently warrant him to follow the same, and so render him capable (upon the others acceptance) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute it. All this is true, but nothing to our purpose, because it doth <hi>destruere suppositum</hi>; for we now suppose the Case of a <hi>Souldier</hi> putting himself into service, under a <hi>Foreiner</hi> of his own mind, and where <hi>himself thinketh good,</hi> without the <hi>knowledg</hi> or <hi>licence</hi> of his own <hi>lawful Sovereign.</hi>

for the same purpose; and the reason of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> thereof is, because every <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State</hi> is (in relation to other Princes and States) but as one <hi>private man</hi> to <hi>another</hi>; for being called to the <hi>Regiment</hi> of his <hi>own people</hi> only, he is but as a <hi>private man</hi> in <hi>Aliena Republica.</hi>

IN judging of <hi>Cases</hi> of <hi>Scandal,</hi> we are not so much to look at the <hi>event,</hi> what that is, or may be; as at the <hi>cause</hi> whence it cometh; for sometimes there is given <hi>just cause</hi> of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and yet no <hi>Scandal</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, because it is not taken: sometimes <hi>Scandal</hi> is taken, and yet no <hi>just cause given</hi>; and sometimes there is both <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal given,</hi> and <hi>Scandal</hi> thereat <hi>taken</hi>: but no man is concerned in any <hi>Scandal</hi> that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to another, by occasion of any thing <hi>done</hi> by him; neither is <hi>chargeable</hi> with it, farther than he is <hi>guilty</hi> of having <hi>given it</hi>: If then we <hi>give Scandal</hi> to others, and they <hi>take</hi> it not, we are to bear a share in the <hi>blame</hi> as well as <hi>they,</hi> and that a <hi>deeper sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:105198:51"/>
how far forth the <hi>danger</hi> thereof <hi>may,</hi> or <hi>may not oblige us</hi> to the <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>not doing</hi> any thing <hi>proposed,</hi> the <hi>Resolution</hi> will come on much the <hi>easier</hi>; if we shall but rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, what it is to <hi>give Scandal,</hi> or how many waies a man may become guilty of <hi>scandalizing another</hi> by his <hi>example.</hi> The waies (as I conceive) are but these <hi>four.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>first</hi> is, when a man doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before another man, which is in it self <hi>evil, unlawful,</hi> and <hi>sinful</hi>; in which <hi>Case,</hi> neither the intention of him that <hi>doth it,</hi> nor the <hi>event,</hi> as to him that seeth it done, is of any <hi>consideration</hi>; for it mattereth not whether the doer had an intention to draw the other into sin thereby, or not: neither doth it matter whether the other were thereby induced to commit sin or not: the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>action</hi> being <hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>done</hi> before others, is sufficient to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>doer guilty</hi> of having <hi>given Scandal,</hi> though he had neither any intention himself so to do; nor were any person <hi>actually scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized</hi> thereby; because whatsoever is in it self, and in its own nature evil, is also of it self, and in its own nature <hi>scandalous,</hi> and of <hi>evil example.</hi> Thus did <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> give <hi>Scandal</hi> by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>second</hi> way is, when a man doth something before another, with a <hi>direct</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and <hi>formal purpose</hi> of drawing him thereby to commit sin; in which Case, neither the matter of the <hi>action,</hi> nor the <hi>event</hi> is of any <hi>consideration,</hi> for it maketh no difference (as to the sin of <hi>giving Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>) whether any man be <hi>effectually enticed</hi> thereby to commit sin, or not; neither doth it make any difference, whether the thing done were in it self unlawful or nor, so as it had but an appearance of evil; and from thence an <hi>aptitude</hi> to <hi>draw</hi> another to do that (by <hi>imitation</hi>) which should be <hi>really</hi> and <hi>intri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4.

            <head>The CASE of the ENGAGEMENT.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have hitherto been very sparing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering my opinion concerning the point now most in agitation, <hi>viz. Of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of Subscribing the Engagement:</hi> considering the mischiefs that must needs have followed, if it should be once noised abroad, that I had given forth any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in so tickle a point. I could not but foresee on the one side, if I should condemn it as utterly unlawful, how I should be looked upon by those that have all power in their hands, not as a refuser only, but a disswader also of what they have thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: And on the other side, if I should allow it in any case lawful, what ill use would certainly be made thereof by multitudes of people, apt to be so far scandalized thereby, as either to swallow it whole without chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (that is, resting themselves upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral determination of the lawfulness to take it in hand over head, without due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105198:58"/>
either of the true meaning of it, or of other requisite cautions and circumstances) or else to conceive themselves by so enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, to be for ever discharged from the bond of their former <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet since by your Letter, and by sending your servant therewith on purpose so many daies journey, through unknown waies, and at this season of the year (especially as the weather hath proved since his coming forth) scarce passable, you have shewn your earnest desire to understand what my opinion is in this point; so great, both for difficulty and concernment; I could not think it fit, nor consistent with that civility which is to be used, especially towards Strangers, to send back your messenger without the return of some kind of answer: Wherein, albeit I shall not come up to the full, of what your Letter declareth to be your desire, <hi>viz. In giving a particular Iudgment and estimate of the Eight several Arguments therein proposed, and the additional</hi> Quaere <hi>in the Postscript:</hi> yet you shall find something tending towards your satisfaction therein, by touching upon those points (so far as the straits of time would suffer) wherein the difficulty of the whole business seemeth chiefly to consist.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:105198:58"/>
               <hi>First</hi> then, it is to be considered, that <hi>Allegiance</hi> is a duty that every Subject, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what form of Government soever, by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> oweth to his Countrey, and consequently to the Sovereign Power thereof. For the very same Law (which we may call the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> at least in a large acceptation) which inclineth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men to grow into one civil body of a Common-wealth, must necessarily withal, imprint a sense, and tacite acknowledgment of such a duty of <hi>Allegiance</hi> in every infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior member of the body, unto the <hi>Caput Communitatis,</hi> or Sovereign Power, by which that Common-wealth is governed, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the preservation of the whole body. So that the bond of <hi>Allegiance</hi> doth not arise originally from the <hi>Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>; as if those that had not taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> had a greater liberty to act contrary to the <hi>Allegiance</hi> specified in the <hi>Oath,</hi> than those that have taken it, have: or as if, in case the <hi>Oath</hi> should be quite laid aside, there should be no <hi>Allegiance</hi> due. But it is so intrinsecal, proper, and essential a duty, and (as it were) fundamental, to the relation of a Subject, <hi>quâ talis,</hi> as that the very name of a Subject doth, after a sort, import it;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105198:59"/>
insomuch, that it hath thereupon gained, in common usage of speech, the stile of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Allegiance</hi>: Whence all these inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>bond</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> (whether sworn or not sworn) is in the nature of it <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>indispensable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is so inseparable, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Subject, that although the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it, may be suspended by reason of a prevailing force, whilest the Subject is under such force, (<hi>viz.</hi> where it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, how the endeavour of exercising it can be effectually serviceable to restore the Sovereign Power to the right owner, for the establishment of that Publick Justice and Peace wherein the happiness of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths consisteth) yet no outward force can so absolutely take it away, or remove it, but that still it remaineth vertually in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and obligeth to an endeavour (so soon as the force that hindered it is over) of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exercising of it, for the advantage of the party, to whom of right it is due, and the advancement of the common good thereby, upon all fit occasions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That no Subject of <hi>England,</hi> that either hath, by taking the Oaths of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:105198:59"/>
or <hi>Allegiance,</hi> acknowledged; or that not having taken either Oath, yet otherwise knoweth, or believeth, that the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to whom his <hi>Natural Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi> is due, is <hi>the King, his Heirs, and lawful Successors,</hi> can without sinning against his Conscience, enter into any <hi>Covenant, Promise,</hi> or <hi>Engagement,</hi> or do any other <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> whatsoever, whereby either to transfer his <hi>Allegiance</hi> to any other party, to whom it is not of right due, or to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into an incapacity of performing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his <hi>bounden Allegiance</hi> to his lawful Sovereign, when it may appear to be useful and serviceable to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That therefore the taking of the late <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> by any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>England</hi> (notwithstanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation in the Preface, that therein he <hi>had the Honour of the King before his eyes</hi>; and that express clause in one of the <hi>Articles</hi> of it, wherein he swore, <hi>The Preservation of the Kings Person and Honour</hi>) was an act as clear contrary to the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> and the <hi>Natural Duty</hi> of every Subject of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; as the <hi>Assisting of the King to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of ones power</hi> (which is a branch of the Oaths) and the assisting against any person
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105198:60"/>
whatsoever, with his utmost power, those that were actually in Arms against the King (which was the very end for which that Covenant was set on foot) are contrary the one unto the other.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And that also for the same reason, no Subject of <hi>England,</hi> that hath taken the Oaths, and understandeth them, or is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that the Sovereignty of this Realm doth of right belong to the King, his Heirs, and lawful Successors, can without sinning in like manner against his Conscience, take the <hi>Engagement</hi> now offered: if he so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the words, wherein it is expressed, as if they did contain in them, and require of the Promiser, an acknowledgment that the Supream Power of this Realm, whereunto the Subjects owe their <hi>bounden Allegiance,</hi> is rightly vested in those persons that now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise it; or as if they did import an utter abjuration, or renouncing of that <hi>Allegiance</hi> which was formerly held due to the King.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This being cleared, the next enquiry must be, Whether or no <hi>the words of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi> will reasonably bear such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, as to the understanding of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and conscientious man, may seem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105198:60"/>
with his <hi>bounden duty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to his lawful Sovereign? Whereof (I think) there need be no great question made, if it be well considered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all expressions by words, are subject to such ambiguities, that scarce any thing can be said or exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>essed in any words, how cautelously soever chosen, which will not render the whole speech capable of more constructions than one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That very many men, known to be well affected to the King and his Party, and reputed otherwaies both learned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious (not to mention the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> most of whom, truly for my own part, when we speak of learning and conscience, I hold to be very little considerable) have subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Engagement; who in the judgment of Charity, we are to presume, would not so have done, if they had not been perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the words might be understood in some such qualified sense, as might stand with the duty of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the King.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That (as you write) it is strong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and believed, that the King hath given way to the tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng of the Engagement, rather than that his good Subjects should lose their Estates for re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>using the same.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105198:61"/>
Which, as it is a clear evidence, that the King, and they who are about him, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise him, do not so conceive of the words of this Engagement, as if they did necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily import an abandoning of the <hi>Allegiance</hi> due to him: so 'tis (if true) a matter of great consideration towards the satisfaction of so many, as out of that fear only, have scrupled the taking of it. For the doing of that cannot be reasonably thought to destroy the Subjects <hi>Allegiance</hi>; which the King, who expecteth <hi>Allegiance</hi> from all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, advisedly, and upon mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alloweth them to do.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But all this being granted, that the words of the Engagement are capable of such construction; yet is not the Conscience thereby sufficiently secured, from justly scrupling at the taking thereof, unless it may yet further appear, that the Subject hath the liberty to make use of such a construction; which is in effect the <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re</hi> contained in your Postscript, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether upon supposition, that the words of the Engagement will bear more constructions than one, the subscriber may take it in his own sense, or is bound to take it in the imposers sense? or, Whether
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105198:61"/>
it be necessary or expedient before he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, to ask those that require his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, in what sense they require him to subscribe it? Upon the resolution of which <hi>Quaere,</hi> since (as I conceive) the last resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Judgment, wherein the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to acquiesce, doth principally depend; I shall endeavour to give you my thoughts therein, (wherein I acknowledg to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived much light and satisfaction from a Discourse written by a Learned, Judicious, and Pious friend, whereof I lately had the perusal, but for some reasons, not thought fit to be published) as distinctly, and clearly, as the time I have to do it in, will suffer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>First</hi> then, for a man that is required of another to give Faith by some <hi>Oath, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> or other <hi>Engagement,</hi> to take it in a sense of his own, manifestly different (even in his own apprehension) from the others meaning, sufficiently expressed by words, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common custome of speech, and the nature of the business which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth, is so gross a conceit, that had not the impudence of the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>suits, in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawfulness of their Equivocations, and the sad experience of these late times, (wherein thousands have cheated themselves
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105198:62"/>
in perjury, by thinking to avoid it) eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the contrary, it might well have been thought a thing incredible, that any man of common understanding, should suffer his reason to be so infatuated by his affections, as to be deceived thereby. For if such lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of construction should be admitted in Promises, and other Obligations of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, intended for the Preservation of Faith amongst mankind, there would not remain any possible means, whereby for men to have assurance of one anothers meanings. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take that for a clear truth, That all Promises, and Assurances, wherein Faith is required to be given to another, ought to be understood, <hi>ad mentem imponentis,</hi> according to the mind and meaning of him to whom the Faith is to be given; so far forth as the meaning may reasonably appear, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the matter about which it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and such signification of the words, whereby it is expressed, as according to the ordinary use of speech amongst men, agreeth best thereunto. The reason whereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Faith so required to be given, is intended to the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoof, and for the interest of him that requireth it; namely, to the end he may have the better assurance from
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105198:62"/>
him that giveth the faith, that what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised shall be accordingly performed: which assurance he cannot have, if after his meaning, sufficiently declared by the words, it should yet be at the liberty of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser to reserve another secret meaning in his own breast, differing there-from.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> what if the Intention of the Imposer be not so fully declared by the words and the nature of the business; but that the same words may in fair construction be still capable of a double meaning, so as taken in one sense, they shall bind to <hi>More,</hi> and in another to <hi>Less?</hi> I conceive in such case it is not necessary, nor always expedient (but rather for the most part otherwise) for the Promiser, before he give faith, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Imposer, whether of the two is his meaning. But he may by the rule of Prudence, and that (for ought I see) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the violation of any Law of Conscience, make his just advantage of that ambiguity, and take it in the same sense which shall bind <hi>to the Less.</hi> And this I ground upon the very same reason as before; For sith the Faith to be given, is intended to the behoof of him, to whom it is given, it concerneth him to take care that his meaning be expressed in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105198:63"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch words as will sufficiently manifest the same to the understanding of a reasonable man. Which if he neglect to do, no Law of Equity or Prudence bindeth the Promiser by an over-scrupulous diligence to make it out, whereby to lay a greater obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself than he need to do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But then <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if it shall happen (as often it cometh to pass, when we have to deal with cunning men, and may possibly be the Case now, and undoub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edly was so in the business of the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>otestation,</hi> when the time was) That he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat requireth the faith to be given, do of purpose so contrive the words, that there may be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ft an ambiguity and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of sense therein; yea, and that it be very probable, and in a manner apparent, (upon the consideration of the point of interest, or other strong presumptions ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from circumstances or otherwise) even to the apprehension of the Promiser himself, that he hath some farther reach in requiring that promise from him, some more remote and secret intention then he is willing to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. In that case what is to be done? I answer, That the Promiser in such case is no ways obliged in giving his Faith, to take notice of any secret intention, but is at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105198:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to make use of that Latitude of sense, which the other did rather chuse to leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined, than to restrain, and so to turn the others cunning dealing to his own best advantage, by taking it in the more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble construction; and that which bindeth <hi>to less.</hi> For it is <hi>the declared intention</hi> only, (<hi>viz.</hi> That which the words, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use of speech, do in relation to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the subject, most naturally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly represent to the understanding of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable men, when they hear them) and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the remote, secret, and <hi>reserved intent,</hi> which the Promiser is obliged unto. The reason whereof is manifest; because he that requireth Faith to be given from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by words of his own contriving, is ever presumed so to have determined the sense thereof, in the contrivance of the words, as may sufficiently declare what he intendeth the Promiser should assure him to perform. If therefore he have not so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the words, as to signifie <hi>the More</hi>; it is in all reason to be presumed, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to oblige him but to <hi>the Less.</hi> For being at liberty to make his own choice of words, whereby to express his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; who can think otherwise, but that he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105198:64"/>
would make the choice with respect to his own Interest? And therefore, though he might have a secret desire, which he is lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h to discover, that the Promiser should be bound to <hi>the More,</hi> and would be marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously well pleased, that he should so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the words, as if they intended to bind him to <hi>the More</hi>: Yet since it had been so easie a matter for him, by adding or altering a few words, to have declared that intent, if he had thought it conducible to his own ends; it will be presumed also, that it was out of respect of self-interest, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare so to do, and chose rather to leave his meaning, in such general words, as will not exclude the sense, which bindeth but to <hi>the Less</hi>; and consequently that his declared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent obligeth to no more but to <hi>the Less only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. To bring the matter yet closer, and to put it up to the present Cases, there are yet two things more to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To shew what the different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions (<hi>the highest,</hi> I mean, and <hi>the lowest</hi>) the words of the Engagement are fairly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> to find as well as we can,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105198:64"/>
whether of the two is more probably the meaning intended by the Imposers, to be declared by the words.</p>
            <p>The words are these: <q>I do promise to be true and faithful to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> as it is now esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished without King or Lords.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein there are sundry ambiguities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> In the words <hi>true and fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi>; by which may be intended, either the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of that <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> (which was formerly acknowledged to be due to the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to be now performed to those that are presently possessed of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power, as their right and due. Or else that promise <hi>of such a kind of fidelity,</hi> as Captives taken in the War, promise to their Enemies, when they fall under their power; <hi>viz.</hi> to remain true Prisoners of War, and so long as they are in their power, not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing to their destruction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the word <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> by which may either be meant, those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who are the <hi>prevalent party</hi> in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105198:65"/>
and now are possessed of, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the Supreme Power therein, as if the right of Soveraignty were vested in them: Or else, the <hi>whole entire Body of the English Nation,</hi> as it is a Civil Society or State within it self, distinguished from all other Foreign Estates. Taken in the former sense, the fidelity promised to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> relateth directly to the upholding of that party who are the present Governors <hi>de facto,</hi> and imports subjection to them as <hi>de jure:</hi> But taken in the latter, it relateth to the safety of the Nation, and importeth no more as to the present Governors, but to live peaceably under them <hi>de facto,</hi> and to yield obedience to them in things absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the upholding Civil Society with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realm; such as are the defence of the Nation against Foraigners, the furtherance of Publick Justice, and the maintenance of Trade.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the words <hi>as it is now established, &amp;c.</hi> which may be understood either by way of approbation of what hath been done by way of abolishing Kingly Government, and the House of Peers, and placing all Authority and Power within the Realm, in the House of Commons. Or else <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> only, as a

clause simply and barely reciting what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Government it is that this Nation <hi>de facto,</hi> is now under; <hi>viz.</hi> a Government by the Commons only, without either King or House of Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Which Ambiguities considered, The <hi>highest construction</hi> that can be reasonably made of the words, is to this effect. I acknowledge the Sovereign Power of this Nation, where unto I owe Allegiance and Subjection to be rightly stated in the House of Commons, wherein neither King nor Lords (as such) have, or henceforth ought to have any share; And I promise that I will perform all Allegiance and Subjection thereunto, and maintain the same with my fortunes and life to the utmost of my power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>lowest construction</hi> that can be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably made of the same words, is to this effect: <q>Whereas for the present, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power in <hi>England,</hi> under which Power I now am, is actually possessed and exercised by the House of Commons, without either King or Lords; I promise that so long as I live under that power and protection, I will not contrive or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any act of hostility against them:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105198:66"/>
but living quietly and peaceably under them, will endeavor my self faithfully in my place and calling, to do what every good member of a Common-wealth ought to do for the safety of my Country, and preservation of Civil Society therein.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. Now cometh in to be considered in the last place the great Question, whether of the two constructions it is, (<hi>That</hi> which bindeth to the <hi>Most,</hi> or <hi>This</hi> which obligeth to the <hi>Least,</hi> the words can well bear) that the formers of the Engagement did rather intend to declare by these words. They that think <hi>the former,</hi> want not probability of reason to ground their perswasions upon. For they consider, that those who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently possessed of the Supreme Power, are not minded to part with it if they can hold it. And that the likeliest way to hold it is, if they can possibly bring the whole people of <hi>England,</hi> or at least the far greatest part thereof, to acknowledge that they are rightly possessed of it, and to promise Subjection and Allegiance to them as such. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Engagement, being purposely devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and set on foot, as the fittest engine to expedite that work, must in all reason intend to oblige so far. Which being so contrary to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105198:66"/>
their Judgment and perswasion, concerning the duty and Oath of Allegiance, I cannot blame those that so understand the words of the Engagement, if they abominate the very thought of taking it.</p>
            <p>But there wanteth not great probability of Reason on the other side, to induce us to believe that the latter and lower sense is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be deemed the immediate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared intent of the Imposers, whatsoever cause of suspition there may be, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer meaning may be more agreeable to their <hi>secret, reserved, and ultimate intent</hi>; between which two, if there be any difference (as it is not impossible but there may be) the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gager is not concerned in it, or not yet: the Equivocation, if there be any in that, must be put upon the Imposers, not on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misers score. For thus believing, there are amongst others these Probabilities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That many prudent and consciencious men of the Royal Party, as well Divines and Lawyers, as others, have thus understood it, who we presume would not for any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward resp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct in the world have taken it, if they had conceived any more to have been intended in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it hath often been affirmed, both
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105198:67"/>
publickly and privately in several parts of the Kingdom (if we may believe either common fame, or the reports of sundry credible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons) by those that have perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or pressed others to subscribe; that the same is the very true intent and meaning of it, and no other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That if the Imposers had been minded to have declared an intent of binding <hi>to more,</hi> they might easily have framed the words so as not to be capable of a construction bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>to Less.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That (as is also credibly reported) whilst the form of words was under debate, the opinion of those that would have had it set higher, was not followed, as held unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable; and the vote carried, for the more moderate expression wherein it now stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Imposers, intending by the Engagement to secure themselves, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the designs and attempts of those men, who they knew (well enough) held them for no other than Usurpers, must be in reason supposed to require no more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them by the Engagement, than such as may and is usually given to Usurpers; which is, not an acknowledgment of their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105198:67"/>
title, and a promise of Allegiance, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a promise of living quietly, so long as they are under their power, and enjoy their protection.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That it is a received Maxim of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical prudence, for all new Governors, (especially those that either introduce a new form of Government, or come in upon a questionable title) to abstain from all harsh proceedings, even against those whom they know to be evil affected to their Power, and not so much as to exasperate them (though it be in the power of their hands to destroy them) especially in the beginning of their Government; but rather to sweeten them into a better opinion of their persons, and to win upon them by Acts of Grace and Oblivion (for <hi>Remissiùs impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranti meliùs paretur.</hi>

            <p n="6">VI. Out of all these premises together (weighing my Positive conclusion, either Affirmative or Negative, touching the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness or Unlawfulness of subscribing <hi>in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versali</hi>) I shall declare my opinion only in these few following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is not lawful for any man to take the Engagement with a resolution to break it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That therefore, whosoever thinketh the words of the Engagement do contain a promise of any thing which it is not law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul for him to perform, cannot take it with a good conscience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That whosoever so understandeth the words of the Engagement, as if they did oblige him to any thing contrary to his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, or render him unable to act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, upon any seasonable emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging occasion, cannot with a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence take it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That if any man for any temporal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105198:68"/>
or avoiding any temporal damage, shall take the Engagement with a doubting conscience (that is, before he be perswaded in his Judgment, upon some probable ground of reason, that it is lawful for him so to do) he sinneth therein.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That if any man after a serious desire of informing himself as rightly as he can, what are the duties of his <hi>Allegiance</hi> on the one side, and what is most probably the meaning intended by the words of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement on the other side, shall find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self well satisfied in this perswasion, that the performance in the mean time of what is required by the Engagement so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, is no way contrary (for any thing he can discern for the present) to his bounden <hi>Allegiance,</hi> so long as he is under such a force, as that he cannot exercise it; and likewise, that whensoever that force is so removed from him, or he from under it, as that he hath power to act according to his <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> the Obligation of the Engagement of it self determineth and expireth: and out of these considerations, rather than suffer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme prejudice in his person, estate, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary relations, shall subscribe the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; since his own heart condemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <div type="resolution">
               <head>The Resolution.</head>
               <p>My opinion is, <hi>That the Vow was</hi> Rash, <hi>and is not at all</hi> Obligatory.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:105198:70"/>1. The Question here proposed is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the obligation only; yet I deem it expedient to declare my opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Rashness also: and that for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. <hi>First,</hi> Because there seemeth in the propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al of the Case, to be some weight laid upon the after iterations, which were more deliberate, as if they added to the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because I think it needful that the Vower should as well be convinced of the greatness of his sin in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such a Vow, for the time past, as satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied concerning the present and future inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is easie to believe, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when he first made the Vow, was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with a very great indignation against his Daughter for her high and inexcusable disobedience to him in so very weighty a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. And truly it must be confessed, he had need to be a man of a very rare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over his own Spirit, and such as are scarce to be found one of a thousand, that could so contain himself within the bounds of reason, upon so just a provocation from an only child, (possibly some other aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting circumstances concurring) as not to be transported with the violence of that passion,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105198:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into some thoughts and resolutions, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agreeable with the dictates of right reason. It can therefore be little doubted, but the Vow made whilst the Reason was held under the force of so strange a pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, was a rash and irrational Vow.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor will these after-acts in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first Vow, though having more of deliberation in them, be sufficient to redeem either it or themselves from the imputation of Rashness: understanding rashness in that latitude as the Casuists do, when they treat <hi>de Voto temerario,</hi> under the notion whereof they comprehend all such Vows as happen <hi>per defectum plenae &amp; discussae deliberationis,</hi> as they express it; For it is to be considered, that when an injury, disobedience, or other affront is strongly resented, it many times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aketh a very deep impression in the Soul, which though after the first <hi>impetus</hi> have a little spent it self, it begin somewhat to abate, yet it doth so by such slow and insensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that the same perturbation, which first discomposed the mind, may have a strong influence into all succeeding delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a long time after. Even as after an acute Feaver, when the sharpest paroxysmes are over, and the malignity of the disease
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105198:71"/>
well spent, although the party begin to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver some degrees of strength; yet there may remain for a good while after such a debility in the parti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, as that they cannot exercise their proper functions, but with some weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness more or less, till the party be perfectly recovered. Sith therefore the after-iterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the first Vow in the present case, did proceed apparently from the rancor and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity remaining in the mind, as the dregs and reliques of the same perturbation, from which the first Vow also proceeded: they must upon the same account (to wit, <hi>per de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum plenae deliberationis</hi>) undergo the same censure of Rashness with the first. The same I say for the kind; some <hi>difference</hi> I grant there is for the degree: but <hi>Magis &amp; Minus non variant speciem,</hi> we know. And the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that difference is only thus far useful in the present Case, that the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate those after-acts were, the more cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable they are, and the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s capable either of Excuse or Extenuation; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do oblige the party to so much the more serious, solemn, and lasting Repentance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But concerning rash Vowes (in as much as the knot of the Question lyeth not there) it shall suffice to note these few points. <hi>First,</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:105198:72"/>
That every <hi>Rash Vow</hi> is a sin; and that upon its own score, and precisely as it is <hi>Rash,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it should not be any other way pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. All acts of Religious worship (by the importance of the third Commandment) are to be performed with all due sobriety, attention, and advisedness: how much more than a <hi>Vow?</hi> which is one of the highest acts of worship, as being a sacred contract, where unto God himself is a party. See <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.1. <hi>&amp;c. Secondly,</hi> That Rash Vows are for the most part, (besides the Rashness) peccant in their matter also; For they are commonly made in passion, and all passions are evil Counsellors, and Anger as bad as the first. <hi>The wrath of Man</hi> seldom <hi>worketh the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God. Thirdly,</hi> That a Rash Vow, (though to be repented of for the Rashness) may yet in some cases bind. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, A man finding himself ill used by a Shop-keeper, of whom he had formerly been accustomed to buy, voweth in a Rage that he will never buy of him again: This is a Rash Vow, yet it bindeth, because if the party had never made any such Vow at all, it had neither been unjust or uncharitable, (nor so much as imprudent) in him for to have done the same thing, which by his Vow
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105198:72"/>
he hath now bound himself to do. So if a man impatient of his ill luck at Cards, should Vow in a heat never to Play at Cards any more; he were in this case also bound to keep his Vow: because there neither is any sin in keeping it, nor can be any great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty why he should break it. That therefore <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if at any time a <hi>Rash Vow</hi> bind not; the invalidity thereof proceedeth not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (nor indeed at all) from the Rashness (which yet is a very common error amongst men) but from the faultiness of it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, in respect of the matter, or thing vowed to be done; when that which is so Vowed, is either so evil in it self, or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of circumstances, becometh so evil, that it cannot be performed without sin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That therefore concerning the Vow in the present case, I declared my Opinion that it is not at all obligatory; it is done upon this ground (which is a most certain truth, and consented to by all) that <hi>Rei illicitae nulla obligatio.</hi> If a man shall Vow any thing that is contrary to <hi>Piety</hi>; as if having taken of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at some indiscreet passage in a Sermon of his own Minister, he should vow that he would never come to the Church, or hear him Preach again,: Or that is contrary to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105198:73"/>
                  <hi>Iustice,</hi> as to take away the life of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent person, as those 40 persons that had vowed they <hi>would neither eat nor drink till they had slain</hi> Paul: Or never to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution to one whom he knew he had wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: Or contrary to <hi>Charity</hi>; as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of, or never to be friends with one that had done him wrong: Or that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Mercy</hi>; as if having lost some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by lending to his friend, or having smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by suretiship, he should vow never to lend any man money, or become surety for any man again. Let such a Vow, I say, as any of these, or any of the like nature, be made either rashly, or deliberately, and strengthened with Oaths and Imprecations, in the most direful and solemn manner that can be devised to tie it on the faster; yet it is altogether null and invalid as to the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct of Obligation. Whence those common say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>In male promissis rescinde fidem; ne sit juramentum vinculum iniquitatis,</hi> &amp;c. And we have a good president for it in <hi>David,</hi> after he had in a rage vowed the destruction of <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all that belonged to him; which vow, upon better consideration, he not only did not perform, but he blessed God also, for so providentially preventing the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105198:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
performance of it, by the discreet demeanor and intervention of <hi>Abigail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Now the reason why such vows are not binding, is very cogent and clear; Even because the party at such time as he is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have made such Vow as aforesaid, lay under another (a former, and therefore a stronger) obligation to the contrary. And it is agreeable to all the reason in the World, that he who either by his own voluntary act, hath bound himself (where lawfully he might so do) or by the command of his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Superior (that hath a right to his service, and may exact obedience from him) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bound to do, or not to do this or that; should not have power to disoblige himself therefrom, at his own pleasure, or to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induce upon himself a new Obligation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto: <hi>Obligatio prior praejudicat posteriori.</hi> As in the case of <hi>Marriage,</hi> a precontract with one party, avoideth all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-contracts with any other: And if a man convey Lands to several persons, by deeds of several date, the first conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yance standeth good, and all the rest are void; and so in all cases of like nature. The Obligatory power thereof that is in <hi>Vows, Oaths, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> &amp;c. is rightly said by some, to be a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105198:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>constructive,</hi> not a <hi>destructive</hi> power. The meaning is, that such acts may create a new Obligation where was none before, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm an old one; but it cannot destroy an old one, or substitute another contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in the place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the reason of this reason also is yet farther evident; for that <hi>Quisquis obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, alteri obligatur.</hi> When a man is obliged by any act, it is also supposed, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is made to some other party; to whom also it is supposed some right to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue, by vertue of the said act obligatory; and that that other party is by the said act sufficiently vested in that said right, of which right he cannot be again devested and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the meer act of him who instated him therein, and is obliged to perform it to him (unless himself give consent thereunto) without the greatest injustice in the World. Now God having a perfect right to our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by his own obliging Precept, both for the not doing hurt to any man, and for the doing good to every man upon all fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities: and this right also confirmed, and ratified by our own obligatory act in a solemn manner, before many witnesses at our Baptism, when we vowed to keep all God's
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105198:74"/>
Commandments: it were unreasonable to think that it should be in our power, by any after-act of ours to disoblige our selves from both, or either of those obligations. For then we might by the same reason free our selves from the obligation, of that latter Act also (suppose an Oath, or Vow) by another subsequent Oath, or Vow; and from that again by another: and so play fast and loose, make Vows, and break them <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Evident it is therefore, that every vow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring any thing to be done, which is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to any office of <hi>Piety, Iustice, Charity,</hi> or <hi>Mercy,</hi> which we owe either to God or man, is void, and bindeth not, because it findeth us under the power of a former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary obligation, and hath not it self power sufficient to free or discharge us from the same.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The general rule thus cleared, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to examine concerning the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Vow now in question, whether it be void upon this account or no? It will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found hard I believe to free this <hi>Vow</hi> from being repugnant to the rules of <hi>Iustice,</hi> but impossible, I am sure, to reconcile it with the perfect Evangelical Law of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> First, <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Political Iustice,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105198:75"/>
that every man should obey the wholsome Laws of his Countrey, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself to be ordered thereby. Now, put the case (which is possible enough) that the Daughters Husband should for lack of support from his Father-in-law, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, live and die in great want, leaving his Wife, and many small Children behind him, destitute of all means for their necessary su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance. The Law would (as I suppose) in that case, upon complaint of the Parish, and for their case, send the Daughter and her Children to the Father, and compel him to maintain them out of his Estate. Which order he ought to obey, nor can refuse so to do, without the high contempt of publick Authority, and manifest violation of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Justice, notwithstanding his Vow to the contrary: The Law must be obeyed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever becometh of the Vow; in that case therefore it is evident the Vow bindeth not.</p>

But say that should not happen to be the case (which yet is more than any man can positively say before-hand) the Parent is nevertheless in <hi>Moral Iustice</hi> bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide due maintenance for his Children and Grand-Children if he be able. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith that Fathers ought to lay up for the

                  </gap>hat doth not at all lessen the importance of it, such illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations being ever taken <hi>à notiori,</hi> and from such common notions as are granted, and consented unto by all reasonable men. The same Apostle having amongst other sins of the Gentiles, mentioned disobedience to Parents in one verse, in the very next verse, mentioneth also want of natural affection in Parents. And the disobedience in the Child can no more discharge the Parent from the obligation of that duty he oweth to the Child, of affection, and maintenance, then the unnaturalness of the Parent, can the Child from the duty he oweth to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> For the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral duties, that by Gods ordinance, are to be performed by persons that stand in mutual relation either to other, are not <hi>pactional</hi> and <hi>conditional</hi>; as are the Leagues and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made between Princes (where the breach in one part dissolveth the obligation on the other) but are <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>; wherein each person is to look to himself, and the performance of the duty

               <p n="10">10. Something I foresee may be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in this point, concerning the lawfulness of the Parents withdrawing maintenance from the Child (either in whole, or at least in part) in the case of disobedience. Which how far forth it may, or may not be done; as it would be too long to examine, so it would be of little avail to the present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For it is one thing to with-hold main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from a disobedient Child for the present, and to resolve so to continue till he shall see cause to the contrary. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to bind himself by Vow or Oath, never to allow him any for the future, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever should happen. Let be granted what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever can be supposed pleadable on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers behalf in the present case; yet there will still remain two particulars in this Vow, not easily to be cleared from being unjust. <hi>First,</hi> let the Daughters disobedience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all this uttermost of punishment f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105198:76"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is (if not unjust, yet what differeth very little there-from) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of rigid Justice; that any offender (much less a Son or Daughter) should for any offence, not deserving Death, be by a kind of fatal peremptory decree, put into an incapacity of receiving relief from such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as otherwise ought to have relieved the said offender, without any reservation either of the case of <hi>extreme necessity,</hi> or of the case of <hi>serious repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. However it be for the point of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>; yet so apparent is the repugnancy of the <hi>matter</hi> of this <hi>Vow,</hi> with the Precepts of <hi>Christian Charity</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi>; that if all I have hitherto said were of no force, this repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy alone were enough (without other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence) to prove the unlawfulness, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the invalidity, or inobligability thereof. It is (not an Evangelical Counsel, but) the express peremptory precept of Christ, that we should be <hi>merciful,</hi> even as our heavenly Father is <hi>merciful.</hi> And inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as, not in that passage only, but for the most part wheresoever else the duty of <hi>mercy</hi> is pressed upon us in the Gospel from the example of God: God is represented to us by the Name, and under the notion of

a <hi>Father,</hi> although I may not lay much weight upon it, as a demonstrative proof; yet I conceive I may commend it as a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Topick, for all that are Fathers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of, whether it do not import, that <hi>mercy</hi> is to be expected from a <hi>father</hi> as much as (if not rather much more then) from any other man; and that the want of <hi>mercy</hi> in a <hi>Father,</hi> is more unkindly, more unseemly, more unnatural then in another man: But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his by the way, from that Precept of Christ, we learn that as there is in God a two-fold <hi>mercy,</hi> (a giving <hi>mercy,</hi> in doing us good, though we deserve it not, &amp; a forgiving <hi>mercy,</hi> in pardoning us when we have done amiss:) so there ought to be in every good <hi>Christian man</hi> a readiness (after the example of God) to shew forth the fruits of <hi>mercy</hi> to others, in both kinds, upon all proper and meet occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.

               <p>Our Saviour, who in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. sharply reproved such vows, (though made with an intention to advance the Service of God, by inriching his Treasury (as hindred Children from relieving their parents, will not certainly approve of such vows (made without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

All this granted, cometh not yet up to the point of shewing <hi>Mercy</hi> according to the example of God.

others be incouraged by her impunity, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise their Parents after her example? There is much reason in this objection; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what I have hitherto written, ought not to be understood, as if thereby were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded such a plenary indulgence for the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as should restore her <hi>in integrum,</hi> but only that she should be made capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving such relief from her Father, from time to time, as in relation to her necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and after-carriage, from time to time, should seem reasonable; and that his Vow ought not to hinder him from affording her such relief. But by what degrees, and in what proportion, the Father should thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his daughter into his fatherly affection, and relieve her, must be left to discretion, and the exigence of circumstances.
