            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT came upon me to write as followeth. Oh! Nation of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and City of <hi>London,</hi> how often have you been warned, and called to Repentance, yet how ſlow have your Inhabitants been in anſwering the Lord by Humiliation and unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. I am truly concerned for thee, Oh City of <hi>London!</hi> leſt thou haſt given the Lord cauſe to complain againſt thee, and upbraid thee as he did <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida;</hi> for the Lord doth not ſend his Judgments without great Provocation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think not Repentance to be a hard thing for thee, for God wills not the Deſtruction of any, but their Deſtruction is of themſelves. I pray God, O Nation of <hi>England,</hi> thou mighteſt be prevailed with to turn to God, and he will turn to thee, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Aſhes thou ſhalt have Beauty, and inſtead of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Joy, and for Heavineſs, a Garment of Praiſes: And thy People ſhall be called Trees of Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And now Oh City of <hi>Briſtoll!</hi> What haſt thou to ſay for thy ſelf, when the Lord makes Inquiſition for Blood and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that has been in thee: Haſt thou made thy Peace with the Lord, or haſt thou ſought thy Peace with the great good God. To thee this is the Word of the Lord, <hi>If thou be willing to come out of the Pool or Puddle of Sin and Tranſgreſſion, a Pool of Water</hi> (or Deſolation) <hi>thou ſhalt not be.</hi> The Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. Oh City of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> I am truly concerned for thee, that thou might ſhine with the Beauty of Holineſs, to the Praiſe and Glory of the great God.</p>
            <p>This from him that deſires the good of the whole Creation, and is ſeeking the good of all People,</p>
