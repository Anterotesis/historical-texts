            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I thought it ynoughe in this place onely to haue monyshed you trusti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that god in tyme commynge shall adde to those thynges bothe tyme conuenyent &amp; also lyght. Therfore here (as entryng my mater) fyrst I wyll declare after a symple &amp; playne maner (by the which euen as by a glasse thou shalt knowe) what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lege of sinne is, and how we ought trulye to pray folowyng the rehersal of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes and of the Pater noster. And I duobte not but this one prayer is sufficyent ynough to them that pray how often soeuer it be, or what soeuer they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre, yea yf they take but one lytle parte of it which so euer it be, for a good prayer stondeth not nether co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>systeth in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tytude of wordes as Christe sayeth in the syxte of Mathew.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, and this syghe ought to endure contynually. Therfore I desyre

al persones that from hensforth they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get suche prayers as be saynte Brigittes and other lyke, whiche greate promyses and perdons haue falsely aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced. And you shal retorne vnto this symple prayer nedefull for euery Christen, whose come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vse doeth yet perseuer amonge all men, yf they dyd vnderstonde it, and applyed theyre myndes to it.

there be, necessary to be knowen to obtey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne eternall lyfe. The fyrste is that thou know what is expedient to be done, and what to be vndon. The secunde when thou perceyuest that thou of thyn owne strenght cannest neyther doo, neyther yet auoide that which thou art bounde to do or to eschewe, that then thou knowe of whome to seke, fynde, and receyue this strenght.

And hereunto I wyll gyue the an ensample to thentent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou mayst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more euydently perceyue it, a man which is diseased with any maner of syckenes.

Fynally, when he hathe founde this medecyne, he wyl take it, and vse it / lykewyse the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes of god do teache a man to knowe his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, that he may vnderstonde and fele, what he can do, &amp; what he can not, what he can leaue and what he can not, so that
<pb facs="tcp:5797:16"/>
he maye knowlege hym a vitious person and a synner, after he hath knowleged hym selfe so, that then he may learne by faithe, where to fynde remedy and grace whereby he may be restored and iustified and so may be able to fulfylle the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
