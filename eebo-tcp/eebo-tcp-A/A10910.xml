            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ The Preface of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I began to write of this doctrine of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of Loue, I minded in deed, to haue sent it to a friende of mine which is entered into that errour, and so to haue made it as a priuate matter betweene vs. But when I had shewed the same to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine of my friendes, to haue their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in certeine pointes, their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate suite was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this small treatise might be published in print: which request I was loth to grant, for diuers causes. The chiefe whereof was, that Bookes whiche are set foorth vnto the eyes of all the world, had need to be circumspectly and diligently examined, before thei be made as á glasse for all men to looke vpon. For, when as there are many beholders, there are also many fault finders. And in this simple work there are many faultes, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and want of skill committed: which I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, not to be done of malice or negligence, but in trueth my simple &amp; vnlearned capacitie could doe no better.
<pb facs="tcp:121:3"/>
The faults are these. The rough and harsh stile, being rudely and without any good methode set downe, because I want the help of those artes which comly &amp; aptly couch sentences together, whereby the Reader might take the more delectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in reading and perusing of books. The order shoud haue bene amended if time would haue suffred, but since it is otherwise, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee accept my good will. If any of the familie carpe at this booke, because of the rudenesse thereof, let them answer it, and a reply will speedily be perfourmed, wherin their expectation shal be satisfied (I dout not) by men of godly knowledge and learning. In the meane time, I wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the cause that made me more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to satisfie my friendes request. There are many diligent &amp; godly teachers, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in places conuenient do inuey &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Family of Loue, &amp; yet are not throughly acquainted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: whereby many in the same family, take occasion to exclame against them, as slaunderers of their doctrine: &amp; many also of Gods children, hearing the Family of loue spoken against, are desirous to know what opinions and doctrine they hold &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:121:3"/>
professe. Therefore I thought it my dutie which I owe vnto Christes Church (as a member thereof) to vtter and make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest vnto all persons what I know tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Authours and doctrine of the same family. And seeing that wee liue amongst so many enimies of Christs Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which obiect against vs varietie in opinions, it is very requisite, that euerie member in Christes Church, put too his helping hand, to cleanse and purge the Church from such errours and false doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as through the malice of Satan dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creepeth in. For if we hearing Christe Iesus his death and passion (which is our only comfort) blemished and darkned by the subtile fetches and persuasions of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious and wicked men, possessed with fantasticall spirites, &amp; shall not be moued with zeale: howe appeareth any loue of God or Christ Iesus in vs? or where is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the fruites that should shew a iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith? Many that are at case &amp; liue securely, thinke that this errour will of it selfe vanish &amp; decay, without stir or gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying: which saying bewraieth too much their want of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> true feare &amp; loue of God. For, if we shall daily heare but our friend
<pb facs="tcp:121:4"/>
euill spoken of, and bee still and silent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hereat, what loue or friendship appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in vs? How much more ought we to bee zealously affected, when the glorie of our GOD, and the office of Christe Iesus our Lord, shal be shadowed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, wee sleeping securely without touch or motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of true zeale or loue? And if we looke into the daily increase of this errour, we shall then behold our slouth &amp; negligence. For in many shires of this our countrie, there are meetings &amp; conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this familie of loue, and into what number they are grown, my heart reweth to speake that which one of the same so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie did auouch to me for trueth. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is time to withstand their impious opinions, and euerie one according to his charge and office in the Church of Christ to purge and cleanse the same, from the dregges and blasphemies of <hi>H. N.</hi> and his familie. And although many errours &amp; much false doctrine is taught in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more then is here expressed, (which to touch al would require a longer discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and a more learned author,) yet I haue set down (for a tast or shew) some of their doctrine, that the children of God may
<pb facs="tcp:121:4"/>
be armed afore hande, and take heede of such impious blasphemies as. <hi>H. N.</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Many Bokes are abrode, which I haue not seene, and many I haue seene, which I could not haue the vse off to reade. For except one will be pliant to their doctrine and shew good will thereto, he shal hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get any of their bookes, no, nor they will not conferre, nor talke of any points of their doctrine with any, except it be to such as they finde inclined, and (as they tearme it) willingly minded thereto.</p>
            <p>And here I protest, that what my pen shall vtter, either touching the person of <hi>H. N.</hi> or his doctrine, I malice him not, nor his familie, I rather pittie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; their case, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so many simple people are by his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine seduced and deceiued: neither will I auouch any thing which I haue not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrant to proue. As touching his person and behauiour, I haue the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of diuers ancient persons, &amp; of good credite of the Dutch church, who haue bene acquainted with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same <hi>H. N.</hi> and haue dwelt together in one citie, and in one streete, being neere neighbours &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friendes, who haue declared and testified the certeintie of his behauiour, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:121:5"/>
demeanour. And touching his doctrine, I haue vsed this order, to set downe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours owne speech, not adding or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing any thing, with the name of the Book, Chapter, or follio. And whereas I haue directed much speech vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, the cause is this. I haue ben familiar with some of them of long time, &amp; haue had large discourses and conference with many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: therfore if my simple speech, vttred by pen, may do any of them good, I haue that I desire. And this hath bene an other cause, why more willingly I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended vnto my friendes request. And because <hi>H. N.</hi> and his family haue protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the trueth hath no where beene taught in the worlde since the Apostles time, but now by the family: how vaine this their assertion is, in it self appeareth. For if truth hath ben hid and buried this 1500. yeares, where is become Christes promise, that he would be euer with his to the end * of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to what purpose<note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> haue so many notable men suffered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, both in the primatiue Church vnder heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperors, &amp; daily do suffer vnder the persecuting and cruell Papists? If these haue not suffered for the trueth,

And this is a thing also to be wondred at amongest the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, that if conference be vrged at their hands, they denie it vtterly: if disputation be offered, they flee from it egerly: the reason is, their doctrine dareth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the light, nor the triall of the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. If there were nothing else to proue their doctrine false, this were sufficient. I coulde declare of discentions that are
<pb facs="tcp:121:6"/>
amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; how many of their great <hi>Rabbines,</hi> or <hi>Illuminate Elders,</hi> haue beene plaine <hi>Arrians,</hi> &amp; haue recanted at Paules Crosse: Also how often they haue altered their opinions, as well touching commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of thinges, as diuers other points. But because they will lay to my charge, that I seeke onely to make them odious to the world, I ceasse to speake any further, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I rest, hoping in their conuersion, which I beseech the Lorde our God to graunt for his Christes sake. There is one other thing which (as they affirm) moueth them to be silent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because there is no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Magistrate that will mainteine their doctrine: therefore they are constrayned to be still. If this be a cause sufficient, let the reader iudge. Shall a trueth be hidden, because no Magistrate will giue it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance? Certainely if the Apostles had ceassed to preach Christe, vntill they had warrant from the Magistrate, I thinke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nations had bene yet vnconuerted. But I will not let to put them in memorie where they had maintenance of a Magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. Euen in <hi>Munster</hi> a citie of <hi>Westphalia</hi> where <hi>Iohn Leyden,</hi> and <hi>Knipper Dolling</hi> shewed the fruites and effectes of their

They tooke compassion of him, and made petition vnto the Lordes of the towne for him, that it would please them to take him and his, for poore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and inhabiters of their citie. They
<pb facs="tcp:121:10"/>
receiued this answere, that they would not denie their citie to any honest stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, being of a good &amp; true religion. His, graue yeares, sober speach, and modest behauiour, with his ancient and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparell, did not a little preuaile, that his petition tooke place: so that he and al his companie were made frée men of Basil, &amp; was in good reputation among the people. He was liberall in giuing of almes, and full of hospitalitie: he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his daughters very worshipfully: he was serued in plate, and spent libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: for his scholers in the lowe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries made collections for him, so that he wanted nothing. Eleuen yeres he dwelt in Basil, and it was not espied what doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine he taught.</p>
            <p>Then he built two houses, the one for pleasure in a garden, the other in the towne: one of the houses was by lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and thunder consumed with fire: also in his own dwelling house one loft fel downe, and did much harme: al these were warnings of Gods displeasure.

            <p>WHen I considered the duetie of a Christian, to consist in the true profession of Christ Iesus his name, &amp; diligently to walke in the pathes and wayes manifested in his word, and to séeke to beautifie and inrich that belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued spouse, the Church of Christ, sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by his bloude: I could not holde backe my penne, to publish such matter, as I sée daily to blemishe that beloued bride: (I meane the Church of Christ:) and to haue crept in by the subtiltie of Sathan, our professed enimy.

<pb facs="tcp:121:17"/>
be stayed from further plunging themselues into that gulfe of impietie. How the wicked take occasion by these &amp; like errours, to speake euil of Christs Church, the eares of many godly doe heare, <hi>Especially the Papists:</hi> who speak and write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and nothing is heard more common in their mouthes, then these tearms.

But how vntruely they impute these maters vnto the church of Christ, to euerie member of the same Church it is euident.</p>
            <p>For if we consider the wisedome of God in gouerning his, we shal perceiue that in all ages, when Christes Church did most flourish in perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then was errour and heresies moste rife, as may wel appéere euen in the Apostles times, by the <hi>Nicolaitans, Ebionites, Cerinthus</hi> and others.

               </gap>, as by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Ecclesiasticall histories doeth well appeare. Wherein, what trauell hath béene taken, what counsels called, what Books written, it were a wonder to behold. But when corruption began by litle and litle to spread her selfe, and got the face of a Church: O how were dissentions appeased, &amp; no varietie sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be? where as in déede, nothing was taught nor published but dreams &amp; deuises of men: who leauing the certein and knowen wayes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord reuealed in his word, betoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrines of men. But if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into these last times, wherein we liue, and marke the wisedome of God in gouerning his Churche, how he hath manifested his sonne Christ Iesus with an vncouered face, to the great comfort of his children, how the doting dreams of men are vanished, how nothing but Christ Iesus is lifted vp with prayses, as the immediate and only cause of our saluation, how the true vse of workes is placed, not as any cause, but as the fruites of our instification. And yet to
<pb facs="tcp:121:18"/>
sée how busily sathan (enuying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie of Christes spouse) endeuoureth daily in his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, to trouble and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet this peaceable Sion, by raysing vp diuers strange and monstrous he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, as the <hi>Anabaptistes,</hi> the <hi>Free will men,</hi> the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and the <hi>Familie of Loue,</hi> with many others, which heresies the Diuell more bufily soweth nowe to disquiet the Churche, then heretofore in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time of ignorance, when he lulled the most part of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world in errours and dreames of men. And séeing that euerie errour doeth seeke his cloake &amp; defence by the holie scripture, yet we haue great cause to reioyce, that onely by the scripture they are all put to silence, and their heresies made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to all men: as by the learned trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of many graue men in this our age doeth manifestly appeare. Of this last errour of. <hi>H.

person, and also of his doctrine) no man hitherto (that I can learne) hath endeuoured to confute them in writing.</p>
            <p>Whose Bookes as they haue come to my hande, I haue with diligence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used, and by much conference with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of that <hi>Familie,</hi> learned the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which they followe. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they haue béene charged with diuers articles before the highe commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet by no argument that I can learne, doe I finde that they holde all the errours conteined in the same.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, so many as either by the doctrine of <hi>Henrie Nicholas,</hi> or by conference I haue learned, I haue set downe, to the ende that some good man might be incouraged to confute so impious an authour, and such horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errours, and perfourme in some learned worke that whiche my want and capacitie is not able to supply: neither would I haue ventured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte to writing suche rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant labour, the matter béeing in déede <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And because diuerse with whome I am familiarly acquainted are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into this errour of <hi>Henrie Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> I haue the rather for their sakes bent my studie to doe them good, if it be possible. And if these simple notes may haue that successe that I wishe: I trust it will stay some of GODS children, from running headlong into that bewitched snare. And also suche matter, as by disputation, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with some of the same familie, I haue boulted out, I will declare. For in déede, the Authour in his Bookes doeth not deale so plainely, as one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ledde by the spirite of GOD, whereof he boasteth: but verie subtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and darkely, and so as the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many godly and learned men, to whom I haue deliuered his Bookes, vppon the reading of the same, haue testified, that there is no matter in the Authour, that may bée drawen into argument, but that it séemeth to be as a riddle, or darke speeche, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more intricate to be followed.</p>

            <p>And when the Kabbynes of that Family, whome they tearme <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Elders,</hi> haue béene pressed by me and others, to giue a reason, why the Authour hath so cunningly and subtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt, not expressing his minde in plaine tearmes and spéeche: the best an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that hath béene made, is, that the Authour hath writen in the Dutch tongue, which wanteth his grace and eloquence, béeing turned into our rude Englishe. But if I might be bolde to replye without offence, his rude stile béeing written in the Dutch tongue, is rather beautified by translation, then impayred: for I haue some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes in Dutche, some in Latin, and some in English: wherein the Authors barbarous stile, and his ignoraunce, is verie muche manifested, although some of his schollers haue put too their

            <p>And if I should diligently séeke out of what forge the Authour <hi>Henrie Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> hath fyled his heresies, I am certeinly persuaded, that one <hi>Dauid George</hi> was the founder, hatcher, and bréeder of all this mischiefe, and <hi>Henrie Nicholas,</hi> but a disciple or scoller of the same <hi>Dauid.</hi> What this <hi>Dauid</hi> was, you may perceiue by that which is set downe before: whose errours also for a tast I will set downe in part as they are collected by the gouernour of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersitie of <hi>Basill,</hi> that all men may sée, that an euil authour hath bred a worse scholer: And thereby shall be perceiued that <hi>Dauid George</hi> his opinions differ nothing from <hi>H.

holy Ghoste. And whereas <hi>H. N.</hi> doeth boast him self y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he can not erre, he saith that with the same lying spirite that is in the Pope, affirming the selfe same thing. As for the Pope, it is manifest y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without proofe. But bycause some may thinke that I auouch that of <hi>H.

               <hi>H. N.</hi> doth couple him self with Moses, with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Prophets, with Christ and his Apostles, very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously affirming, that he him selfe can no more erre then they. His wordes be these.</p>

            <p>In my opinion <hi>H. N.</hi> in these words doth somewhat ouermatch the Pope,
<pb facs="tcp:121:25"/>
for the Pope doth acknowledge, that as he is a man he may erre, but as he is Christes vicar or deputie vpon earth, he can not erre: but <hi>H.

And in déede his bookes are thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest his disciples to be of equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the scripture, and they do affirme that they are written with the same spirit. But if their bare affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may stand for good proofe, then indéed it is somwhat they say: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghost hath taught vs another lesson, saying, beléeue not euery spirite, but trie the spirite whether he be of God. And that we may rightly discern this <hi>H.

<pb facs="tcp:121:25"/>
published vnto the world y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> glad tidings of his glorious gospel to our great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the office of prophesying or foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thinges to come, hath ceased in Christes Church.

Christ our Lord did forewarne vs that in the latter times such false prophetes should rise, and false Christes, and such daungerous dayes, that if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the very Elect should be deceiued.

God doth promise to dwell with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man that is of a lowly mind &amp; humble heart. Also, ye are the Temples of the holie Ghost. And againe, the father and I wil make our habitation in man. Nowe where Christ dwelleth, there also is the father and the holie Ghost: where or in what man soeuer God thus dwelleth,

it may be well verified, God dwelleth in him: if God dwell in him, then the contrarie can not remaine in the same bodie. God is pure, and will not dwell in a corrupt vessell. Two contraries can not be in one place. Christ and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall can not dwell in one temple. Light and darknes can not be together. That man y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hath God thus dwelling in him, may be called <hi>Godded,</hi> or god dwelling in him: so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by this reason man is <hi>God ded</hi> with God, and God <hi>Hominified</hi> in man.

to the brightnesse thereof, which by his good will and pleasure he hath reuealed in this latter age most plentiously: and now by the doctrine of this <hi>Vittell</hi> are declined so farre, that the true sense of the Gospel they despise; and followe the baine and fantasticall humor of <hi>Vittels</hi> allegories, a man vtterly vnlearned, more fitte to be a scholler in Christes schoole, then an Illuminat Elder in the Familie, and so a teacher.

But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest in déede they insinuate a good life, which they pretende to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe: which is as the visard and cloake to hide al the rest of their grosse and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surde doctrine, and the hooke and baite whereby the simple are altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. And this is the subtiltie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
<pb facs="tcp:121:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who otherwise could not preuaile with such bewitched doctrine, except it were shadowed vnder the cloake of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holinesse. For there is no sound argument, a good life is all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for vs to do, &amp; with this the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie doe séeme to presse Gods children often in conference. For if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> will serue to saluation, I sée not how the Iewe or Turke can be excluded, whose workes outwardly (if they be viewed) shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs.</p>
            <p>Howe close vnto the letter of the lawe doeth the Iewe sticke? How wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly doe they abide as vagrant and banished men in euerie countrie? How pitifully doe they reléeue their brethren whiche want? so that none is found to want that, which another is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to supply: which are notes &amp; markes of charitie, or loue, and truely in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion we come not néere the Iewe in this point.</p>
            <p>But I pray you, what doeth all this auaile without a true and a righte fayth in Christ Iesus the sonne of God? The Turke likewise is a great &amp; dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:121:38"/>
obseruer of his <hi>Alcaron,</hi> a great fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or absteiner, a great giuer of almes, diligent in prayer, seuere in kéeping his worde and promise, verie charie in kéeping his Sabbathes, verie obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Princes and Magistrates: and to speak truth, in many outward vertues doth farre excell vs Christians, (to our shame it may be spoken,) but what doth all this auayle? For so much as they blaspheme Christ the sonne of God, and denie his Godhed, and resurrection, they haue no part nor fellowship with vs of the promise of God, touching Christ our Lord, neither are partakers of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which through Christe we féele in our heartes, to our great consolation &amp; comfort. <hi>Without faith it is vnpossible to please God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, aright faith in Christe our Lord, is cheefely to be required and sought after, and then our workes will of necessitie follow. For it is the proper fruite of that excellent trée: a true faith can neuer be without his works, which sticke so close together, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable. A faithfull man can neuer be
<pb facs="tcp:121:38"/>
without good-workes, no more then fire can be without heate: and yet a faithful man is not without sinne, as <hi>H. N.</hi> doth auouche of his regenerate man. We haue many examples to proue, that a faithfull man or a regenerat man, doth sinne often, and to vse the wordes of the Prophet <hi>Dauid; <hi>Septies in die cadit iustus,</hi> seuen times a day doth the righteous fal.</hi> This ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be vnderstood, but of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and regenerat man. Dauid was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate when he fell into whoredome and murther <hi>Peter</hi> was regenerat whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he denied with cursing Christ our Lord. <hi>Paule</hi> was regenerate when he solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced those wordes, <hi>Christe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus came into the world to saue sinners, of the which number I am the greatest.</hi> And I am persuaded that we are neuer so néere vnto God our Lorde, as when we féele sinne moste heauie. God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not such as be emptie, or féele not the loade of sinne: but <hi>Come vnto mee all ye that are loaden with sinne, I wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh you.</hi> I speake not of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, who in déede féele in this life a hell in their conscience, and do dispaire: but
<pb facs="tcp:121:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
GODS children do féele themselues wounded with sinne, euen to death, but by grace giuen from aboue, they doe apply that souereigne salue, that whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some medicine, Christe Iesus, whose passion hath purchased, whose bloud hath cleansed, whose death hath cured all our diseases and maladies. This comfort doth <hi>H. N.</hi> take away from his Family, and placeth in stéed thereof his owne preceptes, without comfort to a troubled minde. For his doctrine is, <hi>That wee must growe vp vnto the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oldnesse in the loue,</hi> which in playne tearmes, is to growe to perfection, and to be without sinne, which they affirme in this life to be brought to passe. If this be good doctrine, then the holie Scripture is contrarie. <hi>1. Iohn</hi> first Chapter <hi>If we say we haue no sinne we deceiue our selues, and there is no truth in vs.</hi> Likewise <hi>Paule Rom. 8. verse 20. The creature is subiect to vanity, not of his owne will, but by reason of him that subdued it vnder sinne.</hi> To the <hi>Galathi</hi> Chapter. 5. verse 17. <hi>The flesh Iusteth against the spirite, and the spirite against</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:121:39"/>
               <hi>the fleshe continually.</hi> These are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries the one to the other, so that ye cannot doe the same thinges that ye would. And Almightie God did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man at the beginning, this saying, <hi>God sawe that the wickednes of mans heart was great, and all the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and thoughtes of his heart were euill continually. Gen.</hi> Chapter 6. verse 5. The whole scope of the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth proue, that God hath shut vp all vnder sinne. Now if <hi>H. N.</hi> or his Il luminate Elders will still auouch that they are without sinne, then may I as truly aledge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they are without Christ. Let the terrible example of <hi>Sharpe</hi> and <hi>Allin</hi> moue you to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, how desperat a doctrine you imbrace, whose souden deaths, without any comfort in Christ, may remaine as an example to all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie. For the Author of this errour is Satan, who in a desperate state leaueth his pupils. For it was pride that caused almightie GOD to execute his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon him, his state béeing angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: so likewise he séeketh to bring man into the same destruction by the same
<pb facs="tcp:121:40"/>
meanes, through pride and presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we are pure &amp; without sinne, and so exalting our selues, we might haue the swifter damnation. For Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God hath cast our condition &amp; state so lowe, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out his mercie set foorth by Christe, we all perishe: as is witnessed by Paule, * <hi>God hath inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. Rom. 3.</note> 
               <hi>vs vnder sinne. * Also both Iewes and Gentiles are vnder sinne,</hi> (as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,) <hi>There is none righteous, no not</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> 
               <hi>one, &amp;c.</hi> We are neuer so néere vnto our God, as when we féele our sinne as a burthen or heauie loade lying vppon our conscience, nor neuer further off, then when we féele or testifie that we are without sinne: which persuasion Sathan doth féede our humours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, contrarie to the holie Scripture.</p>
            <p>Therfore, I conclude that this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, to liue in this life without sinne, is méerely the suggestion of Sathan, and not of the spirite of God. <hi>Christ Iesus came into the worlde to saue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> And againe, <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce.</hi> If <hi>Henrie Nicholas,</hi> and his <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:121:40"/>
               <hi>Elders be now without sinn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actes. 4.</note> Christe came not for to saue them.* For there is none other name vnder heauen giuen to men by which we shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be saued, but Christ Iesus: Therefore manifestly it appeareth, that <hi>H. N.</hi> and his <hi>Illuminat Elders</hi> are clean excluded, and haue no néede of Christe: for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and death doeth properly belong to sinners, then consequently not to them.</p>
            <p>Therefore ye nouices of the Family, which sée not into what daunger <hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher Vittell,</hi> &amp; <hi>H. N.</hi> doeth miserably bring your troubled mindes, looke wel betimes, espye their subtiltie, leaue the doctrine which is without comfort, and hath no warrant in the holie scripture: forsake those péeuish and darke riddles of <hi>H.

<pb facs="tcp:121:41"/>
spirite of God, by whiche they speake. How gréeuous ye are vnto the Church of GOD, may appeare by the trauell which is taken for your sakes: what of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ye giue, what stumbling blockes ye are vnto the simple whome ye ought not to offend, no not the least, let your conscience beare witnesse. *<hi>It is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>

               <hi>that offences come, but woe bee vnto them by whome they come.</hi> Know this for certeine, without the Arke there is no saluation: except ye abide in the vine Christe, ye bring foorth no fruite: ye cannot serue two maisters, béeing so contrarie.</p>
            <p>If ye cleaue to <hi>H. N.</hi> and his doctrine, ye haue no parte nor fellowshippe with Christe Iesus, for <hi>H.

            <p>For our battell is continuall, and shall neuer haue end, vntill our flesh be dissolued: and we at rest in Christe. If
<pb facs="tcp:121:41"/>
we must atteine to suche perfection in this life as <hi>H.

Therefore as ye loue your own soules, beware of his doctrine, examine it better, acknowledge Christ Iesus and his Gospell, and leaue the drowsie dreames of a doting <hi>Dutchman,</hi> and the erronious spirite of <hi>Christopher Vittell</hi> arude and vnlearned Ioyner. And although they boast neuer so much of the spirite, yet vse the counsell of the holie Ghost. <hi>Beleeue not euerie spirite, but trie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> spirit, whether he be of God.</hi> Think not within your selues that they cannot erre, it is a priuiledge not giuen to mortal man, but only to our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall God.</p>
            <p>God is true, and all men are liers. Beléeue not that his Bookes are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the spirite of God: for God is not contrarie to himselfe: the doctrine of <hi>H. N.</hi> is manifest contrarie to God, &amp; the

vnto him) &amp; let them not be snared in such doctrines of men: (yea men of the worst sort.) But if there be any loue of GOD in you, loue the Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and be of his Churche: which you can not be, imbracing <hi>H. N.</hi> and his doctrine. Consider his loue, his mercie, and his patience in suffering vs to fall into many temptations, that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne might be the more ioyfull to him. I pray you marke but this one thing in their teaching, how they driue the true sense of the holie Ghost into allegories: And when so euer any texte of the holie Scriptures is alledged by any of Gods children, they aunswere that we little vnderstande what is meant thereby: and then if they be pressed to expounde the place, by and by it is drawne into an allegorie. For they take not the creation of man at the first to be histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, (according to the letter,) but méere allegoricall: alluding, that <hi>Adam</hi> signifieth, the <hi>Earthly man,</hi> the <hi>Garden,</hi> the <hi>Woman,</hi> the <hi>Serpent</hi> to be within man: and applying stil the allegory, they destroye the trueth of the historie.</p>

               </p>
            </q>
            <p>And as they expound this place thus: euen so doe they all the whole course of the scripture, leauing nothing certeine to our fayth: for by as good righte may they make an allegorie of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes death and Passion, and say that CHRIST signifieth annointed, and so alluding and following that sense, denie that the man Christe Iesus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so by application of the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie diminish our faith and hope. And in déede, when I was earnestly solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by some of the Family to imbrace that way, which the mercie of the Lord kept me from, the first steppe that I should haue entered into the depth of their diuinitie, was, to learne the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Hebrue names of the
<pb facs="tcp:121:44"/>
Scripture, and thereby to expound the same.</p>
            <p>What a miserable case is this to sée the holie Scriptures thus drawen from the true sense, into Allegories, whiche may be taken many wayes, euen as the vaine imagination of man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise? And surely it is verie pernicious and hurtefull thus to expound the holie Scripture: and yet the simple people (not séeing the deceipte hereof) doe thinke that these bée notable men, and haue the spirite of GOD, and that they teache them suche thinges therby, as they neuer heard of before. I denie not, but sometimes the allegory may be well applied, and to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but when we applie the allegorie to destroy the true sense of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghost, it is by no meanes to be admitted. For if we take such true histories as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost hath left to his Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he sheweth what his will is, and drawe the same into an allegorie, what do we leaue certain, that our faith may depend vpon? and where is our hope, if allegories may haue place? For as I
<pb facs="tcp:121:44"/>
saide before, they expound this place of Saint Paule. 1. Cor. <hi>The last trumpe shall blowe, and the dead shall rise, &amp;c.</hi> The last trump is the last doctrin whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che shal be blowne vpon the earth, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is this of <hi>H.

What a horrible matter is this, to sée the holy Scripture thus dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen like waxe vnto euery purpose? A man would thinke, that no man hauing his senses, would euer credit such fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies and vanities, but I know too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that haue a speciall liking of this teaching, &amp; do unbrace it as the trueth of God. Many partes of this our countrey is pitifully snared by such vaine techers as <hi>Christopher Vittell</hi> is: yea, not a few ministers of the simple sort are her with intangled, (with sorrow I speak it,) and I wold to God that the chiefest place in this realme were frée of these men. If we should examine what is the cause of this errour: surely our sinnes is the chiefe, which doth prouoke the iustice of GOD, to afflict vs with such false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<pb facs="tcp:121:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the negligence of our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which eyther can not, or will not impugne their errour in countrie tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes where it is imbraced. The malice of Sathan is not behind, who séeing the ioyful succéeding of the Gospell of Christ the sonne of God, doth stirre his stumps in his members, to impugne the same. There is no Apothecarie in the worlde able to qualifie the bitternesse of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or medicine, as our enimie is to qualifie the bitter and poysoned doctrin of <hi>H.

               <hi>Lord, and our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Thus hath the holy Ghost decyphered all false teachers, and giuen warning to his children to beware of them. <hi>It is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie that heresies be</hi> (saith S.

If euer there were disturbers of the Church, whereby these scriptures and prophesies may be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, I thinke that nowe is the time: For what with the bloudie Papistes with their fire and fagot, continuall warre, with horrible murders on the one side, and the <hi>Anabaptistes, Free will men, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Pelagians,</hi> and the <hi>Familie of Loue</hi> on the other side, Christes Church hath
<pb facs="tcp:121:46"/>
little rest, and small fauour in the sight of man, but spurned at on euery side.</p>
            <p>But blessed be the Lorde our God, who in the middest of all calamitie and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie which his children daily suffer, yet can not be driuen back by any torment, to denie the Lord Iesus, nor his known truth, manifested to all the world: and the Lord raiseth vp stil some of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to withstand Sathan and all his rable, which striue against grace. And surely these and like errours are great exercises of our saith, how constant we will abide in the day of triall. Therfore though the world rage neuer so much, yet our graund captaine biddeth vs to be of good chéere, saying, <hi>
                  <hi>Ego vici mundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> I haue ouercome the worlde.</hi> In whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable promises we stay our selues, and assuredly beléeue, that although the ship of Christ be tossed vp &amp; downe with boistrous winds, yet perish it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not, nor the lest y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pertaine to him. No dout, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods déere children fal into many snares of errors, but they by grace are called backe againe, if not willingly, yet forceably, so that they can not perish in
<pb facs="tcp:121:47"/>
those wayes. For as our sauiour saith, that such times should come, that if it were possible, the elect should be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But it is not possible to be deceiued and perish, though our God doth many ways trie vs, and maketh vs examples and patterns one of vs to an other, that his louing kindnes might appéere more notable in our preseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; we be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked thereby to shewe a thankful hart in obedience to his will, &amp; also be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to craue at his hands continually, a perfect perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our faith in him, euen to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> end: Which we shal be sure to obtaine, so that no false doctrine of <hi>H. N. Vittel,</hi> nor any other, shall preuaile once to touch vs, bicause our hope resteth in the Lord Iesus. And I verily beléeue, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> although some of Christes houshold be entered into those steps of <hi>H. N.</hi> yet I dout not but the Lord in mercy wil cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; if they wil not come, he wil force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably compel them, if they be his. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you that are entered into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, through the swéete &amp; sugred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions of <hi>Vittell</hi> or any others, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séech you, euen for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord Christes sake,
<pb facs="tcp:121:47"/>
consider from whome you are departed, euen from our Lorde Iesus, who hath bought you, whose armes are stretched abroade, ready to receiue you againe, with the reioycing of Angels ouer your conuersion. How acceptable you should be vnto Christ his Church, by proofe shal be perceiued, but especially how benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall you shall be thereby to your owne souls, and what rest to your conscience, none can expresse, but such as taste the same, &amp; are partakers of the same grace of God in Christ Iesus. For this is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, that to wander astray, is a propertie belonging as well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods chidren as vnto others, and their often falling is by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Scriptures made manifest, but that they continue streying, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer returne home, or that by falling, they willingly wallowe in the myre, is a certaine note and mark that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not vnto the Lorde Iesus, nor are partakers of his death. Therefore if ye willingly perseuere and continue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>H. N. Vittell,</hi> or any such, you are strangers in Christes schoole, and it
<pb facs="tcp:121:48"/>
will be sayde vnto you, <hi>Depart, I knowe you not.</hi> Auoyde therefore the daunger ye be in, acknowledge that your tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers may erre, and are mortall men. For since the Apostles times, there haue bene none so priuiledged, but that he might erre. The olde writers did euer giue that title vnto the holy Scripture, and desired to be beléeued no further, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they agréed with the same: but your tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers will néedes haue their doctrine to be credited and beléeued, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or triall. Assuredly if you did discerne them aright by the holy histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, you should easily perceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and your selfe deceiued. For if it be a trueth they teach vnto you, why teach they in corners, which trueth lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not. Euery truth is able to defend it selfe, especially the truth of God: and it is of that courage &amp; boldnesse, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there is no power, (be it neuer so mightie) but it dare stand fast and abide the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, so inuincible a vertue is truth. Did Christe or his Apostles, being threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to publish a truth, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

losse of life and limme, they stoode in the quarell of God, against the tyrants of the world, and preuailed. But <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Vittell</hi> your teacher, thinketh it sufficient to seduce you in corners, and suffer you to be imprisoned: but for him selfe he is safe ynough. <hi>A good sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>will giue his life for his sheepe,</hi> but your shepheards wil not hurte their fingers for their Familie, but lurke in corners, and delude and deceiue greatly your simplicitie. Alas, why are you so bewitched, or so berest of sense, so to imagine, that a mortall man, an obscure Authour, whome you neuer sawe nor knewe, hath onely the truth, and all the world else seduced and deceiued: for so he him selfe confesseth: and that any other truth then the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach, is of necessitie to be belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: or that his <hi>Glasse of righteousnes,</hi> which you neuer sawe, hath in it the wisedome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of God fully made knowne: or his <hi>

But my hope is, that as many of you as pertaine vnto our Lord and sauiour Christ Iesus, and are members of the holy communion of Saints, shall at the last be brought to sée howe déepe you are fallen, and how sore ye haue ben woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

And marke this thing well: that man that once is entred into heresies, &amp; not wel reclaynied, is subiect to manifold temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our enimie: which is well proued in your instructer <hi>Vittel,</hi> who teaching the monstruous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Arrius</hi> many yeares together, now is possessed with infinite moe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and is the childe of destruction tenne folde worse then before.

            <p>Here ye may sée the summe of that godly wisdome that is in your Author, &amp; his déepe diuinitie. And surely in my minde it requireth no large discourse to confute the same: the spéeche of it selfe doeth sufficiently bewray the minde of their Authour: the effect whereof is, he and his Family haue onely the trueth, and all the world else are deceiued. But
<pb facs="tcp:121:57"/>
I may boldly say, and more truely, that no people in the world that haue any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but they hearing <hi>H. N.</hi> and his doctrine, will iudge him to be a false Prophet, a vain boaster, and a deceiuer of suche as put any confidence in him: whose doctrine is so absurde, senslesse, &amp; without comfort, that none but idiotes, or men without true religion, will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the same. And although many simple people doe imbrace this vaine way, by the subtiltie of <hi>Christopher Vittel</hi> and others, yet I haue no doubt, but the Lorde in mercie will beholde their simplicitie, and giue vnto them a right spirite, to discerne trueth from falshod.</p>
            <p>If I were disposed to lay abroade e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie odious matter, and euery Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie that I haue intelligence of in the Family, I should but infert the eares of Gods children with much vile mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which I had rather burie in silence, then by naming the persons, to make them abhorred of the multitude. I think it conuenient therefore, to couer their turpitude, rather then by manifesting
<pb facs="tcp:121:58"/>
the same, to publishe such odious stuffe, as would euen defile my pen to write.</p>
            <p>Syr <hi>William Moore,</hi> a woorthy Iustice in Surrey, had the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one or two of the Familye, who vttered much matter, which I am loth to write. I do gather it vpon this grounde, that forsomuch as their Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminat Elders do not sinne, and what so euer they commit, it cannot be sinne, (therfore if they fall into anye acte, be it neuer so vngodly) it can not be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sinne, as it procéedeth from them, because they are Deified. And what acte so euer they do, it can not be sinne, no more then the Prophete <hi>Osees,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was commaunded to take a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot to his wife, and to beget children in fornication, and he did so. Uppon such false and vaine persuasions, what vile doctrine doeth followe, the verie simple may perceiue. I doe absteine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from further declaring, or dyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any such matter as this is, least I should euen infecte the ayre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
            <p>And if any of the Family doe sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:121:58"/>
that I write maliciously, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofe, let them signifie their minds vnto me, and I shall satisfie them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately of all such matter as I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence: with the processe, wholy and particularly. And if they denie that <hi>Henrie Nicholas</hi> doeth boaste him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to haue the Spirite of GOD, (as I haue affirmed) and not by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation, but Godded with God, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into GOD, as he vseth to speake: for my discharge, I will let <hi>H. N.</hi> tell how and in what manner he hath it, that you the Family, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may perceiue what he is, rightly. His wordes be these.</p>

                  <hi>in his minde or spirit, his power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed me with a rushing noyse, and the glorie of the same God, became greate in my spirite of his loue, in such wise, that the clearenesse of God wholy inuironed me, and shined round about me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorough</hi>

                  <hi>the sight of mine eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came clearer then the christall, and mine vnderstanding more brighter then the Sunne.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>He doeth not let to vtter vnto the Familie, how mightely and gloriously the God of heauen is in him: so that his sight and vnderstanding became clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then the christall, or the sunne: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che if it be true, then it is méete that all generations of the earth submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues therevnto, as he saith in his dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. And surely this his boasting do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth darken the glorie of Christe Iesus with his Family, excéedingly. And this is beléeued &amp; credited among them, (the more pity) and the simple are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and mocked with such vaine boas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting spirites, and it increaseth daily in the countrey, and créepeth as a canker euery where, through the smooth speach of their Elders. But how close they kéep them selues, and will not vtter their mindes to any other that is not of their companie, I can be both an eye witnes, and eare witnesse: which is a very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb facs="tcp:121:59"/>
persuasion of sathan. For that man that wil not vtter his griefe or sicknes, and where the paine is, howe or when ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he be healed? it is an vnpossible cure. Euen so, in the Family, they are so close and so warie in their speach, that they will not vtter their griefe to any that can ease them. Therfore so long as they continue in that minde, they are reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesse. I shall not néede to confute their doctrin by the testimonies of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which in déede is easie to be done) I doe reserue the same to some zealous pastour in Christs schoole, which I dout not, but as occasion serueth, they wil be willing to perfourme. It is ynough for me to beginne the skirmishe, to display the Familie, to make readie the way, &amp; to discrie their force, that others may come after and ouerthrowe their camp, and put them to silence for euermore. He that will rightly consider the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of this heresie, with the Authours, what persons taught it first, and when it did increase and growe: shall sée, that euen when the Gospell began to shine againe, being couered with clouds, and
<pb facs="tcp:121:60"/>
darkened with dreames of men, then began Sathan in <hi>Dauid George</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie the prosperitie of the Gospell. <hi>Dauid</hi> died <hi>An.</hi> 1556. and then <hi>Henrie Nicholas</hi> supplyed his turne, and followed his steppes, not in <hi>Dauids</hi> name, but in his owne name, as a Prophet sent of God to rebuke the world, and to bring them (as he saith,) to the right wayes. But more truely may it be affirmed, that they peruert the simple, which were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the right and plaine wayes of Christe our Lorde, and haue brought them from the pure waters, which are drawne out of the fountaine which the holy Ghoste by the scriptures doth offer vnto vs, and doe giue them dregges and puddle, which vngodly men haue digged out of the myre of their owne imagination, and do deliuer it as drink sent of God to quench their thirst: but they deceiue them most shamefully.</p>
            <p>For to all our senses it doeth appeare to be ranke poyson, and doeth slay the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of euery one that doth vsually drink thereof. If these simple admonitions may doe the least of you good, giue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the imprinting of this booke of the displaying of the Familie of Loue, I haue beene answered by diuerse letters, but from whome they were sent, it is not expedient that I declare, for as much as I doe but guesse at the matter. by the reading whereof, you shal perceiue, that some in the same Family are touched so neerely, that they begin to kicke and spurne against the trueth, and stirre vp themselues with all the poore skill they haue (which God knoweth is but a little) to defende both their Authour and his doctrine. Many are the causes that haue moued me to publish these their priuate letters with my aunsweres there vnto. Especially ij. the one is, that the Godly learned seeing wherein these of the Family are grieued
<pb facs="tcp:121:74"/>
touching our doctrine, may plentifully in places conuenient confute their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and defend the puritie of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which is taught. An other cause is, the bookes haue come into diuers mens hands, who neuer heard of the family of loue, which do imagine that I haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this my self, their errors are so grosse: hauing no occasion so to doe. Therefore I haue for my discharge let the worlde see, that such there are as I haue manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And some there are you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that can say somewhat to defende their authour and his doctrine. Some wil not thinke it well done to make that common which was written priuatly for conscience sake, to whom I wholly agree in all thinges sauing heresies, (and especially those y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are secreat) therefore for my excuse I protest I could very wel haue kept these priuate conferences se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, had not some Godly and learned, ernestly moued me to the contrarie. And if I had thought that these rude aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres shuld haue come abroad. I would haue vsed some more diligence in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them: but since the family haue
<pb facs="tcp:121:75"/>
coppies hereof, I minde not to add any thing least they exclame against me as you see they doe. What part of our doctrine they finde fault with, by peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing these leters thou shalt perceiue. The Lord in mercy open their eyes that they may at the last beholde their backsliding from the right wayes of the Lorde our God manifested, and bring them O Lorde againe into thy folde, that we all may reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that good sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde of our soules Christe Iesus.</p>

You write that the paines you tooke, was for a priuate friend, fallen into that errour, and though you were moued to put it in print, yet you were loath for diuers causes: but chiefly bicause your conscience tolde you, that the eyes of the worlde should by that meanes see your mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest vntrue reportes, for falshoode would haue corners, and feareth the light. If it were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignoraunce, it were the better to be borne withal: but indeede (as it seemeth) it is come out of malicious enuie: Many goodly shewes can not colour the matter: for it is a custome for men for good maners sake, to alledge great wants to performe their intents, and yet will

You affirme also, that much more false doctrine then you haue set out in that booke, is taught among the people, which (to confute) you complaine your selfe to be vnable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme for the lacke of learning, neuerthelesse, you will giue vs a taste of this doctrine, to giue the children of God to beware thereof, yet many bookes (you say) are abroade which you haue not seene, and againe, some you haue seene, but yet had no leasure to peruse: for the vse of the people is not to let any but their owne companie, to see their bookes, neither wil they confer or talke in any points of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but with such as them selues.

Thus is your doings found out of so many as haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:121:78"/>
as ye shal be proued therein as in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rest, a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sister of both. The speach which you pretend to haue had with many of the company, I dare affirme it to be a great vntruth, &amp; is but a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sard (as you haue saide of them) to couer your malice withall. I would shame would let you tell the truth, then should you say as it is, that your mate <hi>E.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of this world,</hi> and howe can the trueth be taught, where the kingdome is not? for it hath bene euer hid from the worlde and her wise, but yet alwayes manifested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the outseuered ones from this world. And euen as the enimies of the same trueth haue alwayes martyred Gods holye ones, euen so nowe woulde suche worldlings as you are, doe, had you power thereto. And this I assure you, that the very same doctrine which those Martyres haue taught, the same doth <hi>H. N.</hi> teach: but you say, truth seeketh no corners, (see your appliment herein) Christe commandeth his disciples, saying: When they
<pb facs="tcp:121:78"/>
persecute you in one citie, flee vnto an other, &amp; we read that Christe also many times went from place to place, to auoyde such your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, the Scribes and Pharisees, who sought his life. And I pray you, did not Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob flee from his brother <hi>Esau, Noe</hi> from the whole worlde, <hi>Lot</hi> from the <hi>Sodomites, Elias</hi> from all men, <hi>Dauid</hi> from <hi>Saule,</hi> with infinite more examples? Then howe doe you approue your matter? It can (belike) be no truth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you allowe it to be true, a sound conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Likewise, you say, vntruely citing the wordes, that the Illuminate Elders can not erre nor sin, nor dare before the simple ones in Christes Churche, approue their Authours doctrine: you haue (I am sure) good warrant, to seuer the Illuminate Elders in the godly wisedome and holy vnderstanding, out of the Church of Christ. But I haue better to proue that you are not thereof. You disallowe others of bosting, bicause you might boast alone: is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> suffering with Christ to rayle vpon his true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers? or else in patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to take vp our crosse, and so suffer, till (by his suffering in vs) we be deliuered &amp; iustified (but I dare say you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand me not now) from sinne, death, diuill, and hell? but your wordes are no slaunders as you thinke, else woulde you season them with truth, for very shame. For were it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that companie (with indifferencie) to auouch the trueth of their cause, as it is permitted you and your companie slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously to blaspheme, you shoulde then bee

shewed in your right colours. Ye say also that their Rabies or Elders haue recanted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianisme at Paules crosse:</hi> as well might you be charged with other matter, &amp;c. But your obiection is false, witnesse <hi>my Lorde of Canterburie</hi> that nowe is: and yet more were to be saide, but the companie hopeth your conuertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although at this present your brethren in Christ (for their good faithes cause they haue in your licentious doctrine of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination and free election) fill all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons<note place="margin">The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Familie of Loue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> almost in England: but what reason haue I to charge you therewith, but forsooth to put you in minde, that you looke to your selfe and yours, before you reproue others, which (mee thinketh) is but reason. You giue a glaunce also at the greatest house in this realme, which you wish were cleare of such errours, but (put vp your bolt I aduise you) whether that house hath auctoritie to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke you and your adherents, that may you knowe hereafter. Moreouer, you say you could (if you listed to be a blab) tell out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny discentions among them, who yet (you confesse) will not in their best thinges make you or any other acquainted, much lesse in things against them selues: but it is true like the rest: all this is but to make your spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wonderfull, and your modestie greater then it is.

He alledgeth <hi>Iohn Leydon</hi> and <hi>Snypper Dolling at Munster</hi> in <hi>Westfalia,</hi> which were duely punished for <hi>Anabaptisme</hi> by the gouernours and Lordes of that time and place, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by many writers, as <hi>Iohn Sleydon</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And because these men were <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and as he affirmeth, schollers of <hi>Dauid George,</hi> therefore <hi>H.

For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many learned writers do affirme their matter to be <hi>Anabaptisme,</hi> yet this man will haue it the <hi>Familie of Loue.</hi> Fulwell doe you open your malice herein as in the rest, with your forefathers, who saide that Christ had the diuell, and was a wine bibber, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of sinners, &amp;c. but repent least that chaunce to you that came vpon them. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, looke I pray you, howe you stumble in your owne tale. You would prooue that none hath receiued their ministerie from the mouth of God (you'speake of Paule) did not Christ speake to him after his ascention from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? and I pray you tell mee, what mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration (that euer was true) came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other then Gods owne mouth? you are taught to flee such boasters: like enough, for so Satan
<pb facs="tcp:121:80"/>
hath alwayes taught his children. And as concerning the badge whereby you woulde knowe them, is (as you set downe) by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique declaration, which is vtterly false. For <hi>Moyses</hi> onely shewed his ministration to the <hi>Israelites: Abraham,</hi> to his children: <hi>Noc,</hi> to his familie: <hi>Lott,</hi> to his housholde: and all the Prophets, to Gods peculier children: the Apostles, in priuate houses, &amp;c. And nowe (to be short) the disciples of Christe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or his worde, which are taught by the doctrine of Christ our sauiour out of the mouth of <hi>H. N.</hi> do confesse freely before all men, the ground of their faith and religion: and though you will not credit it, yet it doth not followe that it is not so: except this reason (as God forbid) should alwayes holde, like as it hath holden of late: Because men say I am a theefe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no proofe of lawe: the testimonie of my neyghbours with whome I liue, nor mine owne words (against so simple an alligation) must be permitted: but all is vntrue nowe except it be to proue your false words &amp; slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous brutes trewe.

And then (being so taught vnto Iesus Christ in the holie lawe) to take vp (in the beleefe) their crosse daily on them, with Christ against the sinne (which he calleth, the true baptisme in the name of the Sonne) vntill that Christe (which is the way, the trueth, and the life it selfe) haue gotten a liuing shape or fourme in them by faith: and that they (through the Spirite of loue or Christ) be raised vp againe in a newe life (which he calleth the true bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme in the name of the holy Ghost.) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto all the Familie of Loue or of God, at

            <p n="13">13 In déede in your long discourse you haue shewed your disliking in one part of our doctrine, to wit, of predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which you impute to be the cause of the fulnes of prisons in England, but before the doctrine was set foorth, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons haue béene full of leude persons, &amp; such as regarde no religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you doe not well to charge the doctrine of predestination with so foule a faulte. Which doctrine standeth vpon the omnipotencie of God: so that they that acknowledge his almightinesse, must of force graunt his power in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination and election. And although some stumble at the same yet the faulte is not in the doctrin but in the persons, who take it by that part which it is not to be holden by. For as a sharpe two edged sworde being taken by the blade or point to defende a man, may as soone hurte himselfe as his enemie, euen so who taketh the doctrine by such parte as the holy scriptures haue appointed, it will be to their comfort: otherwise it may hurt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And when Christ hath gotten in vs a liuing forme or shape by faith, and so be raised vpp in newnesse of life, this you cal the true baptisme in the holy ghost. All which I doe acknowledge may haue verie apt application, so long as we imagine not a perfection to be wrought in vs, as to be without sin. For to be like to Christ, or haue his image, is to be vnderstoode, to be like minded to him who did not sinne, but that priuiledge onely pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to him and not to vs. For he is like to vs in all thing, sinne except: but this barre, sinne, is the badge whereby his death and office worketh vppon vs to our saluation.

            <p>
               <hi>M. Rogers,</hi> these are to signifie vntd you, that I haue perused a booke, wherof you are the authour. In your preface you say, you haue vsed this order, to set downe the authors owne speach, not adding or diminishing any thing, with the name of the booke, Chapter, or folio. I do wish that your word and deede had agreed therein. I call to minde, that I haue read many authours bookes within this 35. or 36. yeares, and among them all, I haue not found any writer that hath taken such an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as you haue done: for who so euer will write, to confute an Authour, he should set downe the Authours owne wordes, as they stande written in his bookes, and so to confute them by the Scriptures orderly, and not to take out, here some, and there some, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sentences, and part of diuers sentences, to make one sentence. You haue added and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in diuers places, (and to inlarge your booke withall, you haue set downe the most part of the sentences in two places) as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may perceiue, if they do confer your booke, with the Authours bookes, &amp; w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y them with indifferencie. I am fully persuaded, that the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, discreet, wise, and godly learned, do, ne wil not allowe of it, that any Authour should be so abused, as you haue abused this Authour, in wresting, belying, and peruerting his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.

But what you haue done, you can not vndo, it is too farre past your hands. And where you call in doubt that the familie will carpe (as you terme it) at your booke, and do offer, if they do answere it, a speedie replie will be performed, I for my parte (I giue GOD thankes) am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt of the Lande of strife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that ye walke in (and as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ye haue a pleasure therein) I haue wandered vppe and downe there ouerlong, and consumed much time there about, to my greate greefe and sorrowe: for those that doe loue strife and contention, would haue other like to them selues.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Receiued a letter from you touching my booke, wherein you séeme to bée offended for diuers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: For aunswere wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I refer your in many thinges to my letter sent <hi>ad amatorem charitatis.</hi> You say that I take vp weapon to fight with a naked childe, and so sporte your selfe in amplifying the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and <hi>Goliath,</hi> but to any article of doctrin which I haue charged you with all, there is no mention. It were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient that you would proue vnto vs such points of doctrine as you hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to vs, and not to dally in friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus and néedelesse matter. I haue saide that your author <hi>H. N.</hi> doth not speake nor write by the spirite of God, that your illumined elders are not without sinne, that the lawe of God is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be kept, &amp;c. Unto these matters you aunswere nothing, but blott much paper in néedeles probations. You giue
<pb facs="tcp:121:97"/>
vs a note that wher the spirite of enuy, pride, contention, crueltie, murther &amp;c, is: there is the diuell and not God. If I should nowe inlarge this matter and put it ouer vnto you, you would thinke me vncharitable. For I graunt it to be true, and the holy scripture is our grounde, our lyne, our square, without any mans mixture, and if <hi>H. N.</hi> had neuer writ, the scriptures are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to vs, and the church of Christ hath tasted sufficiently his mercy, without him: and you had béene in much better case if he had neuer beene borne. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las what doctrine do you hold, but that which many heretikes haue helde, and haue béene condempned by the Church for the same? It is not Christianlike that one man should persecute an other for conscience sake you say: but doth it followe that heresies and blasphemyes may be mainteined and no man mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the same? Let vs leaue wrangling and come to the trueth: if you holde a truth (as I haue often saide) why is it hidden and kept secrete? If we be in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, why do you not through loue &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb facs="tcp:121:97"/>
manifest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same plainly vnto vs? your authors darke and ranging stile (which you estéeme misticall) doth not sufficiently declare any false doctrine we teach. If you striue for a godly and regenerate life, certeinly we will with our whole hearts ioyne with you: For we acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> our bare confession of Christ with our mouthes is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. <hi>Not euery one that saith Lorde, Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Yet may the diuell vnder the outwarde cloke of holynesse nourish in our harts many false suggestions: there fore the Godly euermore haue had an eye to sathans deceite, and in humilitie of spirite haue still bewayled the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their sinnes, and acknowledged the same: which <hi>H. N.</hi> doth not in any bookes that I haue reade. For many standing vppon the securitie of kéeping Gods lawes, haue vtterly deceiued themselues. The <hi>Pharisies</hi> boasted of their holynesse and the obseruation of the lawe, but Christ reproued them as ypocrits, the <hi>Manachits,</hi> the <hi>Donatists,</hi> the <hi>Marcionits,</hi> the <hi>Montanists,</hi> &amp;c, haue outwardly sought and prescribed to

them selues straict rules and seuere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruances of pietie, but yet maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder the same blasphemous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: and euery heresie set out their holynesse, &amp; commended their patrons as men hauing the spirit of God migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely working with power. And doe not you in like sort affirme <hi>H. N.</hi> to haue the spirite of God, and to haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his doctrine with much more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then any in these latter dayes? Let vs not striue for vaine glory, heaping applications of holy scripture without conclusion, and so farre from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Let vs content our selues with the glorious name to be called christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and let this tearme Family of Loue goe as a new deuised thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant in holy scripture. The householde of faith is mencioned of, but not loue. Touching this point of doctrine, of the possiblitie of kéeping the commaundements, I knowe those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of scripture very well, and what God requireth: but our weakenesse in performing the same, appeareth <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. chapter, verse 5. <hi>Iob.</hi> 25. chapt. 5. vers.
<pb facs="tcp:121:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
4. <hi>Romanes</hi> 4. chapter, 20 verse: but I delight not in many cotations, but how to purpose the holy scriptures are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: therefore onely I will giue you to consider two places, the one of saint <hi>Paule</hi> in 11. <hi>Romaines 32. verse. For God hath shutte vp all in vnbeliefe, that he might haue mercie on all. Galathians 3. chapt. verse 22. but the scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of Iesus Christ should be giuen to them that belieue.</hi> But before faith came we were vnder the lawe, vntill the faith shoulde after be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Wherefore y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lawe was our schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister to bring vs to Christ, that we might be made righteous by faith, but after that faith is come, we are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vnder a schoolemaister.</p>
            <p>I pray you note howe the holy Ghoste teacheth vs not to trust in the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce of the lawe: For it is such a burthen as wenor our fathers were euer able to beare, but includeth vs vnder sinne and the curse of the lawe, that the blessinges which by Christes death we obteine through faith, we
<pb facs="tcp:121:99"/>
might notably become heires by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and not by the lawe. The Lawe therefore doeth shewe our weakenesse, and sendeth vs to Christe, who fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it for vs, and all his obedience and righteousnesse is ours, by imputation: &amp; we by grace through faith are made heires, and not by the déedes of the law: yet we reiect it not, but with reuerence and feare indeuour our selues to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme in euerie pointe what it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, but still we féele our weakenesse in perfourming the same, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore flée vnto Christe Iesus in whome we finde rest to our conscience, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our vnablenesse and infirmitie, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in him strength and habilitie, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che still by faith we apply to our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled mindes, when the iustice of God or the lawe doth by any meanes threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs. And this is our anchor hold of faith, manifested to vs by the scriptures of God to our euerlasting comforte. We are taught to say when wee haue done our best, <hi>Luk. 17. That we are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable seruaunts.</hi> Christ is said <hi>Act.</hi> 13. vers. 3. to deliuer vs from all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb facs="tcp:121:99"/>
which we could not be iustified by the lawe of <hi>Moyses.</hi> By him euery one that beléeueth is iustified: for if saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come by the law, Christe died in vaine. For it standeth not with the glorie of Christ Iesus, that any such perfection shoulde be giuen vs, to kéepe the lawe. For if by our infirmitie the strength of Christe be made perfecte. <hi>Cor. Chap.</hi> 12. so contrary wise by our perfection Christes death and passion is impaired and lessened. Looke therfore into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes office with a right spirite, and you shall sée plainely in him the Lawe to be fulfilled for vs, so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> what he hath fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> haue we full filled: for it is made ours by grace, otherwise we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not kéep the law but by Christ, neither are you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to shewe vs any example that any Patriarches, Prophetes, or Apostles that euer were, did euer kéepe the lawe of God in euery point as good requireth.</p>
            <p>Nowe touching the authoritie of S. <hi>Ierome:</hi> I aunswere by <hi>Ierome:</hi> who writing against <hi>Pellagius,</hi> doth shew two maner of perfections, the one to be agreable to the vertues of God whiche is voyde of all sinne, and here one earth

declared in the person of Christ: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which agreth with our frailtie &amp; is not pure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin: which argueth an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie to fulfill the lawe, otherwise then in the person of Christ. And in déed almightie God did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, for somuch as Christ being perfect ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fulfilled y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> law for vs, which vtterly declareth our weakenes &amp; inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to perfourme the same. For if by any other means y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wrath of God could haue bene pacified, or his lawe satisfied, Christ his onely sonne our blessed saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and redemer had not neded to haue ben incarnat &amp; to become man, to work this great effect for vs. And surely they y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> acknowledge our habilitie in perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the law, do mightilie shake the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice &amp; death of Christ our Lord, &amp; leaue in our conscience such a clog as is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remoued. <hi>Dauid</hi> demandeth <hi>Who can say my hart is cleane?</hi> again, <hi>God looked down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the sons of men: and ther was not one righteous, no not one.</hi> Many of the fathers did sée our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie in perfourming the lawe, &amp; therfore <hi>Austen</hi> saith, al the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

when y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is pardoned which is vndone.

And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as wee haue set downe the true principles of our faith and religion in a breefe rehersall, (which ye confesse to be sound and good:) yet (because that agreeth not to your minde, in that we confesse not somwhat therein where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye might haue your slaunders verified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, which ye looke for, by our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession) it is you say pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And I pray you tel mee, hath the like matter euer beene heard of ere this tune, that simple men, who can scarcely reade
<pb facs="tcp:121:102"/>
Englishe, because they haue read a booke, or heard it read, should be compelled to yelde an accompt of the spirite of the author that wrote the same? I thinke not: except you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe by like reason, that euery simple man that heareth a doctor preache, should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to deliuer forth all his diuinitie, or els to be committed to straight prison. Learned men dispute with the learned: &amp; it hath euer yet suffised amongst Gods ministers, a simple person to yelde an accompt of his beleefe sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply &amp;c. were not thinke you playner dealing better? you say that wee vse the propertie of the Cuttell &amp;c. Do you not remember that the fleshly minded Iewes, could not see their Sauiour when he was dayly amongst them, &amp; yet they boasted verie stoutly of their sight, and would not in any case confesse their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? Wee stand not vpon our tiptoes, (as you say) but we dayly acknowlege our blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and waite vpon the Lord for our sight. Wee say not that you are in errour, but wee say, that we haue (through that sinfull nature of the fleshe, that earthly lying being, which hath wrought that disobedience in Adam, where through we are all fallen) beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped in all ignorance and blindnesse, and for that cause are not ashamed to confesse our errour. Wee will not go about to conuince you by the testimonies of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for that lyeth not in our power, neither were wee so dealt withall. It is the Lorde (by his grace) that hath conuinced vs,

and brought vs vnder his crosse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he also conuince you, then are ye rightly conuinced, and so the praise thereof appertayneth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto him. And whereas you desire to knowe wherein you haue mistaken the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to that we saye, that you haue not set downe any whole sentence, but patched &amp; pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the same without all order, contrarie to your promise. For you say, you will not adde nor diminish, but set downe the authors wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des worde for worde: which you haue done, euen as one may take the tenne commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and leaue out some wordes, &amp; thereby say that God commaunded such things: as for example. <hi>Thou shalt haue none other Gods but mee. Thou shalt not steale. Thou shalt not committ adulterie, &amp;c.</hi> Leaue out <hi>none</hi> &amp; <hi>not,</hi> and then what is the commaundement? If this be good dealing, then you haue dealt well: let all men iudge. You say moreouer, you tooke not vppon you to write against any one booke, but to display the absurdities you found in the auctors doctrine, which wee shall fynde perfourmed ere it be long by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Knewstub:</hi> who (as we suppose) shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playe him selfe therein, euen like as you haue in your booke displayed your selfe and your adherents.

though we expressed our minde therein in plaine dealing, mought it please you so to take it. You say moreouer, you knowe that Christ raigneth in his Church, but who are the church is the question.

and strayning as is nowe vsed. You also denye that euer any in the primitiue Churche taught a perfection to be attained in this life: whereat wee much marueile: for that wee knowe assuredly, that the Apostles taught the perfection to be attained in this life, of all, and among all, that could beleeue, and stoode good willing thereto: and so haue all that hath since taught Christ Iesus, who is the perfection of all the workes of God.</p>
            <p>Is not this much ignoraunce, that wee who acknowledge (as wee saye) Christ Iesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shoulde denye his perfection? But it seemeth wee looke not for his shape to be wrought in vs, as the Scriptures require. <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 1. 13. Chapter. <hi>But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect shalbe done awaye, &amp;c.</hi> You must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with vs, that all the holie ones from the beginning haue taught vs to leaue sinne, and surely that doctrine lyketh vs best. But all your citations are to defende and mainteine the sinne, which seemeth to like you best. For surely it were well that all true Christians should rather take parte with righteousnesse, then be such aduocates for the sinne, as moste men bee at these dayes. Nowe further it seemeth moste straunge vnto vs, where you also say you knowe not what wee meane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our confession, made in our saide let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as concerning our true baptisme, In the name of God the Father, God the Sonne, and of God the holie Ghoste, which is the
<pb facs="tcp:121:105"/>
taking vp of our crosse, and right direction vnto Christ: who hauing then gotten in vs a liuing shape, confirmeth vs, through his holie spirite, in an assured hope of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, in the resurrection, and in the euerlasting life, (yet as you graunt, it may haue an apte application) wee see not any other way to possesse the kingdome of heauen: &amp; the whole newe &amp; estament is full giuing witnesse ther vnto. But if ye haue founde out any easier way thereto, so are not wee therein against you: which till ye can let ds perceiue and feele, wee pray you to suffer vs in rest by you, in this our foolishnesse (as wee do you) vnhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, vnmolested, and vnslaundered &amp;c. wee also say not (as you imagin) that our battaile is ended when wee are regenerate: but wee say, that Christe Iesus (that man of God from heauen, which is borne of God, and in whome the seede of God remaineth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sinneth not) he hath the power to subdue his enimies &amp; end the battail in vs. Wher you also say that <hi>H. N.</hi> hath not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirite of God, &amp; say moreouer, that he teacheth meere contrarie doctrine to the Scriptures, you haue therein (think we) entred verie farre into Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, iudging also greatly of your self therin: for it is nowe adays a common thing that euery man can say, shewe mee a good man, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as in deed in their beholding none is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themselues, &amp; therfore cannot beleeue that god hath such worke with any man, as to bring any goodnes more (the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei haue) to any other.
<pb facs="tcp:121:106"/>
And further we know, that with what mind a man beholdeth another, in such forme he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth whome he beholdeth: for a minde of enuie cannot discerne any paterne of Loue, no more then a blacke Moore looking in a glasse, can see his face altered into white coulour, &amp;c. And as for difference which ye demaunde to knowe betweene you and vs, wee haue fully answered you before, by your owne wordes. Nowe for our minde concerning Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, take vs not therein so short, for we allowe of it simplie and reuerently, in his kinde: and yet further also, euen as the holie Scriptures allowe the same: but wee like not to contende therin, nor desperatly to seeke libertie of life thereby, neither foolishly to serch for things therein aboue our capacities. It seemeth also in your letters that ye feare our mindes stande not to agree with you, in your iustification by Christ: in your acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging your selues to be sinners: in your weakenesse in perfourming the lawe: and that we seuer vs from you therein: wherein ye are too much deceiued: for wee acknowledge our iustification to bee had by none other meanes, but alone in, by, and through the death, passion, &amp; resurrection of Iesus Christ our Lorde and Sauiour: wee daily confesse our selues to he moste myserable sinners, and of our selues altogether vnable to perfourme the lawe: and therefore wee acknowledge and stedfastly beleeue the onely possibilitie to consist in the Lorde our God, through Iesus
<pb facs="tcp:121:106"/>
Christ our righteousnesse, and waite for the same: whatsoeuer you or any other say of vs to the contrarie. Ye say further, to be like vnto Christe, or to haue his Image, is to be vnderstoode, to be like minded vnto him, who did nat sinne, but that priuiledge (say you) onely apperteineth to him, and not to vs: then in vaine (as it seemeth by your wordes) was this written vnto the congregations: <hi>Let the same minde be in you, that was in Christ Iesus, &amp;c.</hi> But as we haue saide, the power thereto is not in vs, but in him. But you take part ouermuch with the sinne (as we thinke) and we ouermuch with the righteousnesse (as you thinke.) And because we are enimies to our vttermost through the might of Christ against the sinne, you vniustly imagin therefore of vs, as that we (of our owne power, without Christ) meaned to subdue the same: but farre be that from our thoughtes: and surely, who so sayeth so of vs, slaundereth vs muche. Nowe further you say you are not enimie to our persons, which wee would be glad to see, (for we are taught to forsake that false sinfull nature of the diuell, that contrarie nature to God, and to growe into that good louely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God and Christe in the spirite) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee see no cause ye should bee enimie to so good doctrine neyther. And as for <hi>Edmund L.</hi> you confesse as much of him as wee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged you with. Further ye saye, wee slyly meane <hi>H. N.</hi> by the white stone spoken of in the Apocalips. But vnderstande, we meane
<pb facs="tcp:121:107"/>
(as the text importeth) by all such as ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in that battaile, and not by any one particulerly. But thus much for certein note well, such as haue no lust to ouercome (in the crosse of Christe) that earthly sinfull nature, but haue much more lust to take parte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and yet notwithstanding doe claime a freedom w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Gods holie ones, in Iesus Christ, in an vnrenewed minde, knowe nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for it is written, no man knoweth that newe name saue alone he that receiueth it, boast he neuer so much of his knowledge.</p>
            <p>Therefore to conclude, for our true principles we referre you to the briefe rehersall, and for any other difference to these premisses and all other doubtes, we haue sufficiently resolued you (as wee thinke) in plaine speeche out of hartie loue. Let this therefore suffise for an aunswere at this time. The Lorde for his mercie graunt you and vs all, inclyned hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to doe his will (but first to leaue our owne will) and to indeuour vs (with all the elect of God and Christe) to the renoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the spirite. vz. that wee all (in one heart of godly loue) mought, as liuing stones, bee fast couched, or coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Iesus Christe, to an holy house, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or familie of Loue or of God, in as much as God is Loue: and not any longer to striue, but much rather, as seruanntes of the Lorde, in all meekemindednesse, to humble our soules vnder this his great grace, loue,

            <p>BY perusing of your reply to my first answere, I perceiue that our confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is to small purpose, for that you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue stil of the same mind you were, and your crabbed &amp; slaunderous words towards me is nothing impaired, with your smooth answer, saying, we charge you not with weightes, wares, &amp;c. If you of purpose had not charged me here with, what néeded any mention of such slaunders? but as in other thinges, so in this you bewray your stomacks and of what spirite you are. You take witnes <hi>My Lord of Canterburie,</hi> whose minde
<pb facs="tcp:121:108"/>
concerning your great Rabby <hi>Vittell,</hi> is knowen to many. You affirme the cause I take in hande is surely disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. The cause is Christes, whose of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and death is impaired and made of no effect by your doctrine of perfection, and shadowed by <hi>H. N.</hi> so darkely, that the children of GOD abiding in the vnitie of his Church, do greatly lament your follie. You say I haue belyed and slaundered my poore neighbours impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and yet you shewe no matter wherein: only you finde fault with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly setting downe your Authours spéech. No man can kéepe order with him that is without order. Of adding &amp; diminishing you often charge me and shewe not in what place nor in what sentence. I will not vse your vnhonest tearmes of impudencie: but surely you deale in this case as the Papistes are woont to charge the doctrine of Christs Gospell, which we professe: that it brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth sedition, that it pulleth Princes out of their seats, openeth a gap to liber tie, &amp;c. which howe truely these are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, the eies of al do at the last behold.
<pb facs="tcp:121:108"/>
The feare of our rigorous dealing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth you to lurke in corners, you say: what rigour I pray you was euer shewed either to you or your compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Papistes for their conscience? Imprisonment you would say, vpon submission, which is no rigor. Of such an houshold as we haue challenged to our selues (you say) you are strangers: we confesse our selues to be of no other houshold then of Christes, staying vpon the puritie of his word: if you will be straungers from the same willingly, it is great pitie. You had rather follow <hi>H. N.</hi> then Christ, and yet confesse that <hi>H. N.</hi> signifieth not any mans name, but hath some other meaning which you ne wee can tell. What a lamentable case is this, that men hauing any sence or vnderstanding, would credite such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeine wayes, to follow an Authour &amp; doctrine so egerly: and yet confesse you are ignoraunt who he is, or what he is. As for your confession published, (as I saide) it is a mockerie: for it is sounde and agréeing to vs. Why halt you so cunningly? Why will you dance in a
<pb facs="tcp:121:109"/>
nett and not be séene? Do you in your confession impugne the doctrine of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, or the possibility of the law, &amp;c. or doe you once mencion the same therein, and yet in your letters you shewe your dislyking of such doctrine, terming it licentious? Is not this déep dissembling, and yet call it plaine dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? I would not haue you accuse your selues as you vniustly charge me, but vse a simple and playn trueth, and shew your minds truely, and not hide it craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, and set downe pointes of doctrine agréeable with vs, and say it is your confession of faith, where you conceale the chéefe matters in variance betwéen vs. Oh when will you deale plainly? a wicked doctrine requireth shiftes and delayes, but trueth openeth her selfe plainly to al in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> day light. And for your weakelings which haue recanted, you say they were suche as coulde scarsely read English. You forget your selfe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much: was <hi>Sharpe</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie which recanted at the crosse, were they suche (as you would beare vs in hand) simple? <hi>Sharpe</hi> was a teacher, and
<pb facs="tcp:121:109"/>
others that I could name were not of the least account among you: yet to help their weakenesse you call them simple men, &amp;c. I know that some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue followed the doctrine, of <hi>H. N.</hi> these 18. yeares: I take you not to be so olde a scholler in the Family. You say you wil not conuince vs by the testimonies of the scriptures, for it lyeth not in your power, neither were you so dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Surely this is very straunge. It is the Lord that hath conuinced you, and brought you vnder his Crosse: but I pray you came this to passe by reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or by mans ministery? If man was the minister, you would haue vs beléeue that <hi>H. N.</hi> was he: but it appeareth not that you are vnder Christes Crosse: for in patience he suffered all wrongs, and there was no deceipt nor guile found in his mouth. He commanded his doctrine to be published to all the worlde, not in corners, but on the house toppe: not faintly and fearefully, but boldely and couragiously: he suffered contumelious spéech and slaunderous, but you do vse spéech of slaunder and disdaine as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth:
<pb facs="tcp:121:110"/>
so that you haue not learned Christes crosse, but <hi>H. N.</hi> his crosse. As for Maister Knewstubs doings, (as yet not exstant) you rashly and foolishly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill at him before you heare him, and condemne his doinges before you sée them, and say that he will display him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe euen as I haue done. This is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie in the highest degrée, to iudge and condemne a man before he be heard what he can say: this doeth bewray of what mind and spirite you are.

<pb facs="tcp:121:110"/>
               <hi>H. N.</hi> in diuerse places of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, to say that that fleshly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nature, that lying being, that hath oppressed the little ones, murdered the holyones, and spilt innocent bloud on the earth, which hath béene a wicked whore vppon earth &amp;c: who woulde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer iudge <hi>H. N.</hi> by these words to mean our corrupt &amp; wicked nature, &amp; not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or societie of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, per secuting the iust: for how can our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nature be said to persecute, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; to spill bloud, when this is done by the whole power, knowledge, and consente of men? The wicked nature of man can neuer bee properly tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or called a whore. And as I haue collected it, to bee spoken againste the Church of Christ which we professe, and you to be those holiones persecuted: So in my iudgement herein I haue not falsified, corrupted, nor maliciously slan dered your Authour as you haue collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of me. You say wee challenge our selues to be of the persecuting Church, and so your selues haue beene in times past: but nowe the Lorde hath made
<pb facs="tcp:121:111"/>
you sée, and you are ashamed of that whorishe nature, and you abhorre her, &amp; hope by Christes might not only in you to be disclosed, but abhorred &amp; reiected for euermore. If this be spoken of our wicked nature, can you reiect it? ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you cast it of for euer? We rather by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs affirme y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we may kéepe it vnder, &amp; not to raigne in vs or beare rule in vs, or haue dominion ouer vs: but vtterly to quench sinne, or reiect it for euer, the holy Ghost teacheth vs not. Whosoeuer hath béene rightly scholed in Christes Church, can by experience tell you, that to kéepe vnder sinne, by grace we may: but to extinguishe the motions we can not: and all those places of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which tende to the abolishing of sinne, are rather as markes to ayme at or leuell at, then to hit the pricke of perfection, which shall neuer be in this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You meruel notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>Touching Christs perfection we doubt not, but stedfastly beléeue he was and is perfecte and hath fulfilled for vs all the law which God required of vs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, but we vtterly denie this to be
<pb facs="tcp:121:111"/>
wrought as you affirme in vs: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth he worke this perfection in vs, nor by vs, but merely without vs: &amp; in déed this is a principall difference betwéene you and vs, and I doubt not but touching this argument you shall heare more hereafter. It blemisheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer much Christes triumph ouer death and hell, if wee shall also triumphe by strength in him. Our triumph standeth not in doeing, but in beléeuing in him which did. The glorie of Christe Iesus his office and death is by this doctrins impaired, darkened and shadowed, (as I haue often saide) therefore better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of it, it sauoreth to much of presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pride, attributing that to bee wrought in vs which is not: and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely herein you deceiue your selues and others. His shape to be wrought in vs, you affirme <hi>Paul. Cor. 1. 13. When that which is perfect is come, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is vnperfect shall bee done away.</hi> but this shall not bee vntill mortalitie shall put on immortalitie, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion incorruption. In the same chapter 4. lines after the place recited ther shal
<pb facs="tcp:121:112"/>
you find S. <hi>Paule</hi> opening his meaning more fully when that perfection shalbe wrought. Saying <hi>Cor. 1. Cha<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</hi> ver. 12. <hi>For nowe we see through a glasse darkely, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal we see face to face: nowe I knowe in parte, but then shall I knowe as I am knowen &amp;c.</hi> doeth not S. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly meane that this perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shal not be brought to passe in this life, but in the life to come? Who hath eyes to sée and beholdeth not these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? You affirme vs to maintain sinne, and that we are aduocates for sinne, &amp; you take part with righteousnesse: but with more modesty you might say, that wee acknowledge with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that sinne is still lurking in vs, against which we haue dayly fight and combate, notwithstanding our election and redemption, and you affirme a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to be wrought in vs by Christe which the scriptures allowe not. That christ is able to work such a work in vs we denie not: for all thinges are to him possible, but it is said, <hi>Omnia quod voluit fecit in celo &amp; in terra:</hi> He doth al things y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he wil in heauen &amp; in earth: but that
<pb facs="tcp:121:112"/>
it standeth with his wil reueiled in the scriptures, we denie. We are no main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teners of sinne, we are humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legers of our sins &amp; imperfections. You mention often y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Christ must haue in vs a liuing shape: by shape, if you meane a perfecte fourme, then wee deny any such shape or fourme to bee in vs: but if you meane, by shape, to bee like min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him, therein we agrée with you, as the scriptures teach. But herein wee affirme, that as it standeth with the weake condition of a mortall creature to be like that excellent creator of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earth, or like minded, so our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine frailtie must striue to attaine as néere the pricke as standeth with his good wil and pleasure to graunt vs. You pray vs to suffer you in rest with your folishnesse. I woulde you thought as you speake: but your wordes are <hi>Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi> for you accompt it high wisedome, although you tearm it foolishnes. Your disquietnesse I neuer sought, it is your ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dment: it is your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>H. N.</hi> to Christ Iesus y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I séek to bring you to.</p>
            <p>In the matter of predestination you
<pb facs="tcp:121:113"/>
desire not to be taken so short, for you say you allow it simply and reuerently in his kinde: you like not to contende therein, nor desperately to séeke liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereby: yet I will put you in mind what you your selfe haue spoken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in your first letter, saying: your ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious doctrin of predestination and frée electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the cause of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of prisons in Englande this day. Now sée how you agrée with your self: if you haue better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered the matter, I woulde be glad, and giue the Lorde hartie thanks, but if herein you speake (as your manner is) somtime affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, sometime denying, then we say you are vnstable and wauering in your wayes. Nowe, whereas I affirmed to be without sinne is a priuiledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing onely to Christ Iesus our Lorde: you say if the case be so, then in vaine was this written vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. <hi>Let the same minde bee in you which was in Christ Iesus, &amp;c.</hi> You further say we charge you that by your owne power without Christ this is brought to passe, that sinne is subdued
<pb facs="tcp:121:113"/>
in you: but we tell you plainely, that this perfection that you speake of, nor such a subduing of sinne as you meane, is not wrought in vs, neither standeth it with Christes good will to worke the same so effectually as you imagine.</p>
            <p>Sinne is kept vnder, and hath not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in vs, it raigneth not in vs, we are not seruauntes to sinne, this the scripturs teach in many places: but that we shall quench it vtterly or subdue if, with all the motions thereof, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach vs no such doctrine, being rightly vnderstoode. Looke I pray you, what that holy vessell saint <hi>Paul</hi> spake of himselfe after he was regenerate, Romaines 7. verse 14. <hi>I am carnal sold vnder sinne, for I allowe not that which I doe. For what I would that doe I not, but what I hate that do I. It is not I that doe it, but sinne that dwelleth in me.</hi> Againe verse 23. <hi>I delight in the law of God concerning the inwarde man, but I see an other law in my members, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling against the lawe of my minde, and leading mee captiue vnto the lawe of sinne which is in my members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:121:114"/>When he entred farre into the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this his frailtie he exclaymed &amp; said, verse 24. <hi>A wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body of this death?</hi> And in these extreame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations and battell which we haue with sinne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually (euen vntil death make an end) saint Paul by the spirite of God doth plainely arme Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and sheweth the remedie in like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flicts, saying: <hi>I thank god through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ our Lord &amp;c,</hi> this is brought to passe by him that sinne is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs. But as <hi>Dauid</hi> saide: <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the man whose sinnes are couered:</hi> And this is wrought only without vs, &amp; not in vs, as you imagine. So y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> our battell is continual and neuer ended in vs, vntill we be dissolued and at rest with Christ Iesus, contrary to your assertion. You sée no cause (you say) that we shoulde be enimies to so good a doctrine as you professe. If your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine were good and agréeable to the holy scriptures, we woulde embrace it: but because it is contrarie there vnto, we reiect it. To forsake that false sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

nature, with you we simply agrée: but with the Poet we say, <hi>Naturam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellas furca, tamen vs<expan>

That God can doe this by his powre in vs we denie not, but that he will do it in vs, (as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) the scriptures allowe not of. For it standeth not with the glorious office of Christ Iesus, that such perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and such a conquest of sinne should be wrought in vs, but that we féeling our miseries, our wants, our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For we are neuer nearer vnto our God, nor neuer more accepted with him, then when we feele sinne as a burthen or loade lye hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely vpon vs: nor neuer further of, then when by illusion of sathans persuasion, we imagin sinne to be quenched or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. All such as ouercome in the battell (you say) shall knowe the name

written in the white stone mencioned by <hi>Iohn.</hi> You say further that such as haue no lust to ouercome that earthly sinfull nature, but haue more lust to take part therewith, knowe nothing thereof: although they boast of their knowledge or fréedome neuer so much. This knowledge therefore you would conclude to be in you and not in vs. Your knoweledge we enuie not, nor your séeking to serue the Lord vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: For our whole care, studie, &amp; minde is bent to do the same: and we pray you hartely to ioyne your selues to vs, that you and we may serue the Lorde our God as he hath commaunded, and not <hi>H.

The Scriptures are our comfort and our stay, without <hi>H. N.</hi> He exerciseth a greate Popedome among you. You had rather speake and vse his phrases, not found in holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then content your selfe with the phrases of the holy Ghost. You often

mencion these tearmes, the lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the vpright fréedome, Godded with God, the newest day, the louely being of the loue, &amp;c. Are these to be founde in the holy Scripture? or are they not deuised by <hi>H. N.</hi> to bring admiration to his doctrine, by straunge and vnaccustomed speach? If the loue of God be in you, (as you woulde haue vs beléeue it is) loue the Lorde Iesus and his holy worde, and let <hi>H. N.</hi> with new tearmes and phrases goe? Belieue not that God hath wrought in him any such a worke as you pretend: examine his doings and sayings better: you wil credit nothing that is spoken against him be it neuer so true, you except it as lyes and heresies, what soeuer testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony his neighbours &amp; famyliers who knewe him long, vppon their oth shall affirme: but according to your concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued opinion, you like him, you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, you onely credit his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, dislyking others: which if you continue, as you begin, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope, nor helpe, nor conference that can doe you good, vntill the Lorde

            <head>A briefe Apologie to the displaying of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.</head>
            <p>IT doth appeare by reading of these discourses, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> familie there are some, who to defende their author and his doctrine haue vsed some diligence: what clamors they haue vttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me doth appeare: how often they haue charged me with falcifying their Authors sayinges is manifeste: howe they doe discredite such testimonie as is produced against <hi>H. N.</hi> (of such as knew the man longe, and were his familiers) is shewed. What vntruethes, what slaunderous speaches, what raylinge wordes, what caueling, what wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which doeth bewray the familie of what spirite they are, and with what spirite they are guided. Many friuolous matters I haue not touched, as not worth aunswere: and many things are but slenderly handled, as the nature of a priuate letter, (which requireth briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) will permit. Of all whiche falsefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and peruerting of their author, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:121:118"/>
they shew one place, wherin I collect that <hi>H. N.</hi> speaketh against the Church, which he tearmeth a whore: which they affirme is spoken againste the wicked nature of man. But whither of vs more truly haue shewed the true sence of the wordes, iudge I pray thée. Howe they tearme vs frée ones &amp; libertines: howe they call the doctrine of predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion licencious: how they impunge the confidence we haue in Christes death, calling it our bragge: how they affirme the Lawe possible to be kept: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other such matters, doth manifestly by reding these letters appeare. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the godly Christian, may as time &amp; occasion shal serue (hauing conference w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> any in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> family) sée in what matters these men are captiued, &amp; so to indeuour to heale y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sore, now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wound is opened.</p>
            <p>And where as I protested in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face that I haue dealt truely and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, not maliciously and corruptly, as I am accused: For further proofe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will briefely declare my euidence, that the worlde may sée the exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they make are friuolous cauilles.
