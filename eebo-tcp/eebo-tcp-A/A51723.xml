            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have curſorily diſcourſed upon eight of thoſe famous and noted mens lives which <hi>Plutarch</hi> writ; When I had employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were my vacancies to reſt: when I was idle they were mine employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Contemplation is mans greateſt repoſe, idleneſs his worſt employment: for it is not idleneſs, but a waking mans dream, a <hi>deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> of one that is in health, and an high way to that of the ſick. Man ſtrives in vain to be idle, the Imaginative faculty hinders him, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe employes him not, imagination drags him, he that will not bave it wander, skip, nor flie about, let him fix and ſtay it. I have finiſhed of the Vniverſall hiſtory of Monarchy, I print them not, by reaſon of the vehement tempeſt which troubleth Europe. A rule, let it be never ſo ſtraight, if it be laid in a ſtirring water, will ſeem crooked to them who give more credit to the troubled means then to the reall object. I will ſtay till the Sea is calm, and lay open that which the tempeſt hideth. I will in the mean time finiſh theſe other lives, if God doth not firſt end mine. Ancient tbings (as the Philoſopher
<pb facs="tcp:61864:6"/>
ſaith) are deſpiſed as fabulous, and modern are neglected as too well known. The ſubjests I write of were in thoſe days when Hiſtory was not dead, neither doth it now live in all men. Theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes may peradventure come into divers mens hands, to whom the Hiſtory is not new. The ſtile is various, the conceits (I hope) not common to delight thee with the one, and gain thee with the other.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eath is equall in all men; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion and glory make the difference (ſaid one) who ſought renowne by temerity, Making glory and oblivion contraryes, and judging him onely to bee inglorious, who was forgotten, as if obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion were not by ſome much more to bee deſired, then to have the memory of them to vive.</p>
            <p>Some doe ſo abhorre the being out of the world, that to ſtay in it death is horrid unto them, even then when it ſhould be moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and accepted, as the onely remedy and period of all their miſeries and evills. And though neceſsity would force him out of it, yet is he deſirous to remaine in it, and when ſometimes he ſhould deſire an everlaſting oblivion, hee ſeekes eternall fame even out ofnotorious infamy. Nothing is ſo tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him as death, and he judges it farre better to leave an abominable memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61864:8"/>
him, then to dye unremembred; As it were in diſpight of fate fantaſtically be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with his body, though extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; and deſirous to ſurvive in others memories, though with ſhame. And the worſt remembrance is more acceptable unto him, then none at all.</p>
            <p>Annihilation is an enemy to man, not ſo much in reſpect of being nothing, as of not being what he is. VVe ſhall not peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture find a ſubject ſo unfortunate, that would be contented to be changed into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>individium,</hi> no not to exchange his fortune; becauſe the changing would be the annihilating of him. Yet it ſeemes harſh, that a man ſhould have a recourſe to wickedneſſe to make him remaine in the world; to that which is not, and to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe he would not be ſo: and yet ſome do it, and attaine to it; whether it be becauſe ſome writers willingly ſet downe any thing that is great or notorious, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to raiſe their ſtile with the relation, ſometimes to attract mens attentions with the rumour, and with the great motion, awake, pleaſe, and raiſe up the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they awake it, but violently; they raiſe it, but to ſomething which naturally, and directly it abhorres; they pleaſe it, but often times corrupt it; or whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from that all men take delight in ſuch
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61864:8"/>
kind of relations; the moſt wicked are comforted through the ſimilitude; the leſſe bad extenuate their badneſſe by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it; the contrariety encreaſes the good mans merit. Great actions, though bad, do in the matter, communicate with good ones, and with advantage, becauſe they do not find it limited as theſe laſt doe, and ſo they deceive: and thoſe who think they can give inſtruction to others by laying them open and blaming them, are oftentimes deceived: They might doe ſome good in teaching of morall vertues, if vertue, as it hath a particular forme to diſtinguiſh it from vice, had alſo a particular matter to worke upon. Vertues matter is open and manifeſt, vices is for the moſt part hidden and concealed, and he is ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in it that operates, and he alſo that almoſt continually ſees the operating. One ſhould not peradventure loſe his labour in the teaching of morall vertues, if there were no meanes to teach their contraries, and that one might learne onely by example of imitation, and not of ſhunning and avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: There being onely one rectitude, makes it a ſecure judge of obliquity. Its having latitude makes it a deceitfull judger of rectitude: Nature is inclined to evill, and evill actions include a certaine acritude in themſelves, and if they be great, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61864:9"/>
have a proſperous ſucceſſe, cauſe more to follow, then to beware of them, and make more emulators then enemies.</p>
            <p>They merit but little of poſterity, that will relate evill actions cauſing that to be heard, which themſelves would unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſeen. Many evill things would be thought to have bin impoſſible to be done, did not Hiſtorians ſet them down as done: and how much better were it (to avoyd fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into them) to live deceived, then warned? Simplicity is a great vertue, and ignorance is wiſedome. True it is, that if the knowledge of the will which is done be taken away, it makes a man ſometimes runne into it; but if the manner of doing it be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

There are times wherein bookes would bee cancelled and ſome men who ought not to be mentioned; and ſeeing it is not in our power to forget them, let us at leaſt not mention them.

A peſtilent body leaves a contagious corps behind, and though men leave being wicked, yet they leave not producing of more, and a delict when it is done, and paſt, ſerves yet for an example.</p>
            <p>An infected body often communicates its infirmity, but never its health, though it be never ſo exquiſitely cured. I know not whether it be becauſe that nature in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence drives away the evill from it ſelfe, and thriftily reſerves that which is good; Or by reaſon that evill proceeds from any cauſe, and that which is good from a ſound and entire one onely.

is like motion, one is like a cleare and calme ſtreame, which (though it be deep) glides ſmoothly in its channell: the other like a fierce torrent, which ſwell'd and troubled, runs violently precipitous with much noiſe. Cur corrupt nature inclines to evill, violently forceth it ſelfe to any good: And ſeeing reſt leaves no ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion as motion, a cleere ſmooth ſtreame drawes not with ſuch violence, as a troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led rough one, and nature defends it ſelfe from its contrary, and followeth its like, we need not wonder if good examples ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cure, but evill ones doe for the moſt partinfect.</p>
            <p>The renoune which remained of <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> the membrance of his Counrry, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Nurſe, &amp; Tutors, when there was not any memory left to poſterity of any of his companions, no not ſo much as of their names, cauſeth <hi>Plutarch</hi> to eſteem him to be a man of eminent vertue.</p>
            <p>Of ſuch men (I know not whether it bee becauſe all things which belong to a great one are eſteemed great, or peradventure infamous) the Country, Parentage, and Tutors, are much enquired after, and ſometimes alſo what influence of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens he was borne under. Or becauſe wee ſhould conceive, that greatneſſe is not attained, is not the purchaſe of man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61864:10"/>
but the gift of the influences of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of the nature of ſuch a temperature, of the aſſiſtance of Tutors, and as accidentall not to bee valued in him: As if he did not in himſelfe include the ſeed of greatneſſe; and that to become conſpicuous he muſt be aided by the nature of the ſoile, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the ſtars, the temperature of his Parents, and the education of his Tutors; as if he were a plant no way excelling ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were it not planted in a better earth, nouriſhing by a more induſtrious hand, and hath a more benigne influence of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. Man is prone to deprive himſelfe of his underſtanding, and will, and annihilate (I was almoſt going to ſay) his free will, unman himſelfe, and grow beaſt, leaving to emulate Angels, and making himſelfe like to a horſe or mule. Can he then, thinke you, alter nature, gaine a new temperature, and command that influence, which hee cannot change?</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61864:11"/>
ſeemed to beleeve his ſonnes caſe to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the limitation or exception of that rule, then the confirmation of another contrary one.</p>
            <p>He that ſets downe the Probleme, reſts not at making learned Fathers infortunate in their children, but goes further yet, and affirmes ignorant men to be happy, as if engendring of evill, were the counterpoiſe of a good underſtanding; and the comfort of ignorance, the begetting of wiſedome. He frames hereby an exception to two ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved rules; Namely that no man can give that which he himſelfe is not owner of: And that goodneſſe is of its own nature communicable. One exception makes for ignorant men, if they can beſtow under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (which they themſelves want) upon their children. And the other is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to learned men, if they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto their iſſue the greateſt good they poſſeſſe.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, alſo that the wiſe man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes working with his intellect; he is not attentive in the act of generation, nor takes no great delight therein; he ejects ſeed without ſpirit, with a moderate pleaſure, contemplation diſtracting him from it. But a blunt fellow, wholly immerged in the act, caſts forth abundant vigorous ſtuffie ſeed and full of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61864:12"/>
But this proves rather the ability of the body, then the vertue of the mind, and that the one ſhould have children of a ſoft and weake conſtitution, and the other of a ſtrong and robuſtious; the greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſeed, cauſeth not more plenty of braine: if the greater quantity of ſpirit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth not a larger portion of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If it be a ſtuffie ſeed nature frames thereof much bone, and a maſſie <hi>cranium,</hi> and theſe being thick hinder the intellects contemplation, and like a ſoggie and dark miſt hide the beauty of the images from it: The underſtanding requires mild and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der organs, and there they will be heard; ſubtile and cleere ſpirits, and there they will be thick and cloudy. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher from the robuſtiouſneſſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, argues a weakneſſe of the intellect, and concludes a ſtrong one, in a weake conſtitution.</p>
            <p>How true ſoever the Probleme be in that part which concernes ignorant Parents; I will go another way to unfold that which belongs to learned fathers, becauſe many, though not peradventure moſt times, we ſee it confirmed by experience. Amongſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, man hath the moſt braine; amongſt men the wiſeſt; or he that may be ſo. The matter is viſcous and cold, it hath need of much aid to draw nouriſhment unto it, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61864:12"/>
much ſpirit to digeſt it; Theſe are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the naturall heat: The ſoule makes them hers, and taking them away from concocting, raiſeth them to contemplate; if not againſt, yet out of, and beyond their own nature, and becauſe ſhe would have them reach unto that which they doe not, ſhe ſubtilizeth them, daſheth them together and tormenteth them; they being ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, evaporate, tormented doe waſt, and weary are corrupted. The naturall heat wanting for a time its inſtruments, and having gotten it againe weake, it workes not being made unable, and growen feeble. Man's proper place is the earth, raiſed up into the aire he is diſordered, in the water he drownes, in the fire he burnes; The ſpirits place is the body, which ſoaring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the matter, afflicts, and deſtroyes it ſelfe. The ſeed (according to the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Phyſician) for the moſt part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the braine, if this be weakened it will not be powerfull to beget a male, if there bee one begotten it is on the womans ſide. Hyppocrates ſaith, that thoſe who are borne oftwo maſculine ſeed, prove <hi>Heroes:</hi> Thoſe that are borne but of one, if it be the mans, it foretokens greatneſſe, if it be the womans, they become effeminate. If this ſolution doth not pleaſe thee, ſay that the forming power, makes uſe of the ſeed to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61864:13"/>
make the ſpermaticall parts, and of the menſtruous bloud for the ſanguine. Of mans weakened ſeed it will make a very weake braine of the vigorous bloud of the woman, a ſtrong liver and heart. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall part will be inferiour to the iraſcible and concupiſcible, ſo the man will prove ignorant, and vicious. Theſe documents will unfold ſeverall Problemes: This is the reaſon why brute beaſt are not ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to catharres as men; becauſe they have a leſſer maſſe of braine: They need leſſer quantity of ſpirits to concoct, and preſerve them better, becauſe they employ them not in contemplation. A Philoſopher by chance was deceived in the ſolution of this Probleme he attributed the cauſe to mans upright figure, which being like a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck, eaſily attracts the vapours unto it. He knew not that diſtillation is not onely by aſcent, but alſo by deſcent and in a plaine. If a Limbeck be not like the figure of a brute beaſt, it may be like a ſerpentine or winding ſtill: and the former diſtillation being more ſubtile, the latter groſſer a beaſts head will be more aggravated, then a mans. Behold how the good ſonne is the fathers glory, and the bad one the mothers ſorrow, either becauſe he is born of her ſeed; or becauſe the root ſprings out of her blood, ſhe predominating in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61864:13"/>
production of the heart, and liver, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of all ill regulated paſſions. Behold why the ſons of thoſe who have the moſt ſublime underſtanding, have but a little, and the daughters much: when the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſeed prevailes, there is an effeminate male brought forth, and when the mans, a manly female. And finally behold why Mothers love their daughters children better then their ſons, and the Fathers the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The males concurre in generation with the ſperma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icall part, the females with the maſſe of bloud. The forming power makes uſe of the fathers ſeed to frame him, and frames her out of the menſtrous bloud. The Mother acknowledgeth her bloud in the one, and the father his ſeed in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and every one beares moſt affection to that where it hath the greateſt part. If thou doſt not acquieſce and reſt ſatisfied with theſe my reaſons for the ſolution of the firſt Probleme take it from the education; either becauſe learned Fathers, ſo much regard their ſpirituall ſonnes that they are careleſſe of the other which are fleſhly and carnal. Or becauſe they are unwilling to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them to their ſtudies, knowing none is taken notice of except he be eminent and finding by experience how difficult it is to attaine to that eminency: and that if it bee attained to; we thereby loſe our vigour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61864:14"/>
and complexion, and if not wee loſe our time alſo, and remaine unhappy, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much as the comfort of having ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our life in exchanging a few yeares of it, for a long and glorious remembrance. The children looke upon the Parents as their onely ſcope and aime, hold it a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing to go beyond them, and inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to come ſhort of them: and hold it more pleaſant and eaſie quietly to enjoy the fruits of their labours, then to imitate them: And deſparing to arrive to their height and eminency, if it was profitable: and if it was not profitable, not caring to endeavour, in the former caſe they forſake learning to embrace caſe and pleaſure; in the latter they contemne it as barren and fruitleſſe.</p>
            <p>If thou be not ſatisfied by this reaſon of education, proceed to the temperament; Great underſtandings an ſubject to black choler, becoming ſo, rather then being borne ſuch, and this temperature increaſing, with a mournefull metamorphoſis trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes a wiſe man into a mad man. When theſe men beget children, melancholy is already in the laſt degree of its perfection; The ſon becomes his heire as he is then, not as hee was, and begins where the Father ends; and this humour growing to its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted paſſe, and wanting but little of being mad, in a few yeares he wholly becomes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61864:14"/>
ſuch; hence it happens that Socrates chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, his cooleneſſe making him prudent were utterly ſtupid: and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> whoſe heate made him raſh and temerarie, his children became frantick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> rehearſes ſome actions of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> when he was yet a child, I will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſider them, this age being fitter then any other, to ſearch into the nature of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which nature appeares plaine, when the ſubject is neither capable of diſcourſe nor operation. But this is not (you may ſay) the knowing of a mans nature, well may it be the knowing of his body. It is at that time a perfect mixt, as for its being, though not ſufficiently mixed, to be fitted for operation. Experience of it ſelfe is not that which maketh aged men prudent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth ignorance alone, make young men raſh and inconſiderate Theſe have not the ſoule ſo free as to withſtand the paſsions of the body, the others body is not ſo ſtrong as to hinder the motions of the ſoule. What can an almoſt meere impotencie worke, or how can the other withſtand being utterly impotent. In a youth one cannot know what way he will take when he is a man; Yet it might be knowne had he not a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſoule, or were it not ſo fettered by the temperament: The wiſe man acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe ignorant in the ſearch of what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61864:15"/>
it would doe, if it were freer, becauſe it is impoſsible to conjecture what that will bee, which is not, nor hath not bin. When thou feeſt it in being, thou wilt be able to diſcourſe (with the aſsiſtance of that which is) of what it ſhall be; yet it is alwayes difficult to warrant, or ascertaine any ſuch thing. The actions of a child are not ſufficient to teach thee his nature: there is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, and the particular nature; the former is proper to the age, the latter to the <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum:</hi> thou ſhalt know the one, by that which hee operates not according to the other; either he adds to it, or takes from it: And though hee ſeemes with time to change it, he doth not; he may ſometimes overcome it, but never change it, wandring through many univerſals, but alwayes with its owne particular. The nature is the ſame at all times according to the more or leſſe, ſometimes riſing, ſometimes fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us, becauſe we doe not know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the operation, which is cauſed by the augmentation and diminution of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: nor yet the various conſonancie, which the ever conſtant nature of the <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum,</hi> hath with the differing natures of age. It ſeemes new to us, though it bee but changed not altered.

There is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſure in hearing Beaſts ſpeak, though they ſpeak ill, then men though they ſpeak better: The one overcomes, the other do but follow Nature. Man takes great delight, and (which I more wonder at) hath a great inſtinct from Nature it ſelf to oppoſe it. The delight would be leſs, the profit greater, if he did it for profit rather than pleaſure. God commanded him to manure the Earth where it was barren, and that where it brought
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61864:18"/>
forth thorns, he ſhould cauſe bread to grow: The Precept was to labour, not to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but he where he ſhould grow fruitfull becomes barren, and where he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bread of grace, he feeds the thorns of ſin. He feels within himſelf that inſtinct of oppoſing nature. He knows his happineſs conſiſts in the overcomming of it; but equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating therein, and either for want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or through a wilfull miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whereas he ſhould ſtrive againſt his own inward, he oppoſeth the outward Nature, where he finds Hills he makes Plaines, where Plaines he raiſes Hills; in pleaſant places he ſeeks horrid ones, and brings pleaſantneſs into places of horrour; he ſeconds that which he ought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and that which he ſhould follow he oppoſes; and when he thinks he triumphs over anothers nature, his own nature tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over him. This is a Stratagem of the particular nature to ſet us at odds with the univerſall; And that ſhe may remain quiet within, ſhe cauſeth us to ſtrive abroad. Like to a cunning politick Tyrant, who having a valiant and fierce Subject within his City, by whom he fears to have violence or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition offered him; if he can find no other remedy he ſends him into the field to fight with the Enemy, to the end, that venting his violence and fantaſticalneſs abroad, he may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61864:19"/>
have plenary power to tyrannize at home at his pleaſure. God is angry with us that we ſhould at the ſame time reform that which he himſelf had framed; and conform our ſelves to that which we had deformed. He had (as we may ſay ſuffered <hi>Solomon</hi> to run unpuniſhed while he gave himſelf in prey to women, worſhipped Idolls, loved a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of fleſh, which would quickly return to duſt, better then himſelf: but no ſooner did he put his hand to levelling of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, but preſently he cauſed rebellions to be raiſed againſt him, and decreed the rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Kingdom from him: It ſeeming ſtrange to him that man ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to follow his own bid nature, but he muſt alſo perſecute the good, and to be a King where he ſhould obey, and inſtead of a Vaſſall become a Tyrant. Peradventure alſo that little kind of liſping wrought the ſame effect in <hi>Alcihiades,</hi> as a ſmall ſpot doth in a fair face; a remiſs ſtile enterlaced amidſt lofty Dictates and pithy Speeches; Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe contraries compared, and placed neere one another ſhew their luſter more plainly, but becauſe it gives envy ſatisfaction, which taketh pleaſure in defects; or by reaſon it takes away that aſtoniſhment which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of delighting, confounds. I do not ſay that imperfection can make perfect, that a defect can encreaſe beauty, and therewith
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61864:19"/>
delight. A ſpot in a beautifull face, a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of remiſs ſtile in a flouriſhing ſpeech, adde not grace to a viſage, nor beauty to a dictate, they do not increaſe delight; they entertain it, becauſe they extinguiſh, and then renew it; The continued action of an Agent increaſes the effect; he that ſtands neareſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When the continued pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the delightfull object doth exceed, the delight ceaſes, and comming to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of what it can contribute, it delights no longer. He that will renew his pleaſure, muſt begin with paine, and go out of the naturall ſtate to return into it. Let him look upon the ſpot; Go out into the cold; run over the remiſs and meaner ſtile; Then return to behold the beauty of the face; to enjoy the ſweetneſſe of the heat; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the beauty of the ſpeech, and efficacy of the phraſe; He that looks upon a faire peece limmed by a Maſter workmans expert hand, is much delighted thereby, yet after the firſt violence it failes and diminiſhes; becauſe it is come to the extreme it vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes. But he that is admitted to ſee the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable working of an excellent Pencill upon a plaine and ſmooth board, continues ſometimes grieved at the framing of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, then delighted with ſeeing it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61864:20"/>
perfected; And all thoſe proceedings being full of reformed deformities refined, are full of relight keeping the imagination in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall motion, through the Novelties. A Muſitian cannot pleaſe better than by erring. He paſſes through diſſonancies, and frames Pauſes, and with the one takes the hearer out of his naturall ſtate and with the other he ends an operation. Then he begins again to ſing, goes on in conſonancy, to renew the operation, to return the hearer into his naturall ſtate by delighting him. What do fooles &amp; naturall idiots in great Noblemens Palaces? Their imperfection ſerves to draw the Nobleman out of the naturall ſtate into which wiſe and underſtanding mens diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes had brought him, that he may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards return unto it with more delight. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it is true that man deſires to find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, even in thoſe things which are pleaſing to him, and that he rejoices when he hath found it; peradventure ſeeming unto him that he hath gotten command over him that hath it, and that he may reape the delight of pardoning, without f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61864:20"/>
it, intending to pleaſe himſelfe; and finding it (though never ſo great) uncape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſatisfie him, perſiſting nevertheleſſe in his deſire, becauſe he will not beleeve it is impoſſible to be attained, he ſeekes the reaſon why he hath not attained it. If he finds the defect he rejoyces, it not lying in the unſatiabilitie of the deſire, but in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of the object. He hopes to finde one totally perfect, and that when he hath found it, he ſhall be ſatisfied. Then becauſe of the deficiencie which he findes in all carthly things, he raiſeth up himſelfe to beleeve, that there is a primarie cauſe without defect: and finding it not to his ſatisfaction in this world, he thinks he ſhall finde it in heaven. And ſo behold the Creature ſerves for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to bring man to ſeeke out the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; not onely by what is perfect in it, but alſo by that which wants perfection. There one may perceive there is a God, and that the creature is not he: If the creature were totally perfect, who would denie it God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head? Flatterers, who have fawned upon it have even adored it for ſuch; and ſimple people, who have beleeved it perfect, have offered incenſe to it as Celeſtiall.</p>

If upon great commotions depend great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; and if feare be the ſtrongeſt paſsion that is in man, what pleaſure ſhall he not find in the paſsing from dangers to ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?

paſsions, if you compare them with feare. This Chimericall paſsion is of greater force then thoſe reall ones, if we will beleeve an eminent Polititian. Many and true provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations (ſaith he) had <hi>Otho</hi> to adventure himſelf to obtain the Empire. Deſire of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, a riot even burthenſome to a Prince, Poverty ſcarce to be tolerated by a private man, Anger and hatred towards <hi>Galba,</hi> Envy againſt <hi>Piſo.</hi> He feigned but one only of theſe paſsions to make him the more to affect it and that was Feare. What makes Tyranny ſo pleaſing, but the love of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Where it is great, he can deſire no more; where it is but ſmall, he encreaſes it; where there is none, he feigns it. Yet the tragick ſcene of theſe men is full of bloud unjuſtly ſpilt, ſometimes of guilty, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of half guilty, and ſometimes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent men. I ſhould ſay only of innocent, for the greateſt fault that Tyrants puniſh, deſerves the the name of the greateſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. But if if this man be not yet grown ſo inhumane, as to feign a fear where there is none; yet he ſeldome reſerves ſo much humanity as not to grudge and bemoane himſelf, becauſe there is none. <hi>Tiberius</hi> comes into the Senate houſe, he finds all the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to ſecond his thoughts, and flattter his actions: No body Contradicts him, no man provokes him, He goes forth angry,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61864:22"/>
and enraged: Calls them baſe men, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for ſlavery. He was troubled and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted (ſaith the Author) with ſuch baſe ſervility, he was aſhamed (ſaid I) of having cauſed it: He was ſorry (I now ſay) that he had loſt that feare, which was the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie of his delights <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> alſo knew peradventure that to be true which I ſaid, though they did not explaine it. They call a Tyrant unhappy; not by reaſon of any outward feare, which he with pleaſure and delight ſatisfies by the death of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one, ſometimes another Citizen: But by reaſon of the inward feare, which inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gnawing his entrailes lets him neither find reſt, nor hope for remedy. If the griefe and paine of this did not counterpoiſe, yea go beyond the pleaſure and delight of the other, we ſhould amongſt the Pagans rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon more Tyrants than Princes. There is a Character imprinted in mans Nature by God, which we call Conſcience, to the end that even who thoſe may feare him who not know him. Contenting himſelf rather with not being known, then not feared, to the end that the world ſhould not be loſt for want of feare, nor men arrive to the extreme of wickedneſſe.</p>

Men had alſo rather compaſsionate then admire: with compaſsion one benefits a wretched man without any loſs, yea, with game, with admiration he payes an homage due to a great worth, even to his own diſgrace. The one is the daughter of that which the cataſtrophe in the world uſeth to beſtow; the other of that which our weakneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine: to the firſt one goeth volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, to the other he is dragged.

Finally man finds ſuch unſavourineſſe in the meane and ſo much acrimony in the extreame, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily he drawes back moſt from the firſt when he hath not arrived unto it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances forward moſt when he is come to it, or gone beyond it, becauſe he will not ſtay at it, or becauſe he would ſtill go further from it: whence comes that the young man ſhortens his years. the old man encreaſes them. His domeſtick and familiar figure (ſaith <hi>Quintilian)</hi> is hyperbole, becauſe he is an enemy to truth. But this cannot be, for truth is the object of mans moſt noble pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it is not each ones equality, it is reſerved only for the beſt, that which he ſees in this world is ſufficient to move his deſire, but becauſe it is not ſo much as will ſatisfie it, he is perplexed. He would have it to be ſo, but cannot really make it ſo; he doth it as much as he can with hyperbole: ſo that he lyeth, not in hatred, but in behalfe of truth corrupting that which is not his object, to make it become ſo.</p>

               <hi>Alcibiades</hi> hath many Athenian Nobles that make love to him, and offer him great preſents; he contemnes them. A Country fellow falls in love with him, ſells all he hath, and preſents the money to him. <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> accepts of his love, and his gift; and with that mony makes him preſently gaine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61864:25"/>
a Talent. He hath reaſon to make more eſteeme of the Country Fellows affection, then of the Nobles. It was greater, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer: He that gives not all he hath to the beloved perſon, loves him not above all things; he loves that better which he hath reſerved for himſelf. The paſſions of ſimple men are plaine, thoſe of Nobles are mixed with ambition: The love of the one is meere love, that of the other hath pride coined with it. The one ſeeks only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himſelf, the others to ſubject alſo, yea, &amp; more then ſubject; hautines prevailing in them above affection, whileſt ſometimes through jealouſie, by the death of the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they have deprived themſelves of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, becauſe they would not endure a Companion. They ſay that love enters not an abject and degenerous breaſt, but links it ſelf only to noble hearts. It is true of that part of love which is pride, the peculiar ſin of great ones. Love is a Tyrant, not only becauſe he tyrannizes over him whom he conquers, but becauſe he alſo imprints in in him the Character of tyrannizing. They decline love to be a deſire of enjoying the thing beloved. But it is alſo a deſire to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate its body and ſoule, and to take away free will from it. He that ſaid, <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through pride, ſaid well. He that ſaid he ſinned through exceſs, though he did not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61864:26"/>
unfold it well, did not peradventure ſpeak totally ill. The Angell ſaw God, not as he is, for then he would have loved him of neceſſity, and in an ordinary way, and had not ſinned: He loved him voluntarily, and diſorderly, and ſinned. For it being made manifeſt to him, that God would be huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated (as we may ſay) and man Goddiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, changing vertue into paſsion: adding pride to love; to the deſire of enjoying, the deſire of tyrannizing; willing to be only alone, or ſuffer no equall, he forſook the love of God; Iealous, armed himſelf with hatred againſt mankind, to hinder it, as his rivall, from enjoying the clear ſight of the beatificall object.</p>
            <p>But how ſtands <hi>Socrates</hi> amidſt this mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of lovers? He peradventure belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that where there was ſo much beauty, there was alſo a great diſpoſition to vertues. I meane not ſpeculative but morall: Even as amongſt Brutes, that which is the faireſt, performes beſt its proper naturall operation; the Lion hath moſt valour, the Greyhound moſt ſwiftneſs; ſo to the underſtanding of many, the faireſt man ſhould beſt perform thoſe operations which are proper to man; who being a compound of ſoule and body, his ſaid operations belong rather to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall, then to the ſpeculative intellect. The ſpeculative goes to the knowledge of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61864:26"/>
firſt truth, the practick to the well directing of the operations according to true wiſdom: the one ſhall ſee its object only at home, the other can only attaine unto it in its way. And how ſhould Nature give us our end in this world, which though we labour for never ſo hard, we cannot attaine in it. But in what manner can that ſaying agree with <hi>Alcibiades</hi> actions, who being exceeding beautifull, was notwithſtanding ambitious, diſhoneſt and laſcivious? They may ſay that the Prognoſtick is not ſo infallible in man, who operates by election, as in beaſts who work according to nature: and that you can hardly ſo know beauty, as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Maſculine from the ſeminine. That which proceeds from the facility which nature finds in working with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that which it finds in operating with the temperate. That which hath its influence from Venus, and that which hath it from Sol, and Iupiter: The one is ſeen to incline the inferiour part to condeſcend to embracements. The other makes prudent, addes Majeſty, and reſpect, and brings up the ſuperiour part to a chaſte deſire of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly beauty. The one belongs to the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the other to the mind; The firſt falſe, the other a true mark of a wiſe mind. If <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> did conſider what <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was, he might quickly know from what fountaine
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61864:27"/>
his beauty was derived. Some one attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo much to this beauty, which we terme Maſculine, and which being perfect is a ſign of a moſt exquiſitely tempered body, that he affirmed, that if any ſuch were, and once being did endure; it would make the ſubject thereof moſt calme and happy, its ſenſes perfect, its underſtanding eminent, its paſsions moderate, and, without repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, obedient to reaſon. I never did grant it any ſuperiority in Sciences, once I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to yeeld it in morall actions: Now I deny it in all, and will grant it no ſuperiority, but in thoſe vertues only which ſerve for the body, the appetitive, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, the concoctive, the retentive, and the expulſive. To ſpeculation the body is a burthen, and oppoſes it ſelf to the working of it: The ſtronger it is, the more it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, and it is ſtrongeſt, when it is moſt temperate. In a dry, leane, withered body, which is almoſt no body at all, you ſhall find paſsions almoſt quite extinguiſhed; the underſtanding in a manner Angelicall, a perfect operation; and moſt excellent ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. In bruite beaſts the caſe is different, becauſe the reaſon is likewiſe ſo. They have need of the bodyes aſsiſtance, if they will operate well; man needs none but onely not to be hindred by it. In beaſts the ſtronger it is, the more it helps, in men when it is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61864:27"/>

I will ſay that <hi>Galen</hi> tooke a better way then Socrates, though each of them proceeded according to his owne art.

And if ſeeing a defect in another which we have not our ſelves, is a cauſe of comfort rather than griefe in us: whence groweth our pleaſure in ſpeaking and hearing others evill ſpoken of? And And how ought old men bee grieved at the follies they ſee in young men? Youth ſhould grieve at the defects of old age, and old men laugh at the ignorance of youth. But they are not ſorry that a young man wants wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome but onely that he doth not know it, and eſteem it; becauſe they exceeding in this noble vertue, the daughter, and onely comfort of old Age, they are grieved to ſee that Talent deſpiſed for which onely they can bee reſpected and reverenced. Young men laugh at old men, becauſe the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they ſee preſent, being greater than
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61864:29"/>
the griefe, moves their imagination ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier than the future, on which oftentimes they doe not think, and which they know not whether it will happen or no; or hope it will be better. What a barbarous thing is a young man? Let him that will bee ſafe from him, ſhun him: he walks in unknown wayes, and (I had almoſt ſaid) like a thing mixt of Man and Beaſt; the degree of the mixture is unknown, what he will be, is impenetrable: ſometimes they are like Beaſts, becauſe they doe not make uſe of reaſon; ſometimes worſe, becauſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it. The overmuch heat hinders wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in youth, too much coldneſſe extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes it in old age: ſometimes it never comes, but man paſſes from immaturity to rottenneſſe; and when it does come, it is alwayes late, and laſts but a little. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the onely one amongſt ſublunary things, which doth not receive the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Periods, a Beginning, a Being, an Increaſe, and Declining. <hi>Quintilian</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders why all men being made by Nature to be good, few are ſuch. I (to not wonder at it) doe rather conſider whence it proceeds, that the ſuperior, part for the moſt part, is not ſo; and whereas it is made to command, it obeyes. Peradventure the advantage of yeares is a great cauſe of it; in which our ſenſe doth with eaſe tyranny over us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

meeting with any oppoſition, or let from the ſoule, and becauſe they are the firſt yeares, it takes ſtrong root, and being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it frames a habit. Then comes Reaſon in, and findes the Tyrant already in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, fortified, and rooted: It muſt fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which he is, and that which he hath done: it muſt ſubdue the forces of ſenſe, overcome the reſiſtance of habit, and deſtroy that Nature to frame a new one. But why doe we not at the firſt, as ſoon as we are born, attain to reaſon? Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture becauſe we would then preſently ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate without a guide; and wanting experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we ſhould precipitate. Learned and wiſemen (induced by a caſe which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our dayes, and being ſingular, and almoſt monſtrous, makes no preſident) have believed, that a Subject may ſecurely paſſe over from ſpeculation to practice without any further experience. I will here ſet down my opinion therein, with all due reſpect and reverence to famous Writers of great merit. If truth onely w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if all things could be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there would be no opinions; the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the one, and ſuper-abundancy of the other, ruine the world. The underſtanding deſpairing of demonſtrating the truth, gives
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61864:30"/>
it ſelfe over to vanity, and goes in queſt of opinion, and not being able to acquieſce in it, he raiſes himſelfe higher, and ſeekes to ſtirre up admiration through novelty, ſeeing he cannot teach and direct with truth. He eſteems himſelfe to be a brave man in Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that makes not the cleareſt, but the hardeſt argument, which though it doth not convince, yet it overcomes the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as if the ones wiſdome conſiſted in the others ignorance; and truth, which ſhould be the eaſieſt for the underſtanding to finde, (as the center of ponderous things) is ſought out by difficult &amp; obſcure things. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are there daily ſeen, which becauſe we know not how they are, nor how they are done, doe aſtoniſh and breed admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in us, for nothing elſe, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we take the lof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieſt, and moſt difficult way to underſtand what they are, and how performed. And afterward, if the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer doe divulge it, we finde it to be an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and plaine way, we acknowledge the error, we ceaſe our admiration, and remaine aſhamed.</p>
            <p>The like would happen in queſtions concerning Sciences: if truth were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us, and that God did not hide it from man, ſhewing him this great Fabrick of the World, keeping him ſtill in diſputes, not letting him underſtand it, becauſe he will mortifie him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61864:31"/>
The Politick truth of the future, being then ordinarily concealed, how ſhall ſuch an underſtanding find it, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to elevate it ſelfe above the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to ſeek extravagant wayes, to ſubtilize, diſtinguiſh, invent and imagine, that if it doth not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ciently: Then in our caſe, it finds it ſelf in a lowly &amp; groſs matter, not hard to be attained, becauſe the underſtanding doth not reach unto it, but becauſe for the moſt part it goes beyond it. One going from Sciences, where he is ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that followes the opinions of thoſe that went before him; and he a maſter that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and comming to the politick, where Experience is Miſtreſs, and he a Maſter that followes it, ſhall commit as many errors, as the things are which he invents, deſpairing of ever warranting or aſſert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng any thing, if he doth not turn from being a Maſter to be a Schollar, forſaking ſpeculation, which is an enemy to Experience.</p>
            <p>But above all others, he ſhall ſeldome prove able in politick affaires, that is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to interpret the holy Scripture. The difficulty proceeds not onely from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mes, God then making for the moſt part, the ſecondary cauſes obedient to merit: and now letting them oftentimes runne in favour of injuſtice; but likewiſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61864:31"/>
from the difference which is between the Divine and Humane intellect: the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, the other finite; this an accident, that a ſubſtance. The holy Ghoſt doth not ſpeak a word for one thing alone, his ſenſe may be interpreted for any thing that is pious; for he meanes it all. Hee gives ſcope of altering thoughts, interpret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the old, invent new, teach with the doctrine, and delight with the variety, without prejudice of truth. But man doth, and ſaith one thing onely for it, and and not alwayes for that which he ſhould doe or ſay.</p>
            <p>In what caſe then ſhall that man finde himſelfe, who comes from interpreting the Divine meaning, which is ſo large, and ſo good, and goeth to interpret that of men, which is alwayes ſhort, and for the moſt part evill; ſeeing that in the one he cannot erre, without he digreſſe; and in the other men have often erred, becauſe they have not digreſſed. I doe not ſay that diſcourſe is not nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſary for man, I exclude it in ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sciences, and admit it in what belongs to practice; ſnow to be ſnow, ought to be white, and ſo ought a woman to be fair; and yet notwithſtanding if ſnow were as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it would not be white; and if a woman were of the colour of ſnow, ſhe would not be fair. And though a great wiſe man compared
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61864:32"/>
a man that wanted Science, and had Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, to an Empyrick Phyſitian, and the learned man to the Methodicall: yet hee was deceived in the compariſon; becauſe Sciences have nothing to doe with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, whereas Theorie is neceſſarie for Phyſick; And if he proves any thing, it is that in Phyſick; beſides Experience, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is neceſſary, and judgement much more than in Sciences: but in practice it is produced, and being produced, is refined.</p>
            <p>To theſe ſpeculative men there often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that which befalls many Theoricall Phyſicians, who comming to operate, will firſt try experience, rather than follow thoſe experiments which have already been made; and thereupon they begin with kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of patients: yet therein hee differs from the Polititian: For the Phyſician kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling many, ſometimes learnes how to heale the reſt; but the Politician beginning to kill one, doth alwayes almoſt ingage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to kill an infinite number, and from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing one piece of State, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow all the World: for after he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a way, in which the ſubtilty of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, alwayes accompanied with acritude did ſet him, rather then ſoundneſſe of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſo ingages himſelf in it, that he cannot turn back ſometimes without preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61864:32"/>
I conclude, that Experience is Miſtreſſe of Policie; and becauſe ſhe is Miſtreſſe, the Politician muſt needs be her Diſciple, and conſider it before he practiſe it: He that at the firſt thruſts himſelfe upon it, may loſe himſelfe before he gives Experience leave to teach him. In the opinion of wiſe men, errors do teach more than any other thing; yet they have one difficulty, they begin with doing harm, and doe not alwayes leave way for a remedy, many oftentimes lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves in the firſt error which they commit.

The firſt age is not the dangerous age, ſeeing that being blinde, it ſuffers it ſelfe to be guided, and therefore ſeldome ſtumbles: it is the ſecond that is dangerous, which having its eyes open, ſees litle, admits no guide &amp; eaſily runs headlong</p>

a deſire of revenge; in <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> repentance: He goes to his enemies houſe, puts himſelfe into his hands, confeſſes he hath erred, bids him take ſatisfaction. The offence which he had committed could not be excuſed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by wrath, for he was not provoked; nor ignorance, becauſe he knew him: it was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and contempt; he purged the contempt with the quality of the act; and the folly with the manner. The free putting himſelfe into his hands, was the greateſt ſatisfaction that could be given, being done willingly, not violented by any extrinſecall mover; nor troubled by any intrinſecall paſſion of fear; it loſeth much of its efficacie, when it is done by compulſion. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> went not with any fear, but boldly, without being perſwaded thereunto; more carefull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain his loſt reputation, or ambitious to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it; than juſt to reſtore it to him from whom he had taken it. For the particular, it had been better if he had gone with a perturbed mind &amp; will; by meanes of feare, he had ſhewed to have eſteemed him more in the ſatisfaction, than contemned him with the offence. It was better for the publick that he ſhould go of his own accord, becauſe the repenting of the action being of its nature e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, he ſecures and warrants all; but by the fear of him that is offended, only thoſe who may cauſe themſelves to be feared as much.</p>

               <hi>Alcibiades</hi> knew he had given the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Athens</hi> occaſion to talke of him in ſerious matters, and to divert them (ſaith <hi>Plutarch)</hi> from thoſe to pleaſant ones, he cuts off the taile, eares, and noſtrills of a very beautifull dogge which he had. It was not diverting, but deriving, and an ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving. The diverſion of a thing is made while the matter flowes, and is undertaken on the contrary ſide. The derivation is, when it is already flowne, and another new one ſucceeds into the evacuated ſubject. <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> action is of the ſame matter as the reſt of his actions were, tho not of the ſame forme. It is like, and not contrary: The fluxion followes, and the ſubject threatens it ſelfe to be greater, making it ſelfe knowne to be full of fantaſticall humours. His intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not to blot out the remembrance of his old actions, but to renew it, loving to make himſelfe be talked of, with a report and fame of being extravagant. The doing of a ſemblable action, doth not cauſe the former to be forgotten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather calls it to remembrance, if not with more force, yet with more delight then it would do, if it were the ſame againe; becauſe man oftentimes ſheweth him ſelfe a greater friend to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, then to the thing it ſelfe, and willingly comes to the knowledge of truth by the meanes of falſhood.</p>

From hence proceeds the delight in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Metaphors, ſeeing of Pictures, the repreſentations of Mymicks, and Stage-players. What terrible beaſt, or diſpleaſing carkaſſe, or horrible Monſter can there be, but the picture of it will be delightfull? What man ſo deformed in bodily parts, and abominable in thoſe of the ſoule, but a mymick imitation of him is pleaſant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What mutilated, rough, liſping or ſtammering tongue and ſpeech, but will be applauded in him that counterfeits it? And if any one enquire the reaſon of it, <hi>Quintilian</hi> would ſay it were, becauſe man is an enemy to truth. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would ſay it is becauſe he loves to learne, and when of himſelfe he learnes the thing he hath conceived, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights therein, as in his owne birth, a thing of his owne bringing forth: this delight he attaines to, in imitation, when it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto him: becauſe thereby he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends as it were by argumentation, the truth of the imitated Idoll. I confeſſe the thought is acute. And I queſtion not but it is applauded. I doubt whether it be becauſe it is good, or for want of a better. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding rejoyces not much at any ſmall thing, obtained with ſmall labour. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends greater for himſelfe, and with leſſe delight. Peradventure he takes not ſo much pleaſure in learning, as in the manner how,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61864:35"/>
which is by the motion paſſing in an inſtant from the falſe object, to the knowledge of the true one. Hence proceeds the ſtrength and powerfull effect, fetching its originall from a knowledge attained unto by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Hence comes the ſmiles at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a friend: Let <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay what he will (in mine opinion) that ſudden and great change, to which <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> aſcribes ſo much delight, namely, from falſhood to truth, and from the abſence to the preſence of the beloved object, is that which cauſes the rejoycing, which may be proved by this, that if it be foreſeen, the rejoycing is not ſo great. But ſince <hi>Alcibiades</hi> his actions, which were altogether extraordinary, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture extravagant, what his inclination was, it will n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That Princes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths may beware of ſuch kinds of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which uſe to uſurp the liberty of the one, and cauſe the other to loſe their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There is great difference between acting of an extravagancy by election, and doing of it by nature, even as there is between a horſes bound which he is taught by a Rider, and one which he naturally makes when he is madded. Sometimes it is fitting to have a ſubject of great worth come with ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies upon this worlds theater, which making a noiſe may draw unto him mens

Some actions alſo ſeem to be performed beſt, when they are done extravagantly (ſuch are the firſt rewards, and firſt puniſhments) to the end that being deeply rooted in the imagination, they may leave the love of vertue, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to returne to my purpoſe; The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant action, for the moſt part, findes applauſe, it brings novelty with it, it cheeres the mind, adds vigour to the body, raiſeth up the underſtanding with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſodainneſſe, and if it doth not give their Spirits their being, yet it ſtirreth them up to operation, and the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, the greater force it adds to them, as experience daily ſheweth us in frantick men, and that not without admiration. How farre different is this motion which novelty cauſeth in the ſpirits, and produceth mirth, from that which is produced by mirth? It is more meeke, and hath opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for its end, imagination for its guide, and the underſtanding for its meanes: Whereas the other moultered being vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, runnes and flyes without ſtay or guide. I know not whether it be becauſe in griefe the ſpirits retire to the heart, and in great joyes they dilate themſelves, that thoſe two paſſions produce ſuch effects, as ſome men are of opinion. Or whether by the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, abating, repoſe, motion, ſometimes loſt, ſometimes unruly. In my conceit all the dammage proceeds from their ceaſing to operate: in feare, becauſe they loſe their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; in joy, becauſe they alter it; in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the imagination gives them motion, and doth not ſet them a working; in the former,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61864:36"/>
it takes away both motion and operation. Man dies through griefe, becauſe the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirits ceaſes, without which they being unable to work, and being not fed, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſily diſſolved, by reaſon of their ſubtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they are ſoone corrupted, What good ſind we in weeping? It doth not vent our griefe, but it is a ſigne that the ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to worke, and that they have operation enough to ſuſtaine them. A man dyes for joy, becauſe in that act, the imagination in an inſtant moves all the ſpirits with a ſwiſt motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then loſing it ſelf, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes them, and gives over ſetting them to work: whereupon they being in a moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent motion, and having none to direct, reſtraine, or curbe them, finding every thing abandoned, fly out and evaporate that way which they find open and enlarged. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeldome gives ſo ſtrong an affliction or griefe, but that it is accompanied with ſome ſmall parcell of pleaſure. Or any joy ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, but that it hath ſome kind of mixture of diſtaſte: to the end, that in one part there may be ſomewhat to excite the ſpirits, and in the other to ſuſtaine the imaginative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: that it may not quite abandon it ſelf to the overthrowing of the <hi>individuum.</hi> Even as the heaven works and operates in this lower world by its motion, and light, ſo do the ſpirits in the body. The world
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61864:37"/>
would periſh, if it did not receive light and motion from the heavens; and the body, if it had not the like from the ſpirits. Finally, extravagant actions make ſo much noiſe amongſt People, that the entring into them, though it be with choice and election, and the proſecuting of them, though in a fitting and convenient way, brings by the plauſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them eminent danger along to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage man in the perſiſting in them, though they be evill: And if this be ſo in him who operates by election, how will it be in him that operates by nature. They have hot and ſubtile ſpirits, the heat cauſeth them to riſe, and mount the ſubtileneſs to penetrate: they have acute ſpeculation, and ſurpaſſe others in underſtanding: their conceits are not common, but oftentimes monſtrous. It is likewiſe ſo with the forming power, when it works upon hot and dry matter; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried on by heat it grows up in height ſo much, that wanting it afterwards to ſpread abroad, it frames a long, but not great body; becauſe ſlenderneſs takes away the proportion which is needfull for a true and perfect greatneſſe, Heat alwaies puts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as much as it can for the advantage of ſublimeneſs; it never turnes back to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect whereby it endammages Prudence, which needs ſome coldneſſe to examine that which drineſſe hath penetrated, and in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61864:37"/>
caſe it find it not ordered and ſettled, may correct, change, or forſake it. The actions of ſuch an underſtanding ſhall alwaies be great, ſometimes good, and ſometimes evill: Going alwaies upward, and never reflecting upon what is paſt, they will be great by nature, but good by accident: An exquiſite temperature for a ſpeculation which is above us, unfit for practice amongſt our ſelves, and every way dangerous to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce erroneous opinions, which will be very hurtfull, if they be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>

            <p>Becauſe the world ſhould not be idle, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſcattered amongſt mankind Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Neceſſity, Gaine and Glory: he that hath not theſe laſt two can hardly ſet forward to action, becauſe the deſire of knowing truth which is in all men, moves them to ſpeculation, before it employes them in operation. True it is, that to keep the affections of both in a kind of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe took care that ſmall gaine ſhould ſuffice to ſatisfie Neceſſity; and little glory to overcome Emulation, ſhe making her ſelf the meaſure of the one, and appointing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61864:38"/>
Equality to be the meaſure of the other. When man thruſts on his deſires to immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate things, he ought not to complaine of that nature which made him, but of that which he himſelf hath made; becauſe that having overcome the Emulator which ſhe had given him, and being grown up above the ſtate in which he was borne, he ſhould find reſt, and want an object to ſpur him on any further, if he did not frame to himſelf a new one. A deſire of little, proceeds from nature, and from us comes the not being ſatisfied with much: And ſeeing ſhe could not with this Law ſtay the courſe of humane ambition, ſhe hath broken it in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that though it go on <hi>in infinitun,</hi> yet it doth it by meanes of ſmall and <hi>finite</hi> objects. Thoſe who from treading upon the duſt, have raiſed themſelves to trample upon thrones, have by the way found many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; in the attaining of which they have beleeved that happineſs to conſiſt, which they have not found even in the laſt object when they have attained unto it. Verily it is ſtrange that Man, who in this world, hath no object (be it never ſo great) which attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto can content his deſire, ſhould think he can content them with leſſer, when he doth but contemplate them. The one proceeds from the naturall anxiety of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topping his Emulator, the other from fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61864:38"/>
a new one to our ſelves in what ſtate ſoever we be; thence it is, that a new happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe gives content at the firſt, untill we find in it ſomewhat to emulate or to envy, which never failing, the deſire likewiſe of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater never failes; which commonly aiming at ones equall, or him that is next before him, comes one way to be ſhort, and the other way infinite. I confeſſe, Nature ſometimes brings forth (but very ſeldome) ſuch magnanimous breaſts, who ayming at a higher degree then that they were born in, do at the very firſt propoſe unto themſelves that object, which is higheſt &amp; furtheſt from them. So a Souldier of the meaneſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fixes upon a Generals place for his ſcope: and ſuch motions, though they ſeeme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them which I have ſpoken of, yet they are not ſo: The diverſity conſiſts not in the ſubſtance, but in the manner, taking the dead and not the living for objects, and alwaies an equall if not him that is, yet him that was ſuch: falling into imitation of them, who were of a meane eſtate as well as they, and from thence either by valour or vertue were raiſed to high degrees. He is unfortunate that is borne thus, unleſs he become very happy; For either he lives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing in a continuall affliction, or raſhly caſts himſelfe into ſome manifeſt danger, being not ſtayed nor appeaſed with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61864:39"/>
yet profitable, hope of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſſe. <hi>Heroes</hi> are indeed framed out of ſuch conſtitutions, if valour be not wanting, or Fortune averſe. There is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in a Travellers pace, when he ſees his place of reſt farre off, and when he is cloſe by it. One way muſt be taken to attain to a thing, as a <hi>medium,</hi> and another way to come to it as an end. He that hath attained to it, if he will make uſe of it for a <hi>medium,</hi> having aimed at it as an end, many times quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives himſelfe of the uſe of it. Whence comes, that many having attained to ſome reaſonable degree of felicity, ſtriving to riſe to an higher, have overthrowne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves quite; for of neceſſity changing their end, they muſt change all; and in changing, it is eaſie to come to ruine.</p>

               <hi>Alcibiades</hi> ſpurred on by ambition, no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is admitted to be one of the Senate, but he ſtrives to become great, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>reſpectfull</hi> by contending with great ones. Power deſerves this name, not onely becauſe it may doe what it pleaſes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe it may hinder others from doing the like. The one lightens the heavieſt Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the other makes heavy the lighteſt chain. The forbidden thing ſeemes beſt for this purpoſe, and it is ſo, ſeeing that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it frees from the bond which tied the freedome of the will. Hence it is, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61864:39"/>
the manner of introducing a law by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is farre more excellent than the doing of it by puniſhment or penalty. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and hath its originall, the hatred which Potentates (though they be not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by him) beare to him that is greater; and the rage which cauſeth them to turn the world up-ſide-downe to over-throw him, under the falſe precence of a loſt, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered Liberty; as if not onely the not being free, but alſo the poſsibility of not being ſo, were ſlavery.</p>
            <p>This n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me is ill underſtood, and ill uſed. Slavery it ſelfe doth not take away a mans freedome: the wiſe Servant is freer than the fooliſh Maſter. Liberty and neceſsity are not inconſiſtent: An action done through outward violence, though it be not of free will, ſeeing he hath not power to doe the contrary, yet it may be a free action, ſeeing that both will and underſtanding concurre therein; and therefore thoſe ſhall be free ſubjects who frame and levell both their underſtandings and wills to their Lords. From this ſpring proceeds the great worth of that man in Gods eye, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures troubles and ſorrows, by reaſon that oftentimes a forced and conſtrained act, which hath no merit at all in it, becomes free and meritorious. And this is (or I am deceived) a better grounded, and more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61864:40"/>
reaſon then <hi>Seneca's,</hi> where he intends to prove, that a wiſe man is uncapable of becoming a ſlave; becauſe that working a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the current which runnes with the actions of the underſtanding and the will, hee alwayes freeth himſelfe, and findes reſt in all things. <hi>Socrates</hi> would not be defended, his Reaſon was, becauſe hee would dye free, and not forced. But becauſe men of this conſtitution, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with this Noble Character, are very rare (by an unknowne motion of Nature, which in its actions is a longing deſire and anxiety to preſerve the freedome of will) domination is hatred. And thence it comes, that he who is mightieſt, either in Citie, Senate, or Court, wounds the eyes of him who comes newly thither with ſo much force, that it imprints thereon a dolorous character. If he meets with an unadviſed harebrained man, he openly oppoſes him, and declares himſelfe to be his enemy: If with a ſubtile one, he makes himſelfe his companion, and choaks him under colour of friendſhip. The one is like the Summer heat, which gently diſperſeth the naturall heat, with another ſemblable to it. The o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther like a Winter cold, with its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, oppreſſes it. The firſt way is hard to begin well, if he preſently gets not the upper hand: the ſecond to end, if he do not attaine
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61864:40"/>
at all to it. The operation by way of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, findes leſſe reſiſtance, becauſe it ſeeks onely free paſſage, and not the ruine. That by contrariety findes a greater, becauſe it aimes onely at annihilation: And therefore the water is eaſily overcome by the aire, and hardly deſtroyed by fire. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had three great enemies, <hi>Cato</hi> totally oppoſite; <hi>Pompey</hi> his ſemblable, and <hi>Brutus</hi> mixt. <hi>Cato</hi> gave him occaſion of ſhame, not of feare; <hi>Pompey</hi> went neare to overthrow him; <hi>Brutus</hi> killd him with being ſemblable to him, but could not overthrow him by his being different. But if <hi>Sylla, Pompey, Caeſar,</hi> and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other men of worth and valour, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to be great, by becoming friends to thoſe who were greater. How can <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi> his way be commended, who went about it by oppoſing them? Thoſe <hi>Romans</hi> found the great ones divided, the <hi>Athenian</hi> agreed and united. Where there is partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or faction, it is beſt to become a friend; and an oppoſite where there is no enemy. It is too hard to ſight againſt two, or more, if they be oppoſites; in Phyſick, Moralitie, or in Policie, if two unite againſt him that ſets upon them (which comes ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to paſſe) makes the iſſue of the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king impoſſible.</p>
            <p>The want of the chiefe inſtrument, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, diſcontented perſons, makes the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61864:41"/>
of the enterprize hard. And in ſuch a ſtate of affairs, though you make ſome ſuch, yet they doe not long laſt ſuch; becauſe that he who diſcontents himſelf with one, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is contented with another. The enmity of great ones makes a man to be eſteemed generous, and is the true way, either to riſe or ruine quickly. It is difficult to enter into it, without loſing ones ſelf in the very firſt ſteps, but if thou get but a little way on, thou wilt ſoon have a companion, and find help. Every one applauds thee, becauſe a new va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour cauſeth as much admiration, as a new ſtarre doth gazing. Envious men aſsiſt him, becauſe they are aſhamed to yeeld; the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, becauſe they ſeek revenge; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, ſatisfaction; and all in generall, becauſe they unwillingly bow to that great one; and being brought under, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce when thy finde one that will not bow to him. They take heart from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and favour him as one that ſhould free them from ſordid ſlavery and abject ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. They are deceived in beleeving, that if they make him ſuperiour, they can without any reſiſtance, bring him againe to an equality. But if they were not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and did believe they rather change, than take away their bondage; yet they would aſsiſt him. They do not much hate, neither are there ſo many diſcontented at

this new valour, becauſe it is more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Envy is not yet come in, and the change of domination is oftentimes judged to be a kind of liberty.</p>
            <p>The paſsing of the diſeaſe from one part to another in a ſicke man, gives ſome hope of recovery; it ſhewes that Nature is yet ſtrong, and the humour not ſo ſtubborn, or ſo ſtrongly knit together, but that it may be looſened and extirpated. For a ſubject to attain to be the greateſt man in the World, in a Citie, or in a Court, is not ſo hard a matter as for one to keep himſelfe ſo. He that is growing up, is helped on, he that is growen up, is aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and left to himſelfe; and every one becomes an enemy to him that is decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>It is ſo eaſie a matter to cut off a riſing power in its beginning, that if man had not a naturall inſtinct to help him that is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, none would become great: And it is ſo hard to bring down him that is gotten up, that if nature did not likewiſe incline man to deſtroy him, greatneſſe would ſtill remain in the ſame place. In augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons men are never quiet, untill they have brought the Subject to the higheſt pitch: when they have brought him thither, they never reſt till they ſee him decline: And when he is declining, untill they have ruined
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61864:42"/>
him. Actions which are done in favour of him that riſeth, in hatred of him that is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, in damage of him that is falling, though they be never ſo well meaſured by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Politicians, yet nature makes them exorbitant, and without meaſure. Let the Pilot be never ſo skilfull, the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this inſtinct doth inſenſibly take off his hand, and in the end of his voyage brings him quite to another place then that whither he intended to come aſhore. The Heaven which is an univerſall cauſe; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is fruitfull, Neceſsity which binds, Practice which teaches, Example which perſwades, men which encourage, Envy which provokes, frame a contrary to him.</p>
            <p>If the heaven become particular, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture barren, the bond ſuffer violence, ſwiftneſſe give not time to Practice, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence leave no place for example, nor ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority for envy; either he ſtayes, or he changes himſelfe, or dyes, ſtayed, changed and kill'd by reſerving nature. God will not have us to enjoy ſo much happineſſe as we ſhould if the world were all one man's: For mens ſinnes it is he ſuffers ſo many Princes, and Common-wealths upon earth.</p>
            <p>It begun when one alone commanded it, and will end when it arrives againe where
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61864:42"/>

            <p>Such was <hi>Alcibiades</hi> his circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vigilancy that he turned the Oſtraciſme upon <hi>Hyperbolus</hi> himſelfe. The people were aſhamed that the Oſtraciſme ſhould fall upon ſo infamous a perſon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a puniſhment which made a man ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and almoſt to be deſired: its reward being to be thereby declared the beſt man, and therefore after that time it was no more uſed, and it was very fitting, that law which had begun with the beſt ſhould end with the worſt.</p>

Excellency or perfect goodneſſe, ſeemes to be an unfortunate thing. In Phyſicke <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, it is not to be found. Hyppocrates if he grant any ſuch thing, doth preſently againe diſallow it In policy they will not admit of it amongſt formes of ſtate, unleſſe it be tranſitorily. A Common wealth baniſheth any thing that reſembles it; a Tyrant kills it. In humane actions they call it an enemy to goodneſſe; nature is ſometimes blamed as ignorant, becauſe it cannot reach to the making of it up: and ſometimes they accuſe it as envious, becauſe after it hath begun it, it cuts it off green. If it belonged to the body, Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally there were no place to receive it. If Geometrically, no ayre whereby it might breath no food to feed upon without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. If it belong to the mind, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be excluded out of the Common-wealth. The excellent and perfect one is not yet come upon earth; and he cannot be a fitting Citizen of any other; therefore it muſt either grant him the command over all, or kill him. When <hi>the perfect one</hi> came into the world and was borne amongſt us, he would not accept of the firſt, becauſe his kingdome was not of this world; and he came for the latter: Scarce was he borne, but the Tyrant ſeekes to ſlay him. Scarce is he knowne, but the Tribes cry him

up King; and the rulers crucifie him. Man is borne to iniquity, ſaith <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> the <hi>Tema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> and this doth not proceed ſaith he from the duſt, from which ſpring the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for then beaſts alſo would be wicked. Not from the ſoule governeſſe and guide of the body, ſay I, for then the infant, and the mad man would ſinne.

The mad man becauſe he hath loſt it, hath an advantage above the wiſe man. The one cannot ſinne, the other can not chuſe but ſinne. To be great in heaven, we muſt become as the little ones of the earth; to be wiſe, we muſt become fooles; yet with this difference, that where they do not ſinne through defect, we ſhould not ſinne thorough vertue: and where they doe not undeſerve wanting the uſe of reaſon, wee ſhould merit in rightly uſing it. This food, this heavenly Nectar, if it meets with a cleere and reſplendent mind, doth ſeed, and elevate it wonderfully, if an impure, and troubled one, it doth above meaſure of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and depreſſe it.

               </gap>t. This poſſibility was the guilding which the inventers of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraciſme gave malice. They covered the vice of envy, with the vertue of providence. But it is not a vertue when it is overmuch, it is a vice, and the leſſe it reſembles it, the more it is ſuch. It ſhews ill in Gods ſight, as if man did put his whole confidence in himſelfe, and none in him. Of this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are framed; For this warres ariſe, and with this the world is pull'd off of the hinges. How many men are dead, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting future things, and by phyſicking themſelves with prevention? How many Cities, Provinces, and Kingdomes have loſt themſelves to prevent a future thing, which was not, nor would not have been. I would liken over much Providence, to the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary, but that is more harmfull, more raſh, more uncertaine: and worſe; becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hindred. Thou ſhalt indeed find ſome that have bin killed by a Tyrant, by reaſon of what the Aſtrologers adviſed, and the ſtarres threatned him. Other ſome that have undertaken great, and new things, perſwaded thereunto by the happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61864:44"/>
of their births. Theſe are but ſome, but their number is infinite whom provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath cauſed to be kill'd or ſpurred on to new buſineſſes. Both go on in divining future things. But providence is the raſheſt, becauſe it drawes the principall out of it ſelfe, and the other ſeekes it in the ſtarres, where he thinkes the Creator hath placed it. They are both falſe, Aſtrology leſſe falſe, becauſe it makes uſe of celeſtiall things. Providence more falſe, becauſe it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon terreſtriall. God is not pleaſed with man who remits all things to him; and is diſpleaſed when he remits nothing at all to him. Seldome will he operate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out man, and never likes that man ſhould operate without him. The one is tempting of God by obliging him; The other is a provoking of him by refuſing to be obliged to him. This moſt vile Law was ordained, by Ignorance and Malignity, the Nobles, the People, Ambition, Jealouſie, Envy, and Feare. The People ſeeke after ſecurity, the Nobles after honour, and both with their private paſsions overthrow the publick weale. A ſubject of great worth is ever hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his equalls, but not alwayes diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his inferiours. If it were poſsible for him to free himſelfe from envy, he might eaſily free others from feare. The People love him, and exalt him
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61864:45"/>
while they beleeve he may profit or at leaſt not endammage their ſecurity. The Noble alwayes hates him, becauſe he is alwayes a hinderance to his honour, and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſhew his envy ſo naked and plaine, he cloaths and covers it with feare, to imprint likewiſe in the Peoples hearts this his diſſembled and feigned character. It is not withſtanding a feare in both of them, though it be not a vice in both; in great ones it is a feare of not loſing their glory, in the meane ones their liberty. And if the People be permitted to oppoſe him who takes away their liberty, why ſhould the Noble be denied the oppoſing of him that takes away his glory? Peradventure it is becauſe the one is aſſayed directly, the other reſlectively. Liberty cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but onely by directly oppoſing him that ſeekes to intrappe it; Glory may be maintained by getting before him, who diminiſhes it. The way to great actions would be loſt, or they which attempt them would loſe themſelves without attaning to them, if the oppoſing ones ſelfe to him that tramples upon him did not not bring blame and infamy along with it, and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting of him praiſe and honour. Envy which reigned in us, one part of the world more than in <hi>Greece,</hi> ſometimes baniſhing worthy and eminent, ſubj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſometimes hindering them from attaining to their aimes, ſuffered not that noble and excellent Country to obtaine any great conqueſts, whereas the Roman Common-wealth in a ſmall time attained to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Monarchy. The Grecian valour was great, but inferior to the Italian; the Italian wits were eminent, but not equall to the Grecian. In the one the braine was greater then the heart; in the others the heart greater then the braine. Where the underſtanding ſurmounts valour, there is moſt envy, where valour outgoes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, moſt emulation.</p>
            <p>The one vilified ſeekes by ſubtilty to bring downe him that is grown up above him; the other encouraged by valour ſeekes to overcome and ſurmount him. Envy (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> growes from the ſir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The firſt effect that it produces, meeting with a breaſt not quite oppoſite to vertue, is Emulation, which prickes on the deſire to goe forward. Not to get away from him who is gone beyond
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61864:46"/>
him that which he hath gotten, but to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe to the getting of the ſame. If he doth not attaine to it, he oftentimes proceeds to a deſire to have the other want it, and then th' emulation becomes envy, which if it remaine in him, in a ſhort time provokes him to wreſt it from him, and turnes to rage and hatred.</p>
            <p>And this is a vice, proper, and peculiar to mans nature; Horſes and Mules to which are likened the worſt of men are not ſubject to it; nor the good Angels, to whom the beſt and moſt excellent men come neere, no nor the Devill himſelfe, who amongſt all bad ones is the worſt. It is much that one degree onely which diſtinguiſhes us from our equall, by reaſon of his, or our owne advancing, ſhould move the paſsions of joy or griefe with ſo much violence, and that many degrees, when they carry our ſuperior farre up above us, or raiſe our inferior after us, doe not produce the ſame effect. Peradventure theſe, though they increaſe, yet they doe not goe out of the latitude of the Spheare. The difference is in the more, or leſſe: The motion is an alteration, but an equall cannot move to ſtep forward, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and in an inſtant he becomes a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.</p>
            <p>He makes no motion, but it is generall,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61864:46"/>
no difference but ſpecificall. If motion be the cauſe of joy and griefe, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt ſuddaine motion cauſeth the greateſt; how ſhould the growing at diſtance, and advancing from equality, ſeeing it muſt be a ſudaine act for defect of latitude, and great, by reaſon of the alteration of the ſpecies, but produce Joy and Griefe in an eminent degree?</p>
            <p>This law was defective in the manner of putting it in execution, it was by the peoples particular votes, not diſgeſted or conſidered upon by conference: Every one in particular ſent <hi>Hyperbolus</hi> into exile; All joyned together were aſhamed of it: It was not the whole commonalty that exiled him; yet was it they who blamed the exiling of him. The whole, to be more then the parts, requires an union; if that failes, it will not take effect, if it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, it corrupts. It loſeth its name, and alſo its vertue. The voyce of this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity united is called Gods voyce, of each one in particular is like the devills. <hi>Plinie</hi> wonders that ſuch a joyned multitude ſhould daunt an Orator, who would ſpeake boldly to any of thoſe men parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. And why doth he not alſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, that a bundell of rods cannot be bent nor bowed, and each ſeverall rod may with eaſe be broken to pieces.</p>

Strength is a vertue of union, moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the peoples unity, which reſembles the Divine; where it goes with violence to overcome, it breakes and ſhivers whatſoever oppoſes it; when it is bent to judge, it ſtrikes terror; when united together, it powres forth prayers; it forceth (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid) the very heavens. Man is affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, aſtoniſhed, trembles, and loſes himſelfe in the preſence of the object which he loves, at the Kings feet to whom he bowes, at the ſight of the people to whom he ſpeaks: not for any thing that he ſees which is humane, but for that is repreſented to him which is Divine: hee diſcovers in his beloved a beame of Divine beauty, in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the people, Divine unity; in the Kings greatneſſe, Divine Majeſty and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency.</p>
            <p>From this manner of voting likewiſe proceeded that dangerous errour of little Secreſie: They ſhewed the blow before they ſtruck, whereas that ſhould have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded ſwifter than a Thunder-bolt, not onely the noyſe, but even the flaſh.

            <p>The next degree to watchfulneſſe, is Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition and miſtruſt: it would be farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if it were to truſt and beliefe; Hee that truſts, is bound preſently to ſecure himſelfe of the ſubject.

            <p>Hee that miſtruſts before hee can reſolve himſelfe, endeavoureth to finde the truth; and let him goe about it as warily as he can, when he comes to uſe the meanes, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his intention, the ſubject that perceives it, preſently finding himſelfe loſt, if hee hath not a truly Chriſtian breaſt, or is not a moſt ſubtile Morall Philoſopher, who to avoyd the ſtain of finne, or note of infamy, will rather than become guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, expoſe himſelfe to the danger of dying innocent, will hold it a kinde of puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity

not to die guilty. And if he be a Traytor, he will at that very inſtant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelfe; if faithful, he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come treacherous. The former hath the greateſt advantage, who hath the meanes already prepared, and preſently comes to a tryall, finding the other unprovided, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and doubtfull, between credulity and diſtruſt: Whereas the other taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden, unprovided of meanes, and wanting time, which he cannot take, unleſſe hee likewiſe give it the other, is often oppreſſed before hee bee prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in preparing himſelfe, or at leaſt ill prepared.</p>
            <p>To take away and baniſh one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was not not a right Cure, it rather increaſed the Diſeaſe.

If a Subject in a Citie, exalt himſelfe above the reſt, what can bee done better, then to give him an oppoſite? And what worſe than to remove him from him? If hee doth not frame himſelfe, or Nature give him one, let Art bring him in one. The Oſtraciſme baniſhing one onely, did let the other looſe, made him Lord

            <p>Two great diſaſters (according to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology) make one good Fortune.

            <p>To take away the beſt, was as much as to let the worſt looſe. In this <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> himſelfe was puzzled, hee would not likewiſe have him to remaine in the Citie, where hee cannot place him but as King. He ſends him into the Woods, he compares him to <hi>Iove,</hi> he would not have man worthy to bee his Companion, and yet hee makes him a companion of wild beaſts. Hee was peradventure deceived: In deſcribing an excellent man, hee ſeemes to attribute unto him the worſt of vices. If hee bee ambitious, or fooliſh, hee is not excellent: if hee bee wiſe and modeſt, he will ſhun and refuſe, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Scepter; he will ſubject himſelfe to the Lawes, as if he had need of them; to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61864:49"/>
Magiſtrates, as inferior to them, to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as if he were not borne to command. It is contradictory to doe ill, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. The inſtance which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives of a voyce exceeding the reſt in a quire of Muſick, if he doth not take away diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him that hath it, the voyce will not take away the harmony from the reſt. That of one member bigger then another, hath nothing to doe with <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> but with <hi>Monstruoſity,</hi> it is as farre from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in goodneſſe, as it is neere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding badneſſe. He that gave the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the body for an example, where if one exceeds the reſt, though it be a good one, yet it diſeaſes the body; he miſtooke the greateſt for the beſt, and tooke the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors for the naturall heat, which be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great, doth not burne nor conſume, but foment, preſerve, and vivifie. He were but a very ignorant Phyſician that would expell it, and ſo is he a Politician, that will baniſh the beſt out of a City. Some cannot ſuffer the beſt, nor endure the worſt. They feare one for their owne ſake, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for the Common-wealth's; They envy the former, and are aſhamed of the latter. They ſeeke after indifferent ſubjects, which may not diſhonour the Publicke, nor put them in danger: and this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine unto, becauſe nature produces
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61864:49"/>
but few ſuch, and taking away the beſt, they raiſe up a worſt, as out of a mixt, if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domin ant be taken away. The <hi>Cretans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, they no ſooner had baniſhed the beſt, but they found themſelves in the hands of the worſt. What is the driving of a great man out of the Citie, but adding the adherence of ſtrangers, to the applauſe which he hath gained amongſt the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. <hi>Caeſar</hi> would not give Senators leave to travell long out of <hi>Italy,</hi> when they were once above twenty yeares of age. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> not out of <hi>Rome: Tyberius</hi> kept them alſo within the Citie, whom he had choſen for Governours of Provinces.</p>
            <p>Politick Writers have blamed the letting of a ſubject grow great in the Citie, more than the baniſhing, of him when he was grown ſo. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſires a remedy from the Lawes, others ſeek it from Art. They keep them idle who haue any ſigne of great worth: they tranſplant thoſe who have gained great reputation in one place, into another. If riches gained it him, they cauſe him to ſpend them; if valour in warres, they call him home to the Citie; if he be reputed of great underſtanding, or raſhly valiant, they employ the one in affaires which may over-throw him, and expoſe the other to dangers, in which he may ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the loſſe of himſelfe; If he attained
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61864:50"/>
thereunto by being officious, and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they deny him thoſe boones and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which he asketh. And generally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt occaſion, they puniſh them all moſt ſeverely. But all this hath more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew than ſafety. There is neither Law nor Art can hinder the riſing off him, whom Nature doth, even from his birth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company with ſuch beames of happineſſe, that either he findes no reſiſtance, or forces his way through, whereſoever hee meets with it; good things prove excellent to him, and he can turn bad into good. All kind of food ſerves him for nouriſhment, and each poyſon is a remedy to him.

            <p>To call one home from an army to the City, is as much as to adde the peoples fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to that of the Souldiours. <hi>Domitian</hi> finding he was not thereby able to deale with <hi>Agricola,</hi> was conſtrained to make uſe of poiſon; and <hi>Tiberius</hi> met with a Subject that would not part from it. To put them upon buſineſſes in which they may loſe their credit, or endanger the loſing of their lives, is a matter full of hazard and adventure. Wiſe men will come off in their affaires well enough, howſoever the buſineſſes proſper, and valiant men for the moſt part overcome dangers be they never ſo great; building their greatneſſe, where others had prepared a precipice for them: It ſo happened to <hi>Saul</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> and to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi>

he did not know himſelf, ſo he were known; for then he would not be put to any tryall. Indeed, if he be not known, there may bee ſome danger in him, yet if hee doth not overthrow the Common-wealth, or the Prince, upon his firſt tryal, before a ſecond they will be undeceived, and know what he is. He that hath excellent parts, and knows not of it, is the better: and he that hath them and knowes it, oftentimes proves the worſt.

            <p>The deſire of worldly glory, is wiſe mens madneſſe, and the fools wiſdom, and

beguiles all. It is an excrement, but bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall; a Mercury, which laid upon the breaſt, without doing any hurt, defends it from the moſt peſtiferous qualities with its own venemous one. The <hi>aſylum,</hi> and laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of Reaſon, which being to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt weakned and tired by oppoſing the ſenſes, hath its recourſe thither, to avoids its utter deſtruction. A vertue, which leaving its mildneſſe and ſweetneſſe, and becoming ſoure, turns to vinegar, rather dead than cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
            <p>If Reaſon fights againſt it, it is in a faire combat; if it be conquered, it ſaves its life, though it be taken priſoner. It troubles man, and he troubles the world if he finds it quiet; and if he finds it troubled, he ſuffers it not to periſh. Nature hath invironed Glory with a hedge compoſed of moſt ſharp thornes of troubles, full of grief and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting labours, to hinder man with the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from that which he could not perſwade him to with reaſon. And not content there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, becauſe he ſhould not ſet upon it, ſhe taught him, that it might be obtained by ſlighting and contemning it. But deſire of this glory being once poſſeſſed of man, makes him ſeeme to be no more fleſh and blood, but turned all into ſpirit. Hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters with heat and cold, hunger and thirſt, fire, ſword, and bullets, and even

            <p>True it is, that hereby the ſuperior part ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth its odds and and advantage, whereby it ſurmounts the ſenſes: and drawing ſuch an one out of darkneſſe, like a lamp of true Glory, ſhewes how ſmall the reliſh of the ſenſes is in objects, in compariſon of that which a glorified underſtanding extends, and communicates unto them. But what ſeeks man with this longing deſire of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory, but divine glory, by an erroneous and falſe way? In ſtead of placing it in the ſeeking out of Gods Truth, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Bounty, he places it in the emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a great one.</p>
            <p>This is not following him that calls us, it is treading of our enemies foot-ſteps; it is renouncing the being GODS true Iſſue, and transforming our ſelves into the Devils adopted children.</p>
            <p>It is corrupting the beſt deſire that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath given us, to bring in the worſt inſtead of it. It was the vanity of the firſt ambitious Creature, who inſtead of turning towards the Divine Eſſence, to contemplate it, turned towards its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to go beyond it; and being troubled, (as ambitious creatures uſe to be) on the one ſide

with paſſion, and on the other ſide a little perſpicuous by his knowledge; finding by the one, that he could not ſet his Throne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſtarres, and obtain ſuperiority in heaven, he ſuffered himſelfe to be drawne another way, and ſet it on the ſide of the North, to attain to it on earth. But God to turn man away from following ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe footſteps, abaſed Worldly Glory, and greatneſſe: to make even the moſt humble upon the Earth, the greateſt in Heaven, and the moſt deſpiſed, the moſt glorious.</p>

            <p>It is temerity to delay or hinder Nature when it operates well, hoping to doe a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cure with the ignorance of Art.

done conformable to its <hi>Genius,</hi> it applaudes, and whatſoever is contrary, be it good or evill, it likewiſe abhorres. Love alſo on the other ſide did deceive them, a paſſion which makes a thing ſeeme what it is not, and much more doth ignorance doe it, which makes one indeed to beleeve it. The People want the true meaſure of vertue, which, is mediocrity, and they doe not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the ſubſtance which is to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate according to right reaſon: they are not informed of the circumſtances, how much, when, and how.</p>
            <p>They make uſe of exceſſe for a meaſure, of quantity alone for a circumſtance; of the matter, for the eſſence, and judge the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt action to bee beſt; Hence it is, that the raſh and foolehardy man is rather applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then the valiant, the prodigall rather then the liberall. The little difference that is between vertue and vice hath alſo a ſhare in this miſtake, where vice is accompanied with ambition; becauſe, that though the ſubject ſuffer himſelfe to be hurried away by the ſenſes, to vices, ye he ſo carrries himſelfe therein, that amongſt the vices now and then ſhines forth ſome act (not through vertue, but through vehemency) ſometimes of liberality, ſometimes of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, ſometimes of fortitude, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of affability.</p>

The reaſon of it is not eaſily given. There bee underſtandings which ſeeme to be great, and are rather unbrideled and wild ones. They draw men away before they can follow them. They run and in a manner flie, moved by a heate, which doth not onely warme, but enflame and ſet them on fire: the Carrier is ſwift. It is a horſe which runnes looſe, and hath not wiſedome ſitting upon him to governe and guide him.</p>
            <p>This kind of underſtanding is peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture one of thoſe which <hi>Seneca</hi> calls uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and which St <hi>Paul</hi> deſires might be ſober: Attributes which ſeem metaphorical, and are moſt proper; becauſe that manner
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61864:57"/>
of ſpeculation, is a note of the manner of operating, ſeeing that the ſame heate which let looſe the reines, to the higher part, ſets the lower alſo at liberty. And as the unbrideled underſtanding, goes where it ought not to goe, ſo the ſenſes ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, run whither they will.</p>
            <p>Men who cleerely ſee the defects of the inferior part, and in the ſuperior can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne nothing but what is great, they judge that ſubject to abound in many vertues, and many vices, when that is alſo a vice in him, which ſeemes not to be ſo. Other underſtandings there be, which are ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive and fixed upon ſpeculation, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly ſet upon it, dividing in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the ſoule from the body, raiſe themſelves with the former, and grow careleſſe oſ the latter; and whileſt they endeavour to ſhew the greater part to be man, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the other to be beaſt. To this ancient Poets had a relation, when they repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Satyres, their upper parts like men, and the lower like goates; Whilſt the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is buſie in ſpeculation, the ſenſes runne and skip about like goates, having none to direct or rule them.</p>
            <p>Meane underſtandings doe not raiſe themſelves ſo high as to make ſuch a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and whereas the other are men, and beaſts, theſe are men-beaſts: and if they do

not attaine to be ſuch eminent ſubjects, they doe not likewiſe come to be ſuch great beaſts. Behold whence proceeds the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of eminent underſtandings, becauſe that, according to <hi>Plato,</hi> they have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of madneſſe in them. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was one of the firſt ſort, and ſo was almoſt all the <hi>Heroes, Diogenes,</hi> and moſt part of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> were of the ſecond.

            <p>
               <hi>Alcibiades</hi> adviſes the Athenians, to make warre againſt the Sicilians: He had no other reaſon to doe it, but his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of glory, and to ſurpaſſe his emulator. He that ſuffers himſelfe to be overcome by this paſſion, is never quiet, nor ſuffers any one elſe to be ſo. The appetite of the taſte already ſatisfied with food, runnes not to the deſiring of new, though better; and if it doth runne to it, it is not nature, but intemperancy that perſwades it. Having received it, into the ſtomack, it is ſatisfied; if it remaines there too long, it loaths it: if it quickly diſgeſts, he returnes to deſire more.</p>
            <p>The appetite of glory goes likewiſe to the object, although mistaken; Scarce is it touched by naturall heate to diſgeſt it;

but poiſon-like it ſtupefies the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſcarce diſcovers it, but it loaths it. If one ſhould take it away from it when it hath had it but a little while, it would againe returne to deſiring of it. But thoſe things which ſerve for an object to humane ambition, have volatile ſpirits ſoaring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſuperficies, and not fixed in the ſubſtance: the underſtanding quickly takes them out, and ſodainly conſumes them.</p>
            <p>The thing remaines, not living, but a carkaſſe; which becauſe it remaines, is not deſired; and becauſe a carkaſſe doth not ſatisfie; ſeeing that nature for a ſhort time is contented with a little, and is not for ever ſatisfied with an infinite. It is a great dammage, to not enjoy at all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath acquired, and worſe to keepe it but for an inſtant, the one incites to greater things, and the other oftentimes hinders from attaining them.</p>

One doth not content himſelfe with the ſtate wherein he is, the other is contented with that which he hath not: becauſe hee is deceived by a fixed deſire which doth not ſet the defect before him, he imagines he hath it as he deſires, and hath not ſo much free underſtanding left, as to reaſon upon it, how it would be, if hee had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, and ſo to refell the deceits of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, with arguments of reaſon.

            <p>They both erre, the mad man with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, the wiſe man with trouble; one in beleeving he hath obtained wherewith to content himſelfe; the other becauſe he knowes not that hee hath obtained it.</p>

Yet notwithſtanding, the Athenians conſidering <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to be raſh and violent, to reſtraine and mitigate theſe qualities in him, aſſigned him <hi>Nicias,</hi> a wiſe and ſtaid ſubject, for a companion.

            <p>The ſtaid and prudent man, cauſes the raſh and hare brained to loſe that fortune which aſſiſts and favours bold men: The raſh man ſpoyles the prudent mans coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells and advices, not ſuffering them to come to maturity, but preventing them with fury and violence. The primary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the elements are qualified, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled, and corrected by themſelves: mans qualities remaine entire; they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually juſtling &amp; encountring one another, but never joyne nor qualifie themſelves. The raſh man gives an onſet, the prudent man will not ſecond him: One goes as it were with feet of lead to engage himſelfe, the other flyes into an engagement with wings of fire: The prudent man thinkes he ſhall utterly loſe himſelfe, unleſſe he forſake his companion, and ſometimes goes back, when by going on, he might have conquered. <hi>Tacitus</hi> relates the vertues and vices of <hi>Mutian</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi>

but if they had been both joyned in one: he will have a mixt made by Nature, and not by Art, where the parts grow neere, but doe not unite, or at leaſt not mix: each holds &amp; keeps its inclinations to its proper ends. And though the firſt vertues, from which the accidents have their originall, be ſometimes daſhed to pieces, yet the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains intire, ſo that in operating they frame as many characters as they are themſelves, always different, and for the moſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The knowledge of the firſt qualities, and ignorance of the ſecond, loſes both the Phyſitian and the patient: if we did not want this knowledge, the medicines which were moſt mixt, would be the beſt, for our body is more mixt then than any other, by this means bearing the worldly imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make a difference between it and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly perfection: for there the moſt pure and ſimple are the beſt; and here the moſt mixed and mingled are excellenteſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> not content that they had ſent <hi>Nicias</hi> &amp; <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to the enterpriſe of of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> doe appoint <hi>Varianus</hi> alſo for that ſervice. Two contraries had need have a third, to the end that if they cannot be united one to another, they may be both joyned in him; which he may eaſily attain to, if he participate of both their qualities. So the aire, by meanes of its heat, is united to fire;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61864:60"/>
by means of its moiſtneſs, to water: water by its coldneſs, unites it ſelfe to the earth: by its moiſtneſs, to the aire: From whence growes the rawly-compoſed order of this great vniverſe. But becauſe <hi>Varianus</hi> was not ſo, but was likewiſe full of rage &amp; boldneſs, this ſeemed to be rather a putting the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe into the hands of temerity, than ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, unleſs that were the way to ſecure it. A prudent man is not ſitting to undertake bold attempts, which are beyond Reaſon, they are to be atchieved by the hands of a daring fierce man, or not at all. Prudence hath meaſure for is actions; temerity is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited, in uſing it ſomtimes are performed extravagant &amp; unlookt for atchievements. He that makes uſe of it, hath an advantage to aſſault by way of ſurprize to amaze, to diſorder, to confound, binding the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding either to loſe it ſelfe, or take a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den reſolution in a thing which was never diſcourſed upon. It runnes violently upon ſome inacceſſible way, and finds it without defence, becauſe every one ſtands armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Wiſdome, and lies open to Temerity. Therefore wiſe men for feare of this, make a golden bridge for him that flies, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours make a way for them that runne. One may erre (it is true) by temerity, but one ſhall ſometimes doe the like through prudence.</p>

The wiſe man caſts him ſelfe into the armes of reaſon, the raſh man puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the hands of Heaven: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe things have ſeldome that end which other men judge, hee erres ſeldomer that hath not diſcourſed upon affaires, then hee that hath judged of the events. The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is within us, impriſoned in the body, and intangled amongſt the ſenſes; Nature is without, looſe, free, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to erring. The Philoſopher defines Temerity to be an act without reaſon. Hee might peradventure be deceived: An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate act is out of the bounds of reaſon, but a fortunate one is above it. An impulſe of nature, which alwayes aymes at truth, is more available then a motion of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which diſcourſes upon likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods; and if nature erres, it is becauſe one making no difference between our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular nature, and the univerſall, beleeves that impulſe to be ſuperior to reaſon, which is without any, as if the ſenſes, and the heauens did move in the ſame manner. Others, confiding too much in their owne underſtanding, hold all that to be a defect in the inferior part, which is diſſonant from the ſuperior; as if there were not a ſupreme which they ſometimes doe not know, and ſometimes oppoſe erring for the moſt part, by fearing not to erre. It is too hard for

            <p>The Philoſopher was of opinion, that ſuch as were raiſed by fortune, were endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with piety and obſequiouſneſſe towards

the Gods, above other men. And yet <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> teaches the contrary, when hee ſayes, That miſeries are tolerated, and proſperity corrupts us. And if you look into Holy Writ, you will there finde ſentences much differing from <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion. There you ſhall read examples of Kings, both of the twelve, and of the ten, and of the two Tribes, who erred in their greateſt proſperities; moſt of them having before with much vertue and conſtancy endured af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
            <p>Many Subjects ſet worldly glory before their eyes, &amp; many the Divine: you ſhal ſee both of them afflict their bodies to attain to it, thinking to make the ſaid body to enjoy it, after they have attained it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Divine is out of this world, and the worldly in it, the one doth not unchaine and let looſe his ſenſes, but when he cannot ſin; and the other ſins becauſe he hath let them looſe.</p>
            <p>Man is not unhappy onely, in reſpect of his not finding really ſuch an object as may content him; but is more infortunate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that little time during which, novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes him beleeve that he hath found it.

a-doe to avoid that of Greatneſſe: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived to higheſt degrees of good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and finding great oppoſition in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, and not loſing the deſire of a new delight, almoſt deſpairing to attain to it with ſatisfaction of the paſſions of the mind, glutted with the preſent, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the ſatisfaction of the ſenſe, and caſts himſelfe headlong into intemperancy.

            <p>Evill is hated and not envied; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not hated, but envied. Rancor is without any reall object, it runs towards goodneſſe, but towards that which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,

If he imagines him to be an enemy, proud, raſh, and preſumptuous, he beleeves nothing can give him better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, then to overcome him: deſires nothing more than by advancing his own Trophee, to abaſe and bring him low, and employes his vertue and valour in nothing elſe. But if afterward he ſees him before his eyes, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, eloquent, valiant, &amp; affable, not boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his valour, but moderating his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and reaſſume the ſame poſture in which he was by nature ſet, and forſake that which he had fabricated to himſelf; It is impoſſible for him to retain his hatred; becauſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though they be naturall, if they meet with a contrary that is greater, in its preſence they muſt receive it, though the form drive it out altered, but not corrupted.

            <p>That Propoſition of the Maſter, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is irreconcilable, ſeems directly oppoſite

to the other propoſition, That the cauſe cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the effect ceaſes; and yet they are both true.

The freedome of will reacheth not thereunto, it may overcome it, but not deſtroy it; bridle it, but not change it: whence comes, that ſometimes we operate with one, as though we hated him, and yet we love him; as though wee loved him, and yet we hate him.

               <hi>Rome</hi> had at one time two Emperours, <hi>Otto,</hi> who was made in the Citie, <hi>Vitellius,</hi> who was ſet up by the Army, both of them vicious. The one preſently forſakes his old and uſuall courſe of life; the other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes it ſtill: <hi>Otto</hi> was wont to deny his own affections, to promote his intereſts, ſo that the power of commanding, excited and ſtirred up vertue in him: and in <hi>Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> it increaſed his defects. The former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incontinent, and ambitious; the latter, intemperate, and ſimple. <hi>Otto</hi> adventured to aſſume the Empire, becauſe hee could not live privat: <hi>Vitellius</hi> accepted of it, becauſe he knew not how to refuſe it; and not knowing how to ſeek after the delight of the underſtanding, abandoned himſelfe to that of the ſenſes. The <hi>Romane</hi> Senate was amazed at <hi>Otto's</hi> forſaking his vices, and at his counterfeited vertue. The ſame being done by <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> might have given the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> cauſe of ſuſpition, if not of feare, ſeeing they might be ſure the vices would returne greater in bulk, and more violently, through the acrimony which they would acquire by being ſo long ſtopped and diſſembled. Even ſo it befalls him that thinkes to help a ſwift running ſtreame which overflowes his medowes, without turning it another way, only with making the bankes up, he may ſtay it for a while,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61864:69"/>
but on a ſuddaine he turnes it all upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and whereas before it would gently have overflowed his land, it beares down trees by the rootes, overthrowes build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and beats downe all that comes in its way, that oppoſition having gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a greater heape of waters, and made them more violently ſierce. Thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning their paſſions, retaine &amp; keepe in their ſmalleſt and meaneſt ones, if they did goe calmely along with them, they might in part vent out their evill <hi>genius,</hi> without expecting the laſt fury, and violence, which a feigned vertue being unabled to reſiſt, they blindly and furiouſly are precipitated in it. So had <hi>Otto</hi> done, if death had not prevented him; and ſo did <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> wickedly committing adultery with <hi>Agis</hi> the King of <hi>Sparta</hi> his wife. <hi>Agis</hi> was not very circumſpect, ſeeing he did not perceive, that ſome great end muſt of neceſſity be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under ſo great a change, which hee ought to beleeve had taken its originall from an unlimited ambition, and to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt that thereby and through his luxury, he would one day get away from him (two indiviſible things) his wife, and his kingdome: and indeed he got away the one, and in all likelihood laid a plot to gain the other, ſeeing he uſed that meanes to attaine thereunto, which others
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61864:69"/>
have happily put in practiſe to doe the like.</p>
            <p>Firſt to make his valour known, then to publiſh the adultery, and finally to make ſhew that he contemned <hi>Agis,</hi> what was it elſe, then to endeavour to gaine his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: inviting by this meanes diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented perſons to ſide with him, animating, and ſecuring them? But I know not whether <hi>Tacitus</hi> did well underſtand from whence proceeded that feare, when he aſcribed it to diſguiſed and cloaked vices, and falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vertues. <hi>Ottoes</hi> vices were luſt, idle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe, and gormandizing, which were indeed to be wiſhed of him, yet not to be feared, if they had returned to him: Uertues though falſe carry for the moſt part their corruption within them, gliſtring and ſhining on the outſide, as if they were true and pure ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and are more pernicious to them that make uſe of them, then to thoſe for whoſe ſakes, and againſt whom they are employed. And howſoever, they doe leſſe hurt in this manner feigned, then an open, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhameleſneſſe in vices. The Senate (in mine opinion) ſeeing <hi>Otto</hi> thus plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in paſſions, not thinking that he could leave them, though peradventure he might diſguiſe and alter them, feared leſt inſtead of idleneſſe, he would take delight in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and affaires, and in ſtead of luxury
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61864:70"/>
he would be filled with feare, and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and through one take away the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates authority, and through the other the moſt honorable mens lives.</p>

in living, though moſt unhappy. This complexion is not to be wiſhed to a Prince, and if he had it, it ought not to bee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in him, ſeeing that to preſerve it, he ought to be wholly his owne, to become a ſlave to the Phyſician, whereas, a Prince ſhould never be ſo farre his owne as to make himſelfe a ſlave to his ſubjects. If then there be no ſuch temperament to be found, and if there be any ſuch, either it cannot or ought not be maintained, we muſt needs conſequently fall into ſome exceſſe, which may ſerve for nouriſhment, and roote both to vice and vertue; becauſe as <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were borne both of one Mother, ſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſelfe ſame temperament, may proceed both a great vertue, &amp; a great vice. He that was of opinion, that there could be no great vertue in a man, unleſſe there were alſo ſome great vice, was not peradventure deceived, if he meant of a naturall inclination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And if any vice be a ſigne of a great underſtanding, it is that of luxury, which uſeth to be great, where it findes the fire of the <hi>Flava bilis</hi> or yelow choller, and the acritude of the <hi>atra</hi> or black.</p>
            <p>We ſee that thoſe brute beaſts, which have moſt humane knowledge, and ſeeme almoſt to diſcourſe, as Apes and the like are exceeding luxurious, and that at all times; beyond the cuſtome of other beaſts.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61864:71"/>
And to this peradventure, the ancient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venters of fables had a relation, when they feigned all the Gods much addicted to this defect of luſt, as the Poets alſo did their <hi>Heroes.</hi> If I were to frame unto my ſelfe a Prince according to mine owne mind, I would have him continent by vertue, and not by nature. For the naturall continency proceeds from coldneſſe of the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alwayes excludes acrimony, and coldneſſe without acrimony cauſeth ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and not prudency, which requires melancholy; not the dreggs, but the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of blood: not that which is borne <hi>aduſt,</hi> and carries imprinted in the acrimony of its aſhes, the character of the efficient, as the learnedeſt and wiſeſt men of the world have beleeved. And St <hi>Paul</hi> continually complains of the troubles which the acrimony of the prick in the fleſh did bring him into. Luſt is alwayes bad for him that is ſubject to it, but it is not alwayes hurtfull to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. If it doth not paſſe from the perſon to the office, it is the defect of the man, and not of the Prince, ſeeing that in this caſe hee may be a good Politician, though a bad Moraliſt. There have beene ſome in our dayes, that have in their youth run themſelves a little out, in amarous paſſions yet they have guided themſelves therein with ſo much prudency, that our

It is no great matter for a man that is free and looſe to overcome his enemy, but to doe it when he is ſhackled and bound, without unſhackling or unbinding is very much. If it were lawfull for me to relate ſome things which have happened in our dayes, it would ſurely cauſe, ſuch as have too ſharply in this point touched the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Soveraigne Prince, and his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, to recant and change their opinions: they would find and heare ſuch things, that to admit of an extraordinary vertue, they would winke at a ſmall vice, judging it not to be a reall but a feigned vice, and rather an affectation, then a paſſion.</p>

in a Colt is not a ſigne that he will prove a good horſe. Some Colts will be bounding, leaping, and running, not to draw their necks out of the collar, or to ſhun their labour, but to ſhew their generous mettle, and ſpirit; to be ſportfull, and frollick, and not to refuſe the bit. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome againe will uſe the ſame tricks out of a reſty and ſloathfull ſpirit, onely to ſhunne worke, and labour, and though a ſtander by can hardly find any difference in their motion, yet he that governes and rides them can eaſily perceive it.</p>

Let it then bee lawfull for me to conclude, that great luſt is oftentimes a ſigne of a great underſtanding, and that amongſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a Prince, luxury is one of the leaſt, if ſo he doe in ſome part ſuppreſſe it, by not committing therein any violent or unjuſt act; and in all this, I meane of ſuch actions onely as hee commits in his youthfull yeares; Every one hath ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which are proper to that age, as well of the body, as of the mind.</p>
            <p>The Phyſician, whoſe worth wil not ſuffer any man to beleeve that he erred, was wont to ſay, that diſeaſes are moſt dangerous,

when they come in unſeaſonable ſeaſons: the malignity and greatneſſe of them ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelfe in that, that the adverſe ſeaſon of the yeare could not ſuppreſſe nor controll them: And as a difeaſe which comes in its proper ſeaſon is leaſt to bee feared, ſo is a defect which comes in an Age be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And in this caſe it ſeemes a chiefe Officer; or Favourite, ought rather to ſeek to cheriſh prudency in his Prince, than hinder his luſt. For it being cheriſhed and aſſiſted, having gathered ſtrength, will quite extingu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſometimes it endangers the increaſing of the evill: And this is true not onely in thoſe who will not be overſwayed by any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are incenſed to anger thereby; but in them alſo who intend to overcome themſelves, becauſe they diſdaine to be perſwaded by others to that which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend of themſelves to doe. A Painter whilſt he is limming, ſometimes leaves a fault in a place, and runs over the other parts with an intent to mend that error. He that ſees him worke (if he be a wiſe man) although he perceives the error, holds his peace, knowing the Artiſt to be ſo skilfull, that he both knowes it, and will mend it. If he be a foole, he points at it, and produces rage and diſdaine in the Painter, and ſometimes in ſuch exceſſe, that he leaves it unmended, and chuſes rather to leave an error, then to applaud an impertinency. And this is the reaſon why few Painters will admit any to ſee them worke, or judge of their workes before they be perfected: there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more diſtaſtfull to a choice ſpirit then to have a fault ſhewed him, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to amend it, when he knew it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and had an intent ſo to doe.</p>

               <hi>Alcibiades</hi> goes to the Median Court, and findes favour in the eyes of <hi>Tiſaphernes, Socrates</hi> was the moſt affable and courteous Gentile that was, <hi>Tiſaphernes,</hi> as Barbarous
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61864:73"/>
and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> gaines the love of both. We will ſay peradventure that he was of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate habit. Such a Subject (according to <hi>Hyppocrates)</hi> of ſuch a temper, engenders with all conſtitutions, be they cold, or hot, moiſt or drye, becauſe he corrects them all, if it be alwayes true in engendring, yet it is not continually true in loving. It is not ſufficient that he can correct, if the other doth not deſire to be corrected. He will hate him, if peradventure he preferre plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to profit, and whereas he ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre that contrary which is furtheſt from him, he abhorres that moſt which is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, which is the fault of an erring nature. There can be no delight where there is no truth; he is deceived that ſets it upon falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The oppoſite contrary, becauſe it is likewiſe a vice, rather confirmes then takes away the error. Trueth reſides in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, whereupon ſome ſhunne it, becauſe they will not loſe their delight, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived.</p>
            <p>The habit, which hath its diſtemperature from nature, loves its ſemblable. Nature cannot love its deſtruction, it would love it, if it loved the contrary. She hates i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

contrary. In this caſe the intereſt of nature, and of the <hi>individuum</hi> are the ſame. That which happens in the failings of the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, happens alſo in the defects of the mind. If one be cruell naturally, he loves its ſemblable; if by accident, its contrary; From the firſt, proceeds he that runnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the paſſions; from the ſecond hee that doth not reſtraine himſelfe. The one loves vice, and hates the remedy, the other cannot endure neither the vice nor the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, But to go on from the temperament, to the influence of thoſe ſtarres which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it; that which was loue-worthy in <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> might be thought to have bin cauſed by his being borne at that time, when the benigne ſtarres of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> ſhewed their fortunate brightneſſe upon the Horizon, were it not that a violent death, admits of no fortunes in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hee was lovely, and had an impediment in his ſpeech. He betooke himſelfe to all manner of ſciences; Prevailed in eloquence; hee would learne all things, and doe any thing. He would accommodate himſelfe to every mans faſhions. And <hi>Cameleon</hi> like take

            <p>The Athenians ſtood in great feare of <hi>Tiſaphernes</hi> preparations. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> knew of their feare; He thought he would make uſe of it. He writ to the Nobility, that if they would take the Government upon them, and ſuppreſſe the Commons, hee would cauſe <hi>Tiſaphernes</hi> to alter his purpoſe. All embraced this motion, <hi>Phrinicus</hi> onely oppoſed it, knowing that it was done with an intent, to breed diſcord betweene the Senate and the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> to returne into his owne native Country. But becauſe this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was contrary to likelyhood, and given by one who was thought to be an enemy to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> it was not accepted.</p>
            <p>It is hard to goe againſt the preſent, in the behalfe of the future. Truth hath no greater an enemy then likely-hood, and that which is, then that which will be. Wee ſhould not diſpute againſt the ſenſes if they could not erre; and much leſſe againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if it did not erre. Amongſt themſelves
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61864:75"/>
ſometimes they correct themſelves, if at the ſame time they deceive not themſelves, but the ſenſes guided by a great likely-hood, and reaſon being thereby dragged along, they both fall into error, and there is none to raiſe them up. In tricks of <hi>legerdemaine,</hi> who would not be deceived, if notice given, or experience did not hinder it? and who is not deceived, though he be warned, if the Artiſt be arrived to any excellency? Sometimes we muſt not onely feigne that we doe not ſee, nor underſtand, but alſo beleeve we doe not ſee nor underſtand, that which ſeemes to us, we both ſee and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
            <p>Who ſhall perſwade him that is poſſeſſed of a good and healthfull body, repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the beſt humors that can be in man, not endammaged by any action, that he hath need to take Phyſick, if experience had not taught it <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> and his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, us?</p>
            <p>None would go about to perſwade it, and queſtionleſſe no man would ſuffer himſelfe to be perſwaded thereunto. No more then we ſhould be able to perſwade a Monarch, or a Common-wealth, which had obtained ſome great conqueſt, that it were very uſefull for him, or it to yeeld up againe what it had conquered. There would be requiſite for ſuch a purpoſe a Politick
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61864:75"/>
               <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> full of knowledge, experience, and authority, and peradventure he would hardly be able to perſwade it. <hi>Scipio Naſica</hi> was of great eſteeme in the Common-wealth of Rome; yet was he not able to diſſwade the ruining of Carthage. Such is the power of likely hood, it is hard to meet with an underſtanding that can find out truth, a heart that will adviſe it, and a Prince that will follow it. Such an adviſe, is for the moſt part unfortunate: when it is not accepted of, it wants its effect; when it is accepted, it is not ſeen; and becauſe it goes againſt a thing which is ſeen, it is not beleeved. The Author comes to be blamed for ignorance and malice. <hi>Anniball</hi> was adviſed (and peradventure it was done with wiſdome) to not go to Rome after the defeate of <hi>Cannas,</hi> and becauſe he did not goe, he was taxed with ignorance. <hi>Hunno</hi> would have perſwaded the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, (peradventure through malice) in the midſt of victories, when Rome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even ready to fall, to ſeeke after peace, and becauſe he could not perſwade it, he was eſteemed wiſe. It is ordinary for human malice, to judge that advice to be beſt, which hath not bin accepted: And for its ignorance to refuſe to be cleered in matters which have likelyhood in them, any way but by the evill ſucceſſe.</p>

               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:61864:76"/>
To give counſell againſt likely-hood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a great underſtanding, or a great paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The one cannot perſwade, unleſſe it it be knowen; the other, if it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. It is ſufficient for the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be reputed; Paſſion muſt be feared, and may make it, but not perſwade it, to be executed; being known it loſes its credit, and yet it is alwayes known; being little it is not effectuall, and being great it cannot be concealed. The happy man will not think upon the future, for feare of grieving himſelfe, the envious will for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>That which is, keepes him in torment; Onely the hope that it will not laſt, revives him. The underſtanding ſubtilizeth itſelfe, to make it be beleeved, and if there be any reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it findes it out, if there be none, it feignes one; whence comes, that others do not beleeve it, through the difficulty there is in diſcerning the true birth of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from the feigned and fantaſticall one of the deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alcibiades</hi> having intelligence in the City of <hi>Selibria,</hi> made a match to be brought into it by a ſignall given by fire, ſuſpition that one of the conſpirators would diſcover the treaty, cauſed an anticipation. He not being prepared, and ſeeing the ſignall given, ran thither with a few, giving order for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61864:76"/>
the reſt to follow. But being come into the City, he found ſo much oppoſition that he was not able to reſiſt the too advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power.</p>
            <p>He cauſeth a trumpet to be ſounded: Commands the Cittizens to lay down their armes, if they value their lives. When a man is in danger and hath his ſword in his hand all the ſpirits retired to the heart, and having in a manner forſaken the braine, it is an eaſie matter to be deceived; whence proceeds the danger which is in ſpeaking, whileſt one is skirmiſhing, ſo that many times enterprizes have bin loſt after they have bin in a manner attained, and wonne onely by a word miſſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Selibrians,</hi> hear the enemies within the walls, they imagine they are all there: they heare a trumpet which doth courteouſly, and friendly invite them to yeeld: their braine is not apt to ſearch out the matter, and find out the deceit, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their weapons in their hands to defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their City, and their lives, judging it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to defend the one, and ſeeing the way opened to ſecure the other, they accept of the proffer.</p>
            <p>The commanding and reſolute ſpeech and voice did cooperate greatly in this ſanatick terror: the command cauſes obedience, the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61864:77"/>
reſolvedneſſe terrifies, eſpecially where diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience is death.</p>
            <p>To not beleeve it they muſt of neceſſity have had time to diſcourſe upon it: and therefore the imminent puniſhment giving no time to diſcourſe, they were forced to beleeve. Seeing then it was hard to avoid the danger, and canvaſſe the matter, and harder to goe againſt the ſenſes without canvaſſing of it: that was beleeved to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure life, which without diſcourſe could not chuſe, but be beleeved, and could not be diſcourſed without hazard of life.</p>
            <p>When the Roman Army commanded by <hi>Germanicus</hi> at the River of <hi>Rhine</hi> mutined, <hi>Mennius</hi> reduced that part which was moſt violent &amp; inſolent, with reſolute &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, which ſeparated the univerſall from the particular, a thing which terrifies the more, forcing a man in his thoughts, to forſake that union, which makes him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, and bold. He takes hold of the eagle, or enſigne, and boldly cries, <hi>he that doth not follow me is an enemy to Caeſar. Saul</hi> being ſlighted by a part of the Iſraelites, takes two Oxen, and hewes them in pieces, ſends the pieces into all the quarters of Iſrael, and ſends them word, that ſo ſhall his Oxe be ſerved that doth not follow him;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61864:77"/>
The commanding and reſolute meſſage which made the publick cauſe particular, wrought in ſuch manner, that all Iſrael fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> aſſaulted by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine chance, inſtead of hazarding himſelfe with thoſe few Souldiers which followed him, and caſting himſelfe into the midſt of the danger, hath recourſe to deceit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that makes me to eſteem him rather ſubtile, then valiant. Seeing that nature being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly brought into a ſtreight, flyes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently for reliefe to that part from which it hopes for moſt aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>If it bee from the braine, we lay by ſtrength, if from ſtrength, we make no uſe of wit. And if wit had bin laid aſide, and not made uſe of in this caſe, how could he have found out ſuch a ſubtle device, as could hardly have bin contrived being out of danger, and ſettled in mind? In a great paſſion we leave art, and flye to nature.</p>
            <p>The one needs attention when it operates; the other needs none. And becauſe in great paſſions man oftentimes abandons himſelf, that paſſion then prevailes which operates, though it be abandoned.</p>
            <p>Nature and art taken in a ſtreight, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by feare, cannot help but hinder one another. The one is not followed by diſcourſe, and the other being abandoned
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61864:78"/>
cannot make uſe of it. Nature hath left but few void of defence, but ſhe ſeldome ſuffers ſagacity, and valour, to be in one ſubject. To whom ſhe hath given a heart to fight, ſhe hath not given ſwiftneſſe to eſcape. Amongſt doggs, that kind which is moſt ſwift, is moſt cowardly.</p>
            <p>The Fox muſt by an extreme neceſſity be forced to fight, and a Lion to run away. Yet he will not wholly recommend his ſafety to flight, now and then he will turne his clawes to aſſiſt with that which nature hath granted him, that which neceſſity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces him to.</p>
            <p>The dogge by running away puts himſelf in diſorder, becauſe he doth not make uſe of thoſe weapons, in which lies his defence. Wherefore nature inſtead of helping hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him, becauſe that running with its ſpirits to that part wherein his ſafety ſhould conſiſt, &amp; feare driving them to that part in which it ſhould not be, he muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity loſe himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The hare which is eſteemed the moſt fearefull of all creatures, ſeeing it ſelfe ſet upon by ſo unequall an enemy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſame People which a little while ſince condemned <hi>Alcibiades</hi> as a traitor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him now as a deliverer, and ere long will drive him away againe as an enemy. They love, and have no ſooner done loving, but they hate, and no ſooner done hating, but they love.</p>
            <p>The furtheſt is neareſt to them, for they runne from one extreame to another. They hold no meane, ſaith <hi>Tacitus,</hi> either they feare, or makes themſelves to be feared.

A Metaphyſical Philoſopher is not good in a Common-wealth: the Morall would ſaile well in a calme, in a tempeſt he loſeth himſelf. Policie is an art by it ſelfe, no man hath yet rightly learned it. Many know how to doe that which ſhould be done, none what is to be done. Hee that knowes not the motions of Fortune, is no good Polititian; and he that knows them, will alſo know God: He is not ſeen in the face, but onely in the back; becauſe (as I may ſay) there is nothing of his operating known, but what is paſt. Not to make u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of prudence, is brutiſhneſſe; truſting to it, is arrogancy. A man to operate well, though he be full of knowledge, hath need of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more; he can neither learn, nor teach, nor know he hath it, unleſs experience ſhews it him, nor knowes not what it is, after he hath had experience of it. If this be not true, that was fruſtratory, and of no availment to <hi>Socrates,</hi> (who was the wiſeſt amongſt the Gentiles) which he beleeved to be a Demon, and in which he truſted, more than in his own prudency. This is not the onely unknown quality in the world, its contrary is likewiſe ſo: And where the good ſerves to give the greater light, the bad is imployed to put it out. Both are ocaſions of the loſſe of wiſdome; and he that loſes it, knowes not wherefore. The firſt works upon it, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61864:79"/>
againſt it: the one with profit, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with dammage; the one blind, the other enlightned. The people goes on, and is not ſtayed by diſcourſe, the end of its voyage is, where it can goe no further. A great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding cauſeth conſtancie; a weak one, obſtinacy; becauſe the one ſuffers not it ſelf to be overcome by Sophiſticall fallacies, the other underſtands not the truth of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The people is diſtempered, how then ſhall it know that which is temperate, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he who writ therof, wil have none but its ſemblable know it. An obſtinate perſon is hard to be removed, it is a great violence that muſt doe it; and that being great, throwes all to the ground which it findes a foot, and ſometimes drawes from one extreme to another. If then Mediocrity is hard to finde; found, to bee knowne; and knowne, to ſubſiſt: and the extreme manifeſts it ſelfe, we need not marvell, if the people doe not know Mediocrity. Theſe Phantaſmes draw mine imagination to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place of <hi>Plutarch:</hi> He declares <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> be unapt for Sciences, by reaſon of his great conſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61864:80"/>
conſtancy; and becauſe knowledge is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but opinion, and opinion gives way to inſtability, he contemned that knowledge which admitted not of conſtancy. The not knowing the foreſaid ſecret, which is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den even from many wiſe men, is the cauſe that the people call <hi>Alcibiades</hi> traytor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had not taken the Citie of <hi>Andria:</hi> they reputed him to be a moſt valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, becauſe he could all as he would, and would not any thing which he did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. It was unknown to them that there was a <hi>medium</hi> between working through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and working through malice. This is produced by a maſſe of circumſtances, from a mixture of actives and paſſives, from a difference of time, which furiouſly aſſaults a man.

But in ſuch things as belong to manners, and morall actions, it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. He that will ſee the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the judgement of Nobles that are touched with envie, and the Peoples which are taken with admiration, let him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaking thereof, ſaith, that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had no will to overcome, and brings forth <hi>Nicias,</hi> a Noble man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing him for the ſame ill ſucceſſe to the people, and ſaying, that he did it through ignorance, careleſneſſe, folly and vanity, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing it not to his evil heart, but to his ill underſtanding, and other things which might diſparage his wiſdome. A great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is an enemy to him that hath no merit; to him that hath it not equall to his reputation, and alſo to him that hath it but equall. It is onely favourable to him that hath a talent ſurpaſſing that great eſteeme. He enjoyes not only that which he hath but alſo that which he hath not, but hopes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And becauſe humane felicity doth not conſiſt in obtaining the greater things, but in the greateſt hope of obtaining them; becauſe that a continued act in a ſmall time, produces a habit, from which ſprings ſatiety or inſenſibility, and hee
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61864:81"/>
ſhall be more happy then the other, whoſe merit and repute is equall. It is a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune for a man to have worth, and want repute; and farre greater to have repute, and want worth. The feare of the future diſgrace, ſpoils his preſent pleaſure. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ground his delight upon that which is falſe, if he doth not deceive himſelfe, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects ſhame from being undeceived. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he findes not himſelfe faulty for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deceived, yet hee would be happy in ſome meaſure, if he could but call in that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror which he cannot perpetuate in others; becauſe the knowledge of ones ſelfe (which is mans chiefe vertue) is the Hangman which torments him. Finally, a great repute is the greateſt help a man can have that will not operate: and the greateſt dammage for him that is put to the Teſt, and is tried; for either he proves according to expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then he gaines nothing, or proves beneath the expectation, and loſes all he had gained.</p>
            <p>Reputation is not diminiſhed by degrees, nor cannot be broken piece-meale: if it be not reſerved intire, it quite abandoneth one. If a particular man hath gottten it, let him be content with having it; if a Prince, let him not, if he can avoid it, put it to a triall. It is better to die ingreat repute than put it to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; to leave it doubtfull in the world
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61864:82"/>
what would have followed, than to put ones ſelf in danger of what wil follow. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily one ought not put it to triall, but being forced thereunto, adventure himſelfe with it; and upon occaſion of loſing it, loſe himſelfe alſo. Not only that victory which <hi>Alcibiades</hi> got over the Citie of <hi>Selibria,</hi> but all the reſt of his actions likewiſe, diſcover him rather to have been full of cunning ſubtilty, than of wiſdome. From whence, in my opinion. proceeded the inſtability of his fortune.</p>

A. Prince muſt not make uſe of vice in governing, nor yet of ſuch vertues as ruine the people. Clemency, liberality, mercy, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and all other vertues, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable in a privat man. In a Prince I commend rigor above cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, parſimony above liberality, roughneſs above mercy; and cautell above fortitude. Rigor will preſerve his peace at home, parſimony wil defend him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall war, without endangering the blood of his ſubjects, or emptying unmeaſurably his Exchequers. Roughneſſe will preſerve ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and prevent ſo many ill effects which compaſſion produces: to which we muſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had a relation, when in his <hi>Poetick</hi> (which is alſo a part of his <hi>Politicks)</hi> he made ſo principall a buſineſs the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Princes, to let them learn Tragick Poems, as a thing that would purge their diſpoſitions from mercy. Finally, cautelouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will not ſuffer him to expoſe his life, which is of ſuch value, to gain a vain and unprofitable repute of being valorous. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> whileſt he was a private man, did always ſhew great ſignes of valour; but being once King, he ſuffered himſelfe to be perſwaded by <hi>Ioab,</hi> to abſent himſelfe from danger. And when the Lord intending to puniſh him, propounded three things unto him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee would endure ſeven yeares fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, flye three moneths before his

enemies, or have three days peſtilence in the land; he choſe the laſt, quite againſt the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of fortitude, but yet in favour of the publick good; judging (as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith) his abſence would be more hurtfull to the people, than the peſtilence. True it is, that when he ſaw the Angel turn his ſword upon the people, he cried out, that he ſhould turn it againſt him that was guilty, and ſpare the innocent. But this was not forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude digeſted by reaſon, it was a violence incited by a tender and valorous nature. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, That in his choyce hee followed wiſdome; in his griefe, piety. I will unfold this queſtion, by ſaying. That the Propoſition which God made to <hi>David,</hi> was to keep him farre off: that which <hi>David</hi> made to the Angel, was to kill him. He will not accept of going farre off, and deſires death, becauſe that by his abſence, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples light was put out, and they would bee left without a guide in the dark: whereas his death had been but a putting out of one light, to give way to another. The former ſeemes alwayes to be evill, the latter is not alwayes ſo, but many times is turned to a greater good. It may alſo bee ſaid, that when <hi>David</hi> made his firſt choyce, hee grounded it upon a hope hee had, that hee he might appeaſe God by Prayer; which foundation, when he found it prove vain, he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61864:84"/>
altered his deſire. Nothing makes a man better than prudency, and nothing keeps him more ſecure than ſagacity. This ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city would be dangerous, if it were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally rooted in the breaſt of a Generall, born there, and not acquired: For thoſe who are endowed therewith in this manner, never goe about to try either force or fortune, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the caſe be quite deſperate, and for the moſt part, the time paſt, either to make uſe of force, or adventure ones ſelf upon chance. A Generals ſagacity is different from a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians. The one is not good in the Citie; wherefore Military men are little available in a Senate. The other is pernicious in the field: wherefore they ſend Gown-men, &amp; Councellors to loſe and ruine enterpriſes. In one of theſe ſagacities valour ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile; in the other, ſagacity itſelf muſt have the upper hand. The Polititian ought not betake himſelfe to force till ſagacity quite fails; and the Military man will hardly make uſe of ſagacity, whileſt he can work with violence.</p>

Therefore in ſuch kinde of people, the ſpirits are perceived at the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, by the motions of the head and hands; and moſt of all, by the ſplendor of the eyes, out of which they ſend forth ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles. And by reaſon that no cauſe, (if we ſpeak of celeſtiall ones) concurres more in this fabrick, than <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſwift in his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; therefore it proves moſt like him.

When they give him the company of any ſtars, to make him have a happy influence, it is of the leſſer ones. The over-much motion which it gives the ſpirits in beginning of an action, doth not admit of a proſecution of it; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-much light doth puzzle and reſolve them.

Although they conſiſt of ſomewhat elſe which is more internall; to apprehend which is required great skill in thoſe Arts; and an eminent underſtanding to judge of it. The ignorant man, preſently runnes to the ſenſe, and judges with the eye, and eare, commending according to his ſight and hearing, many times that which deſerves no commendation, and never blaming that which is blame-worthy. Apparance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him, becauſe he fixes himſelfe upon the accidents and commands them; and not penetrating to the knowledge of the ſubſtance, he diſcommends it not, becauſe he does not know it. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks of ſome Orators, whoſe orations pronounced by themſelves ſeemed excellent, and at the

very firſt, gained applauſe; but being read, and examined, were of no worth. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes they forced his underſtanding, and he commends them, not becauſe they deſerved it, but becauſe they bound him to it. The ſame thing there is in pictures; for there are ſome coloured in ſuch ſort, that at the firſt ſight, they doe conſtraine the judgement of ignorant, &amp; ſomtimes of underſtanding men alſo, yet with this difference, that the firſt ſtill continue and perſevere in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and theſe alter it as ſoon as they have examined the buſineſſe. Such kinds of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which ſo violently attract, in Policie, Rethorick, Poetry, Painting, and other Arts, doe proceed, as I ſaid, from a kinde of Fury, which is ſeen in the viſage of an active man, and in the viſage and geſture of the Orator. <hi>Tacitus</hi> was not content with cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it a River, but increaſes the Epithet with the name of <hi>High ſounding,</hi> to expreſſe the noiſe with which it violently runs. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> calls it <hi>Impetuous,</hi> and doth not ſay it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, but raviſhes the mindes of hearers. The ſame Fury, though it bee not ſeen, nor heard in Painters, yet it is ſeen imprinted in the works. The works of <hi>Tintoretto,</hi> though they be inferior to <hi>Raphael's</hi> pictures, yet with theſe qualities they take away their advantage. They are both good, but at the firſt glance, if you doe not take time, you
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61864:86"/>
will applaud <hi>Tintoretto's</hi> moſt; if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them well, <hi>Raphaels.</hi> He that colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth beſt, ſhall finde greater applauſe at the vulgars hands, than he that deſignes and drawes beſt, although he colour well alſo. So likewiſe falls it out in Poetry and Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, that which prevailes in that part that belongs moſt to the ſenſe being highlieſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded: For that preſently repreſents it ſelf to the eye of man; and the ſight ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way carries it to the underſtanding, and without letting it have time to diſcourſe upon it, obliges it to give judgement on ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parances ſide. A man fit for great employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to be endowed with wiſdome, to know what he is to undertake; and with activeneſſe to goe through with buſineſſe when he hath deliberated upon it. If you finde two ſubjects, one moſt wiſe and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but not very active; the other moſt active, though not ſo wiſe, activity being eaſier to know, than prudence, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly perceived in the viſage, geſtures and eyes of him that is endowed therewith Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence being inviſible, as internall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed vertue, which is not diſcovered, but onely in occaſions; ſurely wiſe men will paſſe their verdicts on the active mans ſide, &amp; he ſhal be put upon all the employments.

Thoſe who have ſuch a mixture of great vices, and great vertues, ſometime precipitate and fall almoſt as ſoon as they are born; ſometimes alſo they make a great noyſe in the world, when they happen upon times which will beare with ſuch vices, and ſtand in need of ſuch vertues. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> met with a popular Common-wealth, fitted to his inequality, that applauded his liberality and beauty, ſuffered it ſelfe to be perſwaded by his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence admired his reſolution, humorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and valour, did run along with him in his vices of luxury, ſurfeiting, tyranny and injuſtice; which were pleaſing to people, ſo long as they were employed againſt the Nobility. <hi>Nero,</hi> who was blemiſhed with ſuch defects, and yet gained the <hi>Romane</hi> peoples applauſe, more than any other <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Emperour. Indeed it was by reaſon that he met with times differing from <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> times, the Senate then being predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant over the people, which lived depreſſed, and without authority, his ruine could not be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61864:87"/>
prevented; whereas <hi>Alcibiades</hi> did not take ſo much harm within the Common-wealth, in getting honours, as abroad in managing of affaires; for although his temperament was well enough accommodated and fitted to the ſtate which the Citie was in, yet he found it otherwiſe in forraigne affaires, whereby he was neceſſitated to fall. And though he did riſe again divers times aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his great and good parts, yet being at the laſt over-born by his evill ones, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained oppreſſed. Equality is not onely judged to be an endowment of a wiſe man, but alſo a ſigne that he is one, ſeeing it is he that commands the ſtarres. If a heaven va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable in its motions, moves above us, the ſtars alwayes varying in their aſpects, have their influences upon us, and an aire muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble every moment, doth encompaſſe us, and we are our ſelves framed of an unequall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, who ſhall be able to keep himſelf continually in the ſame tone, in deſpight of heavens, ſtars, elements and temperaments? Certainly a wiſe man ſhall. We are made a ſpectacle to God and men, ſaid St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And is it not a worthy ſpectacle, to ſee a wretched man, a handfull of earth, a point, a nothing, to oppoſe the vaſtneſſe of the heavens, the influences of the ſtarres, the maſſe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, his owne nature, and conquer them all? Equality ſignorizes over the influences,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61864:88"/>
becauſe it conſtantly goes alwayes againſt them: inequality is commanded by them, becauſe it alwayes followes them various.</p>

When Nature fights with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and ſhewes it ſelfe ſometimes ſuperior, and ſometimes inferior, it betokens and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues weakneſſe in it, at laſt it remains con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, the diſeaſe increaſing in malignity, and nature decreaſing in ſtrength, which it loſes even then when it overcomes. Relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the moſt part are deadly, becauſe that nature overcame not the diſeaſe at firſt, but onely when it uſed its laſt endeavour, and when the diſeaſe riſeth again above its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wanting a new and greater endeavour, muſt of neceſſity ſuccumb &amp; periſh: Even ſo, man wraſtling with Fortune, and ſomtimes being ſuperior, ſometimes inferior, muſt needs at laſt remain inferior, &amp; be overcome, For an unfortunate man to ſtrive againſt Fortune, for the firſt time is ignorance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once beaten downe, to riſe againe and returne to the combat is obſtinacie, but to proſecute, and follow it, is meer and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute follie.

wild beaſts, and in ſtead of Cityes and Palaces, Caves, and Woods would be his habitation. And if Fortune did ſeeke him out, inſtead of giving him her hand, ſhe would turne her back to him. He would have his recourſe to night, to not behold the light which is ſo tormenting to him, the Sun, and Heavens that are ſo contrary, and would alſo wiſh the night darke, that he might not ſee in it thoſe ſtar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him dammage and ruine. Happineſſe ſhewes ill in a mans eyes in the darke, and unhappineſſe in the light. It had bin better for ſuch a one to not have bin borne, or to have dyed as ſoone as he was borne. But ſince to not be borne did not lie in his hands, nor dying doth not; let him hide himſelfe, to make men beleeve that he is not borne, and that he lives as if he were dead. Surely if he did know his evill fortune, he would withdraw into the woods, and if it were knowen to others, he would be forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate thither. Wee can hardly make our ſelves beleeve we have it, unleſſe we make more then one eſſay, but others may eaſily know that we have it, without having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented it. Great Princes, Kings, and Monarchs, in whoſe hands ſeemes at firſt to lie the giving and taking away of their ſubjects fortune, if they did withſtand the motions which they inwardly feele,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61864:89"/>
they would know the quality of fortune by the inward effect which moves in them. And how behove-full would it be to recule and ſet by unfortunate men ere they were ſcarce known, and to bring fortunate men out into the light, they having no need of any other triall, but what they feele within themſelves of inſtinct or loathing. Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate men overcome fortune with follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, the unfortunate with yeelding to it. How many times doth nature kill a man, no diſeaſes aſſaulting nor engaging him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth aſſault and engage them.

               </gap>e (according to the opinion of learned men) certaine venemous humours, which remaine a long time in a mans body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting it, becauſe nature hath laid them aſide in ſome ignoble part, farre from the heart, and hath not medled with them, nor ſtirred them; which humours if ſhe once ſet upon, ſhe is loſt. And unfortunate man would live ſecure all the dayes of his life; if ſeeing he cannot any way move fortune, he would recule, and remove himſelfe, not comming to triall with her, to aſſault her. Man daily calls fortune unconſtant, and yet learnes not to ceaſe his admiration when he ſees her inconſtancy. If he he doth not know her to be ſuch why doth he give her that attribute? and if he doth know it, why doth he wonder at it when he ſees it
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61864:89"/>
inconſtant? This alwayes accompanies ignorance, and doth not admit of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>What is there firme in the world? The earth to day brings forth a plant, and makes ſhew as if would raiſe it up as high as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Goe by, and come againe that way within a few dayes, and you ſhall ſee it turned to aſhes, and quite abandoned as ſoon as it is perfected. Behold a Tree that hath happily brought its fruite to maturity, and hath born it all the while it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and as ſoone as it is come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſuffers it either to wither, or rot: Theſe things are daily ſeen, and yet no man wonders at ſuch an inconſtancy. But if we do but think of an <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled and raiſed up to the skies, then when he is at the height left in the hands of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate death; his Monarchie firſt divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and then deſtroyed; Then we cry out againſt fortune, and call it inconſtant. If all wordly things are ſubject to theſe kinds of motions, and changes, why doe we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them to fortune more then to any thing elſe; Truely becauſe it hath leaſt part in it; and is therein more inconſtant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath no certainty in its inconſtancy, wherefore we complaine of its good deeds, and our owne ignorance is the cauſe of our wondring: it being not alwayes incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61864:90"/>
but we not knowing when it will be ſo.</p>
            <p>Men have to this day ſought the cauſe why it comes to paſſe that ſubjects raiſed by fortune, are by the ſame in an inſtant caſt downe: and that ſhe ſhewes her power moſt adverſe there, where her favours have bin moſt conſpicuous; and no body hath yet bin able to give a juſt reaſon for it: not ſo much becauſe they could not give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Probleme, as becauſe they have not framed nor ſtated the Probleme right: but have laid it fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e. For many, yea very many who have bin raiſed by fortune, have remained ſo all their life time, and it hath followed them to their very graves. The reaſon of this diverſity of effects, is that, which muſt be ſifted out. <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> doe not alone influxe fortunes, but <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturne</hi> likewiſe have their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and with them the fixed ſtarres of the firſt greatneſſe, all of them (except <hi>Spica Virginis)</hi> defiled with the violent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of theſe malevolent ones.</p>
            <p>The way is different, and the manner contrary. Some doe raiſe men, are raiſed by Violence, Misfortune, Sword, Fire, Bloud, Slaughters, and Battailes. Some againe, by meanes of Sciences, Vertues, Councells and Prudence are brought mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to degrees of eminency. Out of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61864:90"/>
firſt are framed Tyrants, and Generalls of Armyes; out of the latter, Lawgivers, Councellors, Princes, Prieſts. Each have their Cataſtrophes according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when once the Aſpect turnes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friendly to be adverſe. But the damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and harmes which are influxed by <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are not Tragicall; The change of State is not ſuddaine, and even the death it ſelfe is milde. <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> doe every thing violently. Looke but upon the ſeven Kings of Rome in its very firſt beginning, and you ſhall ſee them all (except <hi>Numa Pompilius)</hi> die violent deaths. In them you ſhall for the moſt part ſee the violence of misfortunes involv'd amongſt deſtructions &amp; bloud. In this the mildneſſe of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> &amp; <hi>Venus,</hi> Councell, Prudencie, and Religion. Conſider many peacefull Princes; Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Councellors, and Prieſts, riſen to the very height of happineſſe: And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide many Princes that have bin War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, Tyrants, Generalls of Armies; And in theſe you ſhall find, for the moſt part, Tragick Cataſtrophes, in the other, very ſeldome any violent ones. But the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate man hath not onely nature, and the ſtarres adverſe to him, but men alſo, whoſe envy he ſtirreth up againſt him through his pride; and even God himſelfe moving him to wrath with his wickedneſſe. Yet
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61864:91"/>
his fortune may wither a little, and yet not be quite corrupted, he may by his prudency overſway the ſtarres, with humility miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate men, and with piety appeaſe God. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had not the delight of an unſavoury and continued happineſſe, he had it of a ſharpe, and often renewed one. The habit of a Wreſtler (as the wiſe man ſaid) being arrived to the very height of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cannot be increaſed, but it will periſh, nor cannot be kept at a ſtay but it will change, nor change without growing worſer.</p>
            <p>The remedy is to diminiſh it, that it may be increaſed againe. Even ſo happineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived to the height, muſt deſcend: and if you ſtay till the deſcent comes accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it often turnes to a precipice: If it comes by wiſdom and foreſight, it occaſions a new delight by riſing againe.</p>
            <p>There is no way for one to riſe when he is at higheſt, but firſt he muſt come downe lower; Fortune is favourable when chance carries him downe gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly, and it is an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent underſtanding, which will diſpoſes his will to it. There is no great delight in being happy, it requires a motion, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is in the becomming ſo, and he that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſt and moſt times becomes ſuch hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived moſt pleaſure. Such a happineſſe doth that man attaine unto, that humbles
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61864:91"/>
himſelfe when he is come to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: he enjoyes a perpetuall delight, and yet doth not forſake his ſtand, living in a continuall motion. He alwayes humbles himſelfe, and is ſtill raiſed up. But even as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was (in mine opinion) deceived, judging it a good habit, to be full of bloud, ſo are they alſo who judge thoſe men happy that are ful of bloud. If any man had repreſented, and ſet before the eyes of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and others who were then; or are now like unto them, the way, and meanes, whereby they had attained to their happineſſe; hearing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but outcries, howlings, and horrid lamentations, ſeeing nothing but ſlaughters, ruines of Cities, deſolation of Provinces, Inhabited places made deſolate, fruitfull places barren, themſelves encompaſſed, with fire, dead carkaſſes, and bloud: it would ſurely ſtrike a terror into them. What happineſſe is that then the cauſe of which affrights and terrifies even him that hath attained to it?</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Doe not profeſſe my ſelfe ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, as that I could not erre in mine advertiſements: neither am I ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian, that I would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans reputation to ſuffer, being any way touched by my ignorant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.

it of mine own head, yet it is ſo farre from truth, that I ſhould imagine I did wrong the ſincerity Duke Charles uſed therein, if I did not affirme the report to be falſe, raiſed by ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, and intereſsed perſons.

From the one he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres, that good ſoile may overcome bad tillage: from the other, that let the ſoile be never ſo good, yet if it continually have bad tillage, it will bring forth ſome bad plant. The ſoile is the Minde, the tillage, Learning, which being of a temperate complexion, corrects all exceſſes, and cures all contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It raiſeth thoſe that are too low, humbles them that are too ſtout; where it findes any hard thing, it ſoftens it; where any ſoft, it hardens it: reſembling the Sun, which with the ſame beames melts the Ice, and hardens the mire. This doctrine is ſo delightfull, that it hath been able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the eyes which it could not dazzle.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61864:95"/>
I have a long time looked upon it with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment, knowing that by conſenting to it, I ſhould betray mine underſtanding; and doubting leſt by oppoſing it, I ſhould ſeem to queſtion a truth; and by arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt education, which hath commonly been approved of, (and moſt of all by the wiſeſt) I ſhould be reputed raſh and temera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though by right I ſhould be applauded for it. But if a good Citizen ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his life to ſave the publick, why ſhould he not alſo adventure his reputation for the common ſervice? This will be alſo ſo much the eaſier, becauſe I mean not to direct my ſhafts againſt the thing it ſelfe, but againſt the manner; commending, with others, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation: but not that Education which is commonly practiſed.</p>
            <p>I repreſent unto my ſelfe two trees of the ſame kinde but in ſeverall places; one wilde in the forreſt, yet in good ſoile: the other growing in a Garden, amiddeſt the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of tillage and husbandry. I ſee the boughes of the latter more beautifull and ſpringing up, its fruit fairer and bigger; but the boughes ready to break at every blaſt of wind, &amp; the fruit rot in a ſhort time, and affording but a weak kind of nouriſhment. I ſee in the former, rougher boughes, leſſer fruit, and not ſo beautifull; but the boughes reſiſting the fury of the North windes, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61864:95"/>
the fruit not eaſily corrupted, and ſtrong for nouriſhment. The roughneſſe of the tree of the forreſt, yeelds I know not what kind of ſtatelineſſe, ſo that Majeſty added to the horridneſſe, brings forth a kind of reverence with delight. The tenderneſſe of the other, moves delight with its beauty; but in ſuch a manner, that it doth in ſome kinde make the beholder grow tender with looking on it. The tree of the forreſt is like a vigorous, ſinewy, well-limbed man, with ſtrong muſcles. A garden tree reſembles a young and tender maiden. And if this be true, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation being like a garden, will make the maſculine vigour grow effeminate, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away the horridneſſe which produces feare, the Majeſty which cauſeth reverence, and will change the Sex, and metamorphoſe Man into Woman. Many Princes have found it ſo, who having conquered fierce &amp; ſtubborn nations, have not taken more pains in any thing to keep them under the yoke of bondage, than in poliſhing what was rough, tame what was wilde, and effeminate by manuring and trimming in a Garden, the maſculine conditions of thoſe wilde, but ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtious plants; yet I doe not mean to vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Education but rather intend to ſpeake in commendation of it, not digreſſing from the example of <hi>Agriculture,</hi> which <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſets down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:61864:96"/>
A husbandman ſometimes meets with an excellent ſoile, to ſowe Corne upon: and if he does but even as it were, break it up with the Plough, and ſowes but a little quantity of ſeed upon it, it will yeeld a fruitfull and abundant harveſt: becauſe the goodneſſe of the ſoile, not oppreſſed by the multitude of ſeed, doth beyond meaſure increaſe that little, and being not ſoftened with overmuch tilling, it ſtrengthens the ſtemme, and with great fertility comes to maturity. But if the unskilfull husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man too carefully manures and tills it, and ſowes a great deale of ſeed upon it, at the firſt comming up, he ſhall ſee an abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crop ſprung, which being growen up with the fruite ſhall lye upon the ground, and being laid will be over-growne with weeds, and ſhall gather great eares, but empty and putrified.</p>
            <p>A husbandman ſometimes meetes with a ſoile that is ſo barren, that he leaves it in the hands of nature, after he hath tilled it, and ſowen it with very good ſeed, and it will bring forth graſſe inſtead of Corne, and cockle inſtead of Wheat.</p>
            <p>But if he chance to meete with an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſoile, there he uſes all the art and skill he hath in husbandry; there he ſoweth ſeed in abundance, and whereas in excellent ſoil, with little art hindering as it were nature,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61864:96"/>
in indifferent ſoile, with great Art., aſſiſting it, hereapes a moſt plentifull and abounding Harveſt. This is an inſtruction for men. Let not an evill nature be too much tilled, nor fed with ſeed, it is offended by being fed, and too much tillage offends it; either the ſeed doth not fadge and take root there, or it turnes to poyſon. Let an indifferent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have a great deale of education, and a good one but a little, if you will not have it grow weak and effeminate. The ancient <hi>Romanes,</hi> whileſt the excellent ſoile laſted, did not tenderly till it with learning, becauſe they would not weaken the ſturdineſſe of their Citizens, nor cauſe their corn to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground through too much rankneſſe, but did educate them ruſtically, in a Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, and ſo they brought forth a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full generation of Heroick perſons. The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dreſſing of a Garden is fit for <hi>Tulips,</hi> and ſuch kindes of Flowers, which for the moſt part delight the eye, but are without ſavour, ſent, or ſubſtance: and ſuch are thoſe men, who brought up in Muſicke, ſinging, and dancing, ſerve for ornament, but are fruitleſſe and vain in a Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>The advantage which an excellent ſoile being but roughly tilled, hath above that which is carefully manured and fed, will more plainly appeare, in paſſing over two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61864:97"/>
parts, we multiply the compariſon. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi> was queſtionleſs an admirable Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſometimes hee was ſo accurate in the Draughts of his Penſill, and ſo exact in his limming, that it ſeemed hee would make the very haires numerable: and ſometimes hee would content himſelfe with drawing of ſome pictures with few and rough ſtrokes. An underſtanding Spectator of ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent proceeding in his Art, will in the one finde a feminine trimneſſe; in the other, a maſculine ſturdineſſe. Hee will paſſe over the firſt with praiſe, the latter hee will fixe upon with admiration; hee will have a ſweet inclination to the firſt, but the laſt will violently and forcibly draw along his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion and affection.</p>
            <p>What was <hi>Cato</hi> (whom Antiquity was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver weary of commending) but a plant growing in an excellent ſoile, a Picture drawn with rough ſtrokes? And the two <hi>Brutes,</hi> one of which expelled the Tyrant, and the other ſlew him, who will not ſay but they were trees of the forreſt? The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was inferior to the firſt in fortune, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he exceeded him in knowledge. Hee knew the defect after hee had been hurt by it; and when he lay a dying, he ſtiled all Sciences vain. <hi>Lucius,</hi> hardened by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageneſſe of the forreſt, kild his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. <hi>Marcus,</hi> ſoftned with the delicacie of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61864:97"/>
tillage ſuffers <hi>Caeſars</hi> frinds to live, loſing that Common-wealth with his learning, which the other had built up with his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The people of Rome who hoped for liberty through <hi>Marcus</hi> his valour, feared he would loſe the beauty of his foreſtick hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridneſſe, by meanes of manuring; <hi>Caeſar</hi> almoſt aſſured himſelfe that he had loſt it. They were both deceived, for with that part of ſavageneſs which remained, he could: kill <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ruine the Common-wealth with that ſoftneſſe which he had acquired.</p>
            <p>When education is contrary to nature, if it doth produce a new character of its own, yet can it hardly quite cancell that which it found, it may mitigate, but not overcome it. One ſubject made baſis to two contraries, ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times operating according to nature, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, works with oppoſite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and with that inequality loſes it ſelfe. If <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> had bin wholly ſoft, he had not undertaken ſo cruell an act: if he had bin wholly rough, he had happily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved and performed it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> confeſſes the truth, in denying it. This herbe the more it is troden the ſweeter in ſmells, this duſt the more it is ſtamped upon, the more it riſes.</p>
            <p>Hee commends learning, becauſe it ſoftens the mind, and this is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61864:98"/>
effeminating of it, becauſe it reduces to a mediocrity, and that is annihilating of greatneſſe. He alſo granteth, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes education, aimed onely at the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the vertue of fortitude.</p>
            <p>The crowne of Oake, which <hi>Coriolanus</hi> gained in his young yeares gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what plants they would have to grow in the Common-wealth, and in what manner manured.</p>
            <p>But why had the Oake this prerogative? Peradventure, ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> by reaſon of the the Arcadians who honoured it, Or of <hi>Iupiter</hi> who decked himſelfe with it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſturdineſſe, or fruitfulneſſe of the tree. Or peradventure they conſidered the vertue of the Oake, which lying under water doth not corrupt, or ſoften, but growes as hard as ſtone, whereas if part of it ſtand above water in the aire, it rots in a ſhort time; As if they would ſignifie thereby, that in a man of worth and valour, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue doth increaſe, by his being continually plunged in employments; and contrariwiſe it withers and fades away, when any part of him is expoſed to ſenſuality.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who would have the reward of the Oaken crowne to come againe, let them take away <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum.</hi> Let them turne this, into a Golden age: and without producing an Acorne age, they ſhall ſee

the Oaken Crownes ſpring up in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>It is ſo conſonant to reaſon that all crimes ſhould be puniſhed, and all vertues rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it ſerves for an argument to know there is a heaven, and a hell; becauſe that good and evill things being not rewarded and puniſhed by God in this world, ſeeing it is neceſſary they ſhould be rewarded, it argues that of neceſſity there muſt be places in the other world to doe it. He is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a pernicious and irreligious Prince that will imitate God in this particular. He takes away (as much as in him lies) the efficacy of the argument, becauſe he takes away the neceſſity of doing it, ſeeing he hath not another world, to reward or puniſh them in, whom he hath not rewarded nor puniſhed in this world. The happineſſe of worldly government conſiſts in not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any vertue to go unrewarded, nor any offence unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>One of the greateſt diſorders that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of rewards hath produced, making treaſuries unable to undergoe that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, hath bin the (in ſome ſort) obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Princes and Common-wealths to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vertues with an impunity of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
            <p>Unfortunate is that vertuous act, abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that reward, if the recompence muſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61864:99"/>
be, the bearing with offences: if reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be forbearance of puniſhing, either vertue muſt goe without reward, or turne to vice to attaine it.</p>
            <p>No body makes any queſtion, but that rewards and puniſhments are they which beare up States: upon theſe two pillars, did God lay the foundations of the world, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing glory to thoſe who did well, and threatning evill doers, with everlaſting torments; and if this were not ſufficient, if he met with people that beleeved neither heaven nor hell, he ſet a reward and a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment within man himſelfe, imprinting in his very entrailes the law of Nature, which ſhould perſwade him to good, and diſſwade him from evill.</p>
            <p>And becauſe all naturall operations are pleaſing, and contrary ones painefull; man doth in his owne very acting receive his reward, and his puniſhment, from whence proceeds that inward joy which comforts good men, and afflicts bad ones.</p>
            <p>But ſince man through ſinne was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and withdrew from this law, the ſenſes imbued with another contrary one, more ſharpe and vehement, he was forced, to goe and aſſiſt the naturall law, which borne in the ſoule, was oppreſſed by that law which came from without in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to counterpoiſe and overcome it; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61864:99"/>
it with outward puniſhments and rewards, which though they be needfull in all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and all ſorts of people, yet are they not required for all men, of the ſame kind.</p>
            <p>The rewards of inferiour people, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, of Nobles honour, the puniſhment for the one death: for the other infamy. In former times great ſpirits were ſatisfied, with the reward of an Olive, or Oaken garland: a ring, a chaine, a feather, a ſcarfe, and for greater matters with a triumph: and the deniall of a triumph after it was deſerved was a puniſhment ſufficient: and this was done at ſuch times as it was the vulgar ſort of peoples reward to divide the ſpoile amongſt the Souldiours, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered land among the people.</p>
            <p>Such were the proceedings in Common-wealths compoſed of Optimacy, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that of Rome, where it may be eaſily knowne, by thoſe that read the hiſtories of it, that the rewards were ſuch, and the like of puniſhments by ſuch as exami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the ſaid hiſtories: VVhere they ſhall find, that whole Armies have bin tithed, putting each tenth man to death, for faults which have bin committed in them: and never any Nobles put to death for loſing of battells, or ill guiding of their Armies,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61864:100"/>
or any other offence, untill wee come to <hi>Spurius Melus,</hi> whoſe crime was againſt the State: Whereby we muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that either in <hi>Rome</hi> they neglected one fundamentall Pillar of Government, which is puniſhment, in the Nobility or that for them infamy and diſgrace was a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent one.</p>
            <p>The Rewards were altered, when deſire of wealth came in: not becauſe Noble minds altered their object, and giving over the deſire of glory, did wholly caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their own intereſts; but becauſe the object it ſelfe was altered; and yet not changed quite, but onely communicated to another. The Ring, the Chain, the Laurell, the Olive Garland, were not the objects of generous mindes, no more are riches now at this time; but they had the firſt for honour, and theſe laſt for that which they had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For the honour conſiſting not in him that is honoured, but in the honourer; it is not in a mans choyce what to bee honoured with, or to be rewarded more by one thing than by another: he muſt onely look what thing is moſt honoured by common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. Thence growes the ordinary errour of ſubjects, who in applying themſelves, doe not follow their own <hi>genius,</hi> but ambition, which cals men to that, where glory is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted greateſt. But the ſame thing is not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61864:100"/>
in every place, nor in the ſame place at all times, nor the ſamething, in the ſame manner. <hi>Roman</hi> vertues were vices amongſt the <hi>Parthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> Eloquence was firſt contemned, then afterwards honoured: ſometimes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaticall, ſometimes Laconicall, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plaine, ſometimes garniſhed Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was applauded; ſometimes that which pleaſed the eare, ſometimes that which beſt perſwaded the minde: and all this comes to paſſe, becauſe the true object of the principall powers of the ſoule, being wanting in the world (even like a ſicke man, that cannot finde reſt in any place) we alwayes change our place, becauſe we will not deſpaire of finding it. It was the people that placed honour in riches, becauſe the object of want hindering the object of ambition, they turned to honouring of that which might relieve them.</p>
            <p>A right effect of Nature, which not to bee defective, makes that to be moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which is moſt neceſſary: Wherefore it was judged by wiſe and underſtanding men, That the deſire and appetite of food, was more vehement in man, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſion; and therefore if hee had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny objects to turn to, and many paſſions to ſatisfie, he would firſt look upon, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the paſſion of hunger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:61864:101"/>
But becauſe honour is expected from the vulgar, more than from the Nobilitie, (who being emulators, and envious, will rather ſeeke to diſgrace than applaud) and they being corrupt, or neceſſitated, honour him moſt that is wealthieſt: it was needfull to procure to be one of the greateſt among theſe, to bee the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. After applauſe came Traines of followers, from them ſprang factions and diſſentions, and theſe cauſed the ruines of Common-wealths and kingdomes.</p>

            <p>Then Princes in Monarchicall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are participant of this error, the Senate in Common-wealths, and People in all kind of States: and therefore together with the corruption of the common wealth, came the corruption of rewards into Rome, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Romans did ill in not changing the puniſhments with the rewards: They did indeed receive ſome change at the diſcretion of Tyrants, and that was when <hi>Cinna, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Silla, Pompey, Caeſar, Craſſus, Antonie,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> came in, the Axe beginning then to fall upon the moſt eminent and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Citizens heads, to wreake, and vent their hatred, and ſecure their feare, which, if they had born reſpect to civill juſtice onely, and not to their Deſpoticall intereſt, there could not have wanted gentler, and milder meanes, and every way as effectuall to ſave it from contempt. All that imbrue their hands in bloud for hatred, are Tyrants, and all thoſe as doe it for feare, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called Tyrants (the feare being grounded upon reaſon) may very well bee eſteemed unfortunate Princes. The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rewards was then introduced by the want, and corruption of the People, and Policy of the Soveraignes: The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of puniſhments by the Tyranny of Princes, and treachery of the Nobles. It is eaſie where Princes are excellent, and the Nobility faithfull, to continue and preſerve puniſhments, in that perfection as they were, in the primitive times of the Roman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; and this is even the ſame manner as is now uſed in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy

and diſgrace are ſufficient puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Noble mens Politick evill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which concerne the Prince's ſervice; The debarring them the Prince's ſight, Removing them from the Court, leaving them in oblivion, is as much &amp; as efficacious in that moſt happy Country, as baniſhing, impriſoning, and beheading in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who blame this manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the effect, which the example ſhould be, are peradventure deceived. For an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regulare and temerary mind it will not be ſufficient, and for a generous breaſt it needs not.</p>
            <p>But becauſe all nations doe not conforme themſelves in giving the preheminency and ſuperiority of this thing which we call reputation, to one and the ſame thing; Some attributing it to Wealth, ſome to Nobility, many to VViſdome, and ſome to beauty: ſome extolling the great man, and ſome the moſt valiant, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe a little to argue and ſearch out, to which of theſe it is due. And becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many different opinions we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the deciſion from man, we will take it from nature, and bow to that vertue, in which nature hath placed the command.</p>
            <p>Lawyers are of opinion, that there is no naturall ſervitude, and that all men are
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61864:103"/>
borne free. And though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeeme to ſay the contrary, yet he doth not meane to yeeld to any more then a character which ſhall ſhew not what another is, but what he ſhould be; therewith ſetting out; not the act, but the inclination. <hi>Ptolomie</hi> meant the ſame thing in the diviſion of the ſignes, into commanding and obeying ones, and no man will deny ſuch inſtincts, who read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hoſtories, will conſider ſo many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which without any outward violence to force them, or art to perſwade them, have voluntarily ſubmitted themſelves to the command of him, whom they have held in greateſt repute.</p>
            <p>But in aſſigning of that vertue, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is commanding, I will take leave to differ and recede from <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion; for whileſt he ſeekes to ſet down what men ought to command, and who to obey, making (or elſe I erre) an evill diſtinction of men; He doth not reſolve the queſtion well, by ſaying that ſome are borne with much ſtrength, and little underſtanding; others with much underſtanding and little ſtrength, the one kind being fit to ſerve, and the other to command, the firſt ſhall be borne to ſervitude, the laſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>He leaves out one part of men who are borne with both theſe, and another who
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61864:103"/>
have neither of them, and are incapable either of ſerving or commanding.</p>
            <p>He to whom nature hath given onely a great underſtanding, was made but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template and teach, if he were made to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it was onely in a Schoole. He that hath valour onely, whom we call temerary, troubles all the world, and is nothing but violence. To the third, namely to him that hath both, the Scepter, in my opinion is due, and to him indeed, for the moſt part, People have granted it, when it hath bin in their power to give it: as to <hi>Saturne, Iupiter, Hercules, Romulus,,</hi> and ſo many others; The Gentiles ſo highly eſteeming him that hath thoſe two characters of valour and wiſedome (which both goe to the framing of true Fortitude) that where they have found them both united, they have even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored them. I doe indeed find that ſometimes men have alſo ſubmitted themſelves to a man, who hath bin onely of an eminent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as to <hi>Pythagoras, Lyeurgus</hi> and <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Peradventure they are both tyrannicall, one offering (as I may ſay) no leſſe violence with his art, to the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61864:104"/>
ſoule, then the other doth with his force to the bodies. And if we conſider well the dominion which is obtained by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it alwayes brings along with it, one of the attributes of the violent, namely of not being durable. Wherefore thoſe that are ſuch; to keep themſelves long in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, have had their recourſe to art, when the favour of nature hath failed them, feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have had ſome commerce with the Gods. So that in mine opinion we may ſay, that the underſtandingeſt doth command by cunning, the moſt raſh by violence, and he that is endowed with true Fortitude, by nature.</p>
            <p>And indeed nature whoſe chiefe aime is to preſerve the <hi>Species,</hi> inclines man to obey him who may beſt preſerve him: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that hath fortitude is ſuch a one, he ſhall before others be ſet in this naturall ſtate, free from all violence: and men will obey him in whom they ſhall ſee this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſhine more then in others.</p>

               <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> did not ſo much deſire to bee honoured himſelfe, as to be commended to his Mother, he eſteemed of honours, becauſe they cauſed joy in her. But why ſhould others joy increaſe ours, whether it be that of our Parents, and Kindreds, or our friends?</p>

Man is ſo ſet upon the ſatisfying of his paſſions, and the paſſions, are ſo joyned and linked together, and alſo deſirous to be ſatisfied, that the perfectly pleaſing of ones paſſion, or the being content with having pleaſed it, is not ordinarily attained unto, when the reſt are froward and diſtaſted. For ſatisfaction of the ſenſe of taſting, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury meat would be ſufficient.</p>
            <p>But he that will have it perfumed, ſeekes to content the ſmelling alſo. If he deſires colour, handſomneſſe, and ſhape; he ſeeks to have the eye alſo pleaſed therewith; and that the hearing likewiſe may have its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, he will eate his meat where there is playing and ſinging.

            <p>In the ſenſe of feeling, man ſhould be content with ſoftneſſe: but hee will have beauty for the eyes, he deſires perfumes to pleaſe the ſmell, Nobility and vertue to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay his ambition; and to content his iraſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call part, could he not alſo ſatisfie himſelfe with the death of his enemy?

he oftentimes doe it with loſſe and danger) he will vain-gloriouſly have it known that it was he that ſlue him; and the greater his innocency was, the more he rejoyces in his revenge. Theſe examples are ſo cleare, that they put it out of all queſtion, that mans deſire is not content with the ſatisfaction of the paſſions of the body, if he doth likewiſe in ſome ſort partly ſatisfie his ambition. The ſame (as I believe) happens as truly (though not ſo plainly) in the ſatisfying of ambition. Cold and unſavoury ſeeme the advancements to honours and dignities, all increaſes of greatneſſe (let them be of never ſo great moment) ſeem deſpicable, if there be not ſome content likewiſe given to the two chiefe paſſions of the body, Iraſcible, and Concupiſcible.

And though the emulation bee not ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet ſometimes there is as much of it, as there is of love, leſſe diſcovered but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more ſharp: whereupon he did very well, that made it the chiefe of his joyes, that his Father and his mother had ſeen him ride in triumph.</p>
            <p>And it is no marvell, if he did deſire the preſence of the one more than of the other, becauſe in the other wants emulation: And indeed the delight is more perfect, which we receive from the love that belongs to both, than from the emulation which belongs particularly to the Father, it failing (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be by reflection) of any deſire which may produce griefe.</p>
            <p>But how can it bee, that a mans joy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing by his friends rejoycing, his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes ſhould decreaſe by his friends grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at his ſorrowes?

The greater grief (according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doctrine) doth not ſuffer the leſſer to be felt, then it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater, or of another nature: greater onely would not have been ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract teares, it would rather have hindered the eyes from weeping: it was of another nature, namely, a mixture of joy and griefe: the firſt with its heat being able to make and open that paſſage which the laſt with its cold had cloſed up to teares.</p>
            <p>None that loves, but if he love vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſomtimes when he raves and dotes moſt, will conſider his friend in the middeſt of his troubles and dangers, with ſome kinde of pleaſure; whereby he beleeves to ſhew and manifeſt the ſincerity of his affection, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by taking him out of his afflictions, or bearing him company in his miſeries. If this deſire being but onely ſpeculated, and contemplated, doth pleaſe one, what will it doe when it is put in practice? It will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a griefe full of delight, which rather cauſes a kinde ſweetned tenderneſſe, than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction or ſorrow of the heart, from which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61864:107"/>
we muſt confeſſe it drawes teares, but very pleaſing ones. Hence proceeds, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he that really falls into troubles and misfortunes, beholds with dry eyes, others who participate thereof onely through af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, powre out Oceans of teares. There being wanting in him that part of pleaſure which opens the cataracts of tears, kept in and ſealed up, through the ſharpneſs of griefe: whereas the other, becauſe the griefe is not properly his owne, but onely bred in him through his friends affliction, being as it were produced by imitation, hath alſo a kinde of delight almoſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually mixed with it.</p>
            <p>An excellent Actor, who on ſtage relates ſome Tragick Scene, feeles a kinde of griefe in himſelfe; and if he doth not, he doth not exquiſitely act his part; and if he doth, who can deny, but that it is with a moſt ſweet and pleaſing grief, which hath its originall from a moſt pleaſant imitation.</p>
            <p>All theſe wayes as being accidentall, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure increaſe not the ſubſtance of the joy: they may peradventure dilate it, but not ſink, nor make it grow deep, unleſſe it be when our friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> joy ſurpaſſes ours, either by the ſtrongneſs of his apprehending it, or the faintneſſe of his temperament; for then it works in us, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which it hath atttained unto. What
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61864:107"/>
true-hearted man can ſee a friend in his t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oubles grieve more than himſelfe, but it muſt increaſe and augment his griefe; and will rather ſeek to comfort his friend, than be comforted by him: griefe working in him no more as a ſigne, but as a thing reall; and becauſe greater, therefore increaſing. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> therefore had reaſon to deſire, that his famous actions ſhould be related to his mother, any thing that increaſed her joy, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him much ſatisfaction; becauſe the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine temperament being more apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive affections, he could perceive it greater in her than in himſelfe; and meaſuring the greatneſſe of the action, by the degrees of the content which it produced, he found the action greater in his mothers rejoycing, than in his own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coriolanus</hi> deſires the Conſulſhip of the people, and when he ſues for it, he puts off his Robe, the cuſtome of thoſe times was ſuch. Whether it was (ſaith <hi>Plutarch)</hi> to ſhew his ſcarres, and cauſe his valour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them, or to ſhew himſelfe ſubmiſſe, and ſo perſwade them with a ſeaſonable hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, becauſe in thoſe dayes vertues were more prevalent with the people than wealth.</p>
            <p>I cannot be perſwaded this ſhould be the intent of this cuſtome. The ſcarres might have been ſhewen without putting off his
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61864:108"/>
his Robe, or the putting it off would not have ſufficed. A ſuppliant humility is good with a mans equals, not with his inferiors, in whom it breeds a kinde of loathing, to ſee a great man, who ſhould command them abaſe himſelfe ſo much.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes that a man, as if he did imprint thoſe qualities which are in himſelfe, in his garment, when he thinkes they might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to him, hee puts it on, and when he beleeves they will doe him hurt, he puts it off. Thoſe Fathers which remained in <hi>Rome,</hi> when it became a prey to the <hi>Gaules,</hi> did put on their Senatoriall habits, which for a while bridled the <hi>Gauls</hi> inſolency. That <hi>Fabius,</hi> who paſſed untouched amongſt the enemies, puts on his Prieſtly habit, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope put on his Pontifical ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and appeaſes the wrath of the barbarous Tyrant. Contrariwiſe, <hi>Davids</hi> childe falls ſick, he rents and layes away his garments. Job feels his ſorrowes increaſing, and puts them off. Neither is that enough in great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, many proceed further, pulling off their haire, and even tearing their fleſh: every thing then repreſents it ſelf to them full of that quality which doth at that time tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them. And they would make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beleeve, that they could diminiſh it by pulling off their garments, throwing away their haire, and powring out their blood, as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61864:108"/>
if together with them they did put off, throw away, and powre forth part of the tormenting griefe which afflicts them.</p>
            <p>The Senatoriall dignity was hatefull to the people, becauſe they could not deveſt themſelves of the degree, they put off the Robe, as if in that lay the whole hatred, if not part of it. For the ſhewing a ſudden change from a Commander to a ſuppliant, from a man clothed in Robes to a deveſted one, did much availe to put off hatred, and gain compaſſion. A Cataſtrophe (though falſe) did violently incline the mindes to a kinde of tenderneſſe; as in a Tragedy we ſee ſometimes circumſtances almoſt forcibly draw teares from the hearers eyes, though they know all is but fained and fabulous. I have ſeen the King my Maſter on that day we celebrate the commemoration of the waſhing of the Apoſtles feet, when he hath laid away his Cloke and Rapier, to fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himſelfe for ſo pious a myſtery, draw abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tears from the beholders eyes. The putting off the Robe did abate a great deale of the peoples hatred; and that which the laying away of the Robe had not done, the Cataſtrophe altered. And becauſe hee that hath a fellow-feeling, deſireth alſo to aſſiſt, and the compaſſion being greateſt where the greateſt change is, and the greateſt change being in him that deſerves moſt: the people
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61864:109"/>
deſired to raiſe him that was of greateſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and exalt him to the Conſular dignity. They had aſſuredly done it in our caſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolved to beſtow it upon <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> if he appearing the next day with a great train of Senators at his heeles, had not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his firſt ſhew of humility, by this ſecond of pride, taking away the compaſſion, and giving way for them to kindle their anger a new, and therewith their hatred, which changed thoſe tender thoughts of raiſing him, into as many ſharpe inclinations to oppreſſe him.</p>
            <p>Vertue can only be judged of naked: all kinds of accoutrements deforme it, it is an ornament to all things, and to itſelfe both ornament and ſubſtance. He that will not loath her, let him behold her unarrayed; and he that will judge of her, let him view her naked. The Trojan Shepheard had not bin deceived, had he beheld the three God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes naked: He had give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſentence on Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las ſide, had not her helmet, ſpeare, ſhield, and the reſt of her armour puzled him.</p>
            <p>Vertue is both good and faire. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and beauty are the objects through which, will, ſatisfaction, and love paſſe to the underſtanding. How can you conceive vertue to be otherwiſe but faire and good if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ou conſider it as vertue: and in what other ſhape can you conſider it, if it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61864:109"/>
naked unto you. Hate, Rage and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy cannot touch it, they are mothes which ſtick onely on the garments, wormes that inhabit putrifaction onely; ſtrip her of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes, wealth, and all other vaine habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if thou wilt have her be ſecure, and enamourthee. This vertue which being once known, violently ſtirres up love, takes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in mens hearts (ſometimes in the Great ones, ſometimes in the Peoples) by very different wayes. Some would have it remaine within the ſpheare of mediocrity, ſome would raiſe it up to the concave of the Moone. It is not alwayes envy which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires it low, nor love that continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to have it exalted. Sometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, becauſe a Great one would come into a ſtrict league of friendſhip with it, and the People would by its means enjoy an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſervitude. He that is poſſeſſed of ſuch a noble gemme may communicate it to ſome by a relation of friend to friend; to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Maſter, to Servant. The one to be perfect requires equality; the other to bee pleaſing, a kind of diſtance. The greater the Maſter is, the more honorable is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: and the more cordiall the friend is, the greater equality is between them. But the connexion which the People hath with a perſon of eminent vertue, is like a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his Lord, and he is deſirous to exalt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61864:110"/>
him. But the great ones is as one friends to another, and he doth not deſire to have him advanced. <hi>Aristotle</hi> though he makes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality too neceſſary in friendſhip; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attributing it to ſuperabundancy, ſometimes to want, as if he diſcovered the truth out of its due diſtance, and with a hindred and obſtructed meanes; ſeemes to contradict himſelfe, and pretend it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a great equality.</p>
            <p>He either was or would be deceived, he needed to have bin neither, if he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that both theſe cauſes united, did produce a moſt ſtrict league of friendſhip. Superabundancy, and want, if one of them alone be divided into two ſubjects, brings forth either ſlavery, or its image. The poor, is the rich mans ſlave, and the Scholar the Maſters, and if he be not, he is like ſome ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Of two ſuperabundancies and two wants, there is framed an almoſt indiſſoluble bond of friendſhip. The People that find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves nothing but defect, goe towards vertue, and deſire to have it made great, becauſe they will ſerve it. The great one who with the defect of vertue, hath ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundancy of honour and wealth, would find him out who hath ſuperabundance of what he wants, with defect of his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundance, and deſires to have him low,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61864:110"/>
becauſe he would make him his friend. And if this latter comes alſo to be exalted to honours and wealth, the other loſes his ſuperabundancy, and remaines with deefct onely: He hath nothing whereon to found the harmonious equality which produces friendſhip; and becauſe he abhorres the character of being a ſervant, he hates that vertue exalted, which he venerated when it was humble. If there be a great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the world, it conſiſts in doing a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and if there be any greater, it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting it.</p>
            <p>Therefore that muſt needs be exceeding great which is produced by the harmonious interweaving, of abundance, and defect, where the benefit is at the ſame time done and requited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls <hi>Coriolanus</hi> proud and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient; I agree to it. He attributes the cauſe of it to want of ſtudy, I diſſent from it: Becauſe learning doth not onely not hinder theſe paſſions, but according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſaying, produces Pride, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Solomons,</hi> Impatience; I attribute it to his being born in the Roman Common-wealth, which more deſirous to increaſe then to preſerve itſelfe as it was made more of valour, eſteeme in its Cittizens thereof Patience. Wherefore at the laſt keeping one ſtill alive, it fell for want of the other.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61864:111"/>
True it is, that as it is not againſt the law of Patience, that one upon occaſion, when there is need, ſhould violently oppoſe one that operates ill, no more is it of the eſſence of valour, to repaire all dammages, and revenge all offences. But the Romans cared not for theſe qualifications.</p>
            <p>That Valour was more uſefull to them, which operated, then that which ſuffered. And becauſe for that part of valour, which lookes after revenge, wrath was very uſefull, and very hurtfull to that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ſuffering; it is not to be wondred, that ſome of them had the vice of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence coupled with the vertue of fortitude. <hi>Seneca</hi> would not admit this doctrine of wrath: he would have it rooted out, as if our nature were ſo perfect, that it wanted no inſtigation, to make it operate well, nor no curbe to keep it from working evill.</p>
            <p>He that will ſee how man ought to make uſe of wrath, which we alſo call choler, let him conſider what uſe nature makes of that choler which is called <hi>Bilis.</hi> I meddle not with that part which is called <hi>Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> which ſubtilizes the bloud, that it may the eaſilier nouriſh the parts, which feeds the heart, and the muſculous fleſh, which tempers the cold of the Pituitous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, with Melancholy. I will ſpeake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Excrementall <hi>Bilis;</hi> There is one
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61864:111"/>
naturall, and another without nature, or <hi>extra naturam:</hi> One reſerved in the Gall bagge, that is to clenſe and <hi>abſterge</hi> the pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous humors together with the ordures; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe like a medicament it inſtigates, and provokes the expulſive vertue, to ſend forth that which is not to be retained, and which being retained would kill. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther breeds Dyſenteries, Diareas, Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, Frenzies, perfect Tertians, and an infinite of ſuch diſeaſes: And even juſt ſo it is with wrath. One kind of wrath is a paſſion which like that unbridled <hi>Bilis</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on furiouſly, brings one to a precipice: The other regulated by the underſtanding, and ſet apart for ſome occaſion, ſerves to inſtigate the vertue of valour: and as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures excrementall <hi>Bilis</hi> is neceſſary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the excrements; which nature would not move to doe if it were not inſtigated; ſo likewiſe this wrath is neceſſary for man to drive that away from him which the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath concocted, and judged fit to be driven out.</p>
            <p>But nature doth not make uſe of the <hi>Bilis</hi> onely to expell excrements onely, but alſo of the ſerous matter to diſtribute the bloud; of melancholy to excite the appetite, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the food, and ſuſtaine the body; Of the ſharp and ſerous humour to mixe with the ſeed to provoke to generation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61864:112"/>
the kind. Although that ſerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour bee that which cauſeth Hydropſie, though the <hi>Atra Bilis</hi> produces Quartanes, Cancers, Hypocondries, Rage and Madneſs; though that from the ſharp ſubtile humour, the greateſt part of the Cutancall diſeaſes have their beginning: So the minde like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe makes uſe of Wrath for Fortitude: of Ambition for Magnanimity; and yet the one produces raſhneſſe, the other pride. That ſtraitneſſe of minde which cauſes avarice, being dilated, makes up parſimony: From that largeneſſe of breaſt, from which ſprings Prodigality, if it bee but a little reſtrained, there proceeds liberality. Finally, the good or hurt that theſe humours of the body, and paſſions of the minde doe produce, proceeds from their being regulated or not regulated; the humours by Nature, and the paſſions by Reaſon. From the making uſe of the ſame humour, both for vertue and for vice, though in a divers manner, comes, that ignorance is oftentimes deceived, and malice confounds vice and vertue, calling prodigality, libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; raſhneſſe, fortitude; and pride, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity.</p>
            <p>It is worthy conſideration, and yet not eaſie to know, why Nature hath made choice of evill humours to make uſe of, to exerciſe the beſt and principall parts of the body: when as it might have diſpoſed the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61864:112"/>
generative vertue, the expulſive, the reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the appetitive, and the diſtributive, in ſuch manner, that they might have operated without having need of ſpurre or inſtigation. And if they had need of any, why did give it them of ſuch imperfect matter? This knot which by a Gentile is indiſſoluble, may be reſolved by a mean underſtanding, ſo that it be Chriſtian, when it ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>Natura Naturans,</hi> did not create man in ſuch a faſhion. There was no ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour reſident in him, every thing was good; all parts obeyed, without any reſiſtance; all vertues operated without any inſtigation. It was <hi>Adam</hi> and not Nature that placed good and evlll in the ſame ſubject; and if it were Nature, it was <hi>Natura Naturata,</hi> corrupted by him who diſobeying his Creators com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, broke the order of obedience, and put every thing in confuſion. The evill of the <hi>Bilis,</hi> of melancholy, and other humors, proceeds from <hi>Adams</hi> ſin &amp; retaines the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of diſobedience. But if vanity made <hi>Seneca</hi> contrary to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> truth did agree them together again. He confirmes what I have ſaid, hee ſaith, It is good to make uſe of wrath as a ſervant, and that it is naught to be ſubject to it, as to a Lady and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>Patience co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts not in the not feeling of pain, ſeldome in doing as if one felt it not, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61864:113"/>
in feeling it as it ought to be felt. There is no ſuch thing as inſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſibility of pain: if there be it is not a ſtrongneſs of heart but a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the minde. He that pretends to have ſuch an inſenſibility, deceives, becauſe hee hath it not; and he that hath it, deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, becauſe he raves, and ſo doth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer too, being ſick with ambition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though not of a Fever. It is bad in proſperity but in adverſity monſtrous: in the one we muſt uſe violence to our ſelves to keep it away, &amp; in the other we muſt ſorce it to come. It is contrary to the ambitious humor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a time of miſery is fitting for it.</p>
            <p>Where that which ſhould cure, hurts, it is a ſigne that the diſeaſe is long, or mortall. Where the diſeaſe comes out of its due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon either the humor is malignant, or aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The comfort of the afflicted is onely to be born with, the ambitious man is onely hated. Inſenſibility is a vaine oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it is not a hurtfull madneſſe, which makes the evill worſe inſtead of remedying it. His aim that offends is ordinarily to give diſtaſt and to cauſe griefe; which untill he hath attained to, he cannot be quiet: and to overcome a feigned <hi>non-feelingneſſe</hi> of griefe, attempts a greater miſchiefe. The operation of Vertue ought to bee long, and ſlow, to make a difference between a habit and a violent paſſion. Singularity doth not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61864:113"/>
become it; for either it makes it ambitious, and it changes full of, or affectation, and it growes faint and weak. <hi>Diogenes</hi> comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Plato's</hi> houſe, he wonders that it is not a Tub: he ſees his Bed, and is ſcandalized and offended, becauſe it is ſoft: and when he was to goe by it, not ſatisfied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning it, in a fierce, violent, and proud rage, treads and ſtamps upon it. The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Legions cry up <hi>Vitellius</hi> for Emperour, they ſee him neceſſitous of money; with the ſame heat and violence as they had from a private man raiſed him to be a Prince, they will alſo of poore make him rich, every one ſtrives to bring him gold and ſilver, and whatſoever he hath, that is pretious. The moſt wretched, that had nothing in his poſſeſſion for the preſent to give, gave him whatſoever he had due to him. <hi>Tacitus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the action, and to finde out the form, he goes not to the matter, which is capable of contrary formes, he goes in queſt of the Motor; and after he hath called it ſometimes Inclination ſometimes Violence, at laſt to ſhew how adverſe he is from eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it to be Liberality, he breakes out, and calls it by the name of Avarice.</p>
            <p>The female Sex, though endowed with a weak heart and very mean underſtanding, is alſo ſubject to impatience, as well as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valiant man: I would ſay it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61864:114"/>
the delicateneſs of the inſtruments that are ſubſervient to the underſtanding, are likewiſe common to them with man, the moiſtnes of the brain, and the ſoftnes of the fleſh: were it not that thoſe inſtruments are rather unſinewed and weak, than delicate: the moiſtneſſe rather fluid than viſcous: the ſoftneſſe rather watry than aereall. It will be peradventure more warrantable, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne the cauſe of it to pride, and wrath, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which produce impatiency, and to which that Sex is very prone, And by meanes of the one, they communicate with men of great wit; by the other, with ſuch as have a great heart. But if wrath be ſo predominant in women. how come they to want valour? Say that it is becauſe their choler proceeds from a pallid <hi>Bilis,</hi> which abounds in that Sex, and being ſerous, and fluid, it yeelds no firmneſſe nor conſiſtency. And likewiſe that their ſpirits are moveable, and few; becauſe moveable, they run ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the heart, and quickly kindle the fire; becauſe they are few, they cannot feed nor maintain it, and it goes quickly out. From hence doth female inſtability take its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, thoſe unquiet ſpirits letting goe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently that which they have received, and being but few, they know not how to retain it. This may alſo be a reaſon why they doe not hit upon the truth, unleſſe it be on a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61864:114"/>
ſudden. They ſend thoſe ſpirits ſuddenly to the brain; and if they be capable of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the truth, they doe it in that very inſtant: and if not, failing of new ſpirits, they want meanes to attempt a ſtronger o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and ſo they doe not finde it: and if they have found it, yet they want ſpirits to diſcuſſe it, and ſo they loſe it. Their braine either doth not reach to the truth, or it doth not ſtay and fix there. Many men alſo tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ſuch a defect, after they have found the truth, if they goe about to bolt land ſift it out carefully, doe loſe it: they have as many ſpirits as will reach to it, and not enough to follow and proſecute it. A moſt acute and learned Author gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon; Truth, ſaith he, is a moſt bright light, it ſuffers it ſelfe to be looked upon, but not to be examined. He that looks upon the Sunne, ſees it not at the firſt ſight; but if he ſixes his lookes upon it, he loſes both Sunne and ſight. This reaſon is more faire than ſound, and is averred by an example more beautifull than fit. The thing which is too ſenſible, doth not appay the ſenſes, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them: their object is a mean, and too great a one is an enemy to them. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding runs towards the greateſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, it doth not ſtand upon the mean one: neither doth any other truth limit it, than that which is unlimitted. The diſtance
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61864:115"/>
which is between the materiall and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall, takes away the proportion: to frame the example. The great ſenſible ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken poſſeſſion of a ſenſe, makes the knowledge of a leſſer impoſſible for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſubſtance.

This caſe was divulged in <hi>Rome.:</hi> There was neither Plebeian, nor Patrician that blamed him. For his teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity he had deſerved death; for his love he was rewarded: they all hope hee will (being inſtructed) learn to doe that through the direction of vertue, which he had done by violence of Nature, and as much for his Countrey, as he had for his father. Where a man erres through valour and love, the matter deſerves correction rather than puniſhment; and he that did it, deſerves a reward rather than a penalty. <hi>Moſes</hi> with this Character, full of divine zeale, kills an Egyptian, <hi>Peter</hi> cuts off <hi>Malchus</hi> his eare. The one is made the head of the old Law, conductor of the children of Iſrael and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> God: the other a head of the new law, a Paſtor and head of the Church. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> his valour was grounded upon pride: for it could not be ſaid it was grounded upon affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his countrey, coming againſt it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and putting it into ſuch ſtraits, that it was very neare loſt.</p>

There are ſome defects in young men, which (I was going to ſay) are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, I will ſay, compatible; and ſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues (I will not ſay blame-worthy) yet are not to be deſired. Where the action is not good becauſe it is ſuperabundant: and the error hath a kinde of conformity with the years, time doth help, and it hurts where it is inconformable: and the ſin is more in the quality than the quantity: more in the form than the matter. A te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petate liver in youth, is good for one to live healthfull, to live long it is better to have it exceed in heat. It cools continually, &amp; according as the man grows in years, it loſes his ſuperfluous heat, ſo that as the man grows old, it grows temperate. The hurtfulnes of the exceſs is in the ſtrength of age, which is able to reſiſt it, &amp; doth not kil. The profit of its temperatneſſe is, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath moſt need of help, and ſuſtains and aſſiſts it. But if the exceſſe were in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the heat, and in thoſe yeares that it ſhould be favourable, it ſhould ſhew it ſelfe nipping, whereas the one, becauſe it alwayes decreaſes with age, ought to bee left to grow old; the other, becauſe it alwayes increaſes, muſt be rooted up: So thoſe young men, who erre through quantity of heat, ſhould grow old in the Citie, and thoſe extirpated, who p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ecipitate by reaſon of their evill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. Of the firſt quality was <hi>Manlius Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatus,</hi>

and they reward him; of the ſecond was the ſon of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and they kill him. If a young man of a fiery nature, be raſh, the firecools, and before the time of operating comes, is reduced to a degree that he may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate well; but if he be prudent, cold being required for ſuch an effect, and the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cooling with the increaſe of yeares, it may be feared, that before he arrives to the time in which he ſhould make uſe of its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he wil degenerate into vice; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in one caſe the raſh man comes to attaine true fortitude, in the other the valiant man becomes puſillanimous. <hi>Quintilian</hi> would have the Orator in his young age, rather bold than fearfull: The latter would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cold, whereas the firſt yeares favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, will make him moderate. Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ought to overcome judgment, when it is time to learn; but when it is time to operate, it ought to be ſubdued. It will be more eaſie for Art to coole hardineſſe, than to heat judgment, becauſe Nature is favourable to the one, and contrary to the other. All that which is violent, is difficult; yet with a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between that which is againſt, and that which is conformable to Nature. One may eaſilier throw a ſtone toward the the Center than the Circumference: for it is eaſier to follow than to oppoſe an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

If patience meet with greatneſs, or vigour of minde, it raiſeth to that degree of glory to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which many with an unbridled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferency (but in vain) directing themſelvs, find nothing but precipices. Suffering beſt befits him that can eaſilieſt revenge himſelf, and gives moſt glory, where it finds greateſt reputation. Where feare cannot be aſcribed to baſeneſs of heart, nor the not knowing, to dulneſs of brain; his contempt muſt be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led magnanimity, and his diſſimulation muſt be termed prudency. The leaſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not eaſieſt to be endured, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they moſt conceale the revenge, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſting more ſharply, or becauſe they are more frequently met with. Theſe are they which ruine Princes, &amp; overthrow Monarchies: they grow infallibly, and yet inſenſibly, and greatneſs coming in, gives no way to forbearance of revenge, without loſſe of reputation. There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene an offence being great at firſt, and its becoming ſuch. One findes man cold, and free, the other heated and engaged: neither can hee ſeem to grow careleſſe of it, when it is grown up, that did not contemne it when it was but ſmall. And having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy loſt the name of prudent, by proſecuting of it to that time, he wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

is more mortall than that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun ſo. The Prince which wil not bear with his ſubjects, endangers the changing his name of Prince, into Tyrant: and he that will not beare with ſtrangers, endangers his kingdom to become a private man. A prince his own patience is not ſufficient for the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of his kingdome, if his officers alſo be not endued with it, in whom it being equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, it is farre more difficult: A man may eaſily ſuffer in his own intereſts, who is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient in his Lords. For the one, he hopes to reap glory and profit through his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo beares. In the other, to gaine it from revenge and ſo he puts forward. Hee that offends the Prince before his Officer, offends both the Prince and his Officer, whereby obliging him to two patiences, hee makes the ſufferance almoſt intollerable. Theſe imagine that the zeale of their maſters reputation moves them to a reſentment, and oftentimes it is their own arrogancy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they embroyle Princes, obliging them to warres, into which they are engaged more by others than their own impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and this happens ofteneſt, where the States and Dominions are moſt remote. That remoteneſſe which is moſt favourable to the Prince for his ſuffering, is contrary to the Officers. One doth not ſee the injuries, the other, the Prince.</p>

When <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> blames the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians for attributing every thing to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of fortitude, ſaid, that one vertue was not ſufficient: and if one alone were to be choſen, Fortitude was not it. He named not that, to which he attributed the chiefe honour, if he had named it, in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it had bin patience, becauſe virtually it containes all other vertues in it, as the ſeed doth both roote, fruit, and ſtemme. If morall vertues are ordained to good, in as much as they keep within the bounds of reaſon againſt the violence of paſſions, and when theſe doe joyne with any vice, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the onely guide of them, who can deny it to hold the firſt and ſupreame place amongſt them?</p>
            <p>As the Phyſician cures the diſeaſes of the body, ſo patience corrects the defects of the ſoule. They both worke by removing the obſtacles. I confeſſe more like inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, then efficient cauſes. But if the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an bee ſaid to occaſion health, though it be not he, but nature; Patience ſhall likewiſe be called the productrix of all vertues.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> his impatience (for we muſt call him impatient, if we will not attribute the name of baſe to the Senate) put him in danger of his life; and though his great vertue, reverenced by the People, was ſufficient to free him from death, yet
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61864:118"/>
by reaſon that was feared alſo, it was not able to keepe him from baniſhment. One of the greateſt and ordinarieſt errors, that croſſes the good direction of Politick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, is that Princes and common-wealths either know not how, or through maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will not, in time make uſe of that valour, which fortune hath abundantly beſtowed upon ſome ſubject of theirs. Dominions are increaſed by the hand and meanes of a ſubject which is advantagiouſly valorous and fortunate.</p>
            <p>Whoſe valour by bringing to paſſe the moſt difficulteſt enterpriſes, findes no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle able to reſiſt it, all that he ſees, he conquers: Whoſe fortune meets with no chance, but it proves favourable to him, all what he does not ſee is likewiſe aſſiſting to him. Such a man is now and then borne in an eſtate of ſo low a degree, and himſelfe ſo poore, that without ever do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, or at leaſt equall, or partly worthy, his fortune and valour; he dies inglorious, but ſeldome without leaving at leaſt ſome little modell, whereby others may as with proſpective glaſſe ſee what a Coloſſus they have neglected to build, through want of matter.</p>
            <p>That character which in a great ſtatue attracts even the dimmeſt eyes to behold it, in a little one, is not ſeene many times
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61864:119"/>
by the moſt perſpicuous ſight. Sometimes alſo this man is borne in ſome conſpicuous place, and of ſuch a fortune, that at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt flaſhing of his actions, he makes that beame ſhines out which lies incloſed in his breaſt. But thoſe which rule King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, or governe Common-wealths, though they have good intentions, yet look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more upon the age then the fortune of the man, advancing him by degrees, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome admit him to great affaires, where he might have performed ſome high and ſpecially ſervices, till it is too late, and hee growen old, after he hath tired his fortune in actions of no moment, and his declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing age hath made him good for little. To linger out fortune, of a great ſubject is a great error, yet not worthy of any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere puniſhment. Ignorance herein may be excuſed, Careleſſeneſſe endured, but hee that hinders it through envy, hatred and malice, calls Gods wrath upon him; and ſometimes ſees it viſibly come. Loſing himſelfe for want of him, whom he hath loſt. Or to prevent his owne ruine, bowing to him whom he hath deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>Such a man is happy, and by him his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, if he be borne a Prince. Moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if in ſuch a time as enterpriſes are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſet on foot, and he able to follow them. Or that obſtacles be removed in ſuch ſort
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61864:119"/>
that they may not oblige him, to tire his fortune upon them before he goes about them. If <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth had found the Kingdome of France, entire, ſlouriſhing, peaceable within, and at wars abroad; as he found it divided, deſtroyed, unquiet, plunged in civill wars, what could he not have done with ſo much fortune and valour? he did much indeed, yet did he not a whit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his dominions: He waſted himſelfe in gayning his owne, and when he begun to caſt his mind upon other mens, both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and time failed him.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Guſtavus</hi> King of Sweed could at the very firſt have employed all his fortune and power in Germany, and had not bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the Muſcoviters &amp; Poliſh wars, I know not who could have hindred or croſſed him from attaining to his vaſt and unlimited deſires. If <hi>Alexander</hi> had bin to begin the wars of Greece, &amp; not found them, almoſt finiſhed by his father, he had never come to be <hi>the Great,</hi> becauſe he would not have had time to ſettle ſo great a Monarchy. By this meanes thoſe King domes do much increaſe which ſucceſſively meet with many warlike, valorous, &amp; fortunate ſubjects, and by this meanes grew up the Turkiſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Aſſiſting of confederates, is a great aide to the gaining of conqueſts, the violence of the enemies fortune broken upon them,

            <p>Unhappy ſhall this our ſubject be, though irradiated with ſo many benigne influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the heavens, if he chance to be borne under a Tyrant. He hinders him, expells him, kills him.</p>

The Tyrant cannot thinke himſelfe Lord, whileſt he ſees one before his eyes that ſhould be ſo; and is ſo indeed by right, and nature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Tyrant is ſo but onely by fortune. Indeed he is happy if he be borne under a Prince that hath his heart free; he runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his familiarity, as the ſtone goes to the center; The Prince receives him into it, as the defect doth ſuperabundancy; both he, the Prince, and the ſtate become happy.

            <p>In free and ſound Common-wealths it is a happineſſe for a man to be borne fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and valiant, but not in corrupt ones; Envy, and Malice which were never root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

out of the Common-wealths of Greece, and particularly out of the Athenian, would not ſuffer it to come to that degree of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to which the ſcituation of the City, and valour of the Citizens did ſeeme to promiſe to raiſe it.</p>
            <p>The Oſtraciſme was the ſtone at which they ſtumbled. It perſecuted the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and to doe it with greater prejudice, whereas (if ſo be they feared ſuch a mans fortune) they ſhould have hindered and reſtrained it, they did not, but ſet it at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by baniſhing them, not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving themſelves of ſo great an advantage, but alſo, and that for the moſt part giving it to their enemies; as if they had deſpiſed that fortune, and valour, when it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, which had affrighted them when it was on their ſide.</p>
            <p>This peſtiferous worme came not into the Roman Senators mindes, in a long time; and becauſe it was a worme, it crept in with the corruption of the Common-wealth, wherefore finding it already great, it did not hinder the increaſe, but the laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſſe of it.</p>
            <p>It is true that it quickly tooke roote in the Tribunes, but becauſe the People was free, they were fearefull to deceiue them; to the end that raging, and ignorant they ſhould without being envious or malicious, worke

according to their envy and malice. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the rage was quickly appeaſed, and gave way, that the light of truth, might of its owne accord manifeſt it ſelfe, or that the Senates dexterity ſhould diſcover it, though it occaſioned no ſmall dammage, and that more then once, yet it came not to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as it would have done, if it had bin the Peoples ſo properly, as it was onely by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation.</p>

was ſeen adhere to the Dukes of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and <hi>Humene,</hi> if they had not ſought to make it obedient to their own particular deſires.</p>
            <p>Many have erred, becauſe they have not in time known this fortune in their owne Citizens, to make uſe of it: and many alſo becauſe they have not perceived it in their enemies, to defend themſelves againſt it.

            <p>When they ſhould have followed the current of it, to keep it with them, they have oppoſed it to overthrow it. <hi>Hannibals</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune came in its prime with him into Italy: like a fierce torrent it overthrew whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever withſtood it. The Romanes ſhockt with it foure times, and it ſtill increaſed: if they had perſiſted, they had bin loſt. They happened at laſt to put the managing of Martiall affaires into the hands of <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> who thinking patience and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection more available in warre then celerity and fury: not a purpoſe, but by chance, not knowing what he did, whileſt he thought by military art to tire out the Souldiers valour, he did weare out the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals fortune with a Politick document: I ſay by chance, becauſe time, and occaſion
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61864:122"/>
being changed, he rather obſtinate then conſtant, would ſtill perſiſt in his firſt way of proceeding, did Prognoſticate that the ruine of Rome would proceed from thoſe things, from which its greateſt increaſes had her beginning.</p>
            <p>He knew not that fortune there begun in <hi>Scipio,</hi> where it ended in <hi>Hannibal;</hi> and that it was time now to ſhock with that, which hee had long given way to, and to put that fortune forward, which he meant to delay. <hi>Hannibal</hi> knew it, and did what he could to avoid the triall, to not ſhock againſt a budding and vigorous fortune, with his old, withered, and decayed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
            <p>The greateſt conqueſts that ever the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes had, were in the beginnings of their good fortune, while it was tender, and no way obſtructed. The Carthaginians like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe availing themſelves of <hi>Hannibals</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had notably advanced themſelves. It gave them ſo much time, that had they not met with ſuch an exceſſive power as they did, which was able to receive ſo many overthrowes, without quite loſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and overcome after ſo many loſſes firſt wearying out <hi>Hannibals</hi> fortune, and then overthrowing it; they had doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore <hi>Alexanders</hi> fortune was much to be admired, which being to laſt but a ſhort time, happened to encounter with a Monarch would violently oppoſe it, and came to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with it, not knowing how to give it way, to tire it, and weary it out with delayes.</p>

               <hi>Coriolanus</hi> goes to <hi>Tullus,</hi> the head of the <hi>Volſci,</hi> relates his misfortunes to him, tells him what affronts had been offered him, exaggerates the longing deſire of revenging them, deſires aſſiſtance, with promiſe of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. <hi>Tullus</hi> joyfully entertaines him, put into hopes, doth aſſiſt him; mollified, gives him the command of the Army, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, commits the whole managing of the buſineſſe to him.</p>
            <p>No ſooner doth an object preſent it ſelfe to a mans eyes, by whoſe valour hee thinkes to free himſelfe from any trouble, or obtaine any great benefit, but preſently he will give him whatſoever he can: and whatſoever he is not able at the preſent to give him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes more largely, than if hee had already by his meanes avoided that danger which he ſeared, or obtained that benefit which he deſired; becauſe that a paſt evill loſeth its terribleneſſe, and a benefit already gotten its delightfulneſſe. He values nothing he hath, to avoid that he would not ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him, or to obtain that which he would
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61864:123"/>
have. He imagines he ſhall have all things, if he hath avoided the one, or gained the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo he doth evill for the preſent, through deceitfull hope of the future. And unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately manages what he hath in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through an erroneous opinion of what he deſires. Sometimes a man ſhall finde himſelfe neceſſitated to ſuppreſſe and bring down one, who had formerly done him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in oppreſſing of his enemy, or emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: when he raiſed him, he had no thought of any thing but onely of his deſire. What he gave him, he weighed not but with the ſcale of paſſion. Even as a Phyſician that oppoſeth ſo much heat to a cold diſeaſe, as may be ſufficient to drive the diſeaſe away, neither conſidering nature, whether it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſtrong, nor yet the ſeaſon whether it be hot or cold, muſt with in a little while to controll and oppoſe that heat which hee himſelfe hath cauſed: So hee that raiſeth a man as much as he thinkes will be ſufficient to oppreſſe his enemy, making no reckoning of his worth, if it be great, or of the peoples favour, if he chance to prove fortunate, will quickly become his <hi>emulator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and hath no more mind to give, there proceeds a wearineſſe and loathing. If the other hath taken more than was given him, there is feare in him; if the people have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him, there is envy: So that a man is obliged either to leave that which hee hath received, and ſo depart; or if he ſtay, to take that which was not given him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> who could not attain to that as he wanted, ſhould have forſaken that which he had received; and rather abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe, leave a kind of admiration of him to ſurvive, than abiding there, expoſe himſelfe to envy, which to ſtrangers is the way to precipice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> received too much from <hi>Nero;</hi> he found his error too late, and bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe too late of retiring and leaving him. To conceale the feare of his Diſciples bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſſe, hath a recourſe to Philoſophy, and makes the cauſe of it to be his modeſty; but <hi>Nero,</hi> to hide his cruelty and avarice, rejects his liberality, and under a pretence of juſtice, takes all again by cruelty. All Art and Cunning is vain for him that is not able to withſtand and reſiſt violence, and every thing proves ſucceſsful to him that is able to uſe any force, and yet make men beleeve that he doth not commit any. He cares not for offering violence to the body onely
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61864:124"/>
which is ſubject to him, he will alſo ſubject the minde, which is free, and to perſwade he doth not doe it where he can, he will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to doe it where he cannot.</p>
            <p>The people will exile <hi>Coriolanus;</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate defends him; the people overcomes, the Senate mournes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coriolanus</hi> comes a Conquerour to the Walls of the Citie, the people repents, and would receive him: the Senate having alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red its minde, would not admit him.</p>
            <p>A man works for ſome imaginary good, and oftentimes before hee arrives to it, he ſtumbles at ſome evill which hee did not think upon. Upon this the operator is at a ſtand dejected, thinking hee was deceived alſo in that wherein hee had gueſſed right. To remedy the evill which is already paſt, he deprives himſelfe of the good which is to begin. For one, the time is paſt; and for the other, it is not yet come: He wil correct the error when he hath already done all the hurt: He either changes the operation, or leaves it: if he changes it, he receives a new loſſe; if he leaves it, it doth not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile that which hee hath already received. Many times actions are begun when they ſhould not, &amp; given over when they ſhould be moſt followed. An action ought not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be intermitted, or left off, becauſe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61864:124"/>
it was ill done; nor alwayes followed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is well done.</p>
            <p>He that findes prejudice in an action, runs preſently to undoe it. Nature inclines, and Art teaches us how to ſeek remedy from the contrary. But not every contrary is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, that which is ſo, ſometime is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, that it ſeemes to be a ſemblable.</p>
            <p>All the infirmities are not healed, and the reaſon is, becauſe ſometimes the nature, and ſometimes the degree of the contrary, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. When one ſhould have recourſe to the laſt of the formes, he flies for reliefe to the firſt of the qualities. Rationall Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians know, one ought to cure with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but they know not with which. They confound the diſeaſes; they doe not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that which hath been brought in by the Eſſence from that which the Accidents only have introduced; the ingendered from the altered.

            <p>The Empyrickes, which will heale with the like, are deceived; either they cure not at all, or by a contrary. They ſay that one ſalt is a remedy for another, and do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it doth not operate like ſalt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſts the reſemblance, but as the one is volatile, and the other fixed, from whence

ſprings the contrariety. The Senate was the <hi>Fixed</hi> Salt, which cured the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> from the <hi>Volatile</hi> of <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> They will not conſent to his return, whoſe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment they bewailed. The people will have him recalled, whom they themſelves had baniſhed: their love to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, leſt it ſhould become a prey to the Tribunes, was the cauſe why the Senate defended <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> their owne intereſt the cauſe why they pitied him. The ſame love, becauſe they will not have it fall into his hands as a tyrant, makes them to not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit him now he is an enemy; and the ſame intereſt envies him now victorious. The feare which poſſeſſes the people, while he was a Citizen, is the cauſe they baniſh him. And a greater feare which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him, now he is an enemy, cauſes them to recall him. The moſt ordinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that take root in great ones, are Compaſſion and Envy; if they ſee their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in an unhappy condition, they pitie h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61864:125"/>
And though it may ſeem, that as more the corrivall riſes, the more he is to be envied: ſo likewiſe, the more he falls, the more hee ſhould be pitied. Yet this may not be true, ſeeing compaſſion may peradventure faile, as well as envie: which when the corrivall is come to ſuch a pitch of greatneſſe, that he is quite beyond our reach, ſhame ceaſing, (which is onely in things poſſible) envie ceaſes likewiſe: So on the otherſide, when the corrivall is come to ſo low and unhappy a condition, that the other thinks it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to fall ſo low; becauſe the fear ceaſing (which is not in things impoſſible) compaſſion likewiſe ceaſes. The ſame <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus,</hi> whom the Senate compaſſionated in his miſeries, envied him in his proſperities. Peradventure the harſhneſſe of this pranke which he had plaid, together with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred valour; his having gotten forraigne aſſiſtance, and his forgetting the love which he bare to his Countrey, might give the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cauſe enough to feare, that if he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he would become a tyrant, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who had driven him away, becauſe hee ſhould not become one, now recalling him, did likewiſe make the world think, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid of becoming a prey to the <hi>Volſci,</hi> they would accept of him.</p>

The people, to the utmoſt of their powers, make choyce of ſubjecting themſelves to their Countrey-man rather than to a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but the Senate will rather ſubmit to the enemy, than to their corrivall: the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent carriage of the Senate in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, may alſo proceed from another cauſe. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> was valiant, free in ſpeech, and ſurly; kinds of carriage which do not gain the love of the heart, though they overcome the underſtanding, &amp; in a manner tyrannize over the wil, cauſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> rather drawing along, than enticing, or alluring. This is no violent motion proceeding from Nature; neither can it be called voluntary, becauſe knowledge doth not precede it. Man goeth along in this motion, not againſt, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his will, not knowing wherefore he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. He delights not in being carried away, and yet ſuffers it; he doth not love, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that thing which raviſhes him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediently followes it, as its commanding <hi>genius.</hi> Of this kinde of metall ſometimes are favourites made, who by thoſe as do not know this, are termed bewi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

place they pull down, and in the other they raiſe: they abaſe themſelves by ſeeking to riſe: they call that Witchcraft which is a Gift; as if Nature could not, as well as the Devill produce wonderfull things by Art in mixing actives with paſſives. This ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is mixed, as one ſhould ſay, of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and of naturall, of voluntary and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary; and thence it comes that it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces effects mixt of pleaſure and diſtaſt, of love and hate, with I know not what: of feare, accompanied with reſpect and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The thing is beloved which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſheth, and yet to be raviſhed, is hatefull. We delight in him alive, whom we could wiſh, had not been born. We are glad to have him neare, and yet ſhould not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed to have him farre from us; we can neither keep him, nor put him away, for we are willing both to have him, and to be without him. He that will thrive with his Lord, through his ſecret qualities, let him conceale the manifeſt ones; if the <hi>Genius</hi> be commanding, let him make himſelf obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. How ſhould Ebony cure the French Diſeaſe, and Triacle the peſtilent Fever, if their manifeſt qualities were not controlled?</p>
            <p>They would doe as much prejudice with their extrinſecall qualities, as they would doe good with their intrinſecall form, What good would it doe a Lord to ſee one lie at

his feet, who ſhould bee ſeated above his head? If the getting above him, whom fortune of birth hath made equall to us, bee one of the ſavourieſt dainties that humane ambition feeds upon, what will it bee to Lord it over them, to whom the nature of the <hi>Genius</hi> hath made us inferior.

            <p>And though he by and by after returned to his owne nature, yet did not the people know how to free themſelves from him, being as it were bewitched to him; if the Tribunes violence, had not oppoſed it ſelfe to the Semi-violence of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious <hi>Genius.</hi>

            <p>So much did this <hi>Genius</hi> prevaile when it was preſent, and loſe when it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. He that ſubjects himſelfe to it, deſires not to be freed, nor returne into ſubjection, when he is free,</p>

            <p>The ends which move men to ſeeke the higheſt degrees of honour in their owne Country are many times different, and for the moſt part contrary.

And ſome againe for no other end but for the good of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and to be able to do great matters in the behalfe of it. The one is alwayes a vice, and is termed ambition, the other, when it is not a vertue, may be called pride. The firſt aiming at a vicious end, it cannot ſeeme ſtrange, if he proceeds towards it by ſuch meanes; he flatters bowes to the People, and vili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the obtaining of domination. The laſt raiſeth nor his fortune by any ſuch meanes, vertue will not give way to it, nor Pride will not ſuffer him: <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi> were of the firſt, <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Coriolanus</hi> may be numbred amongſt the latter.

            <p>From ſuch different ends, proceeds a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe manner of operating; from the diverſe operation, are produced various effects, in the people, and in thoſe to whom they are done.</p>
            <p>Flattering bending, and humbling ones ſelfe, increaſes love in the People, and at the ſame time diminiſhes the conceit of him that does ſo; it detracts from his Majeſty, and therewithall make him not ſo much to be admired. The people rejoyce at it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is for their profit: but though they deſire thoſe men ſhould be ſo, whom they make choice of to love; yet they doe not deſire them to be ſuch whom they in end to revererce. So that when they will make choiſe of one to command them, they will chuſe him rather whom they admire, then him they love. Doing of great actions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61864:129"/>
flattering, or bowing to the people cauſes admiration in their breſt, it does not ſuffer a tender love to take roote in their hearts, but inſtead thereof it oftentimes breeds an awfull love in them; for as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty cannot put on tenderneſſe without aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it ſelfe, ſo cannot a man put on Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty without altering himſelfe.</p>
            <p>But theſe loves are too different. The one reſides in the concupiſcible, the other in the intelligible part. The one is towards his equall, and if he be not ſo, it makes him ſo, and requires mildneſſe. The other ſeems to be towards one's ſuperior, and requires majeſty.</p>
            <p>The firſt hath the perſon for its aime, the ſecond his vertue. The tender love loſeth it ſelfe or diminiſheth, when the ſubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Majeſticall; the awfull and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full love, when he comes to be low. The one eaſily turnes to contempt, the other many times is changed into hatred. How could the name of marriage pleaſe <hi>Meſſalina</hi> in <hi>Siluius,</hi> without the Empire, while ſhee could not enjoy him as a husband, unleſſe he became Emperour? Peradventure ſhee knew that the Majeſty of that degree would take away the Adulterers love, and chan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e hers. That contempt would creep into <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> his love, and reverence into hers; That
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61864:129"/>
ſhe ſhould be obliged to reſpect, where ſhe onely loved, and change the tenderneſſe of affections, into obſequiouſneſſe of eſteeme. How could the Tribunes ſuſpect <hi>Coriolanus</hi> for tyranny, ſeeing he had quite loſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts, by the harſhneſſe of the pranck he had plaid them; if they had not feared, he would have made himſelfe Maſter of their underſtandings by the greatneſſe of of operations? Who ſpoke more freely to the Tribes, and more ſharply rebuked them then our Saviour Chriſt, yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by vertue of the great miracles which he had wrought, he had bred in them an awfull and reſpectfull love, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away, becauſe they ſhould not proclaime him King.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who flatter the People, either are not at all called to command, if they bee, they doe not continue in it. He that attaines to it by a tender love, let him prepare ſtrong force to keepe himſelfe in, leſt contempt and repentance beat him out againe. Hee that is come to it through a reſpectfull love, may by the ſame maintain himſelfe in it. The people being once brought under obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the commanding <hi>genius,</hi> wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no outrage, nor uſe any violence, unleſſe it be firſt uſed to them. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eloquent, acceptable in the Peoples

ſight, being accuſed dares not appeare to defend himſelfe. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> rough, and as unskilfull in all good arts, as hee was ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to inſinuations, hatefull to the People, appeares rather vaunting, then defending himſelfe: reſolved to make manifeſt the greatneſſe of his mind and ſpirit rather then his innocency.</p>
            <p>He diſtruſts the love of tenderneſſe that often uſes to transforme it ſelfe into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and confides in that reſpectfull love that admits not of contempt. He feares not hate, which is alſo compatible with ſuch a kind of love; not that the being angry with a great vertue, totally excludes the reverencing of it, it floating lightly over any thing that is not peſtilently produced by the groſſeneſſe of ignorance or rancour of malice.</p>
            <p>What would <hi>Coriolanus</hi> have had more? How came it that he did not know himſelfe in the higheſt point of the Epicicle, when he ſhewed his fortune ſuperior to Romes, and the altering of hers at his diſpoſall; when he had ſeen his emulators at his feete and his enemies at his diſcretion: when hee had at the ſame time obtained the ſweet taſte of revenge; and the magnanimus honour of not having taken it? But this not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to retreate is a thing as common to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61864:130"/>
great ſubjects, as the deſire it ſelfe of rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p>In greateſt motions they diſcourſe of reſt, and amidſt moſt turbulent buſineſſe of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy. Therein doe they place their felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and it is in their hands to attaine to it, and yet they doe not. Peradventure they would rettire with ſatisfaction, and beleeve they ſhall, and put it off till that time, and ſtill there is ſomething wanting, that they can never attaine to that ſatisfaction nor yet retiring; and being deceivers of themſelves, live in continuall trouble and motion: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying no other reſt or peace, but a vaine hope, and Chimericall imagination that they ſhall enjoy it.</p>
            <p>Sometimes againe it is neither deceit nor ignorance, but ought to be imputed to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of heart, and conſtancy of mind. If fortune, though never ſo great, cannot be given over with ſatisfaction, yet feare muſt at laſt make it be abandoned; and if to attaine unto it, is required, an enforced valour, an undaunted mind, a breſt of ſteele; who can forſake it cowardly, that hath valiantly attained to it? He will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be maſter of it, and will beleeve that it cannot change nor alter: He will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine himſelfe ſuperior to it, and will not be daunted at it, though it do change.</p>

The glory of the dead runnes; but cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It remaines in the world, but withered, and wanting novelty, is not looked upon by reaſon of its oldneſſe. Death gives a great blow, but the civill death gives the greater; it doth not utterly extinguiſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy as the naturall doeth; nor doth not like it counterpoiſe that which it takes away, with the ſenſe which it hath taken away. No marvaile then, if others avoid retiring, becauſe they will not ſtrive with it.</p>
            <p>Death cannot ſtay and naile faſt fortunes wheele from deſcending, yet it ſtayes it that it may not precipitate. And ſeeing it very ſeldome laſts a mans age; happy is that man that laſts but fortunes time. And becauſe the time of the one is not meaſured, and the others life is onely looked after, we ſometimes complaine of death for pulling up of that green, when we ſhould thanke it, for gathering it when it is ripe. It is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him whom it cuts off, when hee is growen up into a high degree, and but newly arrived to it. It makes him to bee imagined of infinite vertue, becauſe it hath not bin meaſured, nor the end of it ſeene. It attributes unto him the glory of that which he hath nor yet done, when perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture he would have loſt that which hee had already gotten.</p>

Death which is one to all men, is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually favourable to all, ſhe cuts off one before he is ripe, ſhe lets the other hang till he falls off rotten; and gathers but few in the flower of their ripeneſſe. It is a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to dye, when fortune is at higheſt. One cannot long ſtand at a ſtay, it is impoſſible to advance, and to decreaſe is of neceſſity. He that cannot receive this favour from the originall, let him ſeeke it from the copy, and he that cannot die, let him retire, for any thing is better then to precipitate.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Summum bonum</hi> of the body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick were as manifeſt as that of the humane, and that we did know as well what fortune requires, as we know what nature deſires; wee might when wee come to ſuch a ſtate leave for a time, and returne to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but knowing neither of both, few yeild, <hi>when, what and ſo much,</hi> as they ſhould yeild. It ſeemed to a fortunate man, to be come to the height of happineſſe and to ſuch a pitch, that he was to fear a downfal</p>
            <p>To avoid it, he throwes a moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious gemme into the Sea. Ere long it was brought to his Table againe in a Fiſhes bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; fortune returned him that which hee had given her, becauſe it was not that which ſhe would have had; he joyfully receives it againe, and takes that for a favour

               <hi>Coriolanus</hi> that could not leave his fortune, left his life: this happens for the moſt part to ſtrangers, that have bin called, or of themſelves have crept up to the higheſt eminencies of a Common-wealth. The moſt valiant have loſt their lives, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have bin baniſhed; If there is in a Common-wealth an eminent Citizen, as <hi>Tullus</hi> was amongſt the <hi>Volſci,</hi> when <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi> came in amongſt them; as <hi>Agis</hi> was in <hi>Sparta</hi> when <hi>Alcibiades</hi> came thither, as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was in Holland, when the Archduke <hi>Matthias,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> were called in there.

            <p>Where they are brought in, they ſend them away too. If it were in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, when that is paſt, if it were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any one, after that was performed: if to be deceived, when they were undeceived. When there is not in the Common-wealth any one Citizen more eminent then the reſt, and in reſpect of domeſtick diſcords, they call in ſome noble man of great bloud to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61864:133"/>
governe them, or in regard of forraigne warres, they ſend for ſome eminent Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour to command them; let this man either prepare himſelfe to be nothing at all our Lord and Maſter, or an exile: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are none that will be nothing, it being repugnant to an ambitious nature, and it being a hard matter to become Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men greater in repute, then power, hee muſt expect either from jealouſie, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or from feare, death. But if ſtrangers be eaſilie driven away, they are alſo as eaſily called in; for the opinion which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune frames in abſence and farre off, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then that which one being preſent doth frame of himſelfe, bearing along with it the greatneſſe of the actions, without the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectneſſe of the matter. Becauſe their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is more pure conceived by meanes of the eare, then by meanes of the eye; that which is heard, then that which is ſeene. For a mans actions repreſented by fame all at once, leave a kind of aſtoniſhment, whereas the other, being ſeen one by one, languiſh, the ſecond being ſcarce come forth before the other be either dead or mortiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Cittizen diſcovers the defects in his youthfull age, which defects leave behind them, if not a wound, yet at leaſt a

ſcarre; from which thing the ſtranger is free, who onely manifeſts and diſcovers himſelfe in that which is perfect; Becauſe envy hath no place in the former, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in the latter.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is peradventure with a truer and more ordinary, though a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and deep reaſon, for the naturall inſtinct of hoping for greater remedy in our affaires, from the greater difficulty in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to it, following therein nature it ſelfe, which hath moſt concealed, and made leſſe ſtore of thoſe things which are moſt precious, and given moſt glory to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt atchievements.</p>
            <p>As for example, there growes an herbe at our very foot, and a man ſtands cloſe by us, the herbes are medicinall, and the man able to heale us, and defend us: Yet wee will ſeeke for ſuch in remote countries, as if all our good conſiſted rather in the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of obtaining, then in the quality of things: nature having imprinted in us, the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of deſpiſing what is obvious &amp; known, to beleeve that which is moſt obſcure, to hope for that which is moſt difficult, to admire that which is furtheſt off, to make all that is great difficult to us, either becauſe it hath made it ſo, or becauſe we make it ſo to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Under a Prince it is not impoſſible, but
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61864:134"/>
it ſeldome happens, that a ſtranger ſhoud arrive to a chiefe degree of honour, unleſſe the Prince be a Tyrant; or that he ſhould continue there, unleſſe the Prince become one. VVith the loſſe of life he concludes his being a favorite, if he doth not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe in it by multiplying of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and ſlaughters.</p>
            <p>But if the Prince be a Tyrant, ſuch a one may often arrive to it, becauſe the Tyrant feares the Citizens, and the favourite may continue, becauſe the other makes him to be feared.</p>
            <p>Finally, <hi>Tullus</hi> through Jealouſie, Malice, and hatred born to <hi>Coriolanus</hi> his vertue, under pretence that hee had not proſecuted his enterpriſe to the deſtruction of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, cauſed him to be murthered by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of ſome who were his adherents.</p>
            <p>A mans Country hath in it a retentive quality for ſuch as are borne in it, and an attractive one, for ſuch as are travailed out of it. This conſiſts in the pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which the providence of Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes communicates to needfull things, and alſo in the aire, the temperament, the influences, in the vertue, which the place affoorded to the thing which is placed in it, and peradventure in a mans being uſed and accuſtomed thereunto, as much as in any thing elſe.</p>

The efficacy and force of this laſt being full of contrarieties, is hard to underſtand, and unfold. Sometime you ſhall heare the Philoſophers ſay, that the underſtanding dejects and dulls it ſelfe in a knowen thing, and greedily turnes to a new one. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you ſhall ſee an opinion laid hold of, which will not be left to turne to any other, although it be new.</p>
            <p>The ſenſe of taſting is tried with aſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and deſires change of food. The ſame happineſſe in the ſenſe of feeling; and likewiſe in the ſenſe of ſmelling. The ſenſe of ſeeing will ſeeme to be glutted with the ſight of a thing, and another which is not ſo beautifull, will ſeeme fairer to it, becauſe it is new. Sometimes a man being accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one manner of cloathing, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be brought to another faſhion, but it will ſeeme ridiculous to him, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo he will change for it, as for a better. In morall things one ſhunnes (God a mercy cuſtome) that as a vice, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother embraces as a vertue.</p>
            <p>It is hard to finde out any thing that will make a man love his own deſtruction. Hence growes the deteſtation of a contrary, though it have novelty to take its part. The underſtanding flies towards it, becauſe its object is not onely truth, but all truths,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61864:135"/>
and as ſuch it turns to it: if it findes it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it turns from it as falſe, and as from an enemy. In faſhions of Cloathes, the ſight will not endure a faſhion much diſcrepant from the wonted and accuſtomed one, and the faſhions altering daily, the change is not very ſenſible; whereby a man comes to bee fatisfied and perſwaded by the novelty, without hitting upon (unleſſe it be in a very long time) the contrary, which he would abhorre. The taſte feeds upon food, which in the beginning is unlike, but in the end ſemblable: the long uſe of it, makes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy like unto it, and conſequently diminiſhes the delight, ſeeing the appetite would have the unlike: but yet you ſhall not ſee it for all this, runne to that which is quite and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly contrary. Aſſuefaction alſo likewiſe makes a great difference in the ſenſes, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where they are meerly ſpiritall, or any way materiall: for this helps ſatiety, and diminiſhes the taſte, which may manifeſtly be perceived in the ſelf-ſame beauty, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen, and ſometimes enjoyed.</p>
            <p>All the love Nature hath put in man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his native Countrey, cannot hinder him from being drawn out of it either by neceſſity, intereſt, or ambition, or any other powerfull motive. And truly, as for a mans health, when all other remedies faile, they
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61864:136"/>
uſe change of aire; ſo for an averſe Fortune, it is good to change the Climate: The aire nurſes the ſpirits, and with them (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſayd) changes the underſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it alters its chiefe Inſtruments. Food cauſes a new temperament, and therewith new behaviours. The Climate changes the Influences, theſe the Inclinations, and all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered together, make an alteration of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Many goe without it, becauſe they will not follow it, and many becauſe they cannot finde it, forſaking ſometimes that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in which they had it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not diſcerning the true place where they might have attained to it. Moſt part are of opinion, that travell makes many worthy men: I ſee the effect of it, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not as yet diſcern whether it be a cauſe, or a figne and token of their worth. A cauſe, if by reaſon that one ſeeing himſelfe deſtitute of many meanes, is forced to make uſe of his own vertue, which reſtrained betweene contraries, increaſes the more. A ſigne, if to overcome the many allurements of ones na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſoile, and forſake it, is required a great ſpirit, a valiant and magnanimous heart, whereby a man may come to attaine to eminent glory.</p>
            <p>I believe there are but few ſo wicked, as to become enemies of their Country, though
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61864:136"/>
they may be enemies to thoſe who prevaile therein, and govern it. But ſeeing the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are thoſe who make a Citie, and not the Walls, he that is an enemy to them, ſeemes, if not directly, yet indirectly, to bee an enemy to his Countrey. By this deceit of believing that the hatred which one beares to the Prince, or Magiſtrate that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes, or to a predominant faction, be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Countrey it ſelfe, or the Citie, many forraigne Princes, and Common-wealths have ſuffered themſelves to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; who ſhould firſt attentively have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered the cauſes &amp; motives of thoſe who have perſwaded them to commence warre againſt their own Countrey; aſſuring them, that whenſoever thoſe men have ſatisfied their own paſſions, they will forſake them.</p>
            <p>Many may bee the cauſes which move a Countrey-man, or Citizen, to ſuch diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances; whereof deſire of revenge is none of the leaſt, when he becomes obliged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by ſome great matters, which do breed hatred all at once as it uſes to be againſt the cruelty, avarice, and luxury of the Prince, when the ſubjects are prejudiced in their lives, goods, and reputations. If the ſhame or dammage meet with a ſtout and valiant ſpirit, it will never be appeaſed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: And it is good fortune when hee
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61864:137"/>
findes things in ſuch a condition, that hee may accompliſh his intention with a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, by killing or expelling the Tyrant, which many times may prove to bee rather for the good then hurt of his Countrey. As when <hi>Brutus</hi> expelled the <hi>Tarquines</hi> for the rape of <hi>Lucrece,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Virginius</hi> procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the death of <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> for defiling his daughter. For if theſe mens way be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that they cannot come to worke their revenge themſelves, they ſtudy how to make uſe of ſome others power: whence come the ruines not onely of Princes, but alſo of whole States and Monarchies. So paſſed the <hi>Medes,</hi> Monarchy to the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when <hi>Arpagus</hi> having no other meanes to revenge himſelfe of <hi>Astiages,</hi> did ſet his Grand-childe againſt him. A Prince may therefore ſecurely take their parts who riſe againſt their own Countrey, by reaſon of an irreconciliable hatred which they beare him that governes.</p>
            <p>Ambition and Intereſt are likewiſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſes for men to bring in forraigne forces againſt their own Countrey, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from hatred, becauſe they are moved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſome good to themſelves, than for any prejudice to others. Theſe cauſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited many perſons in the revolutions of <hi>France,</hi> ſometimes to returne to the places
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61864:137"/>
whence they had been driven, ſometimes to obtain dignities, ſometime to recover thoſe which they had loſt. If the Countrey alſo be in Armes, the conqueſt of it will hardly be obtained, if they will not have ſtrangers become Lords thereof converting the fruits of the victory to the welfare of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, changing but one enemy for another: the Princes being ſo by reaſon of the eſtate which they poſſeſſe, and they become ſuch that conquer it. The <hi>Guiſes</hi> whileſt they thought they might adorne their Temples with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> never forſooke the Catholick Kings ſide; and as ſoone as they found the contrary, they forſooke him. Great are the hopes which diſcontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conceive, and their maintainers: and thoſe hopes being divers, if not contrary and hard to be concealed, quickly bring forth diſtaſtes: They goe on increaſing in the diſcontented theſe and by the ſame degrees they abate in the enemy, who ſeekes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the diſcontented with cunning &amp; fair promiſes, the buſines ſerving them (if for no other end) to cauſe diſtruſts, which bring the ſubjects out of their reſolutions into perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Perplexitie breeds ſuſpition, ſuſpition new diſtaſtes, and diſtaſtes breaches. Where jealouſies once take root, we muſt not hope for any proceedings: the weakeſt doe not ſo
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61864:138"/>
much wiſh for, as feare victories, and deſire rather to obſtruct than promote them. It ſufficeth not that thou promiſe them that they ſhall have whatſoever ſhall be gained, if ſo be it muſt reſt in their courteſie to give it: becauſe in matters of State, none will truſt to mens wills, if they be not obliged by force, or perſwaded by ſome intereſt.</p>
            <p>There are ſome caſes, in which it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to be content with the loſſe which is received by the warres, and leave all the profit to ones friend. As when he ſettles him into his Countrey, with change of forme, ſeeing it may be hoped, that his friendſhip is ſincere in him who is ſo ſetled, becauſe he is to be maintained in it againſt thoſe who governed formerly. True it is, that the memory of that benefit, and therewithall the ſincerity of the friendſhip, will laſt until ſuch time as they can finde meanes to ſecure themſelves, without having need of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Then the leaſt preſent intereſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels all former obligations, it ſeeming to many, that even benefits ſuffer preſcription by the length of time; and being once grown old, do no longer bind to gratitude. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy hath more than once had experience of this misfortune, yet ſuch a cuſtome ought not to be left off, whenſoever occaſion ſhall preſent it ſelfe: Seeing the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61864:138"/>
Polititian ought not to looke after eternity but many times be content with that, which profiteth him but for a time, and onely for the preſent, ſo it doe not bring any prejudice for the future along with it.</p>
            <p>To divide a kingdome amongſt diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented perſons, whoſe power may afterward be feared, ſeemes to ſecure the firmneſſe of of the ſide, and quietneſſe of the State: but if he meet with ſubtile and witty ſubjects, that will not be dallied with, by fallacies of the preſent, they will know well enough, that thoſe who have been able to divide a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome when it was entire can ſubdue it when it is divided. <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond was blamed becauſe he did not take this courſe: but the wiſdome of thoſe of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> was not eaſily deceived with ſlights, nor could they be appeaſed with a part. Thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and valiant ſubjects knowing well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that they could not cancell the name of diſturbers of their countries peace with any other name, but the name of King.</p>
            <p>There are likewiſe ſometimes ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly turbulent braines, that without any inſtigation of hatred, wrath, intereſt or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, have an irregulate deſire of troubles and innovations: Enemies to whatſoever is, alwayes contriving againſt the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61864:139"/>
in behalfe of changes. Kingdoms yeeld more ſuch ſpirits then Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths: for he that goes about to prejudice liberty, thinkes hee goes againſt his owne Countrey; and hee that seekes to ruine a kingdom imagines he goes againſt anothers Such a one was that <hi>Iulian</hi> who brought the <hi>Moores</hi> into <hi>Spain.</hi> The occaſion which he pretended for the rape of his daughter, was already paſt, and he did this but onely out of a meere and ſudden deſire of innovation which made him haſten to it on ſo faſt. He that is called in by ſuch kinde of men, may be ſure he ſhall not be abandoned, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</p>
            <p>Factions are alſo cauſes of bringing in ſtrangers into a country, whether they ſtrive one againſt another for the Government, or being both under one government, are onely at odds amongſt themſelves; That ſide which ſees it ſelfe oppreſſed, preſently calls in the ſtranger, to raiſe it ſelfe over its corrivall, and be revenged. They are both good occaſions for thee to undertake, one with more ſecurity, and the other with more profit, becauſe the latter cals thee in to make thee Lord, and the former that thou mighteſt make him Lord.</p>
            <p>There is another kind of faction in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Cities, or Provinces which is an
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61864:139"/>
enemy to thoſe who are in authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was obliged to thoſe who formerly had the government, and this uſes to bee, where the Government hath bin altered: as it was for a long time ſeen in Naples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Arragonian and Angiovin facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And in this caſe he that is called in, may bee more confident then in any other: eſpecially if he have but any Chimericall conjunction or affinity with thoſe that were once Lords there.</p>
            <p>To take away the priviledges of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, gives occaſion to call in ſtrangers, not with an intent to make them Lords, but onely to have their aſſiſtance in framing their Common-wealth, as the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries did making uſe of Germanes, French, and Engliſh, and driving away all thoſe whom they thought might any way aſpire to principality.</p>
            <p>If you aſſiſt ſuch to free them from their Lords, you need not fear that they will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you, but if you ſhould pretend to rule over them your ſelf, you would find a hard taske of it, unleſſe their rebellion did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from hatred, to which choler being joyned, there growes ſuch a rage in the People, as cauſeth unadviſed operations, wherein they proceed ſo farre, before rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſteps in, that they find themſelves ſo
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61864:140"/>
deeply ingaged, that they cannot give back, but are forced to follow as they begun for feare of ruining: and expoſe themſelves to any condition, though it be farre worſer then their firſt, ſo it be not that which they had freed themſelves from. With theſe one muſt be quick, and make ſure worke, before they returne to their right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.</p>
            <p>There be alſo two wayes to help ſtrangers, when they are called in; the one is with forces, and that gives way to repentance, the other no way admitteth of any. Of the firſt wee have ſpoken already: the ſecond is, when the ſtate hath ſome ſecret weakneſſe, by meanes whereof it may be conquered; or when the preſervation of it conſiſts in ſome ſtrong hold: and in this caſe there will be traitors found, intereſt may and will produce them; as alſo a ſodaine wrath or diſdaine, where an evill may be done in an inſtant, is able to make him become a Traytor, who never had an intent to bee one, becauſe that hurried on by a ſodaine and violent paſſion, rather then by any premeditated will, he will paſt all remedy, the attempt conſiſting in an action ſo ſwift, and mortall, that it may be performed at the very firſt daſh, and being once performed it brings ſodaine ruine, which admits of no repentance.</p>

               <hi>Alcibiades</hi> provoked againſt the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, teaches the Spartans how they ſhould fortifie the City of <hi>Decelea</hi> with walls, and put a garriſon into it, if the ruine of his Country had conſiſted wholly in this, as it did in part, it had bin ruined, and yet that firſt rage and violence of wrath being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, when <hi>Tiſaphernes</hi> would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed it, he would not permit it. <hi>Coriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in his fury leads on the <hi>Volſci</hi> to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Rome: his fury being allayed, he deſiſts.</p>
            <p>Theſe repentings happen under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths ſooner then under Kings, as well becauſe the Country (as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is judged as alien in a princely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as alſo by reaſon that in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth a ſubject ſeldome receives diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt from a whole City. Where there bee factions of Nobles and <hi>Plebeians,</hi> the one is alway in his favour, and by him affected, which will not ſuffer him to run precipitouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to revenge.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe did peradventure <hi>Coriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> more then in pity of his Mothers teares, aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don the thoughts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

be ſeene in <hi>Alcibiades, Themiſtocles,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I attentively conſider the faſhions and carriage of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> I find them to be not much unlike <hi>Catoes,</hi> and worthy of greater glory: in as much as this laſt quite overthrew the Common-wealth, when peradventure he might in part have ſaved it, the other bore it up, when it lay in his hand to deſtroy it. Inflexibility or peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cruelty; Freedome of ſpeech, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; Conſtancy in operating or peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obſtinacy, Contempt of wealth and glory, or it may bee hypocriſie; Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind, in not bowing to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or peradventure pride, Love of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which might be hatred of the Tyrant, or envy, theſe were the vertues ſo much commended in <hi>Cato,</hi> and I find them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all in <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and valour in a more ſublime degree joyned to them. <hi>Cato</hi> had an intent to defend the Common-wealth from the power of one man alone; <hi>Coriolanus</hi> from all mens. It was juſt in both, and peradventure the cauſe equall, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually beſeeming.</p>
            <p>The one would have a decrepit man grow young againe; The other would not have a young man grow decrepit. In <hi>Catoes</hi> time the Common-wealth was totall perverted,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61864:141"/>
confounded, and full of diſcord, ſo farre from its ancient inſtitution, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to bring it to it againe. In <hi>Coriolanus</hi> dayes it was not farre digreſſed from its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtomes, and might eaſily have bin reduced to them againe.</p>
            <p>In the formers time the wiſeſt men were of opinion that the onely cure of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was to reduce it into one mans hand. In the latters, that the beſt remedy was to keep it out of the hands of the people, that it might not periſh. They both loſt the Conſulſhip, becauſe they would not flatter; <hi>Caeſar</hi> cauſes hands to be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Cato,</hi> to carry him to priſon, and for ſhame will not ſuffer him to be brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Sicinius</hi> the Tribune takes hold of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus</hi> with intent to caſt him downe headlong from the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> rock, and repenting, ſurceaſes, <hi>Coriolanus</hi> is baniſhed, <hi>Cato</hi> exiles himſelfe. <hi>Cato</hi> joynes with <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> more for rage, &amp; in hatred to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> than being perſwaded thereunto by the love of his countrey, or zeale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Common-wealth, which he well knew would bee the Conquerours prey; and moſt to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if it became his, who was the more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous and concealed, and peradventure the worſer man. What wonder is it then, if <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus</hi> likewiſe enraged againſt the people,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61864:142"/>
ſeeing the Senate vilified, &amp; finding, no <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> to ſide with, joynes with <hi>Tullus?</hi> They exalt their own Citizens, the one with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> the other with <hi>Volſcians. Cato</hi> is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, <hi>Coriolanus</hi> conquers. If the other had been victorious, it had not much ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the Common-wealth, neither did it loſe it ſelfe, becauſe this overcame. If the Nobility had followed <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> as it did <hi>Cato</hi> either he had returned into <hi>Rome</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and eſtabliſhed a better form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; or being conquered, had left a more laſting Government behinde him. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> dies, becauſe hee could not make the Citie free. <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> becauſe hee would not bring it under ſubjection.</p>
            <p>If any man wonders that I ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Coriolanus</hi> to <hi>Cato,</hi> let him in the firſt place, and much more admire, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſhould compare him to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> the one was altogether effeminate, the other manly. The Greek ſoft, and tender with <hi>Socrates</hi> education, ſavoured of a Schoole. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man harſh, and hardened, brought up in the camp, was compoſed of nothing but warre. The firſt was ambitious, the laſt proud. One ſeverely flattered the people, the other free, oppoſed them. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> framed himſelfe to all mens faſhions, <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi> intended to frame every one to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61864:142"/>
One was beautifull, eloquent, and ſubtle; with his beauty, allured, with his eloquence perſwaded, and with his ſubtilty deceived. The other ſterne in aſpect, rough in ſpeech, ſingle in heart, allured not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded not, nor did not deceive. <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> loſes himſelfe like a vaine man; <hi>Coriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> like a ſolid. In their baniſhments, and in their deaths, wherein they ſeemed to bee moſt like one another, they were contrary. They were both exiled, it is true, but one, becauſe he would alter the forme of the Common-wealth, the other, becauſe hee would not have it altered. They were both kill'd, I confeſſe it, but <hi>Alcibiades</hi> for hatred of his vices, <hi>Coriolanus</hi> for envy of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
