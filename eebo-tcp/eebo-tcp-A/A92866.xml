            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VArious are the Misfortunes of Mankind, and proceed from different Cauſes, and by different Ways, but what here we ſhall relate, is very ſtrange and ſurprizing, and has for ſome days paſt, appeared ſo to many Judicious Perſons: But to come nearer to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> Morning, Mr. <hi>John Temple,</hi> a Gentleman of a conſiderable Eſtate, and for his many Acquirements much beloved and eſteemed, left his Lodging in or near <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and taking water, directed the Waterman to Row him down the <hi>Thames,</hi> calling at ſome places by the way, to enquire (as the Waterman conjectures) for Friends; appearing as he had done a while before very Melancholy and Diſcontented, or at leaſt ſomewhat diſturbed and troubled in Mind, and with that Waterman he ſhot the Bridg; but whatever at that time came into his Thoughts, he attempted not, as the Waterman perceived, what afterward unhappily fell out, yet contrary to expectation; he Landed at one of the Wharfs on this ſide <hi>Billings-G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te,</hi> and diſmiſſing the Boat, in a ſhort time came back to the <hi>Old Swan</hi> Stairs, and took another Boat, which he ordered to ſhoot the Bridg without any certain Directions whether to go: And whilſt the VVaterman was paſſing through, looking forward to guide his Boat from running on the Piles, or Starlings, the ſaid Gentleman expreſſing ſomewhat, though not fully underſtood, by reaſon of the roaring of the Water, plunged into the Stream, ſo that though he uſed what endeavour he could to take him at the Riſing, he could not ſee him to give him any aſſiſtance: But looking where he had ſat, he found a written Note, and in it or by it a Shilling; his Hat was taken up floating at a conſiderable diſtance.</p>
            <p>This creating much Diſcourſe about Town, and his Friends (who were very conſiderable) coming to hear of it, offers of Reward were made to ſuch as could find his Body: Whereupon four Boats, and ſeveral Men in them, with Ropes and Grablers, ſearched the <hi>Thames</hi> a great part of <hi>Sunday,</hi> uſing all Opportunities to find the dead Body; and ſo fortunate were they at laſt, as to find him in a Ballaſt Hole, or Whirl-Pit, near <hi>Pickle-Herring Stairs,</hi> by taking hold of a Boſs-rope that had Entangled him in his Pocket. He had a Watch, and things of value in his Pocket, and by his ſide a Silver-hilted Sword, and very good Apparrel. The dead Body was brought to the VVater-Bailiffs Houſe, near <hi>Fiſhmongers-Hall,</hi> and there in a rich Coffin, and Laced Shrowd, expoſed to View, whilſt the Coroners Jury ſat on him,</p>
            <p>He was Married to a Gentlewoman of a conſiderable Fortune, and accounted to be worth in Eſtate about 3000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
