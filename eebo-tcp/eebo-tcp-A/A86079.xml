                  <note>Wing H1092 reads: "Two anatomical exercises", which may be an erroneous transcription for "Two anatomical exercitations". The latter title apparently was not issued separately after the 1649 Latin editions published in Rotterdam and Cambridge, but served as an appendix to "De motu cordis". (Cf.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here did come forth not many moneths agoe a little piece of the moſt famous <hi>Riolan</hi>'s, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Anatomie and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; for which, as being ſent to me by the Author himſelf, I return hearty thanks: Seriouſly I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate the felicity of that man in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking a thing very commendable. To open to the view the ſeats of all Diſeaſes, is a work not to be atchiev'd but by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wit; Truly he undertook a hard task, that has ſet thoſe Diſeaſes, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt obſcure to our underſtanding, before our eyes. Such endeavours become the Prince of Anatomiſts; for there is no Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170011:3"/>which has not its beginning from foregoing knowledge, nor any knowledge which is not beholding to ſenſe for its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: For which cauſe the buſineſs it ſelf, and the example of ſo worthy a perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd my pains, and did invite me in like manner to put forth and joyn my medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Anatomic, being chiefly fitted for Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical uſes, not with the ſame intention as he, by demonſtrating the places of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from the dead bodies of healthful men, and rehearſing the divers ſorts of diſeaſes incident to thoſe places, according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens opinions, which he ought to have ſeen there; but that I might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to relate from the many diſſections of ſick bodies, and the moſt grievous and wonderfull diſeaſes of dead perſons, in what manner, and how the inward parts of them are chang'd, in place, bigneſſe, condition, figure, ſubſtance, and other ſenſible accidents, from their natural form and appearance, which all Anatomiſts commonly deſcrib'd, and how diverſly and wonderfully they are affected. For as the diſſection of healthfull and well habited bodies conduces much to Philoſophie and right Phyſiologie, ſo the inſpection of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed bodies conduces chiefly to Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Philoſophie. For the Phyſiological contemplation of thoſe things which are according to Nature, is firſt to be known
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170011:3"/>by the Phyſician, for that which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Nature is right, and is rule both to it ſelf and that which is amiſſe; by the light of which, errors and preternatural diſeaſes being defin'd, Pathologie is more clear, and from Pathologie the uſe and art of adminiſtring Phyſick, and occaſions of inventing many new remedies doe ocur. Nor will any man beleeve how much in diſeaſes, eſpecially ſuch as are Chronical, the inwards are chang'd, and what mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſhapes of the inward parts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by diſeaſes: And I dare ſay the opening and diſſection of one conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive perſon, or of a body ſpent with ſome antient or venemous diſeaſe, has more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd the knowledge of Phyſick, than the diſſections of ten bodies of men that have been hang'd.</p>
               <p>Yet doe not I diſallow of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and moſt learned Anatomiſt <hi>Riolan</hi> his purpoſe, but think it highly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as being very profitable for Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, that he does illuſtrate the Phyſiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical part; yet did I think that it would not be leſſe profitable to the art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick if I ſhould ſet clearly before your eys to be ſeen, not only the places, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the diſeaſes of thoſe places, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe them, after I had well view'd and obſerv'd them, and from my many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections declare my experience.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170011:4"/>
               <p>But ſuch things in that Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Circulation of the blood found out by me, which are tranſlated, and ſeem to reflect onely upon me, muſt firſt and chiefly be taken into conſideration by me. For ſo great a mans judgement, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch a weighty buſineſſe, is not to be ſet at nought (who is undoubtedly thought the chief, and ringleader of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſts of this age) but the opinion of him alone, is more to be weigh'd for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, than the verdicts of all others, which ſhall either applaud or contradict me, and his cenſure more to be weigh'd and look'd upon. He then in his <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Enchir.</hi> acknowledges our motion of the blood in Animals, and takes part with us, and is of our opinion, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the circulation of the blood: yet not altogether, and openly; for he ſays, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. That the blood in the port vein contained, admits no circulation, as the blood in the <hi>vena cava,</hi> and in <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. That there is blood which is circulated, and circulatory veſſels, to wit, the <hi>aorta</hi> and the <hi>vena cava,</hi> yet he denies that the branches of them have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circulation; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the blood running out into all the parts of the ſecond and third region, stayes there for nutrition, nor does it flow back to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter veſſels, but being pluck'd back by force,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170011:4"/>when the greater veſſels are in great want of blood, or when it returns with a ſudden force, or exſtimulation, to the greater circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory veſſels.</hi> And ſo a little after. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the blood of the veins, does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually or naturally aſcend, or whether it returns to the Heart, or Whether the blood of the Arteries do deſcend, or go from the Heart, yet if the leſſer veins of the arms and leggs be empty, the blood of the veins in ſucceſſion filling the empty places, may deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, which</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>I have clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt</hi> Harvey <hi>and</hi> Wallaeus. And becauſe daily experience and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Galen</hi> does comfirm the <hi>Anaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis</hi> of the <hi>veins</hi> &amp; <hi>arteries,</hi> &amp; the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Circulation of the blood; <hi>You ſee,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>how the circulation of the blood coms about, without the confuſion of humors, or the perturbation of antient medicine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which words it is known, for what cauſe the moſt famous man would partly acknowledge, partly deny the Circulation of the blood, and why he endeavours to build a reeling and tottering opinion of Circulation. Leſt, forſooth, he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the antient Phyſick, and not mov'd by truth, which he could not chuſe but ſee, but rather for fear he ſhould violate the antient rules of Phyſick, or perchance, leſt he ſsould ſeem to reſume or retract that Phyſiologie which in his <hi>Anthropolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:170011:5"/>he had publiſh'd before. For the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood does not deſtroy the antient Phyſick, but furthers it; rather it ſhow the Phyſiologie of Phyſicians, and the ſpeculation of natural things, and diſallows the Anatomical doctrine of the uſe and action of the <hi>heart, lungs;</hi> and the reſt of the intrals; and that theſe things are ſo, will appear partly out of his own words, partly out of thoſe things which I ſhall here ſet down; namely, that the whole blood, in whatſoever part of the body living it be, does move and ſhift place (as well that which is in the greater <hi>veins,</hi> and their <hi>branches</hi> and <hi>fibers,</hi> as that in the poroſities of the parts in any region of the body) does flow to the <hi>heart,</hi> &amp; flow from the <hi>heart,</hi> without interruption, inceſſantly, and never continues in one place without damage; though I do not ſay, but in ſome places it moves flower, in ſome faſter.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the moſt learned man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes only that the blood contain'd in the <hi>Porta</hi> does circulate, which he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have denied nor diſapproved of, if he had not paſſ'd over the force of his own argument: for he ſayes <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>If in every pulſation the heart receive one drop of blood, which it expels into the aorta, and does make two thouſand pulſations in an hour, there must needs a great deal of blood
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170011:5"/>paſſe through.</hi> He is likewiſe forc'd to affirm the ſame of the <hi>meſenterie,</hi> ſince through the <hi>caliacal arterie,</hi> and the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenterial arteries,</hi> there is thruſt in more than one drop of blood at every pulſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is forc'd againſt the <hi>meſenterie</hi> and its <hi>veins:</hi> inſomuch that it muſt either go out according to the juſt proportion of that which enters, otherwiſe the branches of the <hi>Porta</hi> would burſt at laſt; nor can it (for the reſolution of this doubt) be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſaid, or poſſibly be, that the blood of the <hi>meſenteric</hi> ſhould vainly, and to no purpoſe, ebb and flow through theſe <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> like an <hi>Euripus;</hi> nor the relapſe from the <hi>meſenteric</hi> by thoſe paſſages and tranſplantation by which he would have the <hi>meſenteric</hi> diſgorge it ſelf into the <hi>aorta,</hi> likely to be true; nor can it prevail againſt that which is entring by contrary motion; nor can there be any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude, where it is moſt certain that without interruption, and inceſſantly, there is an influx; but is compell'd by the ſame neceſſity, by which it is certain, that the <hi>heart</hi> doth thruſt forth the blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>menſenteriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Which is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; for otherwiſe, by the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would overthrow all Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood, if thus he ſhould, with the ſame likelihood of truth, affirm that too in the <hi>ventricles</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> namely
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170011:6"/>in the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> the blood is driven into the <hi>aorta,</hi> and in the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> returns, and the <hi>aorta</hi> disburthens it ſelf into the <hi>ventricles</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> as the <hi>ventricles</hi> again into the <hi>aorta,</hi> and ſo neither in the <hi>heart</hi> nor in the <hi>meſenterie</hi> ſhould there be any circulation, but a flux and reflux, by turns, is turned up and down with needleſſe labour: Therefore if of neceſſity in the <hi>heart</hi> is proved the circulation of the blood, for the reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid prov'd by himſelf, the ſame force of argument takes place likewiſe in the <hi>meſenterie;</hi> but if there be no circulation in the <hi>meſenterie,</hi> neither is there in the <hi>heart;</hi> for both theſe aſſertions, namely, this of the <hi>heart,</hi> that of the <hi>meſenterie,</hi> hangs upon the force of the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, onely changing the words, and is eſtabliſh'd, and falls in like manner.</p>
               <p>He ſayes, that the Sigma-like <hi>portals</hi> do hinder the regreſſe of the blood in the <hi>heart,</hi> but there are no <hi>portals</hi> in the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenterie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, neither is this true; for in the <hi>ſplenick</hi> branch, as likewiſe ſometimes in others, there are found <hi>portals.</hi> Beſides, <hi>portals</hi> are not all times requiſite in the more profound <hi>veins,</hi> nor are they found in the deep <hi>veins</hi> of the joints, but rather in the skin <hi>veins;</hi> for where the blood flowing out of the leſſe branches is prone
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170011:6"/>naturally to come into the greater, by the compreſſion of the <hi>muſcles</hi> about it it is ſufficiently hinder'd from return, but where the paſſage being open, it is forc'd; What need is there there of <hi>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals?</hi> But how much blood at every pulſation is forc'd into the <hi>meſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> is reckoned according to the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as if with an indifferent <hi>ligature</hi> you ſhould in the <hi>carpus</hi> bind the <hi>veins</hi> comming out of the hand, and entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>arteries;</hi> (for the <hi>arteries</hi> of the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenterie</hi> are greater than thoſe of the <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>) if you tell at how many pulſations the veſſel and your whole hand ſwell to their greateſt bigueſſe dividing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſubduction, you ſhall find much more than one drop of blood come in at every pulſation, notwithſtanding the <hi>ligature;</hi> nor can it return, but rather that in filling the hand it forcibly diſtends and ſwels it, we may by calculation gather, that the blood enters the <hi>meſenteric</hi> in the ſame quantity, if not in a greater, by how much the <hi>arteries</hi> of the <hi>meſenteric</hi> are greater than thoſe of the <hi>carpus.</hi> And if any ſhould but ſee and think with himſelf, with what difficultie and pains, compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>ligatures,</hi> and ſeverall means the blood is ſtaid, that leaps forcibly out of the leaſt <hi>arterie</hi> which is cut or broken, with what ſtrength (as if it were ſhot out of a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170011:7"/>ſpout) it throws off, and drives away, or paſſes through all the bindings, I think he would ſcarce beleeve that any part of blood which only enters, could againſt this impulſion and influx paſſe back again, being not able to drive it back with force. For which cauſe, conſidering theſe things with himſelf, I beleeve it would not ever enter his mind to imagin that the blood out of the <hi>veins</hi> of the <hi>porta</hi> could creep back by theſe ſame wayes, and ſo disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it ſelf into the <hi>Meſenterie,</hi> againſt ſo forcible and ſtrong an influx into the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, if the moſt learned man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not that the blood is mov'd and chang'd by circular motion, but being ſtill the ſame, it ſtands and mantles in the branches of the <hi>meſenterie;</hi> he ſeems to ſuppoſe, that there is a two-fold blood, divers, and ſerving to divers uſes and ends, and therefore it is of divers natures in the <hi>vena porta</hi> and <hi>cava,</hi> becauſe one of them for its preſervation needs circulation, the other needs not, which neither does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, nor does he demonſtrate it to be true.</p>
               <p>Beſides the moſt learned man addes in his <hi>Enchirid.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 18. <hi>A fourth ſort of veſſels to the Meſenterie, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Venae Lacteae</hi> (invented by <hi>Aſſelius) which being ſet down, he ſeems to infer that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170011:7"/>all the nutriment being drawn through them is carried to the liver, the forge of blood, which being there concocted and changed into blood,</hi> (he ſays in lib. 3. cap. 8.) <hi>it is carried to the left ventricle of the heart, which being granted,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>all the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which were antiently motion'd concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the distribution of the Chylus, and of the blood through the ſame conduit, do ceaſe, for the Venae Lacteae carry the Chylus to the Liver, and therefore theſe conduits are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and can be obſtructed apart.</hi> But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I would fain know how this can be demonſtrated to be true; If this milk be transfus'd and paſſe into the <hi>liver,</hi> how ſhall it get thence through the <hi>cava</hi> into the <hi>ventricle</hi> of the <hi>heart?</hi> (Since the moſt learned man denyes that the blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the numerous branches of the <hi>porta</hi> and the <hi>liver</hi> can paſſe, that ſo circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation may be made) but more eſpecially ſince the blood ſeems to be a great deal fuller of ſpirit, and more penetrative than the milk or <hi>chylus,</hi> which is contain'd in theſe veſſels, and is hitherto impell'd by the <hi>arteries</hi> that it may find out ſome way for its ſelf.</p>
               <p>The moſt learned man makes mention of a certain Treatiſe of his concerning the Circulation of the blood, I wiſh I could ſee it, I might perchance recant.</p>
               <p>But if the moſt learned man thought it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170011:8"/>more fit to place the circular motion of the blood in the <hi>veins</hi> of the <hi>porta,</hi> and branches of the <hi>cava,</hi> (as he ſays in his 3. Book Chap. 8. <hi>In the veins the blood does perpetnally and naturally aſcend or return to the heart, as likewiſe that which is in all the arteries deſcends and departs from the heart.</hi> I ſay, I do not ſee, but upon this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition all difficulties which were objected of old of the diſtribution of the <hi>Chylus,</hi> &amp; blood, through theſe ſame conduits, ſhould likewiſe ceaſe, that hence forward he ſhould not need to enquire apart for, or to ſet down veſſels for the <hi>chylus;</hi> ſeeing as the <hi>Umbilical veins</hi> do draw their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive juice from the liquors of the egg, and carries it to the nouriſhing and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the Chick whilſt it is yet an <hi>Embryon,</hi> ſo do the <hi>meſeraick veins</hi> ſuck the <hi>chylus</hi> from the <hi>inteſtines,</hi> and carry it to the <hi>liver,</hi> and what hinders us to aſſert, that it does the like in thoſe of riper age? for all difficulties ceaſe, when there are not two contrary motions ſuppoſed in the ſame veſſels; but that we do ſuppoſe that there is one continued motion in the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeraicks</hi> from the <hi>inteſtines</hi> to the <hi>Liver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall tell you in another place what is to be thought of the <hi>venae Lacteae,</hi> when I ſhall ſpeak of milk found in ſeveral parts of creatures new born, eſpecially in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, for it is found in the <hi>meſenterie</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170011:8"/>all its glandules, as alſo in the <hi>chymus,</hi> likewiſe in the arm-pits and paps of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the Midwives milk out the blood for their health as they beleeve.</p>
               <p>But moreover it pleas'd the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Riolan,</hi> not only to deprive the blood contain'd in the <hi>meſenterie</hi> of circulation, but alſo he affirms, that neither the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>vena cava,</hi> or its <hi>arterie,</hi> or any part of the ſecond or third region ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of circulation, ſo that only he cals the <hi>vena cava</hi> &amp; the <hi>aorta</hi> circulatory veſſels, for which in his 3 Book Chap. 8. he gives a very faint reaſon, <hi>Becauſe the blood,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>flowing into all parts of the ſecond and third region remains there for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment nor does it flow back to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter veſſels, unleſs it be revulſed by the force and want of blood in the greater veſſels, or flow back, being ſtirr'd with a ſudden force, to the circulatory veſſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is indeed of neceſſity, that the portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which paſſes into nouriſhment, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, for otherwiſe it ſhould not nouriſh unleſs it be aſſimilated, &amp; ſtay there, in lieu of that which is loſt, &amp; ſo become one: but it is not needfull, that the whole influx of blood ſhould remain there for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo little a portion; for every part does not uſe ſo much blood for its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, as it contains in its <hi>veins, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and <hi>poroſities,</hi> nor is it neceſſary
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170011:9"/>in his afflux and reflux that it ſhould leave no nouriſhment within it; where fore it is not neceſſary that for nutrition it ſhould all ſtay, but likewiſe the moſt learned man himſelf, in the very ſame book in which he affirms this, does ſeem every where almoſt to affirm the contrary, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially where he ſets down the circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the brain, and by circulation (ſayes he) the brain does ſend back blood to the <hi>heart,</hi> and ſo the <hi>heart</hi> is refrigerated. After which ſort likewiſe, the remote parts may be ſaid to refrigerat the <hi>heart,</hi> whence alſo in feavers, when the parts about the <hi>heart</hi> are grievouſly ſcorched and inflam'd with feaveriſh heat, laying naked their joints, and throwing off the cloaths, ſick people endeavor to cool their <hi>heart,</hi> whilſt (as the moſt learned man affirms of the brain) the blood being refrigerated and allayd of its heat, do's then go to the <hi>heart</hi> through the <hi>veins,</hi> and does refrigerat it. Whence the moſt learned man ſeems to inſinuate a kind of neceſſity, that as from the brains, ſo there is a circulation from all the parts, otherwiſe than before he had openly declar'd. But indeed he cautiouſly and ambiguouſly affirms. That the blood does not flow back from the parts of the ſecond and third region, unleſſe, ſays he being revuls'd by the force and great want of blood in the bigger veſſels, or that it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170011:9"/>does by a ſudden forcible motion flow back to the greater circulatory veſſels, which is moſt true, if theſe words be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a true ſenſe; for by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter veſſels, in which he ſays want cauſes a reflux. I beleeve he underſtands the <hi>vena cava,</hi> or the circulatory <hi>veins,</hi> not the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries;</hi> for the <hi>arteries</hi> are never empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but into the <hi>veins,</hi> or <hi>pores</hi> of the parts, but they are continually ſtuff'd full by the pulſe of the <hi>heart.</hi> If all the parts did not inceſſantly refund blood in abundance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>vena cava,</hi> and the circulatory veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, out of which the blood very ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſes, and haſtens to the <hi>heart,</hi> there would quickly be a great want of blood. Beſides that, the blood which is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all the parts of the ſecond and third region, by the force of the blood direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and driven by every pulſe, is fore'd out of the pores into the <hi>veins,</hi> out of the branches into the greater veſſels, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the motion and compreſſion of the parts adjacent; for that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd is thruſt out by every thing contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, when it is preſſ'd and ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſo by the motion of the <hi>muſcles</hi> and the joints, the branches of the <hi>veins</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing between being preſſ'd and ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thruſt the blood contain'd in the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer veſſels into the greater.</p>
               <p>But it is not to be doubted, that the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170011:10"/>blood is continually and inceſſantly dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and comes with force from the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and never flows back; if it be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in every pulſe all the <hi>arteries</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are diſtended by the propulſion of blood, and that the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> as the moſt learned man confeſſes, is from the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the <hi>heart;</hi> nor does the blood once gone forth, return into the <hi>ventricles</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> by reaſon that the <hi>portals</hi> are ſhut, if (I ſay) the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man do beleeve theſe things, as it ſeems he does, it will eaſily be underſtood in every part of what region ſoever, by what ſtuffing or impulſion the blood in them contained is forcibly thruſt down.</p>
               <p>For ſo far as the <hi>arteries</hi> beat, ſo far reaches the influx and the force, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is felt in all parts of every region, for there is a pulſe every where in the tops of our fingers, and under the nails, nor is there any part in our whole body, either ſore with boil or fellon, which does not feel the pricking motion of the beating of the <hi>arterie,</hi> and its endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the <hi>continuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further it is manifeſt, that the blood does make a regreſſe in the pores of the parts, in the skin of the hands and feet, for ſometimes in great froſt and cold ſeaſons we ſee the hands and joints, eſpecially of boys, ſo cold, that at the very touch they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170011:10"/>do almoſt reſemble the coldneſſe of Ice, and are ſo benummed and ſtiff, that there is ſcarce any life in them, nor motion, and yet in the mean time they are full of blood ſeeming red or blew, which parts can again by no means be warm'd, unleſſe by Circulation that refrigerate blood be thruſt out, and in its place, new, warm, and ſpirituous blood flowing in do foment and re-warm the parts, and reſtore to them motion and ſenſe; for they ſhould never be renew'd or reſtor'd by external heat, no more than the members of dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, unleſs ſome internal influent warmth did refreſh them. This indeed is the chief uſe &amp; end of the Circulation of the blood, for which cauſe, the blood by its continual courſe, and perpetual influence, is driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; namely, that all the parts depending upon it by their firſt innate warm moiſture might be retain'd in life, and in their own vital and vegetative eſſence, and perform all their functions, whilſt (as the Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts ſay) they are ſuſtain'd and actuated by natural heat, and vital ſpirits; ſo by the help of two extremities, heat and cold, the temper of the bodies of creatures is kept in its mediocrity: for as the breathing in of air does temper the too much heat of the blood in the <hi>lungs,</hi> and in the centre of the body, and cauſes the eventilation of ſuffocating fumes; ſo alſo the blood being
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170011:11"/>hot, and caſt out through the <hi>arteries</hi> into the whole body, does foment and nouriſh the extremities in living creatures and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them to be extinguiſh'd by the force of outward cold.</p>
               <p>Therefore it were injuſt and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if every little part of what region ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould not enjoy the benefit of the tranſmutation and circulation of the blood, for whoſe ſake Circulation ſeems chiefly to be appointed by Nature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that I may conclude, for you ſee how the Circulation of the blood is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd without perturbation or confuſion of the humors, in all the body, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, both in the greater and in the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer veſſels, and that by neceſſity, and for the benefit of all the parts, without which, being cold and impotent, they could never be reſtor'd, or remain alive. It is enough, becauſe its clear, that all influence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative heat does come through the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,</hi> and is done by circulation.</p>
               <p>For which cauſe moſt learned <hi>Riolan</hi> ſeems to me, when he ſayes, that in ſome parts there is no Circulation, to ſpeak rather officiouſly, than truth; to wit, that he might pleaſe moſt men, and oppoſe no body, and that he rather wrote humane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than gravely, in the behalf of the truth. As he likewiſe ſeems to do (<hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap</hi> 8.) when he would rather have the blood to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170011:11"/>come into the <hi>left ventricle</hi> through the <hi>ſeptum</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> through uncertain and hidden paſſages, than through the large and moſt open veſſels of the <hi>lungs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made with <hi>Portals</hi> artificially to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its return. I deſire to ſee the reaſon of the impoſſibility and inconvenience which he ſays he propounded elſewhere. It is a wonder, ſince the <hi>Aorta</hi> and <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Arterioſa,</hi> are of the ſame bigneſſe, conſtitution, and frame, that their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould not be the ſame. But that is very improbable that the great River of the whole maſſe of blood ſhould in ſo great abundance go into the <hi>left ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> by ſo blind and ſmall a winding of the <hi>ſeptum,</hi> which ſhould anſwer both to the entrie from the <hi>vena cava</hi> in the right ſide of the <hi>heart,</hi> and alſo its egreſſe from the <hi>left,</hi> which do both require ſuch wide <hi>orifices.</hi> But he has likewiſe produc'd theſe things ſtaggeringly, for in <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ca</hi> 6. he ordains the <hi>lungs</hi> as a ſink or paſſage from the <hi>heart,</hi> and he ſays, <hi>The lungs are affected by that blood which paſſes through, whilſt its filth flowes together with that blood;</hi> ſo he ſayes likewiſe, <hi>That the lungs acquire corruption by diſtemper'd, and ill-conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'dintralls, which furniſh the heart with impure blood, whoſe fault the heart cannot help, but by many circulations.</hi> He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170011:12"/>in the ſame place, concerning letting of blood, and ſhortneſſe of breath, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the <hi>veins</hi> with the veſſels of the <hi>lungs,</hi> ſays againſt <hi>Galen, If it be rue that the blood does naturally paſſe from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs that it may be carryed to the left ventricle, and ſo to the aorta; and if the Circulation of the blood be admitted, who ſees not in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the lungs, that the blood flows thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in greater abundance, and oppreſſes the lungs, unleſſe they be first largely emptied, every part taking a ſhare to caſe them; which was</hi> Hippocrates <hi>advice, from all parts of the body, head, noſe, tongue, arms, feet, to take away the blood, that the quantity of it might be impaired, and that it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed from the lungs, and ſo draws out the blood till the body was quite without blood.</hi> He ſays likewiſe, <hi>The Circulation being ſuppos'd, the lungs are eaſily emptied by breathing a vein. If this counſel be rejected, I ſee not how it can be revuls'd from thence; for if it flow back through the vena arterioſa into the right ventricle, the Sigmoidal por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals hinder it, and the three-pointed portals hinder the regreſs out of the right ventricle into the vena cava. Therfore by Circulation the bload will be exhauſted, by cutting the veins of the arms and feet. And likewiſe</hi> Pernelius <hi>his opinion in the affections of the lungs is deſtroy'd, that blood is rather to be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170011:12"/>taken out of the right arm than out of the left, for the blood cannot return into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na cava, unleſſe it break through two gates and bars which are placed in the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He addes moreover in the ſame place, (lib. 3. cap. 6.) <hi>If the Circulation of the blood be admitted, and that it doth paſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten through the lungs, and not through the middle of the Septum of the heart, there is a two-fold Circulation of the blood to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, one of which is perfected by the heart and the lungs, whilſt the blood leaping out from the right ventricle of the heart is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the lungs, that it may come to the left ventricle of the heart; for leaping out from the ſame inward part, it returns to it, then by another larger circulation flowing out of the left ventricle of the beart, it goes about the whole body, and runs through the arteries and veins to the right ventricle of the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt learned man in this place might have added the third circulation, which is a very ſhort one, out of the left <hi>ventricle</hi> into the <hi>right,</hi> drawing about a part of the blood through the <hi>coronall arteriese</hi> and <hi>veins,</hi> by its branches, which are diſtributed about the bodie, walls, and <hi>ſeptum</hi> of the <hi>heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſays, <hi>He that admits of one circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot deny the other.</hi> So might he have added, nor can he refurſe the third.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170011:13"/>For to what purpoſe ſhould the <hi>coronal arteries</hi> beat in the <hi>heart,</hi> if they did not drive blood thither? and why ſhould the <hi>veins,</hi> (whoſe function and end it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive blood put into them by the <hi>arteries</hi>) but that they might draw blood from the <hi>heart?</hi> Moreover in the <hi>orfice</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronal arterie</hi> (as the learned man himſelf confeſſes, in his third Book and his ninth Chapter,) there is a <hi>portal</hi> which forbids, all entrance, and is patent to egreſſe: therefore truely he cannot but admit of the third Circulation, who likewiſe admits of another univerſal one, and that the blood does likewiſe paſſe through the <hi>lungs</hi> and the brain, <hi>(lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.) For neither can there be an admittance of blood by pulſation, in all parts of every region, nor regreſſe by the <hi>veins</hi> after the ſame manner, and therefore he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that the parts admit of Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is clear from theſe very words of the moſt learned man, what his opinion is, both of the Circulation of the blood through the whole bodie, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe through the <hi>lungs</hi> and the reſt of the parts; for the that admits of the firſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, it is clear that he does not reject the other: For how can it be, that he who has admitted of another Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through the whole body ſo often, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170011:13"/>through the greater circulatory veſſels, ſhould deny that univerſal Circulation in any of the branches or parts of the ſecond or third region? As if all the <hi>veins</hi> &amp; thoſe greater circulatory veſſels, as he cals them, were not number'd by himſelf, and by all others, amongſt the veſſels of the ſecond region. Is it poſſible that there ſhould be circulation through the whole body, and not through all the parts? and therefore where he denies it he does it very ſtamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, and only ſtaggers and palliates in his negations; there where he affirms he ſpeaks underſtandingly and as becomes a Philoſopher, and as a skilful Phyſician and an honeſt man, gives his advice in this caſe, that in the dangerous diſeaſes of the <hi>lungs</hi> the letting of blood is the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, againſt <hi>Gales</hi> and his beloved <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius:</hi> in which thing if he had been doubtfull, far be it from a Chriſtian and ſo learned a man, to recommend his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to poſterity, to procure death, and the hazzard of mens lives, or that he ſhould recede from <hi>Fernelius</hi> or <hi>Galen,</hi> men in high eſteem with him. Therefore whatſoever he has denyed of the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>meſenterie,</hi> or any other part, in favour of the antient Doctrine of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or the <hi>Venae Lacteae,</hi> or for any other regard, it is to be attributed to his civility and modeſty, and to be prdoned.</p>

               <p>I think it does already appear clearly enough, both from the words and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the moſt learned man himſelf, that there is a circulation every where, and that blood whereſoever it is, does change place, and paſſe through the <hi>veins</hi> to the <hi>heart;</hi> and the moſt learned man ſeems to be of the ſame opinion with me; Therefore it needs not, yea it were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to bring hither my arguments which I have publiſhed in my Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the motion of the blood, for the further confirmation of this truth, which are taken both from the frame of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, placing of the <hi>portals,</hi> and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and obſervations; eſpecially ſince I have not as yet ſeen the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedd mans Treatiſe of the Circulation of the blood, nor as yet any of the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mans Arguments, but only a bare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, by which being induced he ſhould reject the circulation in the regions and veſſels, which he allows to be univerſal in moſt of the parts.</p>
               <p>It is indeed true, that I did find out of the authority of <hi>Galen,</hi> and by dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to be a <hi>refugium</hi> the <hi>Anaſtomoſis</hi> of the veſlels, yet ſo great a man as he is, ſo diligent, ſo curious, ſo expert an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſt, ſhould firſt have laid open and ſhown <hi>Anaſtomoſes,</hi> and thoſe viſible and open ones, and whirlpools proportionable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170011:14"/>to the imperuous ſtream of the whole blood, and the orifices of the branches, (from which he has taken away circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) before he had rejected thoſe which were moſt probable and moſt open. He was oblig'd to demonſtrate and declare where they are, how they are fram'd, whether they are not onely fit for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromiſſion of blood (as we ſee the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> inſerted in the bladder) and not for the return of it, or what other way ſoever they had been. But perchance I ſpeak too boldly for neither the learned man, nor <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, could by any experience ever behold the ſenſible <hi>Anaſtomoſes,</hi> or ever could demonſtrate them to the ſenſe.</p>
               <p>I did look after them with all poſſible diligence, and was not at a little charge and pains in the ſearch of the <hi>Anaſtomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> yet could I never find that any veſſell, namely the <hi>arteries,</hi> together with the <hi>veins,</hi> were joyn'd by their <hi>orifices:</hi> I ſhould willingly learn from others who aſcribe ſo much to <hi>Galen,</hi> that they dare ſwear all which he ſays. Nor is there any <hi>Anaſtomoſis</hi> in the <hi>liver, milt, lungs, reins,</hi> or any other of the intrals, although I did boyl them till the whole <hi>Parenchyme</hi> was made mouldering, and like duſt was ſhaken off, and taken away with the point of a needle, from all the <hi>fibers</hi> of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170011:15"/>ſo that I could ſee the <hi>fibers,</hi> and the laſt grains of every diviſion. I dare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore boldy affirm, that neither the <hi>vena porta</hi> has any <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> with the <hi>cava,</hi> nor the <hi>veins</hi> with the <hi>arteries,</hi> or the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar branches</hi> of the pore of the <hi>choller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagg,</hi> which are diſpers'd about all the flat of the <hi>liver</hi> with the <hi>veins.</hi> Only this you may obſerve in a freſh <hi>liver,</hi> that all the branches of the <hi>vena cava</hi> which creep through the whole bunch of the <hi>liver,</hi> have <hi>tunicles</hi> pierc'd with many holes like a ſive, as it is in a ſink, fram'd ſo for the receiving of the blood which falls down. The branches of the <hi>Porta</hi> are not ſo, but are divided into ſtems, and how that both the diviſions of theſe veſſels, the one in the flat, the other in the gibbous part, doe run round to the very furtheſt riſing of that intrall without any <hi>Anaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only in three places doe I find that which is equivalent to an <hi>Anaſtomoſis.</hi> There riſes in the brain, from the ſoporall <hi>arteries</hi> creeping down into the <hi>Baſis,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and unintangled <hi>fibers,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards make up the <hi>plexus chorois,</hi> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the <hi>ventricles</hi> doe at laſt end in the third receptacle, which performs the office of a <hi>vein.</hi> In the <hi>spermaticall</hi> veſſels, commonly call'd preparatory, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>arteries</hi> drawn from the great <hi>arterie</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:170011:15"/>do adhere to the <hi>veins</hi> preparatory afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, which they accompany, and at laſt are ſo receiv'd within their <hi>Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> ſo that at the firſt they ſeem both to have one and the ſame, ſo that when they end at the upper part of the <hi>teſticles</hi> where that part paſſes forth into a point, which is called the varicous and vine-like body, we know not what to call them, <hi>veins</hi> or <hi>arteries,</hi> or the ends of both. As likewiſe the laſt appearances of the <hi>arteries</hi> which goe to the <hi>Vmbilical vein,</hi> are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated in the <hi>Tunicles</hi> of that <hi>vein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What doubt is to be made, if through ſuch gulphes, the little branches of the <hi>arteria magna,</hi> ſwoln with the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and inſtuffing of blood, could be eas'd of ſo great and ſo conſpicuous a ſtream? Nature at leaſt would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have denyed us viſible and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible paſſages, ſincks and whirlpools, if ſhe had had intention to have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the flux of the blood thither, and by that meanes have deprived the leſſer branches, and the ſolide parts of the benefit of the influx of blood.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I will ſet down one expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, which ſeems to be ſufficient for the clearing of the Anaſtomoſes, and for the overthrowing of their uſe,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170011:16"/>and of the paſſage of the blood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of it out of the <hi>veins</hi> into the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,</hi> by thoſe wayes.</p>
               <p>Opening the breaſt of any creature, and tying the <hi>vena cava</hi> by the <hi>heart,</hi> ſo that nothing can paſſe that way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>heart,</hi> and preſently cutting the <hi>jugular arteries,</hi> not touching the <hi>veins</hi> on neither ſide, If by giving vent you ſee the <hi>arteries</hi> emptied, and not the <hi>veins</hi> too, I hope it will be clear that the blood is carryed out of the <hi>veins</hi> into the <hi>arteries,</hi> no where but through the <hi>ventricles</hi> of the <hi>heart.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (as <hi>Galen</hi> has obſerv'd) in a little ſpace we ſhould ſee the <hi>veins</hi> emptyed, and deſtitute of blood by the efflux of the <hi>arteries.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt learned <hi>Riolan,</hi> by the help of the Preſſe, many years ago, I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a part of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: But ſince the birth-day of the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Blood, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no day has paſt, nor the leaſt ſpace of time, in which I have not heard both good and evill of the Circulation of the Blood which I found out: Others rail at it, as a tender babie unworthy to come to light; Others ſay, that its worthy to be foſter'd and favour my writings, and defend them; Some with great diſdain oppoſe them; Some with mighty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pauſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170011:17"/>protect them; Others ſay, that I have abundantly by many experiments, obſervations, and ocular teſtimony, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd the Circulation of the blood, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſtrength and force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Others think it not yet ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuſtratted, and vindicated from obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: But there are who cry out, that I have affected a vain commendation in diſſection of living creatures, and do with childiſh ſlighting diſpraiſe and deride at Frogs and Serpents, Gnats, and other more inconſiderable creatures brought upon the Stage, and refrain not from ill language. But I think it a thing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Philoſopher and a ſearcher of the truth, to return bad words for bad words, and I think I ſhall doe better and more adviſed, if with the light of true and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent obſervations I ſhall wipe away thoſe ſymptomes of incivility.</p>
               <p>It cannot be eſchewed but doggs will bark and belch up their ſurfets; nor can it be help'd, but that the Cynicks will be amongſt the number of the Philoſophers: but we muſt take a ſpeciall care that they doe not bite, nor infect us with their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell madneſſe, or leſt they ſhould with their doggs teeth gnaw the very bones or principles of truth.</p>
               <p>Detractors, Momes, and writers ſtaind with railing, as I never intended to read
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170011:18"/>any of them (from whom nothing of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, nor any thing extraordinary is to be hop'd for, but bad words) ſo did I much leſſe think them worthy of an anſwer: Let them enjoy their own curſed nature, I beleeve they will find but a few favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Readers; neither does God give wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the wicked, which is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gift, and moſt to be ſought for: Let them rail on ſtill, till they be weary (if not aſham'd) of it.</p>
               <p>If you will enter with <hi>Heraclitus</hi> in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> into a work-houſe (for ſo I will call it) for inſpection of viler creatures, come hithet, for the immortal gods are here likewiſe; and the great and Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Father is ſometimes moſt conſpicuous in the leaſt and moſt inconſiderable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>In my book concerning the motion of the <hi>heart</hi> and blood in creatures, I only choſe out thoſe things out of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other obſervations, by which I either thought that errours were confuted, or truth was confirm'd; I left out many things as unneceſſary and unprofitable, which notwithſtanding are diſcernable by diſſection and ſenſe; of which I ſhall now adde ſome in few words, in favour of thoſe that deſire to learn. The great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of <hi>Galen</hi> is of ſo much account with every body, that I ſee many make a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170011:18"/>as concerning that experiment of <hi>Galen</hi> of the <hi>ligature</hi> of the <hi>artenie</hi> above the pipe, thruſt within the concavity of the <hi>arterie,</hi> by which it is demonſtrated, that the pulſe of the <hi>arterie</hi> comes from the facultie pulſifick, and that it is tranſmitted from the <hi>heart</hi> by the <hi>tunicles,</hi> and not by the impulſion of the blood within the Concavities; and therefore that the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> are ſtretch'd as bellowes, not as baggs.</p>
               <p>This experiment is mentioned by <hi>Veſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> a man very skilfull in Anatomy, but neither <hi>Galen</hi> nor <hi>Veſalius</hi> ſays, that they tryed this experiment, which I did; only <hi>Veſalius</hi> preſcribes it, and <hi>Galen</hi> counſells it to thoſe that are deſirous no find out the truth, not thinking, nor knowing the difficulty of that buſineſſe, nor the vanity of it when it is done, ſince although it be perform'd with all manner of diligence, it makes nothing to the confirmation of that opinion, which affirms That the tunicles are the cauſe of pulſation, but rather ſhows That it is ſet a-work by the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the blood. For ſo ſoon as above the reed or pipe you have with a band ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>arterie,</hi> the <hi>arterie</hi> above the <hi>liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is preſently dilated by the impulſion of the blood beyond the mouth of the pipe, from whence both the flux is ſtop'd, and the impulſion reverberated, ſo that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170011:19"/>the <hi>arterie</hi> under the band does beat with very little appearance, becauſe the force of the paſſage of the blood does no way aſſiſt it, becauſe it is return'd above the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature; but if the <hi>arterie</hi> the cut off below the pipe, you ſhall ſee the contrary, from the leaping of the blood which is thrown out, and driven through the pipe, as in an Aneuriſm I have obſerv'd to come fró the exeſion of the <hi>tunicles</hi> of the <hi>arterie,</hi> this (whilſt the blood is containd within the membranes) hath a contentive veſſel of its flux praenaturally made, not of the dilated <hi>tunicles</hi> of the <hi>arterie,</hi> but of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the membrane and fleſh. You ſhall ſee the inferiour <hi>arteries</hi> beyond this Aneuriſm beat very weakly, whilſt above, and eſpecially in the Aneuriſm it ſelf, the pulſations appear great and vehement, although we cannot there imagine, that the impulſe or dilatation is made by the <hi>tunicles</hi> of the <hi>arteries,</hi> or by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the faculty of the <hi>Cyſt;</hi> but meerly by the impulſion of the blood.</p>
               <p>But that the error of <hi>Veſalius,</hi> and the ſmall experience of others may the more clearly appear, who affirm (as they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine) that the part under the pipe does not beat when the band is tyed. I ſpeak by experience, if you make the experiment rightly, that it will; and whereas they ſay,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170011:19"/>that upon the untying the band the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> below xdo beat backwards, I ſay that the part below beats leſſe when you have untyed it, then when it is tyed.</p>
               <p>But the effuſion of blood which leaps out of the wound confuſes all, and makes the experiment vain and to no purpoſe, ſo that there can be no certainty demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as I ſaid, by reaſon of the blood. But if (and this I know by experience) you lay open the <hi>arterie,</hi> and hold with your finger cloſe that part which you cut, you may at your pleaſure try many things which will evidently make the truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you. Firſt, you ſhall feel the blood, being forc'd, comming down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>arterie,</hi> by which you ſhall ſee the <hi>arterie</hi> dilated; as likewiſe you may ſqueez out and let go the blood as you pleaſe: If you open a little part of the <hi>orifice</hi> and look narrowly to it, you ſhall ſee the blood at every pulſe to be thrown out with a leaping, and as we ſaid in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an <hi>arterie,</hi> or in the <hi>perforation</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> you ſhall ſee the blood to be thrown out in every contraction of the <hi>heart,</hi> in the dilatation of the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you ſuffer it to flow with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and continuall flux, and give it leave to break out, either through the pipe, or by the open <hi>orifice,</hi> in the ſtreaming of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170011:20"/>it both by your ſight and by your touch you ſhall find all the ſtroaks, order, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and intermiſſion of the <hi>heart;</hi> juſt as you might feel in the pulſe of your hand water ſquirted through a ſyringe at divers and ſeverall ſhootings, ſo you may perceive both by your ſight and by its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the blood leaping out with a vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unequall force. I have ſeen it ſometimes in the cutting of the <hi>jugular ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie</hi> break out with ſuch force, that the blood being forc'd againſt the hand, did by its reverberation and refraction, flye back four or five foot.</p>
               <p>But that this doubt may be more clear, that the pulſifick force does not flow through the <hi>Tunicles</hi> of the <hi>arteries</hi> from the <hi>hoant,</hi> I have a little piece of the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie</hi> deſcendant, together with two cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall branches of it, about the length of a ſpan, taken out of the body of a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman, which turn'd to be a bone like a pipe, by the hollow of which, whilſt this worthy Gentleman was alive, the blood in its deſcent to the feet did agitate the <hi>arteries</hi> by its impulſion; in which caſe nevertheleſſe, although the <hi>arterie</hi> were in the ſame condition as if it had been bound or tyed above the little conduit-pipe, according to the experiment of <hi>Galen,</hi> that it could not either be dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in that place, nor ſtreightned like a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170011:20"/>pair of bellowes, nor from the <hi>heart</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its pulſifick force, to the inferior and leſſer <hi>arteries,</hi> nor yet carry through the ſolid ſubſtance of the bones that faculty which it had not receiv'd; yet I very well remember that I often obſerv'd whilſt he was alive, that the pulſe of the inferiour <hi>arterie</hi> did move in his legs and feet: wherefore it muſt needs follow, that in in that worthy Gentleman the inferiour <hi>arteries</hi> were dilated by the impulſion of the blood, like baggs, and not like bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, by the ſtretching of the <hi>tunicles.</hi> For there muſt needs arrive the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, and interception of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifick faculty, the <hi>tunicle</hi> of the <hi>arterie</hi> being wholly converted into a conduit or pipe of bone, as might arrive from the reed or pipe which was tyed, that the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie</hi> might not beat.</p>
               <p>I knew likewiſe in another worthy and gallant Gentleman, the <hi>aorta</hi> and a part of the great <hi>arterie</hi> near the <hi>heart,</hi> turn'd into a round bone. So <hi>Galens</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at leaſt one anſwerable to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not found out by induſtry, was found out by chance, and does manifeſtly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the interception of the pulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick faculty is not intercepted by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or <hi>ligature</hi> of the <hi>Tunicles,</hi> ſo that by that means the <hi>arteries</hi> cannot beat; and if the experiment which <hi>Galen</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:170011:21"/>preſcribes, were rightly perform'd by any it would refute the opinion which <hi>Veſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> thought from thence to have confirm'd. Yet for this cauſe do we not deny all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the tunicles of the <hi>arteries,</hi> but do attribute that to it which we grant to the <hi>heart,</hi> namely, that there is a coarcta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a <hi>Syſtole</hi> in the <hi>tunicles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and from their diſtenſion a regreſs to their naturall conſtitution. But if this is to be obſerv'd, that they are not dilated and ſtreightned for the ſame cauſe, nor by the ſame inſtrument, but by ſeverall, as you may obſerve in the motion of all the parts, and in the <hi>heart;</hi> it is diſtended by the <hi>ear,</hi> contracted by it ſelf, ſo the <hi>arteries</hi> are dilated by the <hi>heart,</hi> and fall of themſelves.</p>
               <p>So you may make another experiment after the ſame manner. If you fill two ſawcers of the ſame meaſure, one of them with <hi>arterial blood</hi> which leaps out, the the other with <hi>venal blood,</hi> drawn out of a <hi>vein</hi> of the ſame Animal, you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently by your ſenſe, and afterwards too, when both the bloods are grown cold, obſerve what is the difference betwixt both the bloods, againſt thoſe who do fancy another ſort of blood in the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> than is in the <hi>veins;</hi> namely they do aſcribe to the <hi>veins</hi> a freſher ſort of blood, I doe not know which way boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170011:21"/>or blown up, ſwelling or bubbling, (like to honey or milk upon the fire) and ſo taking up more room.</p>
               <p>For if the blood which is driven out of the <hi>left ventricle</hi> into the <hi>arteries</hi> ſhould be leaven'd, ſo as to be blown up, and foam after that manner, ſo that a drop or two ſhould fill all the concavity of the <hi>aorta,</hi> no doubt it would when it fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain return to the quantity of ſome few drops (which cauſe ſome do allege for the emptineſs of the <hi>arteries</hi> in dead men) and the ſame would be ſeen in the <hi>cotyla</hi> full of <hi>arterial</hi> blood; for ſo we find that it comes to paſſe in the cooling of milk or honey. But if in either <hi>cotyla</hi> the blood be found of the ſame colour, and congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, of a not much different conſiſtence, and ſqueezing out the whey after the ſame manner, and if it take up the ſame room both when it is hot and when it is cold, I think it will be a ſufficient argument to gain any mans beleef, and to confute the dreams of ſome, that there is neither in the <hi>left ventricle</hi> and ſort of blood diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from that of the <hi>right,</hi> (as you may find out both by ſenſe and reaſon) for you muſt needs likewiſe affirm. that the <hi>vena arterioſa</hi> ſhould equally be diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with one drop of blood foaming up, and therefore that there is juſt ſuch bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and leaven'd blood in the <hi>right</hi> as in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170011:22"/>the <hi>left,</hi> ſeeing the entry of the <hi>vena arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſa,</hi> and the egreſſe of the <hi>aorta,</hi> is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent and equall.</p>
               <p>Three things are chiefly ready to breed this opinion of the diverſity of blood. One is, that in the cutting of an <hi>arterie</hi> they ſee brighter blood drawn out; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, that in the diſſection of dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they find both the <hi>left ventricle</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> and all the <hi>arteries</hi> ſo empty; A third is, that they imagine that the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial blood</hi> is more ſpirituous, and more replete with Spirits; and therefore they think that it takes up more room: The cauſe and reaſon of all which things why they come to be ſo, by inſpection is perceiv'd.</p>
               <p>Firſt, inſomuch as concerns the colour, alwayes and every where blood comming through a narrow hole, is as as it were ſtrained and becomes thinner, and the lighter part of it, and which ſwims above, and is more penetrable, is thruſt out: ſo in <hi>Phlebotomie,</hi> the blood which ſprings out with great flux or force, and out of a greater <hi>orifice,</hi> and flies further, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thicker, fuller, and darker colour'd; but if it flow drops, (as it does out of a <hi>vein</hi> when the <hi>ligature</hi> is unty'd) it is brighter, for it is ſtraind as it were, and only the thinner part comes out, as in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170011:22"/>bleeding at noſe, or that which is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Leeches or Cupping-glaſſes, or any way iſſuing by <hi>diapedeſin,</hi> is always ſeen more bright; becauſe the thickneſſe and hardneſſe of the <hi>tunicles</hi> becomes more impaſſible, nor yeelds ſo pliably as to give an open way for the comming out of the blood: As it likewiſe happens in fat bodies, when by the fat under the skin the <hi>orifice</hi> of the <hi>vein</hi> is ſtop'd, then the blood appears thinner, brighter, and as if it did flow from an <hi>arterie.</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if you receive in a ſawcer the blood when you have cut an <hi>arterie,</hi> if it flow freely, it ſhall appear like <hi>venal</hi> blood, there is blood much brighter in the <hi>lungs,</hi> and ſqueez'd out from thence, than any is found in the <hi>arteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The emptineſſe of the <hi>arteries</hi> in dead bodies (which did perchance cozen <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtrasus,</hi> inſomuch that he thought that the <hi>arteries</hi> containd only aerial ſpirits) proceeds from hence, becauſe that when the <hi>lungs</hi> fall (their paſſages being ſtopt) the <hi>lungs</hi> do breath no longer, ſo that the blood cannot freely paſſe through them, yet the <hi>heart</hi> continues a while in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, whence both the <hi>left ventricle</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> is more contracted, and the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> likewiſe empty, and not fill'd by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of blood, appear empty: But if the <hi>heart</hi> ceaſe both at one time, and the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170011:23"/>
                  <hi>lungs</hi> to give paſſage by reſpiration, as it is in thoſe who are drowned in cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or in thoſe who are taken ſuddenly with unexpected death, you ſhall find both the <hi>veins</hi> and the <hi>arteries</hi> full.</p>
               <p>As concerning the third, of the Spirits, what they are, and of what conſiſtence, and how they are in the body, whether they be apart and diſtinct from the ſolid parts, or mix'd with them, there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo divers opinions, that it is no wonder if Spirits, whoſe nature is left ſo doubtfull, do ſerve for a common eſcape to ignorance: For commonly ignorant perſons when they cannot give a reaſon for any thing, they ſay preſently that it is done by Spirits, and bring in Spirits as performers in all caſes, and like as bad Poets, doe bring in the gods upon the Scene by head and ears, to make the <hi>Exit</hi> and <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of their play.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fernelius</hi> and others do imagine aerial Spirits, and inviſible ſubſtances; for he proves that there are animal Spirit (juſt as <hi>Eraſistratus</hi> proves them in the <hi>arteries</hi>) becauſe there are little cells in the brains which are empty, and ſince there is no <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> he concludes, that in living men they are full of Spirits.</p>
               <p>Yet all the School of Phyſicians agrees upon three ſorts of Spirits, that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Spirits flow through the <hi>veins,</hi> the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170011:23"/>through the <hi>arteries,</hi> and the animal through the <hi>nerves,</hi> whence the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſay out of <hi>Galen,</hi> that the parts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times want the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the brain, becauſe the faculty, together with its eſſence, is ſometimes hinder'd, and ſometime with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the eſſence. Over and above beſides theſe three ſorts of influxive ſpirtis, they ſeem to aſſert ſo many more, which are implanted. But none of all theſe have we found by diſſection, neither in the <hi>veins, nerves, arteries,</hi> nor parts of living perſons. Some make corporeal Spirits, other ſome incorporeal Spirits; and thoſe who make corporeal ſpirits ſometimes ſay, that the blood or thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt part of the blood is the conjunction of the ſoul with the body; ſometimes they ſay, that the Spirits are containd in the blood (as flame in ſmoke) and ſuſtain'd by the perpetuall flux of it; ſometimes they do diſtinguiſh them from the blood. Thoſe that affirm that there are Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal know not how to tread, but likewiſe doe affirm that there are potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Spirits, as Spirits concoctive, chilifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, procreative, and ſo many Spirits as there are faculties or parts.</p>
               <p>But the Schoolmen tell us alſo of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Fortitude, Prudence, Patience, and of all the vertues, and the moſt holy Spirit of wiſdom, and all divine gifts. They
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170011:24"/>think too that bad and good Spirits do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, poſſeſs, leave, and wander abroad. They think alſo, that diſeaſes are caus'd by a Devil, as by a <hi>Cacochima.</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is nothing more uncertain and doubtfull, than the doctrine which is aſſign'd to us concerning the ſpirit: yet for the moſt part all Phyſicians ſeem with <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to conclude, that our bodies are made up of three parts, containing, containd, and enforcing, by the forcing he means Spirits. But if Spirits muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be every thing which enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a mans body, whatſoever hath the power or force of action in living bodies muſt be call'd by the name of Spirit Therefore all the Spirits are not aeriall ſubſtances, nor powers, nor habits, nor incorporeal.</p>
               <p>But omitting the tediouſneſſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignifications to our purpoſe. Thoſe Spirit which paſſe out through the <hi>veins</hi> or the <hi>arteries,</hi> are not ſeparable from the blood, no more than flame form the flakes about it. But the blood and the Spirit ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ſame thing, though divers in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as good Wine and its Spirit. For as Wine is no more Wine after it has loſt its Spirit, but flat ſluff or vinegar, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blood without Spirit is blood, but equivocally goar; as a hand of ſtone or a dead hand is no more a hand, ſo blood
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170011:24"/>without vital ſpirit is no more to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med blood. So the Spirit which is chiefly in the <hi>arteries,</hi> and the <hi>arterial blood</hi> is as its act, as the Spirit of Wine in Wine, and the Spirit of <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> or as a little flame kindled in the Spirit of Wine, and living by nouriſting of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Therefore blood when it is moſt imbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Spirits, it does require and look after more room, becauſe it is ſwell'd or leaven'd, and blown up by them (which you may certainly judge in my experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I brought concerning the meaſure of the ſawcers) but like wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has greater ſtrength and force of action and performance, in which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels according to the mind of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the ſame blood is in the <hi>veins</hi> which is in the <hi>arteries,</hi> though it be acknowledg'd to be more full of Spirit, and more eminent in vital force: but it is not converted into ſomething more aerial or vaporous, as if there were no Spirits but aerial ones, or none that had force but ſuch as were flatuous and windy: But neither are the Animal Spirits, natural, and vital, which are containd in the ſolid parts, to wit, the ligaments and nerves (eſpecially if there be ſo many ſeverall ſorts of them) thought to be ſo many aerial forms, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of vapours.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:170011:25"/>
               <p>Thoſe who acknoledge Spirits in the bodies of creatures, but ſuch as are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but of an aerial conſiſtence, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous or fierie, of them would I fain know, Whether they can paſſe hither and thither, backward and forward as diſtinct bodies, without the blood? Whether or no I ſay, the Spirits follow the motion of the blood, as if they were either parts of the blood, or adhering to it by an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble connexion, and an interrupted exhalation; ſo that they can neither leave the parts, nor paſſe without the influx, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux, and paſſing of the blood.</p>
               <p>For if, as the vapours attenuated by the heat of the water, the Spirits, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall flux and ſucceſſion of the blood, become the nouriſhment of the parts, it will neceſſarily follow, that they cannot remain apart from the nouriſhment, but do continually vaniſh, for that ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they neither flow back nor paſs any way, nor abide, but according to the influxion, refluxion, or paſſing of the blood, as being either ther ſubject, <hi>vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi> or nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Then I would know, how they ſhow us that Spirits are made in the <hi>heart,</hi> and do make them up, either by the compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of exhalations, or vapours of the blood (rais'd either by the heat or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the <hi>heart.</hi>) Are not ſuch Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170011:25"/>to be thought much colder than the blood, ſince both the parts of which they are compounded, to wit, air, and vapour, are much colder? for the vapour of boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling water it ſelf, and any flame burns leſſe than the coal of a candle, and a wood-coal leſſe than iron or braſſe red hot.</p>
               <p>whence it ſeems that ſuch Spirits doe owe their heat to the blood, rather than the blood is heated by the Spirits, and ſuch Spirits are rather to be deem'd fumes and excrements, flowing from the blood and body, (like ſmels) than workers in Nature; eſpecially ſince they being ſo frail and vaniſhing, do ſo quickly loſe that vertue, which in their original they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the blood.</p>
               <p>From whence it were likewiſe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that there ſhould be an expiration of the <hi>lungs,</hi> by which theſe Spirits being blown out might be ayr'd and purified, and that there ſhould be an inſpiration into them, that the blood paſſing through betwixt the <hi>two ventricles</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> might be temper'd by the ambient cold, leſt being heated, and riſing and ſwelling with a kind of fermentation, like boyling honey or milk, it ſhould ſo diſtend the <hi>lungs</hi> as to ſuffocate the creature, as in a dangerous <hi>Aſthma</hi> we have often ſeen:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170011:26"/>To which <hi>Galen</hi> likewiſe aſcribes the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when he ſays, that this comes to paſſe by obſtruction of the little <hi>arteries,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the venous and arterious veſſels. I have had experience of this, that by affixing of Cupping-glaſſes, and pouring upon them good ſtore of cold water, there has many been ſav'd, who have been in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ſuffocated by an <hi>Aſthma</hi> I have here, perchance, ſpoken ſufficiently concerning Spirits, which we ought to define, and ſhow what and how they are in a Treatiſe of Phyſiologie, only I will adjoyn.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that ſpeak concerning innate warmth, as an ordinary inſtrument of Nature in performance of all things, and tell us of the neceſſity of influxive heat, to entertain all the parts, and keep them in life, and doe acknowledge that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exiſt without a ſubject, becauſe they find a movable bodie diſproportionable, by reaſon of the ſwiftneſſe of the flux and reflux, (eſpecially in the paſſions of the mind) and becauſe of the ſwift motion of this heat, they introduce Spirits, as bodies moſt ſubtle, penetrative and movalbe, and juſt as they ſay, that from that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inſtrument, to wit, the innate heat, proceeds the admirable divinity of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral operations: ſo doe they likewiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that thoſe Spirits of a ſublime, bright,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170011:26"/>aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real and celeſtial nature, are the bonds of the Soul; as the ignorant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-people when they do not conceive the reaſons of things, think and ſay, that God in the immediate author of them. that is comes through the <hi>arteries;</hi> as if the blood could not be ſo ſpeedily mov'd, not ſo full nouriſh; and in the confidence of this opinion they are ſo far advanced, that they deny that there is any blood contained in the <hi>arteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence they reſolve, that the influx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive heat does come ſwiftly through all the parts, by the influx of Spirit, and And with very flight arguments they endeavour to ground this, that the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> blood differs from the blood of the <hi>veins,</hi> or that the <hi>arteries</hi> are fill'd with ſuch Spirits; and not with blood, contrary to all that which <hi>Galen</hi> both from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and experience brought againſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ſtratus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is manifeſt by our former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by ſenſe, that the <hi>arterial</hi> blood is not ſo different; the influx of the blood and Spirt with it being not ſeparate from the blood, but that it flows in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy through the <hi>arteries,</hi> ſenſe may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe make evident.</p>
               <p>You may obſerve when, and as often as the extremities of the hands, the feet, and the ears are ſtiff and cold, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170011:27"/>again by the influx of heat, that it happens that at the ſelf-fame time they are colour'd, warm'd, and fill'd, and that the <hi>veins</hi> which were unſeen before, doe ſwell to plain appearance, from whence ſometimes when they are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly warm'd again the parts are ſenſible of ſome pain; from which it appeats, that the ſame which by its influx brings heat, the ſame is it that fills and colours them, but this can be nothing elſe but blood, as was demonſtrated before.</p>
               <p>Cutting off a long <hi>arterie</hi> or <hi>vein</hi> any body may ſee this evidently by ſenſe, when he ſhall ſee the nearer part of the <hi>vein</hi> towards the <hi>heart</hi> let out no blood, but the further part pour it abundantly, and nothing but blood (as afterwards in my experiment which I ſet down, which I tryed in the inner <hi>jugularie veins.</hi>) On the other ſide, cutting an <hi>arterie,</hi> but a little blood flows from the further part, but the nearer part ſhoots with a violent force mere blood, as if it were out of a ſpout.</p>
               <p>By which experiment it is known which way the paſſage is in them, either this way or that way. Beſides, you'l know what ſwiftneſſe there is in it, what ſenſible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not by little and by drops, and with what violence to boot.</p>
               <p>But leſt any would make an evaſion, by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170011:27"/>pretending of inviſible Spirits; Let the <hi>orifice</hi> of the veſſel ſo diſſected be let down into a veſſel of water or oyl, for if any herial thing came out, it would break out by viſible bubbles; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner Waſps, Hornets, and the like Inſects, being drown'd or ſuffocate in oyl, ſend out at laſt bubbles from their tail when they are dying: from whence it is not improbable that they do take breath too whilſt they are alive.</p>
               <p>For all creatures at laſt when they are drown'd and ſtiffled in the water, when they fail and ſink, they uſe to ſend out bubbles out of their mouth and lungs, when they give up the gloſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is aſſur'd by the ſame experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That the <hi>portals</hi> in the <hi>veins</hi> are ſo exactly ſhut, that air when it is blown in cannot paſſe, much leſſe blood. I ſay it appears to the ſenſe, that neither ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly nor inſenſibly, neither by little, nor by drops, the blood is remoy'd from the <hi>heart</hi> by the <hi>veins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And leſt any ſhould flye hither and ſay thus, That this comes to paſſe when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is troubled, and does act beſides Nature, not when ſhe is left to her ſelf, and acts at her own freedom; ſeeing the ſame things appeare in a ſickly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural conſtitution, which appear in good eſtate of bodie, it is not to be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170011:28"/>ſaid, that cutting off a <hi>vein,</hi> ſince there flowes ſo much blood from the further part, that this comes to paſſe beſide Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe Nature is moleſted; for the diſſection does not ſhut the further part, ſo that nothing can get out that way, nor can it be ſqueez'd out whether Nature be troubled or no. Others doe wrangle after the ſame manner, ſaying, That although when the <hi>arterie</hi> is cut near the <hi>heart</hi> the blood breaks out in ſo great abundance immediatly, yet for that cauſe the <hi>heart</hi> being whole, and the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> too, it does not alwayes drive the blood by impulſion. Yet it is more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all impulſion does drive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor can there be a pulſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer without the impulſion of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contained: Yet ſome, that they might deſend themſelves, and decline the Circulation of the blood, are not afraid to affirm and maintain this; to wit, that the <hi>arteries</hi> in living creatures, and being according to Nature, are ſo full that they cannot receive a grain weight more of blood: and ſo likewiſe of the <hi>ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eles</hi> of the <hi>heart.</hi> But it is without doubt, whenſoever, or how much ſoever the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> and <hi>ventricles</hi> are dilated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, they ought to receive greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of blood, and that beyond many grains. For if the <hi>ventricles</hi> be ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170011:28"/>as we have ſeen in the Anatomie of living Creatures till they receive no more blood, the <hi>heart</hi> leavs beating, and continuing ſtiff and reſiſting, it occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons death by ſuffocation.</p>
               <p>Whether the blood be mov'd or driven, or move it ſelf by its own intrinſecall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we have ſpoken ſufficiently in our book of the motion of the <hi>heart</hi> and blood; as alſo concerning the action, function, contraction, dilatation of the <hi>heart,</hi> how it is done, and together with the <hi>Dinſtale</hi> of the <hi>arteries,</hi> ſo that thoſe which take arguments from thence for contradiction, ſeem either not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is ſaid there, or elſe they will not try the buſineſſe by their own ſight.</p>
               <p>I believe there can not the attraction of any thing be demoſtrated in the body but of the nutriment, which by ſucceſſion of parts ſupplies by little &amp; little that which is loſt, as the oyl of a lamp by the flame.</p>
               <p>Whence that is the firſt comon organ of all ſenſible attraction &amp; impulſion, which has the nature of a <hi>nerve,</hi> or of a <hi>fiber,</hi> or of a <hi>muſcle,</hi> to wit, that it may be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and that by ſhortning of it ſelf it may ſtretch <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> draw in, or thruſt forward: but theſe things are more fully and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be declared elſewhere, in the organs of motion in living creatures.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:170011:29"/>
               <p>Inſomuch as to thoſe who do ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Circulation, becauſe they neither ſee the efficient, nor finall cauſe of it, There remains, becauſe I have as yet joyn'd nothing to it, only to ſay thus much; Firſt you muſt confeſſe that there is a Circulation, before you enquire for what it is, for from thoſe things that doe happen upon the circulation and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, the uſe and profits accrewing are to be ſearched. In the mean time I ſhall ſay ſo much, that there are many things allowed &amp; received in Phyſiologie, Pathologie, and Medicine, that no body knows the cauſe of, yet that there are ſuch things no body is ignorant, namely, of rotten feavers, revulſion, purgation of excrement, yet all theſe things are known by the help of Circulation.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever therefore does oppoſe the Circulation of the blood, becauſe ſo long as the Circulation ſtands, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Phyſicall Problems, or becauſe in curing of diſeaſes, and uſing of medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they cannot from thence aſſign any cauſe of the Symptomes, or ſee that thoſe cauſes which from their Maſters they have receiv'd, are falſe, or think it an unworthy thing to deſert opinions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved heretofore, and think in unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to call in queſtion the diſcipline which has been receiv'd through ſo many ages
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170011:29"/>together with the authority of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</p>
               <p>To all theſe I anſwer, that the deeds of nature, which are manifeſt to the ſenſe, care not for any opinion or any antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for there is nothing more antient than nature, or of greater authority.</p>
               <p>Beſides, thoſe Problemes out of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinall obſervations not to be ſolv'd, as the Imagine, to the Circulation they object, and do oppoſe to it the declaring of their own errours, to wit, that if the circulation be true there can be no revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſince the blood is driven upon the part affected as before, and ſo it is to be feared, that there will be a paſſage of the excrements and blood, through the moſt noble and principall of our entrails. They do admire at the efflux and excretion, when out of the ſame body at divers holes, yea ſometimes and the ſame hole, foul and corrupt blood iſſues, whereas if the blood were driven with a continuall flux, paſing through the <hi>heat,</hi> it would be mix'd and ſhaken together.</p>
               <p>They do doubt how theſe, and many other things that they fetch from the School of Phyſicians can come to paſs, for they ſeem to be repugnant to the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood, nor do they think (as it is in Aſtronomie) that it is enough to make new Syſtemes, unleſſe you ſolve all ſcruples.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:170011:30"/>
               <p>I thought fit to return no other anſwer at this time, but that the Circulation is not the ſame every where, and at all times, but many things do happen from the ſwifter or ſlower motion of the blood, either through the ſtrength or infirmity of the <hi>heat,</hi> which drives it, by the abundance, eſtate, or conſtitution of the blood, the thickneſſe of the parts, obſtruction, and the like; thicker blood hardly finds way through narrow paſſages; it is more ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned when it paſſes the ſtreyner of the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> than when it paſſes the ſtreyner of the <hi>lungs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It does not with a like ſpeed paſſe through the thin contexture of the fleſh, and <hi>parenchyme,</hi> as it does through the thick conſiſtence of the nervous parts. For the thinner, more pure, and more ſpirituous part is ſooner ſtreynd through, the more earthy, cacochymick, and more tardy, ſtayes longer, and is turn'd back. The nutritive part and laſt aliment (be it the <hi>Ros</hi> or <hi>Cambium</hi>) is more penetrative, ſeeing it is to be applyed to every part, whether it be to the horns, feathers, or nayls, if being every where nouriſhed they increaſe in all their dimenſions; for this reaſon the excrements in ſome places are voyded, thickned, or do burthen us, or are concocted: Nor do I think that there is any neceſſity that the excrements
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170011:30"/>or ill humors, being once ſet apart, nor the milk, flegm, nor ſperm, or the laſt nutriment (the <hi>Ros</hi> and <hi>Cambium</hi>) ſhould be return'd with the blood, but that it behooves that that which nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes ſhould adhere, that it may be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinated. Of which, and a great many other things which are to be determined and declar'd in their proper places, to wit, in Phyſiologie, and the reſt of the parts of Phyſick, it is not fit to diſpute, nor yet of the conſequences of the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the blood, nor the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies nor inconveniences of it, before the Circulation if ſelf be eſtabliſhed for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>The example of Aſtronomie is not here to be followed, where only from appearances, and ſuch a thing that may be, the cauſes, and why ſuch a thing ſhould be, comes to be enquir'd after. But as one deſiring to know the cauſe of the Eclipſe, ought to be plac'd above the Moon, that by his ſenſe he might find out the cauſe, not by reaſoning of things ſenſible, in things which come under the notion of the ſenſe, no ſurer demonſtration can be to gain beleef, than ocular teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
               <p>I deſire that there may be one other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable experiment tryed by all that are deſirous of the knowledge of the truth,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170011:31"/>by which likewiſe the pulſe of the <hi>arteries</hi> is both ſeen to be done by the blood, and evidenced to be ſo.</p>
               <p>If the Gutts of a dog, or a wolf, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Creature ſtuff'd, and dryed, ſuch as you ſee at the Apothecaries, you cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a part of it of any length., and fill it with water, and tie it at both ends that it is like a pudding, hitting or ſhaking the one end of it, in the end o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt it, by puting too of your fingers (as we uſe to feel the pulſe of the <hi>arterie</hi> above the wriſt) you may find every ſtroak and difference of the motion clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And after this manner in every ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>vein</hi> either of living or dead, you may to raw ſtudents manifeſt all the dife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the pulſes to the ſenſe, in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, frequencie, vehemency, and rime. For as it is in a long bladder or in a long drum, all the ſtrokes of one of the extremes is felt likewiſe in the other; Therefore in the Hydropſie of the belly, as likewiſe in all abſceſſions which are fill'd with liquid matter, we uſe to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh an <hi>Anaſarca</hi> from a <hi>Tympanitis;</hi> If all pulſes and vibrations made in one ſide be by touch clearly felt in the other, we think it a <hi>Tympanitis,</hi> and not as it is falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleev'd, becauſe it is like the ſound of a drum, and is only by flatuouſneſſe, but becauſe (as it is in a drum) every light
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170011:31"/>ſtroke paſſes through it, and every ſhake goes through the whole; for it ſhews that there is a ſerous an wheyiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance within, and not a tough and ſlimy, as in the <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> which being thruſt retains the marks of the ſtroke or impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and tranſmits it not. Having ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this experiment, there riſes a moſt powerfull objection againſt the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the blood, neither obſerv'd, nor oppos'd againſt me by any that has hitherto written. Seeing in this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſee that there may be <hi>Syſtoles &amp;c Diaſtoles,</hi> without the egreſſe of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, who will beleeve but that it may be juſt ſo in the <hi>arteries,</hi> and that in them juſt ſo as it is in an <hi>Euripus,</hi> from hence thither, from thence hither, it may be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by turns. But in another place we have ſufficiently reſolv'd this doubt, and now we alſo ſay, that this is not ſo in the <hi>arteries</hi> of living creatures, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually and inceſſantly the <hi>right ear</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> fils the <hi>ventricles</hi> with blood, the return of which the three-pointed <hi>portals</hi> hinder, and ſo the <hi>lefs ear</hi> fills the <hi>left ventricle,</hi> and both the <hi>ventricles</hi> in the <hi>Syſtole</hi> throw forth the blood which the <hi>Sigmoidal portals</hi> hinder to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and that it ought therefore either paſſe ſome way, and continually out of the <hi>lungs</hi> and <hi>arteries,</hi> or otherwiſe it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170011:32"/>would at laſt by reſtagnation and intruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, break the veſſels which contain it, or ſuffocate the <hi>heart</hi> it ſelf by diſtention, as we have obſerv'd to be plain to the ſenſe in the diſſection of a live Adder, in my Book concerning the motion of the blood.</p>
               <p>To clear this doubt I will recite to you two experiments amongſt many other (of which I cold one before) by which it clearly appears, that the blood in the <hi>veins,</hi> with a continuall and great flux runs continually towards the <hi>hearts</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the internal <hi>jugular vein</hi> of a live Doe, which I laid open before a great part of the Nobility, and the King my Royal Maſter ſtanding by, which was cut and broke off in the middle: From the lower part riſing from the <hi>Gl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicule,</hi> ſcarce a few drops did iſſue; whilſt in the mean time the blood with great force, and breaking out of a round ſtream, ran out moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully downwards from the head through the orther <hi>orifice</hi> of the <hi>vein.</hi> You may obſerve the ſame daily in Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomie in the flowing out of the blood, if you hold the <hi>vein</hi> faſt with one finger a little below the <hi>orifice,</hi> preſently the flux is ſtopped, which after you let it go flows abundantly, as before.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:170011:32"/>
               <p>In any viſible long <hi>vein</hi> of your arm, ſtretching out your hand, and preſſing out all the blood downwards as much as you can, you ſhall ſee the <hi>vein</hi> fall, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as it were a ſorrow in the place, but ſo ſoon as you thruſt it back with one of your fingers, you ſhall preſently ſee the part towards the hand to be fill'd, and ſwell, and to riſe by the return of the blood from the hand. What is the reaſon, that by ſtopping of the breath, and by that means ſtreightning the <hi>lungs,</hi> and a great deal of it being within, the pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall veſſells are ſtreightned, whence the blood is driven into the face, and eyes, with ſo much redneſſe?</p>
               <p>Nay that (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſays in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes) all actions are perform'd with greater ſtrength by keeping in of the breath, than by letting it free? ſo you get blood more abundantly out of the <hi>veins</hi> the <hi>brow,</hi> or <hi>tongue,</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the throat, and retention of breath.</p>
               <p>I have found ſometimes in a mans body, newly hanged, 2 hours after his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, before the redneſſe of his face was gon, opening up his <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricardium,</hi> the <hi>right ear</hi> of his <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>lungs</hi> much ſtuffed, and diſtended with blood, many witneſſes ſtanding by, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially I ſhew'd them the <hi>ear,</hi> as big
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170011:33"/>as a mans fiſt, ſo ſwel'd, that you would have thought it would have burſt with greatneſſe, which, the body being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cold, and the blood having found other ways, was quite gone.</p>
               <p>So from theſe, and other experiments, it is clear enough, that the blood runs through all the <hi>veins</hi> to the <hi>baſis</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> and that unleſſe it found paſſage it behov'd to be ſtreightned, or ſhut up in other ways, and that the <hi>heart</hi> would be o'rewhelmed with it, as on the other part, if it did not flow out of the <hi>arteries,</hi> but were regurgitated, the oppreſſion by it would quickly appear.</p>
               <p>I will add another obſervation: A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Knight Baronet Sir <hi>Robert Darcie</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Son-in-Law of the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, and my very great friend, and a famous phyſician, Dr. <hi>Argent,</hi> about the middle of his age, did often complain of an oppreſſive pain in his breaſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the night time, ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times being afraid of collapſion of ſpirits, ſometimes fearing ſuffocation by a Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiſme, he led an unquiet and anxious life, uſing the Counſell of all Phyſicians, and taking many things in vain, at laſt the diſeaſe prevailing, he becomes cachec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and Hydropick, and at laſt oppreſt in a ſignall Paroxiſm he died, In his Corps, in the preſence of Dr. <hi>Argent,</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:170011:33"/>who at that time was Preſident of the College of Phyſicians, and Dr. <hi>Gorge,</hi> a rare Divine, and a good Preacher, who was at that time Miniſter of that Pariſh, by the hinderance of the paſſage of the blood out of the <hi>left ventricle</hi> into the <hi>arteries,</hi> the wall of the <hi>left ventricle</hi> it ſelf (which is ſeen to be thick and ſtrong enough) was broken, and poured forth blood at a wide hole, for it was a hole ſo big, that it would eaſily receive one of my fingers.</p>
               <p>I knew another ſtout man, who did ſo boyl with rage becauſe he had ſuffer'd an injury, and receiv'd an affront by one that was more powerfull than himſelf, that his anger and hatred being increas'd every day (by reaſon he could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd) and diſcovering the paſſion of his mind to no body, which was ſo exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate within him, at laſt he fell into a ſtrange ſort of a diſeaſe, and was torur'd, and miſerably tormented with great oppreſſion and pain in his <hi>heart,</hi> and breſt, ſo that the moſt skilfull Phyſicians preſcriptions doing no good upon him, at laſt, after ſome years, he fell ſick of the Scorbutick diſeaſe, pin'd away, and dyed.</p>
               <p>This man only found eaſe as oft as his breſt was preſt down by a ſtrong man, and was thump'd and beaten down as they do when they mould bread: his friends
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170011:34"/>thought he was bewitch'd, or poſſeſſ'd with the Devil.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe had his <hi>jugular arteries</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended about the greatneſſe of ones thumbs, as if either of them had been the <hi>Aorta</hi> it ſelf, or the <hi>Arteria magna</hi> in its deſcent, and did beat vehemently, and were to the view like two long Aneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms, which caus'd us try blood-letting in his <hi>temples,</hi> but that gave him no eaſe. In his corps I found the <hi>heart</hi> and the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orta</hi> ſo diſtended and full of blood, that the bigneſſe of his <hi>heart,</hi> and the conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the <hi>ventricles,</hi> were equall in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to that of an Oxe; ſo great is the ſtrength of the blood when it is ſhut up, and ſo vaſt its force.</p>
               <p>Although then (by the experiment newly mention'd) there may be anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion without an exite (inthe ſhaking of water up and down) in the pudding afore-mentioned, yet cannot it be ſo in the blood which is in the veſſels of living perſons, without very great and heavy impediments and dangers.</p>
               <p>Yet from thence it is manifeſt, that the blood in its Circulation does not paſſe every There with the ſame agility and ſwiftneſſe, nor with the ſame vehemence in all places and parts, and at all times, but that it varies much according to the age, ſex, temper, habir of body, and other contingents, external internal, natural, or preternatural.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:170011:34"/>
               <p>For it does not paſs through the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and obſtructed paſſages, with the ſame ſwiftneſſe as it does through thoſe that are open, free, and patent; nor does it paſſe through bodies or denſe parts, and ſuch as are ſtuff'd or conſtricted, as it does through thoſe that are thin, open, and without obſtruction; nor does it run out ſo ſwiftly and penetratively when the impulſion is ſlow and ſoft, as when it is drive with force and ſtrength, and thruſt forward with vehemency and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. Nor is the thick blood or ſolid maſſe, or when it is made earthy, ſo penetrative, as when it is more wheyiſh, made thin, and liquid.</p>
               <p>And therefore with reaſon we may imagine, that the blood in its Circulation goes flowlier through the <hi>reins,</hi> than through the ſubſtance of the <hi>heart;</hi> ſwiftlier through the <hi>liver,</hi> than through the <hi>reins;</hi> ſwiftlier through the <hi>spleen,</hi> than through the <hi>liver;</hi> ſwiftlier through the <hi>lungs,</hi> than through the fleſh, or any other viſcers of thinner contexture.</p>
               <p>We may likewiſe contemplate in the age, ſex, temperature, habit of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſoft or hard, of the ambient cold, which condenſes bodies, when the <hi>veins</hi> ſcarce appear in the members, or the ſanguine colour is ſeen, or the heat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the blood being made more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid by reception of nutriment. So like|
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170011:35"/>wiſe the <hi>veins</hi> do more conſpicuouſly, and freely pour out the blood the body being heated before opening of a <hi>vein</hi> than when it is cold. We ſee that the paſſion of the mind (in the adminiſtration of Phlebotomie) if any fearfull perſon chance to ſound, ſtreight the flux of the blood is ſtopp'd, and a bloodleſs paleneſſe ſeaſes on all the ſuperfice of his body, his members are ſtiff, his ears ſing, his eyes grow dim, and are in convulſion. I find here a field where I might run our further, and exſpatiate at large in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: But from hence ſo great a light of truth appears, from which ſo many queſtions may be reſolv'd, ſo many doubts anſwered, ſo many cauſes and cures of diſeaſes found out, that they ſeem to require a particular treatiſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all which in my medicinal obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, I'll ſet down things worthy your admiration.</p>
               <p>For what is more admirable, than that in all affections, deſires, hope, or fear, our bodies ſuffer ſeverall ways, our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry countenances are changed, and our blood is ſeen to fly up and down? with anger our eyes are red, the black of the eye is leſſen'd in ſhamefaſtneſſe, and the cheeks are fluſh'd with redneſſe; by fear, infamie, and ſhame, the face is pale, the ears glow, as if they ſhould hear ſone ill thing: young men that are
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170011:35"/>touch'd with luſt, how quickly is their <hi>nerve</hi> fill'd with blood, erected and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended? But it is moſt worthy the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Phyſicians, why blood-letting and cupping glaſſes, and the ſtopping of the <hi>arterie</hi> which carries the flux (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially whilſt they are doing) does as it were with a charm take away all pain and grief: I ſay, ſuch things as theſe are to be referred to obſervations, where they are explained clearly.</p>
               <p>Frivolous and unexperienced perſons do ſcurvily ſtrive to overthrow by logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and far-fetch'd arguments, or to eſtabliſh ſuch things as are meerly to be confirm'd a by Anatomicall diſſection, and ocular teſtimony. It behoves him, who ever is deſirous to learn, to ſee any thing which is in queſtion, if it be obvious to ſenſe, and ſight, whether it be ſo or no, or elſe be bound to believe thoſe that have made tryall, for by no other clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or more evident certainty can he learn or be taught. Who will perſwade a man that has not taſted them, that ſweet or new wine is better than water? with what arguments ſhall one perſwade a blind man that the Sun is clear, and out-ſhines all the Stars in the firmament? So concerning the Circulation of the blood, which all have had confirm'd to them for ſo many years, by ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular experiments, there has been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170011:36"/>no mau found, who by his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations could refute a thing ſo obvious to the ſenſe (to wit the motion of flux and reflux) by obſervations alike obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the ſenſe, or deſtroy the confirm'd experience of it, nay by ocular teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny none ever offer'd to build up a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion.</p>
               <p>Whilſt in the mean time there are not wanting perſon, who for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfullneſſe, and little experience in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomie, having nothing agreeable to ſenſe to oppoſe to it, they cavill at it with ſome vain aſſertions, and ſuch as they adhere to from the authority of Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, with no ſolid ſuppoſition, but with idle and frivolous arguments, and bark at it beſides with a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, and thoſe baſe ones too, with rayling, and baſe ſcurvy language, by which they do no more than ſhew their own vanity, and folly, and their baſeneſſe, and want of arguments, which are to be fetch'd from ſenſe, ſo that they with their falſe Sophiſticall arguments do rage againſt ſenſe: Iuſt as when the raging winds advancing the waves in the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Sea daſhes them in pieces againſt the rocks within <hi>Charybdis,</hi> they make a hideous noiſe, and being broken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberated hiſſe, and foam, ſo doe theſe men rage againſt the reaſon of their own ſenſe.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:170011:36"/>
               <p>If nothing ſhould be admitted by ſenſe without the teſtimony of reaſon, or ſometimes againſt the dictate of reaſon, there ſhould be no queſtion now to be controverted.</p>
               <p>If our moſt certain Authors were not our ſenſes, and theſe things were to be eſtabliſhed by reaſoning, as the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians do in their frames, we ſhould truly admit of no Science, for it is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall demonſtration of geometrie from things ſenſible to demonſtrate things to the ſenſe, according to which example, things abſtruſe, and hid from the ſenſe, grow more manifeſt by things which are eaſier, and better known, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes us much better <hi>lib. 31 de Gen. Anim,</hi> diſputing of the generation of Bees, ſays he, <hi>you muſt give credit to your ſenſes; if thoſe things which are demonſtrated to you are agreeable to thoſe things which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciptible by ſenſe, which, as they ſhall then be better known, ſo you may better truſt your ſenſe than your reaſon.</hi> Whence we ought to approve or reject all things by examination leiſurely made, but if you will examine or try whether they be ſaid right or wrong, you muſt bring them to the teſt of ſenſe, and confirm, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them by the judgement of ſenſe, where, if there be any thing feignd or not, ſure it will appear. Whence <hi>Plato</hi> ſayes in his <hi>Critias,</hi> That the explication of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170011:37"/>thoſe things is not hard, of which we can come to the experiment, nor are thoſe auditors fit for Science, that have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               <p>How hard and difficult a thing is it for thoſe that have no experience, to teach ſuch things of which they have no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, or ſenſible knowledge; and how unfit and indocile unexperienced Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are to true Science, the judgement of blind-men in colours, and of deaf men in the diſtinctió of ſounds, dos plainly ſhew. Who ſhall ever teach the flux and reflux of the Sea? or by a Geometrical Diagram teach the quantities of Angles, or the computation of the ſides of a figure to a blind-man, or to thoſe that never ſaw the Sea, nor a Diagram? A man that is not expert in Anatomie, in ſo far as he cannot conceive the buſineſſe with his own eyes, and proper reach, in ſo far is thought to be blind to learning, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: for he knows not truly any thing concerning which an Anatomiſt diſputes, nor any thing, from the implanted nature of which he ſhould take his argument, but all things he is alike ignorant of, as well thoſe things which are gathered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as the things from whence. But there is no poſſible knowledge, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives not from a pre-exiſtent knowledge, and that very demonſtrable. This one cauſe is the chief reaſon why the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170011:37"/>we have of the heavenly bodies is ſo uncertain and conjectural. Very fain would I know from thoſe ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that profeſſe the cauſes and reaſons of all things, why as both the eys in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding move together every way, nor particularly one moves this way, and the other that way, ſo neither both the <hi>ears</hi> of the <hi>heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe they know not the cauſes of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or of the plague, or the admirable properties of ſome medicaments, and the cauſes why they are ſo, muſt therefore theſe things be denyed?</p>
               <p>Why is the Birth that breaths not till the tenth moneth, not ſuffocated for want of ayr? ſince one that is born in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth or eighth, ſo ſoon as he has brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in the air, is preſently choak'd if it have no air? How can it retain life whilſt it is yet within the <hi>Secundine,</hi> or as yet not come forth, without breath? but ſo ſoon as hecomes into the air unleſſe he breath he cannot live?</p>
               <p>Becauſe I ſee many men doubtful in the Circulation, and ſome men oppoſe ſuch things which underſtand them not aright, as I intended them, I ſhall bridfly reherſe out of my Book of the motion of the <hi>heart</hi> and blood, what I did there intend. The blood which is containd in the <hi>veins</hi> (as in its own hold) where it is moſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant (to wit, in the <hi>vena cava</hi>) near to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170011:38"/>the <hi>Bajis</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> and the <hi>right ear,</hi> growing hot by little and little by its own internal heat, and made thin, it ſwels and riſes (like leaven) whence the <hi>ear</hi> being firſt dilated, and afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it ſelf by its pulſifick faculty, ſtreightways drives it out into the <hi>right ventricle</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> which being fill'd in its <hi>Systole,</hi> and conſequently freeing it ſelf from that blood which is driven into it (the three-pointed <hi>portals</hi> refuſing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to it) it drives the ſame blood into the <hi>vena arterioſa</hi> (where the paſſage is open) by which it does diſtend it. Now the blood in the <hi>arterious veſſel</hi> being not able to return againſt the <hi>Sigmoidal por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> but becauſe the <hi>lungs</hi> are extended, amplified, and reſtricted both by imſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and expiration, and likewiſe their veſſels, they give paſſage to this blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>arteria venoſa:</hi> of which the <hi>left ear</hi> keeping together equal motion, time and order, with the <hi>right ear,</hi> and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its function, ſends the ſame blood into the <hi>left ventricle,</hi> as the <hi>right tricle</hi> ſent into the <hi>right,</hi> whence the <hi>left ventricle</hi> together, and at the ſame time with the <hi>right</hi> (ſince it can gain no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, by reaſon of the <hi>portalls</hi> which hinder its return) drives it into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paciouſneſſe of the <hi>aorta,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into all the branches of the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi> the <hi>arteries</hi> being filled with this
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170011:38"/>ſudden pulſe, being not able ſo ſuddenly to disburthen themſelves, are diſtended, ſuffer an impulſion and <hi>Diastole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence I gather, ſeeing the ſame is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated continually and inceſſantly, that the <hi>arteries,</hi> both in the <hi>lungs,</hi> and in the whole body, by ſo many ſtroaks, and impulſions of the <hi>heart,</hi> would be ſo diſtended and ſtuffed with blood, at leaſt that either the impulſion would give over all together, or elfe the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> would burſt, or be ſo dilated, that would contain the whole maſſe of blood which is in the <hi>veins,</hi> unleſſe the efflux of blood were disburthen'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>We may likewiſe reaſon after the ſame manner of the <hi>ventricles</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd &amp; ſtuff'd with blood, unleſſe the <hi>arteries</hi> did likewiſe diſburthen, they would be at laſt diſtended and deſtitute of all motion. This conſequence of mine is demonſtrative and true, and followes of neceſſity, if the premiſes be true; but our ſenſes ought of aſſure us whether ſuch things be falſe or true, and not our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ocular teſtimony, and no contemt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
               <p>I affirm likewiſe of the blood in the <hi>veins,</hi> that the blood does always, and every where, run out of the leſſe into the greater, and haſtens towards the <hi>heart</hi> from every part: whence I gather, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170011:39"/>whatſoever quantitie which is continually ſent in, the <hi>arteries</hi> do receive by the <hi>veins,</hi> that the ſame does return and does at laſt flow back thither from whence it is firſt driven, and that by this means the blood moves circularly, being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in its flux and reflux by the <hi>heart,</hi> by whoſe force it is driven into all the <hi>fibers</hi> of the <hi>arteries,</hi> and that it does after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſucceſſively, by a continuall flux return through the <hi>veins,</hi> from all thoſe parts which draw, and ſtreyn it through; ſenſe it ſelf teaches us that this is true, and collections from things obvious to ſenſe takes away all occaſion of doubt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this is that I did endeavour to relate and lay open by my obſervations and experiments, and not to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by cauſes and probable principles, but to confirm it by ſenſe and experience, as by a powerfull authority, according to the rule of Anatomiſts.</p>
               <p>From theſe we may obſerve what force, and violence, and ſtrong vehemencie we perceive in the <hi>heart,</hi> and greater <hi>arteries</hi> by touch &amp; ſight. I do not ſay, that in all the veſſels which contain the blood, the pulſe of the <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> is the ſame (in greater Creatures) nor in all creatures which have blood, but that there is ſuch a one and ſo great in all, that by that means there is a flux of blood, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170011:39"/>ſwifter courſe of it through the ſmall <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,</hi> the poroſities of the parts and branches of all the <hi>veins,</hi> and from thence comes the Circulation: for neither the ſmall <hi>arteries,</hi> nor the <hi>veins</hi> do beat, but only the <hi>arteries</hi> which are nigheſt to the <hi>heart,</hi> becauſe they do not ſo ſoon ſend the blood out, as it is driven into them, for you may try, opening of an <hi>arterie,</hi> if the blood leap out in full ſtream, ſo that it come out as freely as it went in, that you ſcarce found any pulſe in that <hi>arterie</hi> through which it paſſes, becauſe the blood running through, and finding paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, does not diſtend it. In Fiſhes, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and colder creatures, the <hi>heart</hi> beats ſlowlie and weaker, that you will hardly perceive any pulſe in the <hi>arteries,</hi> becauſe they paſſe their blood through very ſlowlie; whence it is that in theſe as alſo in the little fibers of the <hi>arteries</hi> of a man there is no diſtinction by blood; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not pierc'd with impulſion of blood.</p>
               <p>As I ſaid before, the blood that paſſes through an <hi>arterie</hi> which is cut and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, makes no pulſe there at all, whence it clearly appears, that the <hi>arteries</hi> ſuffer their <hi>Diaſtole</hi> neither by innate pulſifick faculty, nor by any granted them from the <hi>heart,</hi> but by the meer impulſion of the blood. For in the full flux, flowing out the length of its courſe, you may by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170011:40"/>touch perceive both the <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stole,</hi> as I ſaid before, and all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the pulſe of the <hi>heart,</hi> their time, order, vehemency, intermiſſion in the emanation of th eflux evidently, (as it were in a looking-glaſs.) Juſt as water, by the force and impulſion of a ſpout is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven aloft through pipes of lead, we may obſerve and diſtinguiſh all the forcings of the Engine, though you be a good way off, in the flux of the water when it paſſes out, the order, beginning increaſe, end, and vehemency of every motion. Even ſo it is when you cut off the orifice of an <hi>arterie;</hi> where you muſt obſerve, That as in the water, the flux is continuall; though it be ſometimes nigher, ſometimes further: ſo in the <hi>arteries,</hi> beſides the ſhaking, pulſe, and concuſſion of the blood, (which is not equally to be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all) from that time forward there is a continual motion and fluxion in the blood, till the blood be again retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that place where it firſt began, that is to ſay, to the <hi>right ear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things you may try at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure cutting up one of the longer <hi>arteries,</hi> (as the <hi>jugular</hi>) which if you take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your fingers, you ſhall clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern how it loſes its pulſe and recovers it again, beats leſſe or more. And as theſe things may be tryed whilſt the breſt is whole; ſo opening the breſt, and the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170011:40"/>
                  <hi>lungs</hi> afterwards being collaps'd, and all motion of reſpiration gone, you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily try it, to wit, that the <hi>left ear</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and emptyed, that it becomes more whitiſh, and that it doth at laſt, together with the <hi>left ventricle,</hi> intermit in its pulſe, beat leiſurely, and at laſt leave off: And likewiſe by the hole which you may cut in the <hi>arterie,</hi> you may ſee the blood come forth leſſe and leſſe in a ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler thred, and that at laſt, (to wit, in the defect of blood, and the impulſion of the <hi>left ventricle</hi>) no more will flow.</p>
               <p>You may likewiſe try this ſame in the tying of the <hi>vena arterioſa,</hi> and ſo take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the pulſe of the <hi>left ear,</hi> and with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying it, reſtore the pulſe at your pleaſure. Whence the ſame thing is evidently try'd by experiment, which is ſeen in dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that as firſt the <hi>left ventricle</hi> deſiſts from motion and pulſe, and afterwards the <hi>left ear,</hi> then the <hi>right ventricle,</hi> &amp; pulſe, laſtly, the <hi>right ear;</hi> ſo where the vital faculty begins firſt, it ends laſt.</p>
               <p>Which being tried by the ſenſe, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeſt, that the blood paſſes only through the <hi>ſemptum</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> and not through the <hi>lungs,</hi> and only through them whilſt they are mov'd in reſpiration, and not when they are fallen or diſquieted. For which cauſe in an <hi>Embryon</hi> (not as yet breathing) Nature inſtead of the paſſage in the <hi>arteria venoſa,</hi> (that matter may
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170011:41"/>be furniſh'd to the <hi>left ventricle,</hi> and the <hi>left ear</hi>) opens an oval hole, which ſhe ſhuts in young men, and thoſe that breath freely.</p>
               <p>It likewiſe appears, why thoſe that have the veſſels of their <hi>lungs</hi> oppreſſ'd, and ſtuff'd, or thoſe that have any loſſe of their breath, it is preſent token of death.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe clear, why the blood of the <hi>lungs</hi> is ſo flame-colour'd; for it is thinneſt that is ſtraind through there. It is beſide to be obſerv'd from our former concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in order to thoſe who require the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Circulation, &amp; think the power of the <hi>heart</hi> to be the effecter of all things, and as it is the author of tranſmiſſion by pulſe, ſo with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> they think it the author of attraction, and generation of blood, and that the Spirits are made by the <hi>heart,</hi> and the influxive heat (&amp; that by the innat heat of the <hi>heart,</hi> as by the immediat inſtrument of the ſoul, or by a common bond and the firſt organ for perfecting of all the works of life. And ſo the motion of the blood and ſpirit, its perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and heat, and every property thereof, to be borrow'd from the <hi>heart,</hi> as from its beginning; (which <hi>Ariſt.</hi> ſays is in in the blood, as in hot water, or boyling pottage) is in the <hi>heart,</hi> and that it is the firſt cauſe of pulſation and life. If I may ſpeak freely. I do not think that theſe things are ſo (as they are commonly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170011:41"/>for there are many things which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to that opinion, which I will take notice of in the generation of creatures, which are not fit here to be reherſed; but it may be things more wonderful than theſe, and ſuch as will give more light to natural Philoſophie, ſhall be publiſh'd by me.</p>
               <p>Yet in the mean time I will ſay and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it without demonſtration, (with the leave of moſt learned men, and reverence to antiquity) that the <hi>heart,</hi> as it is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all things in the body, the ſpring, fountain, and firſt cauſer of life, is ſo to be taken, as being joynd, together with the <hi>veins,</hi> and all <hi>arteries,</hi> and the blood which is containd in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Like as the <hi>brain,</hi> (together with all its ſenſible <hi>nervs, organs,</hi> and <hi>ſpinal marrow</hi>) is the adequate <hi>organ</hi> of the ſenſe, (as the phraſe is.) But if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by this word <hi>heart,</hi> the body of the <hi>heart,</hi> with the <hi>ventricles</hi> and <hi>ears,</hi> I do not think it to be the framer of the blood, and that it has not force, vertue, motion, or heat, as the gift of the <hi>heart;</hi> and next, that the ſame is not the cauſe of the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> &amp; diſtention which is the cauſe of the <hi>Syſtole</hi> and contraction, whether in the <hi>ears</hi> or <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries:</hi> but that part of the pulſe which is call'd a <hi>Diaſtole</hi> comes of another cauſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from the <hi>Syſtole,</hi> and ought to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every <hi>Syſtole.</hi> I think the firſt cauſe of diſtention is innate heat in the blood it ſelf, which (like leaven) by little and little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170011:42"/>and ſwelling, is the laſt thing that is extinct in the creature. I agree to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles</hi> inſtance of pottage, or milk, in ſo far as he thinks that elevation or depreſſion of the blood does not come of vapours or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, or Spirits rais'd into a vaporous or eareal form, nor is not caus'd by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal agent, but by the regulating of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, an internal principle.</p>
               <p>Nor is the <hi>heart</hi> (as ſome think) like a charcoal-fire (like a hot Kettle) the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of heat and blood, but rather the blood delivers that heat which it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to the <hi>heart,</hi> as likewiſe to all the reſt of the parts, as being the hotteſt of all. Therefore <hi>arteries,</hi> and the <hi>coronal veins</hi> are aſſign'd to the <hi>heart</hi> for that uſe which they are aſſign'd to the reſt of the parts, to wit, for influx of heat for the entertaining and conſervation of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the hotter parts, how much more ſanguine they are, and more abundant with blood, they are ſaid convertibly ſo to be, and thus the <hi>heart</hi> having ſignall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities, is to be thought the Ware-houſe, continuall fire, and fountain of the blood, not becauſe of the corpulency of it but becauſe of the blood which it contains like a hot Kettle, as in the ſame manner the <hi>ſpleen, lungs,</hi> an other parts are thought hot, becauſe they have many <hi>veins</hi> or veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels containing blood.</p>
               <p>And after this manner do I believe that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170011:42"/>the native heat, call'd innate, to be the firſt efficient cauſe of pulſe, as likewiſe to be the common inſtrument of all operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This as yet I do not conſtantly aver, but propound it as a <hi>Theſis;</hi> I would fain know what may be objected by good and learned men, without ſcurrilitie of words, reproaches, or baſe language, and any body ſhall be welcome to do it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things then are as it were the parts and the footſteps of the paſſage, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the blood; to wit, from the <hi>right ear</hi> into the <hi>ventricle,</hi> out of the <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle</hi> through the <hi>lungs</hi> into the <hi>left ear,</hi> then into the <hi>left ventricle,</hi> into the <hi>aorta,</hi> and into all the <hi>arteries</hi> from the <hi>heart,</hi> by the poroſities of the part into the <hi>veins,</hi> and by the <hi>veins</hi> into the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> the blood returns moſt ſpedity.</p>
               <p>By an experiment any man may try that pleaſes by the <hi>veins,</hi> let the arm be tyed as the cuſtome is with a gentle ligature, and let it remain tyed ſo long, ſtill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the arm up and down, till the <hi>veins</hi> all of them ſwell exceedingly, and the skin grow very red below the <hi>ligature,</hi> and then let the hand be waſhed with Snow or cold water, till the blood gatherd below the <hi>ligature</hi> be cold enough, then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly untying the ligature, you [ſhall find by the cold blood which returns how ſwiftly it runs back to the <hi>heart,</hi> and what a change it will make in its return] thither, ſo
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170011:43"/>that it is not to be wondred at, that in the untying of the ligature in blood letting ſome have ſounded. This experiment does demonſtrate that the <hi>veins</hi> below the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do not ſwell with blood attenuated, and puft up with ſpirit, but with blood only, and ſuch blood which can be rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated into the <hi>arteries</hi> through the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomoſis of the parts, or the hidden <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It likewiſe ſhews how thoſe that paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſnowy mountains, are often ſuddenly ſeaſ'd with death, and many ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Leſt it ſhould ſeem a difficult buſineſſe, how the blood ſhould paſſe through the <hi>pores</hi> of the parts, and go hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I will add one experiment. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens after the ſame manner to thoſe that are ſtrangled, and hang'd with a rope, as it does in the typing of the arm that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the cord their face, eyes, lips, tongue, and all the upper parts of their head are ſtuſt'd, with very much blood grow extreamred, and ſwell till they look black, in ſuch a carcaſe untying the rope, in whatſoever poſition you ſet it, within a very few hours you ſhall ſee all the blood leave the face and the head, and ſee it as it were fall down with its own weight, from the upper to the lower parts through the <hi>pores</hi> of the skin and fleſh, and the reſt of the parts, and that it fills all the parts below and the skin chiefly, &amp; colours
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170011:43"/>it with black matter; how much more lively and ſprightly the blood is in a living body, and by how much more penetrating it is through the poroſites than congealed blood,, eſpecially when it is condenſ'd through all the habit of the body, by the cold of death, the ways too being ſtopp'd and hinder'd, ſo much the more eaſie and ready is the paſſage in thoſe that are alive through all the parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Renatus de Cartes</hi> a moſt acute and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious man (to whom for his honourable mentioning of my name I am much indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) and others with him, when they ſee the <hi>heart</hi> of a fiſh taken out placed upon an even board imitate a pulſe (by collecting it ſelf) in its erection, up-lifting, vigora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they think that it is ampliated, and dilated, and that the <hi>ventricles</hi> of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more capacious, not according to my opinion. For when it is gathered, at that time, the capacities of it are rather ſtreightned, and it is certain that it is then in its <hi>Sistole,</hi> and not in its <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> as neither when it falls weak and flagging, and is relax'd, it is then in its <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> or diſtention, and thence the <hi>ventricles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wider; ſo in a dead man we do not ſay that his <hi>heart</hi> is in the <hi>Diaſtole;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is flagging without any <hi>Syſtole,</hi> deſtitute of all manner of motion, and not diſtended at all, for it is diſtended pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and is in the <hi>Diastole</hi> when it is fill'd
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170011:44"/>by the impulſion of the blood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the <hi>ear,</hi> as in the Anatomie of living things is evident enough.</p>
               <p>Therefore they underſtand not how much the relaxation, and falling of the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>arteries</hi> differ from their diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and <hi>Diaſtole;</hi> that diſtention, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, and conſtriction, come not of the ſame cauſes, but from contrary cauſes, as making contrary effects; and diverſe, as making divers motions, as all Anatomiſts know very well, that the oppoſite <hi>muſcles</hi> in any part (called Antagoniſtae) are the cauſes of ſeverall motions, to wit, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and extenſion, ſo there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily by nature fram'd contrarie, and divers active organs, for contrary and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers motions.</p>
               <p>Nor dos this efficient cauſe of pulſe which he ſets down according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> pleaſe me, to wit, that the ebullition of the blood ſhall be both the cauſe of the <hi>Syſtole,</hi> and of the <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> For theſe motions are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtroaks, and ſwift hits. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſwels ſo like leaven, or boyls up ſo ſuddenly in the twinkling of an eye, and falls again, but that riſes leiſurely, and falls ſuddenly; beſides, indiſſection you may by your own eye-ſight diſcern, that the <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> are diſtended, and fill'd by the conſtriction of the <hi>ears,</hi> and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd in bigneſſe according as they are fill'd, more or leſſe, and that the diſtention
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170011:44"/>of the <hi>heart</hi> is a kind of violent motion, done by impulſion, not by an attraction.</p>
               <p>There are ſome who think, as there is no need of impulſion for the aliment in the nouriſhing of Plants, but it is by little and little drawn into the place of that which is ſpent by the indigent parts; ſo the vegetive faculty performs its work alike in both, but there is a difference. Calid influxive is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually requir'd to the entertaining of the members of creatures, and preſerving of vivifying heat in them, and for reſtoring of the parts which ſuffer by outward inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not for nutrition onely.</p>
               <p>So much of Circulation, which if it be not duely perform'd, or be hinder'd or perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or go too ſwiftly, there follows many dangerous ſorts of diſeaſes, and admirable ſymptoms, either in the <hi>veins,</hi> as ſwellings, abſceſſions, griefs, haemeroids, flux of blood, or in the <hi>arteries,</hi> as ſwellings, boyls, ſtrong and pricking pains, aneuriſms, tumors in the fleſh, fluxions, ſudden ſuffocations, <hi>aſthma's,</hi> ſtupidity, apoplexy, and others innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Likewiſe it is not fit to tel in this place, how as it were with an Enchantment, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are cur'd, and taken away, which were thought incurable.</p>
               <p>I may ſet down ſuch things in my medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obſervations, and diſcourſes of Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, which I have hitherto known to be obſerv'd by none.</p>
               <p>I will conclude (moſt learned <hi>Riolax</hi>) to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170011:45"/>give you more ample ſatisfaction, becauſe you think that there is no Circulation in the <hi>meſentericks;</hi> Let the <hi>vena porta</hi> be tied neer to the <hi>cymus</hi> of the <hi>liver</hi> in a live diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection, which you may eaſily try, you ſhall ſee by the ſwelling of the <hi>veins</hi> beneath the <hi>ligature,</hi> that ſame come to paſs which happens in blood-letting by tying of the arm, which will ſhow you the paſſage of the blood there.</p>
