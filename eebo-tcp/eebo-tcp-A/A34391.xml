         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
CONVERTED CAVALIER
HIS
CONFESSION:
Of their
DESIGNE, When they drew the King away from his
PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O confeſſe the truth of our Deſigne,
(of us I meane who are Proteſtants
and in the Kings party) it was at the
firſt) to accompliſh theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we perceived that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would not ſuffer us in our Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
which we had obtained of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and which had coſt us deare; and were like to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41400:3"/>
very profitable to us; we therefore were loth to lay them
downe, and forgetting the law of the land, wee thought
that his Majeſty might doe what he pleaſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee conceived that if wee could draw his Majeſty
away from his Parliament, into ſome remote place, where
we might incenſe and inrage him againſt them, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
him that they did abridge him of his prerogative,
and then promiſing him that to maintain his prerogative,
we would aſſiſt him with mony, horſes, and arms, thereby
to awe the Parliament; we thought this being performed,
that then we ſhould enjoy ſtill our unlawfull gaines by
Pattents as we had done formerly, ſo that being too much
leavened with the Earle of Straffords doctrine, we held
that if the Parliament would not apply themſelves to
his Majeſty, the King then was acquitted before God and
man, and might make uſe of his prerogative, this is the
firſt thing.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place we perceived that the Parliament
would indeavour to reform the Church government, and
take away all ſuperſtitious worſhip out of it, and that
they would amend (if not take away) the book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer, which thing ſeemed very grievous to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we deſired to ſerve God in a formall worſhip (it
being more pleaſing to the fleſh) and obey him only with
the outward man, for we thought that even that was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to God, and that we ſhould now be urged and preſſed
to a more ſpirituall worſhip, which we thought was quite
againſt the haire, likewiſe we thought it an high offence,
(now after the book of Common Prayer had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſo many yeares) that we ſhould goe to condemne
our fore-fathers for the uſe of it, by taking it away; we
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41400:3"/>
likewiſe hoped that when by this Deſigne of drawing the
King away, wee ſhould by force effect for him that hee
might by his prerogative doe what he pleaſed, and that
we ſhould have this book of Common Prayer ſet up (not
dreaming all this while that the Papiſts had any plot in
ſtirring us up, and likewiſe, our blind and ſuperſtitious
Miniſters to ſtand up for it, though indeed now we well
remember that one ſaid a year agoe that they would ſtirre
us up to ſtand for the Common Prayer till they had effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
their owne ends, and then wee ſhould have Popery
ſet up, and ſuch a Service Book as they would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on Scotland, (which now we may ſee is their plot)
in deſpite of a Puritan Parliament, and all their Puritan
adherents, and that we ſhould have our Lord Biſhops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
to curb thoſe that did ſpeak or doe any thing againſt
it, as they did heretofore (eſteeming that they which
were ſuch great Schollars were the only Church-men)
and all that which they did to be divine, and that we ought
to obſerve it; this was the ſecond thing.</p>
            <p>But now we ſee that they made uſe of us and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
but for their owne ends, for they had a deeper plot
and deſigne then in hand, then that wee were aware of,
which we find now to be this, that they indeavour, to
make a diviſion betwixt us that are (as yet) but Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
in name, and thoſe that are Proteſtants in heart,
that ſo we daſhing our ſelves one againſt another, both
parties might be conſumed, and then (when wee are ſo
weakned) they know it will be an eaſie matter for them to
deſtroy both parties; that this is their Deſigne wee ſhall
make appeare, by theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41400:4"/>
1. Becauſe theſe many yeares they have (by
means of ſome near to the King) had familiar
recourſe to the Court, there to agitate and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any Deſign that they had, and likewiſe
were much countenanced and favoured; as Mr.
<hi>Prin</hi> in his late book at large ſetteth forth, that
they had their Agents at Court conſiſting not
only of Ieſuits and Prieſts, but even of our own
Biſhops, which ſhould have been fathers to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
our Religion, they have bin cheife Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries
to ſet the Proteſtants together by the
eares, and the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by name hath
imployed a Ieſuit and a Papiſt to indeavour to
bring us to the Romiſh Religion, as it is laid
to his charge in his articles of impeachment;
now it is evident that this was the Deſign that
they proſecuted, becauſe firſt they did (according
as they durſt) in words and writings, diſgrace
the profeſſion and profeſſors of the Proteſtant
Religion, thereby to cauſe prophane people to
hate, thoſe that were more forward in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
then themſelves.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe they cannot indure any that are
of the Proteſtant Religion, neither are they to
<pb facs="tcp:41400:4"/>
keep faith with us (as their Religion teacheth
them) who are Proteſtants, but they may mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and deſtroy us, and for ſo doing they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
heaven, then ſure it is very madnes and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in us to think that they will indeavour to
eſtabliſh the true Proteſtant Religion, which
they call hereſy, and howſoever although we
can indure their Religion practiced by both
great and ſmall among us, yet if they prevaile,
they will not leave one that beares the name of
a Proteſtant alive in our Kingdom, witnes what
they have done in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> there.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe now their Plot doth diſcover it
ſelfe, by bringing the Iriſh forces over; firſt the
Proteſtant forces, that ſo they might not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them there, but come over into England
to waſte themſelves, and ſuch Proteſtant forces
as were here before: And now they bring (O
you Malignants and all my fellow Cavaliers
open your eyes) the Iriſh Rebels (that have
killed ſo many thouſand Proteſtants in Ireland)
into England daily for to cut our throats, ſo
that now we may ſee that whatſoever colour
they put upon their deſigne, by perſwading us
that the King fought for the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb facs="tcp:41400:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his Prerogative, and that they that
were Papiſts did but aſſiſt him for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing
of the ſame, againſt thoſe which they
and we call Puritans, yet they do indeed intend
to bring us under the command of the Pope,
and ſo to take away the Kings Prerogative,
that he would be ſubject to him, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
His Majeſtie do indeed intend the true
Proteſtant Religion, yet (they prevailing) he
ſhall not be able to eſtabliſh it.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration of theſe things, is the true Cauſe
why we do now forſake their Proceedings, and publiſh it
to this intent, That others that ſtill proſecute the deſigne
that we did, may now take notice of the Papiſts, how they
make uſe of us to our own deſtruction; and then I hope,
you likewiſe will forſake them, as many already have
done, who are different from us in their perſons, but
more in their affections; and let us now make uſe of what
we ſee them do for our beſt advantage, and that is this;
Whereas we ſee them encouraging and countenancing
and helping them that are zealous in their falſe Religion,
ſo let us now unite our ſelves to thoſe that are zealous for
the Proteſtant Religion, and as much countenance encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and help them, both by our perſons and prayers, and
in particular this Parliament, which they have beene a
meanes to cauſe us ſo much to oppoſe: For ſure, had not
God raiſed them up as Inſtruments to ſtand for this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we had been all loſt. And this is my perſwaſion, and
my Reſolution is to adhere to the Kings Forces no more.</p>
