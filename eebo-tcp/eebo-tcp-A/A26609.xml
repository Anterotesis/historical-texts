            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Brethren and Fellow-Souldiers,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU cannot be ignorant of the many Endeavours, and earneſt Deſires of many good men in theſe Nations, to bring us to a Settlement; which it hath pleaſed God to diſ-appoint unto this day, and leave us as a broken and divided People, ready to run into Blood and Confuſion: which that we might prevent ſo great Calamities impending, after our earneſt ſeeking God for his Direction and Aſſiſtance, we finde no Expedient ſo likely, for the ſatisfaction of the good People, and the quiet and welfare of this Commonwealth, as the re-admiſſion of the Secluded Members, in order to a Legal Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Parliament by their own free Conſents; and to iſſue Writs for a future Full Repreſentative of the whole Commonwealth of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> under ſuch Qualifications as may ſecure our Cauſe, to convene on the twentieth of <hi>April</hi> next at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for the eſtabliſhing of this Commonwealth upon the Foundations of Juſtice and true Freedom. And to take away all juſt Jealouſies from you, we do aſſure you, that we ſhall joyn with you in the maintenance of thoſe ends expreſſed in the encloſed; and do expect your cheerful concurrence with us: and we deſire to take God to witneſs, that we have no Intentions or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to return to our old Bondage; but ſince the Providence of God hath made us free at the Coſt of ſo much Blood, we hope we ſhall never be found ſo unfaithful to God and his People, as to loſe ſo glorious a Cauſe: But we do reſolve with the Aſſiſtance of God, to adhere to you in the continuing of our dear-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Liberties, both Spiritual and Civil. The Reaſon of our Proceedings in this manner, may ſeem ſtrange: but if you duely conſider the Neceſſities of our Affairs, and the preſent ſtate of things, you will certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing ſo ſafe to ſecure Publick Intereſt, and to engage the Nations peaceably to ſubmit to a Free-State; moſt of theſe Members having given us full aſſurance, that their Seſſion in Parliament ſhall not be longer than abſolute neceſſity will require, to the putting the Government into Succeſſive Parliaments; they not being free ſo to act by the old Writs, as when they ſhall be called upon a Commonwealth-Account; and it's the Opinion of the trueſt Friends to a Free State, That it cannot be conſiſtent with the perpetual ſitting of theſe Members, being contrary to the Nature of ſuch a Government.</p>
            <p>And as we are confident the preſent Parliament now ſitting, will not Repeal any of the Acts, Ordinances, or Orders of this Parliament, for Sales, or Publick Diſpoſition of Lands; ſo We ſhall in our Station obſerve, and cauſe to be obſerved, all other Acts and Ordinances of this Parliament whatſoever; and humbly interpoſe with the next ſucceeding Parliament, not onely to paſs a farther Act of Confirmation of all ſuch Sales and Diſpoſitions of Lands, here and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but alſo of all the Diſtributions and Diſpoſitions of Lands and Houſes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Souldiery, Adventurers, or any other Perſons, made by or in purſuance of any of the Acts, Ordinances, or Orders of this preſent Parliament, or any pretended Parliamentary Authority. And We entreat You to ſend up an Officer, to give to the Lord General <hi>Monck</hi> an Account of Your Acquieſcence with Us herein. And if any diſ-affected perſons ſhall hereby take occaſion to make diſturbance of the Peace of the Commonwealth, either in favour of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> or any other pretended Authority, we deſire you to ſecure them, till the pleaſure of the Parliament or Council of State be known in that behalf. You ſhall ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily receive Encouragement and Supplies of Monies: and indeed, it was not the leaſt Motive to induce us to this way of Compoſure of Affairs, That we might facilitate the raiſing of Monies for the ſubſiſtence of the Army and Navy; which would not otherwiſe have been done (if at all) but with effuſion of blood. We have nothing more at this time, but to aſſure you that we ſhall ever remain,</p>
