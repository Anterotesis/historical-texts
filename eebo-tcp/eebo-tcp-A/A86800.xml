            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ours of the 27th paſt came ſafe, and with it your admiration of this <hi>great change</hi> which hath happened in the <hi>diſſolution</hi> of the late <hi>Parliament,</hi> which I not at all wonder at; for as this <hi>Iſland</hi> hath afforded the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>Revolutions</hi> that I think any memory affords us, of any time or place, ſo I believe this to be the greateſt of them; and ſo much the greater, as that it was done, in a manner, in an inſtant, without <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,</hi> without <hi>effuſion</hi> of blood, and, for any thing I can perceive, without the leaſt reſentment of thoſe whom it generally concerns. But when I ſhall put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what I have often enforc'd to you, or to ſay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcours'd, for the other is needleſſe, that the wayes of <hi>Providence</hi> are <hi>inſcrutable,</hi> and ſuch, as, though they ſeem to us <hi>unexpected</hi> and <hi>temerarious,</hi> yet are carried on with ſuch a ſtrange and ſupreme kind of <hi>deſign,</hi> it wilbe eaſie for an <hi>humble</hi> and an <hi>acquieſcing</hi> mind to ſee, that by ſeverall invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible degrees, they bring forth their <hi>laſt</hi> &amp; propos'd intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea with thoſe inſtruments which ſeem and intend to do the contrary. What man could have ſuppos'd, after the diſſolution of the Parliament preceding this laſt, to have had another ſo ſoon? and for this laſt, who could have i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd that by <hi>Act</hi> it ſhould have continued, much more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:166521:3"/>
gloriouſly have undertaken the defence of an <hi>injured</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by open arms againſt an <hi>Oppreſſor,</hi> and that theſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, with admirable variety of ſucceſſe, ſhould have been crowned with the extirpation of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collation of the perſon of a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> that that great <hi>Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> ſhould ſo bleſſe the endeavours of a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> now as I may ſay in its very <hi>ſwadling-clouts,</hi> as by them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to reduce thoſe dominions in 3 years, which a <hi>ſeries</hi> of <hi>proud</hi> &amp; <hi>luſty</hi> Monarks could not in 6 Centurys do? Beſides that <hi>navall</hi> oppoſition ſo fortunately &amp; gloriouſly made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the greateſt Maritime enemy in <hi>Europe,</hi> or to ſpeak with due acknowledgment, in the Earth. Yet are theſe men, after all theſe vigorous and happy actions, ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed like Down blown off a Thiſtle, and their power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd into ſuch hands, which a God hath made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall in theſe ſtrange <hi>Emanations</hi> of his Divine <hi>Will,</hi> ſo we may humbly conceive, he intends to make further uſe of to the finiſhing of that <hi>great</hi> work, which by ſuch viſible ſigns, he hath mad appeare he hath in hand for the glory of his name, the felicity of theſe Nations, and I believe for the bleſſed alteration of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am neither <hi>Stoick</hi> to believe that all things are <hi>link'd</hi> by ſuch a ſtrong <hi>chain</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> as that there is nothing left to man but <hi>Mechanically</hi> to act; nor yet can I reſign my ſelf to an abſolute belief of that ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> that <hi>To pray or fear is needleſſe, it being out of our power to prevail by either,</hi> but I ſhal modeſtly affirm it, that as I ever uſe to ſend up my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the beſt things I could, upon the emergencies of the ſeverall times, ſo upon the breaking out and diſcovery of every hidden Councell of above by ſome illuſtrious acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I have thrown my face upon the ground and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, never examining the <hi>meanes</hi> by which it was brought to paſſe, but the <hi>end</hi> to which it was brought; for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:166521:3"/>
I cannot deny unto you, that I have that reverence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to my great Lord and Maker, that as I believe every diſpenſation affords to me in particular, (be it bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or be it ſweet) a means of that grand conſummation of felicity, which I am hereafter to endeavour and expect, ſo even in politick bodies, wherein ſo many dear to <hi>him</hi> are concerned, he ſuffers not any Turn or Revolution, but his <hi>Omniſciency</hi> directs it, to the bettering or more happiſying of that people.</p>
            <p>And truely in my apprehenſion this is done at this ſeaſon, and though you ſeem to ſtare at it, as being unwilling to acknowledge that his hand is wiſe and powerfull, yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it were an argument wortheir of an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> to ſay, that <hi>irregular</hi> actions proceed from a careleſſneſſe <hi>above,</hi> than for a Chriſtian to imagin that his deſignations in the altering the affairs of any State ſhould not tend to a bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that State, and that that power into which he puts it, is not, in his mind, more fit and proper to manage it than that from which he took it; for if a <hi>Fly</hi> fall not to the ground without his <hi>conſent,</hi> I beſeech you what ſhall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of his <hi>care</hi> in the diſpoſition of Millions of <hi>men,</hi> things of his own image, without a high disbelief and contempt of his providence?</p>
            <p>Though I am not ignorant what ſome people ignorantly, or peradventure <hi>ſplenetickly</hi> and <hi>maliciouſly</hi> ſay, that he may ſuffer ſuch things for the puniſhment of a people, and for their <hi>reduction,</hi> yet when I ſeriouſly conſider it, that as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but good can flow from that pure and <hi>ſimple</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of goodneſſe, ſo are his ways of <hi>Providence,</hi> ſo far as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind We can ſee. He chaſtiſes <hi>private</hi> men differently from <hi>publick bodies,</hi> ſome that he dearly <hi>loves,</hi> he <hi>afflicts, purges,</hi> and <hi>refines,</hi> gives them heavineſſe for a day, that they may hereafter have an everlaſting weight of glory. <hi>States</hi> he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166521:4"/>
ſometimes afflicts for their own ſins, ſometimes for thoſe of their Governours, but ſtill out of his mercy he conſiders thoſe that are dear unto him, and ſearches out if there be <hi>ten</hi> good in <hi>Sodom,</hi> which if there be, he carries them out of their Captivity into the Land of Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Out of theſe conſiderations I for my part humbly ſubmit to this myſterious and ſudden action; and becauſe I perceive you not ſo well ſatisfyed with it, am content with what preſent reaſons I can, and out of my little intelligence, and ſmall underſtanding of things, to give you an account.</p>
            <p>And therefore we are to conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The manner of Government by the laſt Parliament;</p>
            <p>Then the right of obedience to Superior Powers; And</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the effects, or events, that may come upon the late change.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, I confeſſe they were a people of <hi>miracles,</hi> God made them gloriouſly inſtrumental in the reſcuing of his people from bondage, yet many of them were content to <hi>ſelf-centre,</hi> or to ſay better, lay little deſignes for their own <hi>greatneſſes;</hi> ſo that, while they ſeemed to look <hi>direct</hi> upon the <hi>publick</hi> Intereſt, their buſineſſe was to look <hi>aſquint</hi> upon their <hi>own:</hi> as if they had been employ'd by their Country not to make up publick, but private Breaches. Beſides that, the Houſe being by the laſt <hi>purge</hi> made thin, and few in a capacity to ſit, and fewer active, (unleſſe ſome that only trudg'd at Committees) there was an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty given them to become ſo familiar with one another, that what by their <hi>Ordinary</hi> at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and what by their <hi>conferences</hi> at the <hi>Speakers</hi> chamber before the ſitting of the Houſe, little was determined but out of <hi>deſign</hi> and <hi>faction: Oppoſitions</hi> and <hi>Conjunctions</hi> were laid, <hi>private intereſts</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terven'd, (and theſe commonly by way of exchange,) need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe things mightily inſiſted upon, whilſt thouſands of poor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166521:4"/>
               <hi>Creditors</hi> and <hi>Petitioners</hi> ſtarved at their door with their printed Papers, unheard, unregarded, unleſſe a craſty <hi>Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor</hi> had <hi>undertaken</hi> (for it is a term I hear as common as <hi>practiſe</hi> among <hi>Lawyers)</hi> to <hi>make</hi> ſome <hi>Members,</hi> and this with great expectation, and with ſuch ſucceſſe, as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught them what it was to <hi>truſt;</hi> whilſt all this time the Houſe, under whoſe hand this work lay, were laboriouſly content to ſit four times in a week, and that much about the rate of 2. or 3. houres a day, whereas the whole week had been time little enough for their work. And as for <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,</hi> unleſſe they were either very ſtanding, or ſome Great Men notably engag'd, there have been ſome men have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>nine</hi> or <hi>twelve</hi> moneths to bring one together, and this poſſibly for an adjournment of as long a time. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, Sir, conſider, that though ſome wholeſom Laws they made, and many happy actions have been done under them, yet God hath ſome precious Inſtruments ſtill over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling theſe odd deſigns &amp; combinatons, which are otherwiſe privately hatch'd by ſome corrupt ones among them. What theſe men have done as to <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> I am to confeſſe they have altered the Titles of <hi>Writs,</hi> they have told us we have a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> but for any <hi>eſſential</hi> fruits thereof, a man may <hi>(drolling)</hi> ſay, they have cut off the head of a <hi>King,</hi> and ſet a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which like <hi>Epistemon</hi> in <hi>Rabelais</hi> (who was beheaded in a fight) are ſo finely <hi>ſewed</hi> together, that they return out of <hi>Hel,</hi> and tell things that they did there.</p>
            <p>For to ſpeak freely, what they did for us was very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and with ſuch a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſlowneſſe, that unleſſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome particular Intereſt, or ſome immediate Neceſſity enforc'd them to haſt, it was a common difficulty of a year or two to get paſſe an <hi>Act.</hi> If this had been out of <hi>grave</hi> conſideration, or any laudable and politick <hi>providence,</hi> the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166521:5"/>
preſent Age might have been content, and Poſterity made happier: But it was either their work, or made it appear their work, to <hi>ſpin</hi> out the time, waſt the day in the toſſing of a Feather, and then came in ſome motion of an old <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> who had ſo much a year given him for reſigning up an <hi>illegal</hi> Office; or ſtood up ſome other, who brought old <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears,</hi> (which it may be the poor <hi>Souldiery</hi> was never ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for) and for this, he muſt have ſuch a ſum of money out of <hi>Diſcoveries,</hi> by which ſome Countryman or other muſt be brought into vexation, and forc'd to compound; The <hi>publick</hi> buſineſſe in the mean time was commonly <hi>pre-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> on in the <hi>Speakers</hi> Chamber, and ordinarily at the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the <hi>Cue,</hi> (which was the uſuall buſineſs of ſome ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Fellow put upon it) confirm'd and tranſacted. And as for <hi>Petitions,</hi> they had ſuch a rare and excellent faculty of diſpatching them, that I believe there have been 10000. Petitions offered to them, that could never be read, half as many read, that received none but delatory anſwers at Committees, and I doubt as many more were deterr'd, out of the meer conſideration of the ſucceſſe of others. But you will ſay, they ſet up a <hi>Committee for Petitions,</hi> I grant you they did, but it was with ſuch <hi>Rules,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Reſtrictions,</hi> that I believe it very impoſſible to make any perſon appear that was thereby benefited.</p>
            <p>Thus much to them as a <hi>Body,</hi> to break it in pieces, and look on it in the individual, he were a diſ-ingenuous man that would not confeſſe, that there have been among them as <hi>brave</hi> men, as <hi>wiſe</hi> and worthy <hi>Patriots,</hi> as any Nation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had. But yet if you will take into your Remembrance, that there have been many Lands ſold, firſt the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> then the <hi>Dean and Chapters,</hi> then the <hi>King</hi>'s, <hi>Queen</hi>'s, and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi>'s, then the <hi>Fee-farms,</hi> (the <hi>Foreſt Lands</hi> too coming on) then the <hi>Delinquents,</hi> and all theſe to be doubled upon (a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:166521:5"/>
touch whereof I ſhall give you anon by way of digreſſion) and all this to be diſpatched by <hi>Trustees</hi> nominated by the <hi>Parliament;</hi> you muſt needs think there was very notable carriage in this Buſineſſe, as to the Profit of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> For firſt, 3 <hi>d. per</hi> pound muſt be allowed in point of purchaſe; then you had <hi>Registers</hi> (who conſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by Deputie) at <hi>high</hi> Fees, and their <hi>Under-Officers</hi> as <hi>cunning</hi> and as <hi>ravenous</hi> as thoſe of the <hi>old</hi> Courts. Then muſt <hi>march</hi> forth an <hi>Army</hi> of ignorant and unlearned <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors,</hi> and theſe at 20 ſh. <hi>per diem,</hi> to return Surveys ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times low, in the favour of ſome noble Gentleman, in whoſe eye it was to purchaſe, and ſometimes exceſſively high, for to over-ballance the other; (beſides the <hi>Kings</hi> Lands, which being allotted for the payment of the <hi>Souldiery,</hi> were commonly over-valued by one half,) whilſt in the mean time a ſingle <hi>Mathematician</hi> did properly all their work to their hands; and all this, beſides a peſtilent ſort of people called <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> &amp;c. who <hi>intangled</hi> rights, <hi>diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed</hi> the people, and carried on the buſineſſe ſo excellently well, that poſſibly much about one half might by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours be brought into the Coffers of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>After the return of this Survey, ſo laudably perform'd as I have deſcribed to you, an honeſt <hi>Member</hi> caſts a <hi>ſheeps-eye</hi> at ſuch a Manour. Marry then he goes to <hi>Gurney-houſe,</hi> ſends in <hi>his name,</hi> and tels them he was to attend the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament immediately; upon that he is called in, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people had been deſign'd, and other buſineſſe directed for that time; and by his <hi>authority,</hi> or <hi>friends</hi> at the Table (for he that had a hand in placing them there, muſt needs have favour from them) makes a Contract as low as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, gets it may be ſo long time, as that he may pay for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166521:6"/>
Manour out of the <hi>Manſion-houſe,</hi> or the <hi>Woods;</hi> and by this means it is incredible to what Eſtates ſome have raiſed themſelves. One of them who was a Brewers Clark, his man was heard to ſay, That he thank'd God his Maſter had now 800 l. a year. Another Gentleman having not an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-conſiderable Fortune before, hath made it 10. or 12000 l. a year, and hath been heard to ſay, (as I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) That he had more Land than any man in <hi>England.</hi> Another comming out of a <hi>Draper</hi>'s ſhop at <hi>York,</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd himſelf into an Eſtate in Poſſeſſion and Reverſion of above 5000 l. a year. But examples of this kind are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable.</p>
            <p>This brings me on to tell you, That the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> hath been as <hi>juſt</hi> and as <hi>unjuſt</hi> in point of their debts, as 'tis poſſible for men to be; <hi>just</hi> they were in providing ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for their Creditors; <hi>unjuſt</hi> they were in delay of time, and the little ſatisfaction they received by it. For was it not an unreaſonable thing, that 20 l. really <hi>lent</hi> out, or (which is as good) <hi>earn'd,</hi> ſhould be reduced to ſo many Twenty-pences, or Two-ſhilings's? yet the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> pays it to the <hi>full,</hi> with <hi>Intereſt,</hi> whilſt the <hi>needy</hi> Creditor happly is glad to preſerve <hi>life</hi> by that means; whereas men that had money, <hi>doubling</hi> thus, (a way indeed at firſt thought on for better advance, but ſince proving to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Creditor) and <hi>traffiquing</hi> with accepted <hi>Bils,</hi> either made a ſhift to make 70 or 80 <hi>per cent.</hi> of their moneys, or if they had any hearts for the Parliament (which was not common) were content to take <hi>improveable</hi> Lands as 5 years purchaſe, or thereabouts: So that many people of very inconſiderable Fortunes, have now prodigiouſly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to vaſt Eſtates. I know one, formerly not worth 16 ſcore pounds in all the world, now by valuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:166521:6"/>
where he lives, worth 1600 pound a year. Others I have known worth nothing at all, that now can reckon to 5 and 600 pound <hi>per annnm.</hi> But you may tell me again, that this is no Argument againſt a <hi>Government.</hi> I ſay it is a good one againſt the <hi>Governors,</hi> ſince they are ſo palpably <hi>engag'd</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>By this time I conceive you to be of opinion that things were not ſo <hi>admirably</hi> well governed, yet many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of <hi>private</hi> ſufferings, many <hi>honeſt</hi> hearts were content to ſit down, and <hi>groan</hi> under their own <hi>miſery,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than interrupt ſuch <hi>publick</hi> proceedings, as they ſaw God ſo eminently glorified in. But when we had reduced our enemies abroad, and brought them upon their knees, and began to entertain hopes of a future peace, and eſtabliſhed liberty, we were diverted by other deſigns, and the buſineſſe was, how to continue a <hi>lazy</hi> unactive power, not to <hi>remedy</hi> the ſufferings of a Nation. This brought the <hi>Army</hi> into Conſulation, a ſort of men whom God hath ſo ſingularly own'd, and crown'd by ſo many remarkable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, that it was eaſily perceivable that God intended by them to do ſtrange things. Theſe as free people firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that they would aſſert our liberties, and ſince did not only reſcue but protect the Parliament, and aſſiſt them in the late grand Negotiations. <hi>without</hi> them, they might have been expoſed to the affronts of the multitude, and as in-effective as againſt the <hi>Prentiſes</hi> when they ſhut up the door; <hi>with</hi> them they have done marvelouſly. Now the caſe ſtands thus, The <hi>Liberty</hi> of the People being recovered by the <hi>Sword,</hi> that is to ſay by the <hi>Army,</hi> this Army continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a <hi>Mediator,</hi> or (if a man may ſay ſo) a <hi>Superviſor</hi> of the Peoples Liberties, it muſt be proper for them to ſee that no encroachment may be done thereupon. But here
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:166521:7"/>
comes the pinch, the <hi>Parliament</hi> have not ſatiſfied the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> neither by effectuall Laws, nor vigorous proceedings, the People are diſcontented; the Army want not their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, they are moved for a new Parliament, (but <hi>irregular</hi> motions move ſlowly) they trifle it off two or three years, and frivolouſly <hi>debate</hi> it into a neceſſity, and at laſt provide the buſineſſe ſo, as that their Kingdom may ſtand, and others ſit with them upon the Throne, that is to ſay, like <hi>Theſeus</hi> his ſhip, perpetually to be peeced, and made into the ſame. But this neither ſtands with the <hi>fundamentall</hi> right of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor eſtabliſhed <hi>Liberty.</hi> For if you will allow a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> you cannot allow any thing more <hi>deſtructive</hi> to it, than the Continuation of many men in the ſame power, eſpecially unlimited and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme. For otherwiſe knowledg of <hi>Faces, Acquaintance, Familiartty,</hi> and thoſe little <hi>intrigues</hi> men will make, though they hate one another, will bring all to Ruine.</p>
            <p>But yet ſuch a <hi>deſign</hi> as this were they about, and when they ſaw that a <hi>neceſsity</hi> was upon them for to break up at laſt, they then came down to the third of November this year, but the <hi>Act</hi> which had been 3 years a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, was ſo warily provided, that what in point of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors</hi> and <hi>Elected,</hi> we ſhould have been within a month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>new</hi> Parliament in a worſe condition than we had been during the ſitting of the <hi>old.</hi> They that were to be <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors,</hi> were People that had not <hi>forfeited</hi> their <hi>Liberty,</hi> which in Engliſh is rendred thus, People it may be <hi>un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble, unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, malignant,</hi> and <hi>malicious</hi> enough, though ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offended the State, but in their Ale; theſe to be <hi>Elected, men that had conſtantly been true to the Common-wealth.</hi> This if the malice and cunning of men can do any thing, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:166521:7"/>
to as much as to ſay, that many <hi>Malignants</hi> who from their very hearts and ſouls hated the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and all its Dependances, yet in point of Intereſt and profit, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, might have been brought in. Beſides that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party (which is meerly a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> in a <hi>Genevah</hi> cloak, but ſomewhat more inſupportable) may by this rule all come in. For they may have vigorouſly acted at the firſt, whilſt they thought the Beer which was a brewing might be their own mornings draught, but ſeeing it was provided for others, they took <hi>ſnuff,</hi> and forſook the <hi>Houſe,</hi> nay and are become enemies; ſo that upon this account, inſtead of bringing a ſelect Company of honeſt Gentlemen to debate together, we ſhould have brought ſo many Bandogs to have travers'd Factions. For what other could we expect when men of ſuch humors and tempers ſhould neceſſarily meet?</p>
            <p>This you will ſay, might be prevented by examining the returns of the <hi>Writs.</hi> Suppoſe it. But here is firſt, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to that end, as who can diſcover a mans heart? who a mans ways? who can judge that a Convert is reall, or abſolutely aſſure himſelf, that another man is not an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite? for things of another mans boſom is matter of the niceſt ſcruple in the World; and an exact hypocrite may deceive the moſt cautious and nice Counſail that can be made among men. Yet ſuppoſing this buſineſſe feaſible, here ariſes another queſtion, Whether the Peoples right or no, in point of Election, be not extinguiſh'd by this <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perviſing?</hi> (for as yet I cannot find any other word for it.) For either they have a right of <hi>liberty</hi> to chooſe, or not, but both <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> have declared they have; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their election is good: But if there be a power <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi> to <hi>allow</hi> or <hi>diſallow</hi> of this Election, (which ſuppoſing an examination of the returns of the <hi>Writs,</hi> you muſt needs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:166521:8"/>
grant, otherwiſe it will be in vain to examine them) then that <hi>Election</hi> of theirs ſignifies nothing; For if I in a <hi>Caſe of Law</hi> chooſe my <hi>Arbitrator,</hi> and the Judge, or a third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath power to <hi>allow</hi> or <hi>diſallow</hi> him, I cannot properly be ſaid to have a <hi>choice,</hi> becauſe <hi>choice</hi> is an effect of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Controlment</hi> are things that cannot conſiſt together. So that hence it will amount, that this proviſion was weak and not of aſſurance enough to our purpoſe, and if two inconveniences were to be run upon, it were much better to run upon the leſſe.</p>
            <p>This is an Hypotheſis, I ſee not how it could be ſalved otherwiſe than by chooſing ſuch <hi>idoneous</hi> perſons, and that in ſuch a number as might carry on the work; for though <hi>multitude of Counſellors</hi> is ſtrength and ſafety, yet in <hi>diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd</hi> and turning States it is weakneſſe and <hi>diſtraction;</hi> And theſe ſuch kind of men as are fit to have the reigns of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their hands, and ſuch as by a ſwift and due proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſhould ſatisfie the people, what it is to be free. This is a buſineſſe either to be done by the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> by the <hi>People,</hi> or by the <hi>Army.</hi> The firſt like cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Brokers</hi> would not do it; The ſecond like troubleſome <hi>Ideots</hi> cannot do it, and the third as wiſe Guardians muſt do it.</p>
            <p>And therefore though this <hi>change</hi> may carry much in it as to appearance of <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>terror,</hi> yet when a man will conſider theſe two things, that the Liberty of his Nation ought to be the deareſt thing to him under Heaven, and that without theſe men and means it cannot be preſerved, (for take away the force that protects us, all our enemies ſhall flow in upon us) he muſt neceſſarily grant a ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to what they do. For he that hath power to <hi>command,</hi> hath alſo power to <hi>guide,</hi> theone without the other being inſignificant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:166521:8"/>
And therefore ſince we are in a Tempeſt, let us come to this Rock (to ſpeak at the harſhlieſt) rather than periſh. For you cannot conceive but the worſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the world is infinitely better than none at all; or to ſpeak a little cloſelyer, an ill Government well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, may be much better than a completer form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ill manag'd, people ſtill judging by their <hi>Safety,</hi> or <hi>Liberty,</hi> or <hi>Civill</hi> advantages, the effects not only of their Government but Rulers.</p>
            <p>For matter of <hi>change</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> leſt you may be diſſatisfied, I have thus much briefly to ſay, that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the actions of the late <hi>Parliament,</hi> and their <hi>diſſolution,</hi> we are to remember by what means they were called, and for what end. They were called at firſt by a <hi>Writ</hi> of the King, and that by the ordinary ſummons of a Writ, and that on the Kings part compulſively. But God that hath a mind to do much out of little, ſo proſpered them, that by an Act of the whole Parliament as then it ſtood, they were enabled to ſit till they ſhould diſſolve themſelves. Tis a queſtion worthy the reſolution of a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe men ſitting by <hi>that</hi> Authority, were not tyed to follow exactly the <hi>Rules</hi> of it? For certainly every <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Commiſsion</hi> ties according to the <hi>Intent.</hi> They thought fit to throw out the Lords <hi>ſpirituall, alias Biſhops;</hi> they manage a War againſt the <hi>King</hi> upon their own <hi>Authority,</hi> and by vertue of <hi>that</hi> Act; they were purg'd of <hi>Malignant</hi> or <hi>Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected</hi> Members, by the Army, (whoſe duty it was to interpoſe in ſo dangerous a time) and at laſt declared and eſtabliſhed a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> Thus did they act, and that to the eternall Renown of the Nation, for four years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; But, when dieaſes grew upon them (as all <hi>ſedenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Bodies are ſlow and <hi>unactive)</hi> there appear'd ſuch a lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:166521:9"/>
in the execution of that power, ſuch a <hi>Lethargy</hi> as to Act in the <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> that <hi>theſe</hi> immortal perſons, whoſe blood had been ſtirr'd or ſpill'd in their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to awake, and remember for whom they had done ſo great things, that is to ſay, for the People. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they being (as I have ſaid) <hi>Arbitrators,</hi> men whoſe eys were open, and Conſciences not branded, riſe up, and begun to look and conſider in what condition the People was, whereof they were a part; and therefore, when neither <hi>Addreſſes, Reaſons, propoſalls,</hi> nor <hi>Petitions,</hi> of a long time could prevaile, it is not ſtrange at all if they were forced to that of the Phyſician <hi>Vre &amp; Seca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know your Objection before hand, that the action of the <hi>Lord Generall</hi> in the Diſſolution was ſomewhat <hi>rough,</hi> and <hi>Barbarous,</hi> and I ſhall not trouble you with a long An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That, as to his <hi>Perſon,</hi> as he hath in the Field de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf one of the Nobleſt <hi>aſſertors</hi> of our <hi>Liberty,</hi> and as great an enlarger of our Territories as ever was, ſo as for any particular <hi>deſigns</hi> of his own in point of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it muſt be a <hi>ſcrutiny</hi> greater than <hi>humane</hi> that can diſcover, how he either intended to <hi>invade</hi> us, or to make us a prey to any <hi>ambition</hi> of his. And therefore if upon this grand <hi>Revolution,</hi> he might appear to his enemies <hi>paſsionate,</hi> yet conſidering the <hi>extremities</hi> that <hi>great</hi> minds fall into, and the great <hi>trust</hi> committed to him, it will appear nothing but the diſcharge of that <hi>duty</hi> that lay upon him. To have done ſuch a thing as a <hi>ſingle</hi> Generall, wants neither exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple nor preſident (but I would not injure an argument in a Letter by the by, which I could make good in a whole Treatiſe.) For you may remember that of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the <hi>Tribune, Young man</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>'twas eaſier for me</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:166521:9"/>
               <hi>to ſay this than to do it,</hi> a ſpeech (ſayes Sir <hi>Francis Bacon)</hi> both the proudeſt and the mildeſt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came out of the mouth of Man: For at that time he was breaking open the <hi>Sacred Treaſury,</hi> which by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lawes was not to be broken open. But it is otherwiſe here, this was not a raſh preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate Act of his, but a <hi>Truſt,</hi> and <hi>Reſult</hi> of thoſe under him. Twas fit he that was the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſhould appear, and he as civilly without noiſe or diſturbance did it. And therefore Acting by their <hi>Votes,</hi> and by their <hi>conſents,</hi> it was <hi>their</hi> action as well as <hi>his;</hi> and it was no more <hi>his</hi> action than it is the action of the <hi>Head</hi> moved by <hi>Tendons</hi> and <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> which are parts of the Body, and without which the Head it ſelf could not poſſibly at all move.</p>
            <p>So that here it comes to a Queſtion, Whether it be better for us to be in <hi>Slavery</hi> under the name of <hi>Liberty,</hi> or in <hi>Liberty</hi> under the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi> I have told my thoughts before, in what condition I conceiv'd our Liberty was, and I repeat it once again, that I think this preſent is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expedient. For ſuppoſing that the ſeverall <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> ſhould withdraw their ſeverall <hi>Members</hi> (for I ſuppoſe they could not of late pretend to ſit by <hi>VVrit)</hi> certainly they would never have made a <hi>Quorum</hi> in Parliament; and ſuppoſe they ſhould call them to account, where had one Authority without the conſent of all the Counties, or rather all People capable to demand it from them? And if you will ſay that the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> by this meanes is <hi>ſtifled,</hi> I muſt tell you again, it is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:166521:10"/>
only <hi>ſuſpended,</hi> 'tis a Sword taken out of a <hi>Mad</hi> Mans hand, till he recover his <hi>ſenſes;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, till we be <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lted, Coagulated,</hi> or <hi>Centred,</hi> (call it what you pleaſe) it is <hi>Tantum non impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibile</hi> for to loſe ſuch a <hi>Liberty</hi> of chooſing a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative</hi> as a Rationall Man may expect good from.</p>
            <p>It is a ſcruple that hath vex'd many People, how and in what manner, or whether or no, we are to obey new Governments, (this is the ſecond point I propoſed) and this comes by reaſon of <hi>Oathes</hi> impos'd by Governours, who think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to chain Men to them, whereas if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, promiſſory and obligatory, Oathes tye pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, <hi>Semper &amp; ad ſemper,</hi> (as the <hi>School-men</hi> tell me) whereas <hi>obedience</hi> to a <hi>Sovereignty</hi> (which being plac'd in one or more is the ſame) extends, nor can extend no further than during the <hi>protection</hi> thereby received. For to put the Caſe at the worſt, I am among a Company of Theeves commanded upon my life not to diſcover, the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> ſay, that this ſecrecy of mine, though they be <hi>Outlawes,</hi> and perſons under the heavieſt cenſure of <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> ought to be perform'd, for this is but a price of my life (beſides my promiſe) and in that conſideration I ought to forbear it. But I'l take it at the beſt ſenſe, inſteed of falling into the hands of Theeves, I am under the protection of thoſe that protect me from them, and then I muſt ſay that I owe theſe Men the very ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but much more <hi>Religiouſly</hi> and with a greater deal of honor and <hi>veneration</hi> than the o- <pb n="17" facs="tcp:166521:10"/>
other.
The <hi>first</hi> may take away my life if they pleaſe, the <hi>ſecond</hi> cannot only ſecure me, but avenge my blood upon the Murtherers. The <hi>first</hi> are unaccountable, unleſſe by their private puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Theſe</hi> reſponſible. For I remember a thing that <hi>Bodin</hi> ſaid excellently, that <hi>The King though he make Lawes, it tied to thoſe Lawes;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>accountable. They</hi> are inviſible, <hi>Theſe</hi> viſible. And therefore a man would rather chuſe his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſuch as he knew where to repair to, and by whoſe means he might be redreſſed, than ſuch a one as could not own it ſelf. For let men ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin what they will, yet upon largeſt conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and deepeſt experience, they muſt find, that <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> are ſo <hi>related</hi> that they cannot be ſeparated one from another, and that the abſurdities of the contrary are ſuch as cannot rationally be avoyded.</p>
            <p>For I muſt neceſſarily ſwear either to <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Place;</hi> by the <hi>Perſon</hi> I underſtand a Man <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> or claiming to Govern, either by himſelf or Succeſſors; by <hi>Place</hi> I underſtand a particular Mans <hi>Vaſſalage, Liberty,</hi> or <hi>Privilege</hi> in any one <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> As to the firſt, it concerns not me by what <hi>name</hi> any Man is diſtingniſhed, the determination of his <hi>power</hi> determines my <hi>obedience,</hi> which (as I have ſaid) is <hi>correlative</hi> to <hi>protection.</hi> As if <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> ſhould enjoyn me a Command I ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in, I ought not by any Law of God or Man to obey, unleſſe he could protect me in the execution <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:166521:11"/>
I ſhould be ſo conſiderate as to remember a <hi>Hurdle</hi> and <hi>Tyburne,</hi> and therefore diſobey. For if the <hi>Civilians</hi> allow it, and that Generally, that a <hi>stranger</hi> doing a miſdemeanour in another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, though properly he is not tryable by the Lawes of that Country, yet thereby ought to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; I ſay it is as much reaſon that a <hi>Native,</hi> doing againſt the Lawes of his own Country, be they in whoſe hands they will, ſhould be ten times more puniſhed (if it were poſſible) as a breacher of <hi>Faith,</hi> and a <hi>deſertor</hi> of that <hi>protection</hi> by which he lives. Honeſt men may diſſent in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle things, and it may be their wayes of reaſoning are not the ſame, but for any man under what pretence ſoever, to act againſt the grand deſign of the happineſſe of his Nation, is ſuch a matter, as whoever would tell me, that a Man were a peaceable Man, and withall aſſaulting me with a <hi>Stilletto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is yet another thing that may ſtick in your Stomach, (which is the laſt thing propoſed by me) which in reſpect you have urged with a little ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe I am content to clear you of, and that is, the great loſſe of <hi>Reputation</hi> which you ſuppoſe we may receive from our <hi>Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Correſpondents</hi> abroad. Certainly, Sir, if you would but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that in matter of publick <hi>Treaties, Perſons</hi> are not dealt with, but <hi>Nations;</hi> (for our <hi>late</hi> King Treated with <hi>Don JOHN</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and yet this was no breach of the League between him and <hi>Spain)</hi>
it can ſignifie no more than the Alteration of the Title of their <hi>Credentialls;</hi> For all Treaties
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:166521:11"/>
between <hi>States,</hi> are between the <hi>Powers</hi> of thoſe <hi>States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though <hi>Uſurpation</hi> or <hi>Election</hi> appoint one Name, yet ſtill it amounts to this, that the State is concerned, and that only. Friendſhips in <hi>private</hi> men are different from thoſe of <hi>Princes,</hi> and that as much as the Mariages of <hi>Princes</hi> one to another: <hi>Princes</hi> are Married by <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Pictures, private</hi> Men by <hi>acquaintance</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi> and no doubt if <hi>Boccalini</hi> were alive, and ſhould hear any Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that they did otherwiſe, he would ſay they were <hi>Tramontani,</hi> and not allow them <hi>Portar la dot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trina ſopra le ſpali.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this doth not come home to my queſtion, that which I would particularly inſiſt on is this, that I believe this <hi>change</hi> or <hi>event</hi> will contribute more to our <hi>happineſſe</hi> than if we had ſtill <hi>langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed</hi> under our former ſufferings. I have told you what the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Army</hi> is, to tell you of the reſt were a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true, <hi>great</hi> Births are hard in the <hi>Labour,</hi> and many Glorious men have been cut out of the Womb, Therefore wonder not, if the account that they may give you be ſlow, or poſſibly ſlower than you expect. I am no <hi>Member</hi> of their <hi>Councills</hi> and by a late infirmity leſſe able to attend them, yet if I can believe any thing; or underſtand Men when they make the cleareſt <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> they intend all noble things, both as to the

But theſe are not only wiſhes of mine, but hopes, and certain expectancies, and I believe they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince theſe men to be lyars that ſpeak againſt them. But now I think I have put you to all the tryalls of your patience, which if my infirmity had not been, which confin'd me to my Chamber, I could not have done, but I rely ſo much on your Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and I believe you think ſo well of my vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as I want not the impudence to affirm my ſelf (however you take it)</p>
