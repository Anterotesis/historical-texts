            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And the Rabbins vvhich haue in fragmentes yet the floures of all the N.

So it may be eaſily ſeene hovv for the Apoſtles tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Ebrevv, D. Bilſon ſeeth nothing.

And vvheras S.

thus: you muſt not vnderſtand that of promiſes corporall, but of the promiſes touching the ſoule in the vvorld to come. And our Doctours gather this he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, THE BLESSED GOD VVIL CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY THE IVST PEOPLE INTO PARADISE AND HIS GLORY SHALL BE AMONGEST THEM. This diuinity is ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confirmed in the Nevv Teſtament, as in Iohn 17. I vvill that they be vvher I am 8. 2. Cor. 5. VVe knovv that if this earhtly tabernacle of ours be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, vve have a building from God, an houſe not made vvith handes, eternall in the heauens. Thus the Nevv Teſtament ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth moſt agreably to the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines ſpeach: as it hath but tvvo poinctes differing from them, the incarnation &amp; reſurrection.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14211:17"/>
yf the Ievves can be perſuaded of thoſe tvvo, they vvill admire all the reſt as eloquently agreing vvith the pure and the beſt of their doctrine. A Rabbin at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil 1598. made this knovven to the Scholers there: vvho being taught in longue ſpeach, hovv the Apoſtles excelled in all Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud ſkill, vvhen the party vvas gone to Zurick deſired the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors to vvrite to them of Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, to requeſt him to returne. But the party could not: yet left in print that vvhich might mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve him: &amp; moved one Ievv that novv is in Cambridge, as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Stode ſay he confeſſed there, to be a Chriſtian: by the CNOſtantinopolitans Ievves petition of inſtruction from En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gland, and by anſvver to him. And all vvould admire the Nevv
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14211:17"/>
Teſtament: being expounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theyr ſpeach to vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bookes vvere vvritten. But vvhen Latines vvhich vvere ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in the Greek and Hebrevv of the Apoſtles age, muſt be cited, by Doctours as rude, darkenes &amp; confuſion vvill take all. D. Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ignorance thus appeareth. He tooke in hand to defend Ar. VVhitgift: that our Lord his ſou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le vvent hence to Hel: and not hence to heauen. All ſides agree that no further iourney vvas ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the body but the retur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne from Hades to it. So he took in hand to defend D. VVhitgift. But he betrayed him to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſhame: in that he impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many, perſecuted more, and vrged ſome to death vpon conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentes for denying that our Lord vvent hence to Hell. D.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14211:18"/>
Bilſon yet betrayeth him: to ſmart for his hereticall diſturba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Church: and ioineth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt VVhitgift vvith the aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſarie: that our Lord vvent hence to Paradiſe. This matter is paſt all deniall: that D. Bilſon betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Canterburies cauſe: to ſhevv it to haue bene hereticall and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanean: that the Prince might call him to heauy iudgement.</p>
            <p>And vvhile D. Bilſon is of any auctority, D. Bancroft folovving D. VVh. muſt needes be holden an heretique. But this only is not D. Bilſons vviſdome. more he hath. VVheras he bringeth ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for himſelf and his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, &amp; muſt plead that King Edvv<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ard the ſixt vvas of his mynd, and Q.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14211:18"/>
God &amp; the Princes ſay the ſame, it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that yf he rage againſt any one for ſaying that our Lord vvent hence to Paradiſe, by ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, by our Princes faith, by D. Bilſons faith, he rageth againſt God, againſt the Princes and his ovvne ſoule. But all this doth D. Bilſon. His vvordes ſhallbe commended plentifully to all poſterity. Thus they ſtande in his ſermon book fol. 419. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to M. Iacob. Tell then your abettour that all the realme vvill take him not only for a rayler a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all honeſty, but a lyer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all duty that voucheth ſo confidently: King Edvvard the ſixt and his ſubiects held that Chriſt his ſoule never vvent to Gehenna: and the realme knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Qu. oath, as alſo the Qu. aduentureth her eternall ſtate.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14211:19"/>
Theſe be not ſtates to come vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin his vncleane mouth.

That our Lord ſhould goe

from Paradiſe to Hades. So he hath gone from vvincheſter to England. Graecians vvould tel him he might as vvel ſay the one as the other. VVher Hades is generall: and by circumſtances of difference is ſometime heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſometime Hell. And yf he care not for prophane Graecians ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and Philoſophers, from vvhom a Greeke oration vvas printed at Francfurt againſt him, and an other at Hannavv, Greeke Diuines ſhall as generally damne him: as voyd of faith herein, none of them euer beleeved that any ſoule vvent from Paradiſe to Hades, or yet to Gehenna.</p>
            <p>But the extremity of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for vvhich all Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome ſhould reproue him ſtandeth in theſe vvordes, for the meaning of the Creede. They ſhalbe vv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritten

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14211:20"/>
ſide. Yf Paganes, Machmadiſtes, and Ievves ſhould heare D. Bilſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make a ſermon vvith theſe vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des before D. Bancrofts G. vvith his approbation, they vvould &amp; vvell might ſay, that the fooli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheſt of all Homers fables had as good Chriſtianity, as his G. that ſuffred this to be printed, and the others Lp. that no more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Lord, that (as vve ſay) bought him vvith his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood. No Chriſtian euer thought that a mans ſoule vvent not to Hades till his body vvas buryed, nor any in Homers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles being avvaked: only Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in a dreame of his knight Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocles kild by Hector, thus hard Patrocles ſoule complaine, that the body being vnburied it could not goe to Hades. Iliad 23.</p>

me: thou neuer diddeſt ſo while I liued: only ſince I died. Bury me quicly, that I may paſse the gates of Hades.

            <p>Thus the right reuerend father may ſee, that his Lp. hath no fellovv for Diuinity but his abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and Achilles dreames. The burgeſſes of the Parlement are very patient that lent him the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and revenues of a Lord after this Patroclean Divinity. He that ſpake and the vvorld vvas made, vvill ſend him to Hell for ever &amp; euer: or teach him to reuerence better theſe vvordes Eb. 9. vvhen Chriſt came an high ſacrificer of the good to come, by a greater &amp;

Theſe vvordes ſhall make him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, not only ſo far as he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made, that our Lord his moſt holy ſoule vvent hence to Paradiſe to the hand of God, to the ſanctuarie, to the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but alſo, that our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption vvas then founde: and no addition muſt be ioyned thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And this tendeth to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me purpoſe, folovving ther: that Chriſt by his eternall ſpirit offred him ſelf in his blood vvithout blemiſh vnto God: that death being performed the called may inioy the promese of eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14211:22"/>
As Aharons ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes adding to theyr office vvere kild for ſtrange fyre: ſo D. Bilſon for his dreame, that our Lord vvent not to God till the body vvas buried, (by all Greekes to Cateltheineis Hadou is to goe hence to God, for 3000. yeres vſe) ſhould think that he muſt goe into a fyre vvhich he hath kindled. Theſe vvordes tell the ſame that S. Paul afore told. For aboliſhing of ſin by ſacrificing of himſelf he appeared before God. All ſage knovv that from the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy immediatly vpon theſe vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the ſoule vvas to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: and to reſt in that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I think neuer any that toke Hades in the Creede for the place that receaved our Lords ſoule, tooke it for anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then that vvhich receaued it

This alſo might break the hart of D. Bilſon, yf he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the only reverend father, the Lord, the great, and the fearfull: Eb. 10. By Gods vvill vve are ſanctified: vvhich ſtay vpon the offring of the body of Ieſus Chriſt, once for all. And again: cap. 10.

Secondly, he fleeth to his adverſary and carieth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to him from God, from K. E. and from Qu. E. and from K. I. and from the right honorable the B. of. W. that is from his ovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſoule and from all the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx of theyr army. After this, to make ſtationers beleve he had not betrayd Cant: and London: he rageth againſt him ſelf: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and the Princes and theyr faithfull, pretending to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge only againſt one of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort: hoping fooles vvould not

Though the King ſee him not, he that hath his eyes like a flame of fyer vvill teach him as Alexand. the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſmith, not to blaſpheme.</p>
            <p>Then he betrayeth alſo all that euer ſpake Greeke: that our Lord ſhould goe from Paradiſe to Hades. So all Diuines of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery vving, Gentils and Ievves vvill marveyl at going from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe to Gehenna. So he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth all Philoſophers, vvho thought all ſoules vvent preſent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly hence to Hades, to God: to a ſtate vnchangeable. Plat.

vvaking fablers, that a ſoule ſhould not goe to Hades till the body vvas buryed: that all men ſhould preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly bury their dead.
