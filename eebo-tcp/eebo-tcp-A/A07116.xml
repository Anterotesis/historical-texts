            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which said booke, was written by a learned man of that tyme, who shortly after dyed, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, yf God had lent hym longer lyfe, to haue confuted more of the sandye groundes &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the sayde Ciuilian. And thynkyng it at these dayes not vnprofitable to be read for this controuersie, I committed it to the Printer, praying thee (good reader) to beare with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the wrytyng in some partes therof, beyng more meryly penned, then some graue wryter would peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture alowe of. In which fourme of wrytyng, somewhat he foloweth, as he sayth hym selfe, thexample of Sir Thomas Moore knyght, in his booke of Dialogues for purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This wryter, abstaynyng yet from vnchaste tales, such as be in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:12645:4"/>
with, &amp; yet vsyng fewer insultations &amp; reprofes, then the vnworthinesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said Ciuilian, by his vnreasonable chalenge myght haue moued him to. Now, because I wold nether adde to another mans writing, neither diminishe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, I haue prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto thee (good reader) the whole booke as it is: affirmyng this, that thou shalt finde all his allegations truely aduouched by the writers that he doth name, assuring thee also (persuaded by the nature of the man, whom I haue hearde wel reported) that no malice or corrupt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moued hym to write as he doth, but pure zeale to the trueth of Gods most holy worde: to their instruction who woulde be taught in this trueth: to the amendement of his aduersarie in his manifest vntruethes: to the comfort of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who loue God and his veritie: and to admonishe all such, as be eyther wylfully ignoraunt or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, well to expende this cause, whiche is of God and of his Gospell: and also depely to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with what plagues almightie God reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged the contempt of his holy institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foresaid raigne, to much apparaunt, &amp; in to much freshe remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be denied. The discourse wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it were worthy, yf any indifferent learned man should take in hand to set out in storie, with the circumstaunces thereof, it woulde ryse to a houge volume, to the wonder of the godly &amp; wise heades of other countreys, to see what we felt in these dayes here in the Realme: but it is not like that the notabilitie therof wylbe forgotten to be transmitted to our posteritie hereafter in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng. Surely, the briefe remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of things
<pb facs="tcp:12645:5"/>
chaunced, may appeare lamentable to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: as what immoderate raynes &amp; tempestes raged in one yere, what intollerable heate and drowghtes in another yere, what penurie &amp; scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of corne and vittaile, what hunger &amp; famine therof folowed, what sickenesse, what agues, what strange mortalities reigned &amp; raged, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the eldest and grauest personages of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and conditions, were in great numbers wasted and consumed, what misfortunes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fell to women with chylde in their dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, what fyers chaunced, farre aboue the wont of other yeres of princes raignes, in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wastyng whole vyllages, townes, and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Agayne, what crueltie was seene executed by fyeryng olde men and women, young men, &amp; maydes, without choyse, whether the women were with chylde, or free from chyldren. What proscriptions and banishmentes of learned men out of the Realme, and suche as taryed within the Realme, howe they were dryuen to corners, spoyled, and impoueryshed, and such as could be gotten, shamed openly by vyle penancies and shameful recantations. And furthermore, what rapes and vyllanyes committed, aboue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practised disorder, by straungers and forey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, what impunities wonne and purchased to the vnchaste generation, to recourse agayne to their olde trade of lewde lyuyng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after they had confounded the priestes chast matrimonies, so stablyshed and aucthorised by the hygh lawes of the Realme. Then at the last, what dishonor and losse the Realme suffered, by losyng that

notable borderer Calyce, aforetymes so vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntly wonne and gotten by king Edwarde the thirde, and to these vnfortunate dayes (of resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng the great aduersarie of all christian Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes the Pope of Rome agayne) politiquely and chargeably maynteyned and defended in good &amp; sure possession, to the comforte of the whole Realme, to the terrour of all our forayne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I say, to consider all these particularities as they myght deserue, to be set out at lengthe, what Englishe heart coulde forbeare teares, and not inwardlye sygh and lament the miserie? Which heauy infelicities, the Englyshe chyldren yet vnborne shall wepe at, and wayle, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same. If these be not seuere tokens and proffes of Gods heauie displeasure toward Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, for so vylely despising his worde, his light, his religion, his sacramentes, his institutions: what can be shewes of his wrath and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If open contempt of true matrimonie were not throughly punyshed and plagued in some certayne maryages, whiche then were so glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously begun, so gorgiously set out and aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, so greatly reioyced at, and such wonderfull fruite certaynely loked for: and in conclusion howe it succeded, how it ended, what it brought foorth: Here I ceasse, and leaue it vntouched. But let God be honoured, who hath all power in his hande. Let his worde and religion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced, who is in a gelousie thereof. Let his institutions be regarded, the contempt whereof he wyll surely plague in them all, whatsoeuer they be, which despyse them, as all ages and
<pb facs="tcp:12645:6"/>
tymes, all landes &amp; dominions, haue euer felt, and shall feele the same, from the first destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sodome and Gomorrha, vntyll the laste day of Gods feareful iudgement, when the sonne of man shall sende his Angels to gather out of his kyngdome all slaunders and offendicles: and those which commit iniquitie, he shall sende into the hotte burnyng fyre, there shalbe waylyng and gnashyng of teeth: where the ryghteous shall then shyne as the sunne, in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their father.</p>

And for that commonly thei supposed preachyng, to be but vaine labour spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and daungerous to haue the people wise in knowledge, and thought that muche preachyng broughte in but heresie, where ignoraunce was the mother of obedience, and quiete behauiour of the people to their Lawes.

            <p>And in this poincte also Martine is not a litle to be blamed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that he doeth not onely belie S. <hi>Hierom,</hi>

make a sence of this place. But note his impudencie in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> translation out of the laten into the englishe, he putteth in these wordes (against the Sacrament of matrimony) whiche is not in the latin, myndyng, as it seemeth, by a sleight for want of other proofe, to perswade the vnlearned reader, by this peece of sainct <hi>Hierom,</hi> that mariage is a Sacrament.

the firste as Martine fasly reporteth) was aboue 300. yeare after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this dissention began, whiche Martine for the mayntenaunce of his lyes saieth, began in his tyme. If I shoulde bring in the firste caunsaile holden at <hi>Constantinople</hi> against <hi>Eunomius</hi> for deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of the procession of the holy Ghost from the Father and the Sonne, what can Martine saie? Againste this <hi>Eunomius, Basil</hi> and other haue written plentifullie. Thus ye see concerning the beginnyng of this heresie againste the holy Ghoste, Martine is founde a falsifier of histories, not onely by the supputation of ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, but also by the verie testimony of the Pope hymself his God. Now concernyng the cause of the disention betwene the Grekes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and the Latines wherwith Martin charged the Emperour <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaell Paleologus</hi>: The learned man cardinall <hi>Bessarion Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arche</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and Archbushoppe of <hi>Nicea,</hi> writeth a whole Chapiter for declaration of the cause of this schisme and dissention, shewyng that the Bushoppe of Rome was the causer thereof, for that he, <hi>Suà vnius authoritate fretus, aduocata syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do generali particulam illam communi symbolo fidei, non cum communi ascensu, ascripsit.</hi> that is, when he had called a generall counsaile, he tooke vpon hym of his owne priuate aucthority, to adde this parcell (of the proceadyng of the holy Ghoste from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> father and the sonne) to the common créede, without the consent of the rest of the other Bushoppes there assembled.<note place="margin">The Pope was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of the dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwene the greke and the latine Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Martine.</note> Behold good reader, a plaine profe, that it was the rashe and temerouse bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Busshoppe of Rome that caused this dissention, who of his owne aucthoritie would doe that tumultuously, whiche he might haue doen with others consente quietly, and that was it, which caused first all that dissention that ensued, &amp; also the latter ruine, mischief, distructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Turkishe captiuitie, which Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin saieth, is this daie lighted vpon the churche of God in <hi>Grecia.</hi> But Martin will saie, the thyng that he did was good. Yea, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the maner of the doyng was suche, as I thinke Martine, if he throughly knowe it, as he would seme to doe, hym self (for al his follie) will not yet defende it. And the inconueniencies that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Popes braules and beastly audacitie, declare that the meanes whiche he vsed in compassyng his doynges, were wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12645:46"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and deuilishe. So that wheras Martin imputeth the breach and contention, betwene the Greke and the Latine churche, and the ouerthrowe, bothe of the Grecians Churche and kyngdome, to the lecherous life of the vncle to the Emperour <hi>Michael Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leologus</hi>: it is proued, that the Pope the aucthour of all mischief in the Churche of God, was the onely matche that kindeled this fire. A worthie matter doubtlesse, to depriue the Pope for euer after, from bearyng any rule, though there were nothyng els, wherwith to charge hym. And thus is Martin once again ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen with his owne reason,<note place="margin">Two lies of Martines at a cast.</note> and taken with a double lye, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for the alledgyng of the heresie againste the holie ghoste, to begin so lately, whiche began so many hundred yeres before: As for aduouchyng the dissention, whiche rose betwene the Easte and the Weste Churche, to procede first of lecherie and ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as he termeth it in his note in the margente) of the Emperour <hi>Michael Paleologus</hi> and his vncle, whiche proceded firste (as ye sée by the testimonie of <hi>Bessarion</hi>) from Gods greate enemie the Pope, the Archeheretique in Christendome.</p>
            <p>Now to make aunswere to that fewe lines, whiche remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in Martines first Chapiter, I neede not to take farther pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> because thei be nothyng els but lies and railynges, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon false groundes, as I haue before declared, onely to this ende, that Henry the eight the Queenes father, might appere to the worlde bothe a Lechour, an Heretique, and a man full of all other wickednesse, out of whose naughtie life, Martine would haue all the preachyng in kyng Edwardes daies, whiche he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth heresie, to haue his first originall.</p>
            <p>And the procedynges of the late Parliament, in the seconde yere of the Queenes reigne, wherein all her fathers doynges in religion be condemned, seme to confirme the same. So that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Quéenes Father (if he had been suche a man as the Papistes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte hym) were nowe condempned with vs. Wherefore it is to be thought, seyng that almighty God hath permitted, some of vs to suffer Martirdome by fire, by bloodie persecution, and the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of the Popes Lawe, and tormentes for professyng the truthe of Gods woorde: that now the bodie of that noble Prince
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12645:47"/>
the Quéenes Father (because he was the beginner of all this, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Martine reporteth, and the continuer of it .xxv. yeres, as the procedynges of the Parliamente seme to pronounce) shalbee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp at Windsore, and burned as Wicklifes was. All men of wisedome and discretion maie iudge of thee (if thou were not as thou shewest thy self, a shamelesse railer, voide of all regarde, against whom thy tongue talketh) that it had been thy parte, to haue couered the faulte of the Queenes Father, if thou haddest any faulte wherewith to charge hym, leste the worlde perceiue some vnnaturalnesse in her, so to suffer her noble Father nowe beyng dead, to bee railed vpon, by one who shewed hym selfe a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> traitour to hym, when he was a liue. All the worlde right well knoweth, that there is no sparke neither of Gods spirite, neither of good nature in those children, whiche are not greued to heare their deade parentes euill reported, and their faultes reuealed. Suche is the reuerence due to them that bee dead, vnto whom we ought obedience in the time of their life. And what good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion maie any man euer hereafter conceiue of suche a Papiste, and of a great rable of the rest, who glory in nothyng more now, then that thei haue been rancke traitours these many yeres? And what thyng shall haue the name of vice, where treason is made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a vertue? Or what iustice can be ministered, where a traitour is the Iudge? Who knoweth not, in a Counsaile, where there bee but twelue, what a perilous thyng it was to haue one Iudas, though none of the reste loued hym? How muche more is it then perilous, where all the reste allowe his counsailes and doynges, and make as it were of an olde Iudas, a newe Christe. Here had I a greate fielde to walke in, describyng these dissemblers with princes, and with suche realmes where thei beare rule, but wee will ceasse, to vtter their deseruynges, and returne again to that matter, whiche doeth more properly appertaine to the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of our writyng, and therefore will resume that was begonne in the .32. leafe B. continued vnto .35. B. before, sm, that the Apostles had their wiues, as all writers aunciente confesse the same, and all reasonable men will agree thereto.</p>
            <p>Now if it can be borne of mennes eares, to heare that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12645:47"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> had wiues: why should this aucthor by his tragical exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerations make it so odious for Bushoppes and Priestes (the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles successors) to haue their lawfull wiues? I thincke he will not saie that the beste of his chaste Priestes, be better then the Apostles.</p>
            <p>Againe, to consider what <hi>Paphnutius</hi> saied and counsailed for the priestes of his tyme: not to be seperated, and that it is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie to company with their wiues, and that to seperate them, might be an occasion of great inconueniencie in them bothe. If in that holy tyme, whan God was truely honored, his worde and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Sacramentes moste holyly ministred, Priesthode was then in greate high estimation, and that in maried priestes and bushops, as by name shall be hereafter expressed: why doeth this aucthour so stifly crie for seperation in Priestes married, nowe sequestred by power, and not by right, from ministration, wher thei of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene,</hi> were suffered with them in ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? If like perill may bee feared in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parties now coupled together, why should thei be seperated more then the other? If their Sacramentes were none other, nor holier then oures, their worde none other then that we haue: why maie not oure order stand with mariage, as well as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thers? If lyke necessitie of Ministers in this realme, be as great as hath been in other places where maried Priestes did minister, and yet doeth in some places of the Occidentall Churche: Why shoulde this wryter exclame so vnlearnedly againste Englishe Priestes mariage, as though it were not decent, nor tollerable, but against Goddes lawe, and mannes law, liyng against them bothe, and saiyng: that order and Matrimonie: that a wife and a benefice, can not stand together. And in the bolsteryng out of this matter, is almoste all his booke emploied: againste antiquitie: against the practise of the primatiue Churche: against the worde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of God wrytten: againste the practise of tolerations in the lyke case of diuerse counsailes, and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rees of the Busshops of Rome, as shall be proued, when it cometh to place.</p>
            <p>I truste this Ciuilian is not yet so addicte to the Canonicall procedynges, that the matter lieth onely in this poincte, that if the Bushop of Rome allowed the matter, all were well: for me
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12645:48"/>
thinke so he can not meane. For if his assertions be true, he must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> proue the Bushoppes of Rome, diuerse of them, to be very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techristes, if thei haue dispensed against Goddes expresse woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: yea, he must condempne a great many of Canonistes, and of scholemen, and a greate many of Catholike writers, traueilyng in controuersies of this tyme, whiche peraduenture hath read as muche in Diuinitie and Canon lawe, as I thinke this Ciuilian hath doen in his Ciuill, whiche bee of cleane contrary assertion to this singular man.</p>
            <p>But yet I heare this writer obiecte againe, suche an obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as was once made by a Canonist, in the expending of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> poincte: <hi>Distingue tempora</hi> (saieth he) <hi>&amp; personas, &amp; concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabis leges &amp; Canones.</hi> Weye the difference of tyme and of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones, and so shall ye make the lawes and Canons agrée. Then was then, and now is now. For the case, saieth he, is farre vnlike betwixte the priestes of the Greke Churche, whiche were maried before thei were priestes, and the priestes of our Churche &amp; time, whiche he maried after their order. And this he thinketh to be an high wittie inuention, and insoluble: and by this shifte, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the victorie of the cause, before any stroke bee striken, standyng stoutely in the difference of the tyme, mariage to goe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> before order, or to come after.</p>
            <p>To answere: if it be true, as he can not deny, but that it was not lawfull by their saiynges of the Counsaile of <hi>Nice</hi> to bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, by Lawes and constrainte: and that it was chastitie for the busshoppes and priestes, to kepe company still with their wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: yea, when thei were ministeryng busshoppes and priestes, in an other maner attendaunce and holinesse, then the best chast busshoppes and priestes of our tyme practise in their doynges: so that by their iudgement, the one state dishonored not thother, nor was impediment to the other, as hereafter shalbe proued by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> testimonie of their owne Canonistes and Doctors: what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there in the substaunce of the order, in them of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or Greke churche, and in the priestes of this Latine churche, and Occidentall churche, but that order and matrimonie, maie stand together in one figure, in them bothe? As for vowe, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12645:48"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> shall bee hereafter considered: open protestation, or no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation: chastitie of congruitie dependyng or included by the nature of order, or for the Churche constitution, shall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter answered and expended.</p>
            <p>Now I saie, if the priestes of the Greke Churche, liued godly in ministration with their wiues, why maie not the priestes of the Occidentall churche, be iudged to liue as godly in Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and as lawfully to in Englande, hauyng the highest Lawe in the realme on their side? But here this doctor will be offended to haue any thing brought in, for declaration of this cause out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Grece, and maketh a greate matter that men should so doe, and repelleth al their doing thus: what is that, saith he, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, are not we of an other territorie and iurisdiction? If I should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere you so, master doctor, with your owne obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then might it bee a full sufficient answere by it self a lone, to all your whole booke, to saie when ye bryng Romishe Canons out of Spaine, out of Fraunce, out of Grece: I might so answere you, what bee all these to the matter, are not we of an other territorie and iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction? When ye alledge from Prouinciall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutions, Sino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des; nationall lawes of Emperours, Ciuile and Panim lawes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> what are all these to the matter of our Imperiall lawes, are not we of an other territorie and iurisdiction? And thus your booke is fully answered, and ye may now put vp your pipes, with al your choristers of forren Lawes and Canons. Moreouer, in the seuen Chapiter ye also saie, that it bewraieth the weakenesse of the cause, for priestes to wander into Grece, to bryng in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of liuyng of mariyng, &amp; orderyng. If that declareth the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenesse of the cause, I praie you then, what is the strength of the cause ye haue taken in hande? For ye be not content to raile and wander ouer all the Realmes, and Churches of <hi>Europe</hi>: but ye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> runne into <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> and bryng in Panim priestes to set out the matter. There is nothyng in your booke, written or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, deuised by your owne braine, or surmised by heare saie, but ye make strong argumentes, for your owne vaine and feble cause. But briefly to answere this wittie deuise, of the difference of the tyme, till a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

answere, as once sainct <hi>Hierom</hi> was answered, in a matter of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Priestes and Bisshoppes wiuyng and orderyng, by a certaine disputer, who defended the constitution of the churche, as it was then, and as it is at this daie, where S. <hi>Hierome</hi> is on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part, holdyng that to haue one wife before Baptisme, and a seconde wife after, was not therefore an impedimente to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priesthode,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epistola ad Oceanum.</hi>
               </note> or to a Busshoppes office. <hi>Nonne legisti ab Apostolo, vnius vxoris virum, assumi in sacerdotium, &amp; rem, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tempora definiri?</hi> that ts. Doest thou not reade (saieth he) that by the Apostles aucthoritie, the husbande of one wife, is to bee chosen into Priesthode, and that the cause and matter is thereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> defined, and not the tyme? If this catholike disputer would haue the saiyng of S. Paule to bee weighed, in the nature of the order and mariage, rather then drawen to the circumstaunce of tyme, and that he must bée the husbande but of one wife, either before or after Baptisme, at the tyme of his orderyng, and therefore maie be eligible to be a priest or bushoppe: And as sainct <hi>Hierom</hi> hym self writeth afterward, that it is rather loked for in a priest or Busshop, what he is for the tyme presente, then what he hath been: why not as well maie sainct Paules text and aucthoritie, serue for a prieste and a busshoppe, to be lawfully qualefied, if he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be the husbande but of one wife, whether he had his wife in the tyme he was no prieste, or he take a wife in the tyme after he bée in his priesthode? So he be as it is said, the husbande of one wife, yea, successiuely. Wherewith ye maie quarell by aucthoritie of some expositours, though not with the manifest woorde of God. But to be the husbande onely of one wife before order, and after order, once for all, as ye saie the Greeke Churche vseth to doe, ye can not quarell rightly by Goddes worde, nor yet by reasonable aucthoritie of mannes Lawe, or Canon, in suche necessitie, as ye force and inferre of their saiynges.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>As for the other peece of <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon where it is saied: that accordyng to thauncient tradition of the Churche, suche as were not as yet maried, and were partakers of holy order, should from thence for the contracte no mariage: And as for the Canon of the Apostles, whiche ye stande so strongly to, or yet for the saiyng of

            <p>And I maruell muche, what this writer meaneth, beyng an Englishe man, and offereth his seruice so ready to the Queenes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> maiestis, that can enuie the crowne of Englande, of that prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, that is by Goddes woorde incident therevnto, beyng so ofte proued and confessed, yea, and sworne vnto, by the whole Realme, and so muche stablished by the learned assertions, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, orations, and other writynges of the aunciente Fathers, and moste catholike men, that be at this daie knowen, and had in reuerence and aucthoritie, for their greate wittes, learnyng, and grauitie of life, by the space of twentie yeres perpetually incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, whiche now to call againe into question, maie enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a good mannes conscience in the Realme, who were moste <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> chiefly induced by them, bothe to swere, yea, and to ieoperd their soules therein, and many be departed in the same belief already.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, I would wishe this professour of Ciuill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, or at the least the (gentle reader) to note, with what charitée he could so slaunder his owne countrie men, the Queenes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to her grace, in his Preface, with so odious accusations of inceste, heresie, coueteousnesse: and because he would leaue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng behinde, to promote them to the Queenes graces crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, with treason also and malice to her grace, and that without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any one man, entred into the said state of mariage: who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as thei bee many, so had thei diuerse respectes in their doynges, and haue at this daie diuerse cogitations in their hartes.

In deede I must confesse, that here the Catholikes (so taken) hath the better hand of the heretiques, so named.

            <p>The Apostle geueth a precepte, that we should alwaie praie,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12645:60"/>
if praier must alwaie bee had, ergo, wedlocke is not to bee vsed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for so ofte as I render due beneuolence to my wife, I can not praie. Also I iudge, that thende of mariage is death, but the fruit of continencie is eternall life. Also, Wedlocke for it self is not good, and is compared to a fire. Againe, thei that be in the fleshe can not please GOD. Also, there is no daunger that Marriage should bee lefte, though wee exhorte many to continencie. For of fooles the number shall be euer infinite. Also comparyng Ihon a virgine, and Peter a maried manne, he saieth: whereby is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that virginitée shall neuer dye: but as for the filthinesse of mariage, can not bee wasshed awaie with the blood of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Also writyng against <hi>Heluidius,</hi> thus he pronounceth: we doe not deny, saieth he, but that it is possible to finde maried wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, holy women, but suche (saieth he) whiche ceasse to be wiues. Of whiche place, <hi>Erasmus</hi> could gather no other, but that he should meane, that mariage is not to be alowed, no not for frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes sake. And suche other saiynges innumerable hath S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> whom this manne reporteth with suche aucthoritie. But in the next parte of this treatise, all suche causes shall bée more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expended, to see whether the fained Catholiques of these da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, bee not farre fallen from the true Catholiques, of fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> yeres next after Christ: and be not relapsed into the plaine heresies of the <hi>Tatianes, Manichees,</hi> and suche other: how soeuer thei couer theim selues close, as thei imagine. <hi>Sed omnia dum produntur in lucem, manifesta fient.</hi> But all thynges when thei are shewed at the light, be made manifest.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I woulde wishe to haue some considerations more, to be waied of this gentle and courteous Ciuilian, how he coulde be so rigorous and extreme, without any moderation, or indifferent equitie, so sore to charge Bushops and Priestes for mariyng in this realme: with suche ineuitable necessitie, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with so vndispensable a bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, to conteine vnder paine of eternall dampnation. And further, so highly to magnifie this late doyng against them: that thei bee gently depriued of all their whole li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynges: and that, not for fiue, or tenne yeres, as the equitie of some Canons prescribeth, but for euer. And to saie that thei bee
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12645:60"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> driuen fauourably out of their ministrations. Specially where he maie reade what indifferencie and tolleration is graunted in some counsailes and decrées: yea, in other christian realmes and dominions: and standyng the assertion of so many learned Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and Canonistes, &amp; of the old auncient writers in the church, I saie, that he could so passe awaie in his readyng and collectyng: all their moderations: and onely waie, the most extreme rigoure he coulde finde in any of them all, against the saied mariage of Priestes here in Englande, so maried by lawe, as thei be.</p>
            <p>Where, he readeth, I am sure, how tenderly and fauorably <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his Canonistes expounde and glose the hard lawes and canons that be written against Priestes, liuyng in open aduoutrie, and manifest fornication: And yet could not sprinkle some droppes of suche holy water, to ease the heate of the hoote zeales and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes of some certen of the Clergie, whiche for pure honesties sake, in respect of their faint liues, dare not once touche any of the poluted benefices, and promotions, that the vncleane maried Priestes haue so longe defiled with their wiues, vnworthie as thei be, once to be saied, <hi>aue,</hi> vnto in salutation. And furthermore moste vnworthie reputed to come to their Tables, to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for disteinyng their holinesse and angelicall vowes of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie: but must nedes blowe so fast these fiery coales, not onely to enflame the stomakes, of some of the saied Clergie that be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die incensed beyond witte, honestie, and learning, against them: but also to moue the Nobilitie, to incense the Comons rather to repute them for worse then Heathen or Turkes, if his entend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente should haue like successe to proceade, as his stomacke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth.</p>
            <p>I am suer he cannot be ignoraunt of the soft gloses, that the Canonistes make for the excusyng of fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and adulteries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in Priestes without wiues.<note place="margin">

Whiche wholsome doctrine a man maie some tyme heare, not onely of meane learned men, but of some of the hiest learnyng, that holdeth so. Which secret mischief me thinke this man Marten should haue in his head, by the maner of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng.

               <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> and long occupied in the Schooles: yet at the worste he breaketh no vowe, nor is any heretique, as the Prieste that taketh a wife.

I truste though this Ciuilian affirmeth plainely, that all the slepyng Canons of the Churche, bee awake againe, to bite the married priestes, by the Queenes graces statute of repeale: yet he would not wishe suche slepyng saiynges of Doctors, to be raised vp, to barke so odiously as the wordes pretendeth.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12645:73"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and also to signifie, that there maie be no coueryng betwixt God and them: but that the prieste maie see the glory of his maiesties open face. For a clarke saieth he, maie not be ignoraunt of gods secretes, as the Laye man maie bee: for he is a messenger to the Laye people, and therefore this superfluous heere must bee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced awaie, euen to the sight of his eyes and eares, that no world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesse, nor yearthly ambition hinder hym from hearyng and vnderstandyng Goddes woorde. These be all the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that bee in the pontificall: and if ye tourne ouer bothe the gloses and the textes in the decrees, where priestes crownes bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> intreated of, ye shall finde no suche signification, as he reporteth here to be a strong argument, to proue Englishe priestes vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. As for other writers what thei be. I can not tell, and sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng emong many, I can not finde that signification. Yet after that, I went to other kynd of writers in suche matters, and came to one <hi>Petrus Bercharius,</hi> who wrote a greate Dictionarie of woordes in diuinitie, and there he writeth thus of crownes, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng: <hi>Quod corona praelatorum est dignitas Ecclesiastica: vel etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quorumlibet iuste praesidentium &amp; magnorum. Isti enim ad lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram portant coronas, que sunt signa dignitatis &amp; excellentiae <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> status sui: quod etiam ipsa natura videtur facere, quia Basiliscus qui est rex serpentum, dicitur esse quodam circulo candido coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus. &amp;c.</hi> The crowne of prelates, and all other that beare rule and be greate men, is their Ecclesiasticall dignitie. For these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the letter doe weare crownes, whiche are hadges and tokens of the dignitée and excellencie of their estate. The whiche thing, Nature also her self semes to shewe: for as the Basiliske, whiche is king of serpentes, is said to haue a crowne of a certaine round white circle. &amp;c. But of that signification of vowes, he speaketh not a woorde. And furthermore, where Doctour Martine in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> same place of his Booke, telleth you that the Heretiques in Spaine, abhorred to weare crownes, and to go in priestes gow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: If ye will knowe the trueth of this matter, ye muste either stande to his credence, that he can not lye, and that all is aucthoritie that he speaketh: Or els, if ye be more froward, and will not bee aunswered: then ye maie goe into Spaine and looke

            <p>But yet here is a prudence.

And for this cause, saie the expositors, was it so commaunded, to the detestation of their Idolatrie, and that Goddes Priestes should bee vnlike to them. And for this cause also (writeth some Interpretatours) did not the <hi>Nazareans</hi> shaue their heades in the tyme of their consecration. And that the pagane Priestes, did vse that rite,<note place="margin">

constantly, in reuengyng Goddes enemies. But peraduenture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Martine ment of those <hi>Nazareans</hi> of whom sainct <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh:<note place="margin">

Whose disciples yet to be, peraduenture would not muche mislike those crowned Priestes, forasmuche as that smalie Iewishe faulte maie bee seen in their holy father, of whom thei beare that marke. For Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seconde, beyng asked of <hi>Boniface</hi> thapostle of the <hi>Germans,</hi> whether thei might eate Horses, yea, or naie: He aunswered, that it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to a christen man, to eate any horse, either tame or wild,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for it was vncleane and accursed. And the same <hi>Boniface</hi> asking of Pope Zacarie, what foules and beastes thei should eate, and after what time Lard should be eaten: To the first he answered, that Pies, Choughes, and Storkes, ought vtterly to be eschued, of christen men, but muche more Graies, Hares, &amp; Horses, of the wood, must be refused. And further, se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth hym in these doubtes to the scripture emong the Iewes constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. As for the Lard, he writeth to hym, although he haue no scripture for it, yet he doeth aduise him, that it be not eaten, before it be either dried by the smoke, or sodain by fier. And if he leste to eate it rawe, it must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be doen after Easter. Now, whether S. <hi>Augustine</hi> maie meane of suche constitutions, let M. Martine expende. But to returne, it maie chaunce that this Ciuilian, to aduouche his other saiyng, will outface the matter, with the Spanishe stories or counsailes in Spaine, to proue the maried Priestes in England, to bee like the Apostatas and Heretikes in Spaine. And then ye knowe, he hath soore charged theim with an hainous name, beside the note of dissolute contempt, of good and auncient orders in the church, and saie: that of verie like crafte and subtiltie belike, thei put awaie their crownes, as other Heretikes and Scismatiques, put <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> forthe laye mennes bokes out of churches, by whiche thei might haue read many a good Catholike lesson, if thei had remained still. And euen so might the Laye people, by beholdyng the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes shauen crownes, haue had a faire letter thereof, to haue red there, that thei had vowed chastitee. For what els, might thei say
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12645:75"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> doeth that faire wéekely shorne marke, and circle declare, so well looked vpon, that at euery sacryng of the Masse, it is as sone, and as well espied, as the Sacramente, the whiche some poore simple purblynde people, doe some tyme mistake the one for the other, and in stede of their wheate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, worship a baulde crowne. And if it were not a signe of the holy vowe of their chastitée, ye maie bee sure, that that holy Pope <hi>Anicetus</hi> .xiij. yea, full .xiiij. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yere agoe, so nye Christes tyme, that he was the tenth, as sainct <hi>Hierome</hi> recordeth, or the eleuenth Bushoppe of Rome at the furthest, in succession to Peter: He I saie, would neuer haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ordained, that a clarke should in no case suffer his héere to grow, contrary to the precept of the Apostle (as <hi>Platina</hi> writeth) and so to haue a crowne fashioned like a little circle, as <hi>Petrus de Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talibus</hi> writeth, and <hi>Cronica Martini</hi> aduoucheth the same: If there had been no misterie in the matter. The priestes of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Churche, would not so ofte in their Masses, haue crossed it and blessed it, with the self same parte of the paten of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, where with a little before, thei had touched the Masse cake, whiche thei call the bodie of Christe: If it were not an holier to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, then master <hi>Polidore</hi> maketh of it, to bee but a signe of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> paryng awaie of the affection of worldely possessions, and that their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s should be set on high vp to heauenward. And thus ye see, maie this Catholike Ciuilian saie, how craftely the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes meant to blotte out suche letters of credence, whiche were signes of their vowe of Chaslitée: and so remoued the olde mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and dooles, whiche the fathers before them did laye: whiche full many an holy man hath vsed, tyme out of minde, in al ages, and in all countries, euen from <hi>Anicetus</hi> daies, who died a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious martyre, and not like to dye for trifles. Good reader, if I should make no answere, to this weightie conference, but stande <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mute: or if I should stily slide, and steale awaie with a by matter, with a craftie figure, <hi>called lieger du Mayne,</hi> this aucthoure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng so well skilled in this trope and figure: I should bee espied.

And againe, it is as vntrue, that the Englishe crowned priestes, be like the Catholike priestes, that of olde tyme were in Spain. For what storie or Chronicle he followeth, I call not tell, nor it forceth not muche, though I neuer knewe.

            <p>Now reade the woordes of this Ciuilian, and compare his truthe, and remember againe his owne Lawe: <hi>Qui semel malus,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> semper praesumitur malus, in eodem genere mali</hi>: He that once is euill, is supposed euer to be naught, in that kinde of naughtines.

For this Spanishe Counsaile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, by the instincte of the holy Ghost, whiche was president in the Counsaile, and therfore could not erre, that it is the marke of shame and dishonour: it is the token of Spanishe heretikes, it is a slaunderous signe, to bee abolished out of the Churche: it is the rite of suche Priestes as bee guiltie of the Catholike faithe.

            <p>

            <p>In deede to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse a trueth: When I had considered the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impudent countenaunce of his preface, the swingyng taile of his lamentable conclusion, the mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous bodie betwixt bothe: and then againe, meruelyng where and how he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so muche matter, and pregnauncie of witte, farre aboue that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which I loked would haue been in hym by this daie, by the gesse of the talke that I had last with him: &amp; consideryng that he doeth somwhat more then scoffe or boorde, in diuerse partes of his boke, as if I should so beastly scoffe with the serious &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t articles of our faith, drawyng them to such an obscéen and filthie sense, as he doth raile in his .ix.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or <hi>Iulianus,</hi> he might well doe it. And then consideryng hym to bee a yonge man and a Ciuilian: I could not refraine my penne, but thus sportyngly, to bee a Comentar of his booke.</p>
            <p>And yet sir, to alledge a Poetes aucthoritie, to a Ciuilian, whose worde hath yet no greate aucthoritie: <hi>Ridentèm dicere verum quis vetat? &amp; hae nugae seria ducunt.</hi> A wiser man then we bothe be, maie some tyme ride on a long réede, &amp; yet keepe graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tée of countenaunce, when he cometh where grauitée should bee shewed: as some haue doen here in Englande before now, in as serious matters as these bee, by open writinges, wherewith I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dare sweare, not all of the Clergie hath been muche offended he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. And if ye will learne how tollerable it is in writyng, ye maie resort to sir Thomas Moores first Chapiter of his Dialogue of ꝙ I, and ꝙ he, and he will proue it vnto you. I am sure, your selfe, as hye as ye now caste vp your head, will come lower some tyme, when ye be pleased, and that ye repent ye not of your own merie scoffyng, in many partes of your booke, whiche bee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme not merie bourdes, but sharpe checkes, and daungerous tauntes to. Uerely M.

Semper ego auditor tantum, nunquam ne reponam. &amp;c?</hi> Whiche drewe my penne, whether I would or no (as before this daie, it neuer was occupied for any printed ware) to bungle with you.</p>
            <p>But yet for the truthe of all that I saie: if ye finde any thyng misreported, and not truly aduouchyng myne aucthorities: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to tell it in your nexte booke, as sharpely as ye can. And if ye will beare with me, for my mirthe nowe, as I beare with yours, whiche I do interprete, that ye vsed it to solace your self, &amp; to holde the reader of your booke from wearinesse, to medle some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> softer musike, emong the dint and dinne of your terrible greate Canons, shotyng nothyng but haile shotte, all the tyme of your stoute debellation of this your wonne fortresse, where in no man was to resiste you: and that is a valiaunt conquest, who can saie nay: I will so rule my penne in my next booke (if almightie God

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> will so haue it) that ye shall, I truste, perceiue your self grauely answered. And not so muche you, but all others graue writers, and deuines in déede by profession, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in parte, you stole your booke: that this matter shall not so obscurely be strangeled vp, but that it shall shewe bothe life and light.</p>
            <p>And yet (good reader) I desire thee, impute not this to any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie, as though I would aduaunce my self so high, of myne owne poore readyng and vnderstandyng: but the graue and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Catholike writers, in the first beginnyng of the churche, shall be my warrant, not as aucthours and iudgers of the scriptures: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but as good faithfull witnesses, in their confessions of the same. So that, I trust, the harmony shall not mislike indifferent men, though I hit not all my purpose. But now againe, further to shewe your dexteritee (master Martin) in aduouching your alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations: ye tel vs very pretely, how in the Librarie of Magdalen College at Oxforde, there is an olde booke written of <hi>Ignatius</hi>: wherein is not expressed, that Paule is named for a maried ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to haue had a wife, although the Heretikes of Germanie haue corrupted hym in the printed copies, ꝙ you.</p>
            <p>If ye be asked who tolde you so? we maie knowe, that master <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> doctor Smithe in his wise booke, written against Priestes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, hath reported so, and many good studentes and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full menne, that hath been felowes in that College, can tell (saie ye) that thei haue had a written copie of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>

And therefore searche no further, neither spende any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to trye hym, but simply trust all that he telleth thee. Is not this a proper allegation thinke ye, and well handled? But yet ye must beleue, that ye see not with your eyes: for <hi>Beati qui non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt &amp; crediderunt</hi>: blessed are thei that haue beleued, though thei neuer sawe it.

He maketh marueilous demonstrations on his fingers, or with his counters, that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be auoided. For ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, saith he, that there be of suche maried persons in the realme twelue thousande, or sixtene thousande. Note firste the witte of this accomptor. If he had firste begon with sixtene, and then if it had been thought somewhat to muche, to haue been contente to come doune to twelue thousande, and vpon that to haue procea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then had it been customable: but then had it not been halfe so subtill and wittie a poincte in suche acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptyng. For ye knowe, euery foole in the gesse of twoo nombers, vseth for concessions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sake, to take the lesse, and so goeth on. Againe, note that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compter leapeth with one iumpe, from twelue, straight waie to xvi. For iii. or iiii. M. ye knowe, is but a small no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to put out or in, in xii. or xvi, as afterwarde in the conclusion, he leapeth from tenne thousande, to twelue, from twelue to twentie thousande.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, he put the case, that one with an other, hath had
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12645:79"/>
three children a peece: although, he saieth, many haue had foure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or fiue, in these fiue yeres laste paste. If ye aske hym how he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that? Marie sir, he was at the deliuery of them all. And to be yet more sure of his accompte to goe straite, he sent for all the midwiues in Englande, to helpe hym to make his rekonyng, without quarell or gainsaie. But putte the case (he biddeth) thei haue but twoo a peece: Loe here ye see, he vseth varietie and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in maner of his accoumptyng. And here he dissenteth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fashion he vsed in the beginnyng of settyng his cases: For els he should haue here saied sixe or eight a peece. Now laie them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Of sixtene thousande, spryngeth sixtene and sixtene. Make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the summe. Summe .xxxij. thousande: euen iuste. Then compte the father for one, and the mother for an other, and one and one maketh twoo, if thei bee well considered: though some tyme thei bee not odde betwixte them selues. Now of these twoo riseth six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene, and sixtene, and then forget not, as ye were learned a little before, that twise sixtene maketh .xxxij. Then write <hi>summa sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum</hi> .lxiiij. thousande mouthes, that the Realme is charged withall to finde. Is not this a marueilous matter, thinke ye, and an importable burthen, to the little Isle of Englande?</p>
            <p>Now, further consider what would growe thereof in processe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of yeres, of twentie or thirtie yeres, saieth he, if suche marriages were permitted: and then if thei beginne to marrie, for their part so sone as thei doe now a daies, whiche will not tary till thei bee thirtie yeres, I warrante you, neither maide nor man: Undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, the marueilousnesse of this accoumpt, must nedes astonish any mannes witte in the realme, it is so incomprehensible. And yet, leste ye should haue but one experiment of his connyng and witte in this science (and euer ye knowe, the more examples in teachyng harde poinctes, maketh the matter more cleare) he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you of an other imaginatiue case, as wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful as this other.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>Imagine, saieth he, foure generations of onely one mannes issue, &amp; euery of them to be maried. And see what this will grow to in fewe yeres? As for example, saieth he, let there bee one man that hath fiue children. And let euery one of these fiue children, haue other fiue children. And leste you should mistake hym, that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:12645:79"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he should meane, that these first fiue children, should beget their fiue children a peece, straight waie after thei were borne: he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth you in minde, that he meaneth of their begettyng, when thei bée mariable, and not before. Now he maketh there vpon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpte thus. The seconde generation multiplied by fiue, shall yelde the increasse of fiue and twentie. Note this wittie poincte, that fiue tymes fiue, multiplied, maketh .xxv. iuste, neither more nor lesse. Now sir, their generation multiplied by fiue, must nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des growe to the number of .Cxxv. And here by the waie, marke that he rekoneth but twentie to the score, and yet fiue score to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hundreth. And then ye knowe, fiue tymes .xxv. is sixe score and fiue, that is, after the rate of fiue score to the hundred, a .Cxxv. iust as can be. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> hym self, the first aucthour of this science, could not more truely haue hit it.</p>
            <p>Then goe now to the fourthe generation, still multiplied by v. it must increase to the number of hundrethes at the least, euen sixe hundreth .xxv persones. Ye see how precisely he goeth on, to bryng all with hym, leauyng neither out the odds score, nor yet the little fiue. All this number, he saieth, maie growe within the compasse of .lx. yeres. Whereby ye maie learne, that he geueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them soner libertie to beginne to begette their children, then the olde Canons gaue to Priestes, to bee admitted to that order: that is, not before thirtie, how worthie so euer he were: and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons not before .xxv. and virgines to be professed, not before xxv. no, some .xl. and widowes not before .xl. where sainct Paule is straighter to them, &amp; appoincteth .lx. For ye knowe, if thei should goe to it so slolie, his rekonyng could not be so well made vp. And therefore ye muste dispense with his generations, for suche ages as the Canons appoincteth.</p>
            <p>And againe, ye muste graunte hym an other case imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that not one of all these generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s maie dye, before he haue begotten his fiue, for then he should come short of his rekonyng. And one missed in this accompt, ye knowe must make a square: for it is not in persons, as it is in ynches. And yet he must craue more phantasticall cases of you. You must graunt hym, that all these must be men children, that must beget these fiue multiplied
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12645:80"/>
nombers. And ye knowe, thei maie not be any suche neither, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Christe telleth vs of in the .xix. of Matthewe, of three kindes of Eunuches, for thei ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not spede his purpose generatiue. Marie, if he mighte haue emong these his foure generations, some of those maried priestes, to whom he ascribeth suche faste multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, thei would make hym the soner a true man in his reko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng. But I dare saie, of his conscience he had rather bee false still in his rekon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>yng, then to graunt suche an absurditée.</p>
            <p>But now at the laste, when he hath brought orderly his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt, to suche plaine demonstration of sixe hundreth and fiue and twentie: he concludeth thus. If the first manne, saieth he (yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he meaneth not Adam, but the first of his foure generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) were tenne, or twelue, or twentie thousande: what Citée, yea, what Realme or countrée, could bee able to holde the generations of a fewe yeres, in so greate a libertée of mariage?</p>
            <p>And here againe note good reader, he meaneth no other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations but of Priestes maried. For he accounteth not these, that be gotten of priestes vnmaried: for it would helpe his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber but little God wotte, though he so did. And again, ye knowe most commonly thei be not without their fathers, that must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouche them, and can not spare them in the tale of his example,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of these foure generations. But if, after his greate laboure in busiyng his witte,<note place="margin">He y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nedeth not to learne a poinct of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetike, or is to graue to come so lowe to such trifli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g triuial s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let hym loke ouer the leaf, &amp; goe by.</note> to make this matter plaine (as I warraunte you, he sweatte at the browes, and was in as colde a studie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>sudauit &amp; alsit,</hi> before the conclusion was fullie spied) some rude and dull Asseheade would maruaile, howe his twoo principall summes in bothe his examples cometh to passe. Then for a more familier manner of handlyng the matter, he would haue him imagine: that he goeth so to woorke with hym, as if he would first make a rekenyng that euerie asse hath eight eares. And to proue that to him, he beareth him in hand that euery Asse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hath .iiii. heades: and there pricke the summe .iiij. heades. And at this he maye not stande, but must quickly goe on, and fall to the account, thus: ij. eares on a head, of .ij. heades, maketh .iiij. eares. For .ij. and .ii. maketh .iiij. Then the thirde head hath other .ii. (if none bee cut of) Now laye them together: put .ij. to .iiij. and then

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ye knowe, their muste nedes result .vi. and so manie ye haue of thre heades. Now go wisely to the fourth head, and there ye find other .ij. eares: put these .ij. to your former vi. and so ye haue .iiij. heades, eight eares.</p>
            <p>It is so euident to youre eye whiche he telleth you, that you can not be deceiued in this manifest rekening: that is that euery asse hath vndoubtedly iiii. heades, and eight eares.</p>
            <p>But to make an ende, for this mans worthie rewarde, let vs put an other Imaginatiue case, that to this Ciuilian, (though he came of late from Paris, as poore as Iob when he satte on his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> doung hill): yet for making of this excellent worke of his, should befall to him as many Asses in conclusion, as were geuen again to Iob at the laste. And imagine that all these Asses were bredde in <hi>Archadia,</hi> where thei be best, or in <hi>Antrothessaliae,</hi> where thei excell in greatnes, all other Asses: either in Paris, or <hi>Padua</hi>: and then he should come with euerie one of these Asses, into the citie of Samaria, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it should be beseged by <hi>Benedab</hi> the king of the Syrians, where he might sell all his asse heades, euerie head for four score siluer peeces readelie, as the market was once so good there, and maie chaunce to bee here nere at home in Englande, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> where his gaine should be the more, for sauing of his carriage, in vttering his asse heades to his speciall frendes, if there be not some spedie prouiso, to stoppe the forsaid multipliyng mariages.</p>
            <p>Then if this man, to make an euen acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of his asses of .iiij. heades for euery asse, iiij. score siluerlynges for euery head, beside the bodies: and if, to be suer in his account, what it would amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to, he would counsell with <hi>Budeus de Asse,</hi> what euery one of these iewesse peeces drewe to in oure currant monie: what a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table riche man, thinke ye, would this man be in suche multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by geuing euery asse foure greate heades?

Let them be laied together, and nowe rule briefly the summe totall, and ye should see what an houge summe he should put vp in his purse, in cleare gaine, though he sold not his owne head neither.

But the substaunce was partly, muche noting the gluttonie of Englishmen, whiche deuoured so muche vitaile in the lande: partly, magnifiyng the greate vtilitée and necessitée of the Frenche tongue, whiche he noted to bee almoste throughout the worlde frequented. And in his confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he marueiled of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse noble men that were present, for that thei could not kéepe hym talke, or yet could not so muche as vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de hym, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his gaie witte. Emong the number of the Lordes there, satte the old honourable Capitain, the Lorde Erle of Shrowes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie, lookyng at his meate, and gaue neither eare, nor counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to this iolie man, but gaue other leaue to talke, and sat, as he might, shakyng heade, and handes, in his Palsey, whiche was testimonie enough, whether he were not in his daies a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, liyng abrode in the fielde, to take aire of the ground. This Frenche Ambassadour was offended with hym, and saied: what an honour were it for yonder olde noble man, if he could speake the Frenche tongue? Surely it is a greate lacke to his nobilitie. One of the Lordes that kepte hym talke, askyng firste leaue of this <hi>mon sire,</hi> to report part of their communication, to the lorde Shrewesburie: Made reporte thereof yet in moste courteous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> maner, with easie &amp; fauorable rehearsal, as might touch a truth.</p>
            <p>When he heard it, where before his head by greate age, was almoste grouelyng on the table: he roused hym self vp in suche wise, that he appeared in length of bodie, as muche as he was thought euer in all his life before. And knittyng his browes, he laied his hande on his dagger, and set his countenaunce in suche
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:12645:83"/>
sorte, that the Frenche hardie Ambassadour, tourned coloure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> wonderfully. Saieth the Frenche whoreson so, saieth he? Marie tell the Frenche dogge againe, by sweete sainct Cuthbert, if I knewe that I had but one pestilente Frenche woorde in all my bodie, I would take my dagger and digge it out, before I rose from the table. And tell that tawnie whoreson againe: how soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he haue been hungerstarued hym self, at home in Fraunce, that if we should not eate our beastes, and make vitaill of theim as faste as we doe, thei would so encrease beyonde measure, that thei would make vitaile of vs, and eate vs vp.</p>
            <p>When these woordes were reported againe to this Frenche <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> gest, he spoiled no more vittaile at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dinner after that, but dranke wonderous oft. Whiche, whether it was his countenaunce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had lefte talkyng, or, whether for that he was inwardly drie: the reporter of this tale, could tell me no further: but saied, that his eye was neuer of hym, all that dinner while after.</p>

            <p>I remember, that beyng once at a marchaunte mannes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in London, whiche was in the verie laste yere of Iubilee, so coumpted commonlie, I heard a man rehearse, how that <hi>Platina</hi> writeth, that Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, whiche did write hymself the Lorde of all the worlde, bothe of Spiritualtées and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltées

In respecte of which greate grace, to be gotten in those yeres, for suche as will dispose them selues thereto, Pope <hi>Clemente</hi> the sixte, brought it to fiftie yeres, and Pope Paule the seconde, chaunged that from .l. yere to .xxv. yere, and that as <hi>Fasciculus temporum</hi> noteth, <hi>in fauore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

At whiche talke, there was an honeste plaine manne saied: that readyng sometyme in the Englishe Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, he noted, that he read of twoo recourses of yeres of Iubilee, whiche were not very gracious to mennes bodies, within the Realme. The one he saied, was aboute the thirtene yere, in the daies of kyng Henry the seuenth, in whiche yere died in London aboue .xxx. thousande people: thother yere of Iubilee, was about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the .xxiiij. yere of kyng Edward the third, in whiche yere and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the same, there was suche an vniuersall Pestilence, that neither the parties beyonde the sea was free, as in Paris died fiftie thousande, at sainct Denis fourtene thousande: As for I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie (<hi>Platina</hi> writeth in <hi>vita Clementis .vi.</hi>) that there was not left skant tenne, of euery thousande men. Whiche Pestilence he importeth to the great confluence of people, that came into Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie this yere of Iubilee for pardon. But in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de euery where innumerable destroied, in so muche, that he tolde it out of Fabia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that after thei had buried in euery Churche yarde within Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and emong the Religious houses to, thei were faine to vse the greate Churche yarde of the Chartor house: in whiche onely were buried aboue fiftie thousande corses. And as it chaunsed there was a man, whiche semed to be a credible man, of the Citée of Norwich, whiche declared that thei had in their Citée, a record of those that died at that tyme in Norwiche, whiche he saied, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted

He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it to bee a greater number, then was in these daies in the whole Citée, and fiue miles about. He told further of so maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a plague, that was once at a towne thereby called Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthe, and there recorded, that he marueiled how the towne could holde so many. Notwithstandyng yet this greate mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, kyng Edwarde, that victorious kyng, who wanne Calice, (whiche almightie GOD long defende) wanted not people the very same yere, to encounter with a greate Nauie that came out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Spaine, and had the victory: Nor yet wanted people in the ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res next immediatly followyng, to pursue that he had begunne in Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. At whiche tyme, he furnished his first begotten sonne, Prince Edwarde with an houge armie, wherewith he wente to Gascoyne, and so by Tholouse to Nerbon, brennyng and spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng all the Countrée as he wente, by his greate power that he had with hym, without resistaunce. And neuerthelesse, aboute that same very tyme, the kyng hymself in his owne persone, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into Fraunce, and there did what it liked him. In whiche passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme, it was brought hym woorde, that the Scottishe kyng was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> stollen into his Realme, and had wonne Barwicke, and that he made daiely assaulte to winne the Castle there. Wherevpon the saied kyng Edwarde, retourned againe, and recouered the saied towne of Barwicke, and went further into Scotlande, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the Scottishe kyng so narrowlie, that he compelled hym to submitte hym self to the kynges grace as prisoner, and resigned his power into the kynges handes.</p>
            <p>And whiles this was in doyng, the saied prince Edward his sonne, warred vpon the Frenche men, and lastly came to Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux, with many riche prisoners, and <hi>Pillagies</hi> to his great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> In whiche said passage, although the earles of Armenacke, of Foyz, of Poyters, and Cleremount, with sir Iames de Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, and many other knightes were in the same countries, yet went he through without battaill.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> wanted no people) the duke of Lancaster had an other armie, and entred the Countrie of Constantine. And if this master Martin, would looke in the Chronicles, he should espie, how prosperously this saied Duke did in that viage: and on the other side, how va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly the saied Prince Edwarde achiued his iourney, beyng in suche confidence of victorie and honoure that would ensue, that he would not bee induced or intreated to any peace, how oft and how diligently soeuer, that good Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the .vi. then Bushop of Rome, sent his Cardinals to that same effect. I name hym good, for he decreed vnder paine of eternall curse, that euerie prelate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> should bée resident vpon their benefices, and for that he brought his familie to a lesse number, &amp; chosed them out of the best. But the saied Prince Edward I saie, notwithstandyng passed fourth to Poyters, where was a wonderfull battaill fought and wonne by hym. In whiche were slaine of the frenche part, diuerse Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and menne of warre, to the number of eight hundreth, and of Baronets, liiij. beside Knightes and other meaner menne of warre: And were there taken prisoners, Iohn the Kyng, Philip his fourth sonne, with other Archbushops, Bushops, and men of name to the numbre of xv. hundreth and aboue.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, leste some occasion of fornication might steale in vpon a man, then it were lawfull to euery manne to haue his peculiar wife, and to euerie woman her proper and peculiar husbande. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> For a proper and peculiar man is (saieth he) a lawfull husband. Thirdly, he that hath a wife, maie not without his wiues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent containe, but render to his wife due beneuolence, and so on the other side, the wife to the husbande: the cause is declared, for that the husbande hath not power of his owne body, nor the wife power of her owne bodie.

            <p>For fornication he said, let euery man haue his wife. Which saiyng and confession, to perteine specialy and onely to the laye folke, is a plaine lye of the Hypocrites: which in what holy order soeuer thei be set, yet without boubt thei force not to abuse other mennes wiues. And these be thei, whiche doe rage in the forsaied crimes. <abbr>sc</abbr>, of abusing their fathers wiues, to vse the filthie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiyng of mankinde, and of brute bestes, which filthines we can not beholde saieth he, but with weeping teares. These bee thei, whiche doe not vnderstand the scriptures aright, whose breastes whiles thei presse so harde, thei sucke out cruell blood, in the stede <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of sweete milke. And further in the ende of his Epistle, chargeth theim with the crime of heresie, that inioyne suche constrained Chastitée: where ye affirme Chap. ix.q.x. that thei were all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, that did continue with their wiues, whiche thei had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before their orders. And here to preuente your cauilation, where ye might saie, that I should haue gone a litle further with this bushops writyng, for sooth I answere, I would all the whole were written in Englishe, that laye menne might see, how it maketh for you, that would haue Priestes diuorsed. For the whole Epistle is an vtter confutation of youre booke. But sir,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> till hereafter, stande vpon that whiche followeth, as strongly as ye can, and yet shal ye neuer be able to extende that saiyng vpon seculer priestes ordered in England, who haue made no profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or vow of perpetuall chastitie. But ye will replie vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> &amp; <hi>Theoqhilact</hi> saiynges before rehearsed:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12645:88"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that this former text, <hi>Bonum est mulierem non tangere,</hi> it is good for a man not to touche a woman, to belong aswell to the laye man, as to the priest. But this saiyng (for avoidyng fornication, let euery man haue his wife) to pertaine to laie menne onely: whiche yet <hi>Huldarichus</hi> sheweth the contrarie. Sir, if ye bee so harde for nigardshippe, to holde the priestes to the straite of the first sentence, and not to giue them the libertie of the sentence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowyng: I weene ye will be answered of the priestes maried and vnmaried, as seruanntes in the countrie will answere their ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard maisters that will ioygne them to fast on the vigils in haye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> seile and haruest. That is, if we be compelled to fast in the vigill precedyng, we will suerly make holy daie and plaie, all the daie followyng. But sir, for the vniuersalitie of S. Paules sentence, if ye list after these olde aucthors, to heare a new writer or .ij. till here after we shall bring you more store of the olde: Looke vpon Bushop <hi>Alfonsus</hi> tractation, where he holdeth plainly, that the prieste hath yet that indulgence and sentence of S. Paule, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie his infirmitie, yea, after his order and promise past, &amp; the reguler also after his vowe. And again, resort ye to <hi>Ioannes Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesius</hi> in his first leafe, and there shall ye learne, that he defineth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that God did twise institute Matrimonie, whiche yet euery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine will not graunt hym. And that the second institution, was by these woordes of sainct Paule (it is good for a manne not to touche a woman) but yet for fornication, let euery man haue his wife, and euery woman haue her husbande: And that this insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was purposely made of God, for the remedie of mannes infirmitie. Well, these notwithstandyng, bee it in case that he could winne, that the saied sentence of sainct Paule were so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly applied &amp; restrained, either from all menne vnmaried, or from priestes to bee maried: What exception can he make in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this sentence of sainct Paule in the same Chapiter, spoken to widowes, &amp; to them that be vnmaried. <hi>Quod si se non co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent, contrahant matrimoniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> If thei do not conteine, let them mary, for it is better to marrie then to burne. But ye will saie, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the lay ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but not for hym that is a priest, or a Regular. Whie, maie mans institution and vowe, defeate this second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution

of God of matrimonie for incontinentie, that any of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> creatures may be debarred from his remedy? Is it better for the priest to burne then to marie? Is it better for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> regular to burne, then to enioie Gods gentle liberalitee in his second institution of mariage? Shall the priest rather chose to go to the deuill, for the wante of the remedie of his infirmitie, then for the shame of the world for his mutabilitie, acknowledging his frailtie, go to god? were it not better to cast fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him his right eye, as déere as it wer, for his estimation &amp; promotion of the worlde, if it be a let to hym to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, rather then with his deere eye of weltering promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to haue all his bodie cast into hell fier? I speake it not to geue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> bridle of dissolute liuing to euery light head, but yet I would not haue man lay snares to ieoperd mennes soules. But ye wil saie, euery man can if he will. Christ saieth, thei onely can take it, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is giuen.

To burne, is to be vexed with concupiscence, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be ouercomed: But that we might not be ouercomed, is in our power through Goddes grace. Maister D. Martine, for all youre throughly aduised writyng, ye haue falsified sainct <hi>Ambrose</hi> in twoo pointes. For first sainct <hi>Ambrose</hi> saieth: <hi>vri est desiderijs, agi vel vinci.</hi> And not: <hi>agi ac vinci.</hi> To bee caried with desires, or to be ouercomed, and not: to bee caried with desiers, and to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomed. For as well <hi>agi desiderijs</hi> as <hi>vinci desideriis</hi> (as other interpretours expounde the place) is, <hi>vstionem pati.</hi> That is, to burne. And to auoide either of them, sainct Paule graunteth mariage. For either of them excedeth <hi>Volatiles &amp; Lubricas co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitationes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> innatae concupiscentiae</hi>: the soden and transitorie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of luste that is in manne. But he, saieth S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that séeth hymself not able to perseuer by the violent motions of his fleshe, let hym marrie, rather then burne, and so peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he maie afterwarde obtaine this thyng. So that he whiche
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:12645:91"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> either lieth in the flame of perpetuall desier of the other kinde in hart, or in outward déede, or executeth further his iuste: is said to brenne. Mary to feale desiers, and to ouercome them in deede, is a poincte of a strong and a perfect manne. Secondly, that other part of the sentence is not <hi>Ambrose</hi> woordes there, though your text and your translation would so blanche it out. But so dothe youre blinde guide, whom ye followed in this allegation, and in others, that impudente <hi>Pelagian Pighius</hi>: who, in his bookes condemneth sainct <hi>Augustine</hi> in that verie Catholike doctrine, whiche he defendeth against <hi>Pelagius</hi>: the tast and sute of which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> counter doctrine, like a good hound, ye folowe on a greate pace.

So that if the partie self wil, he maie conteine and haue possibilitie by the graunt and pleasure of God. In whiche sentence ye do vse muche violence in your translation, to make <hi>(votum)</hi> there to signifie a vowe, as ye speake of vowes. For <hi>(votu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> there signifieth no more a vow, then it doeth in this place of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> writynges <hi>de virginibus Non enim imperari potest virginitas, sed optari.

For such thinges as bee aboue oure nature, bee rather in wishe then in will. Then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vpon this ye conclude an argument, Ergo. &amp;c. where sainct <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> writyng vpon this place: euery man hath his proper gift of God. &amp;c. saieth thus. Who then geueth these thynges? Who doeth distribute to euery manne his proper gifte, as it pleaseth hym? Uerely God, in whom there is no wickednesse or parciali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tée. And therevpon by what equitée he maketh some thus, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12645:92"/>
some thus, it is to man either impossible to knowe, or els very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> harde.

            <p>Also where ye define, that it is in our power and election to liue in virginitée, if ye will doe as sainct Paule did, ye saie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saied, <hi>ter dominum rogaui. &amp;c.</hi> that is: for the whiche I haue praied thrise to our lorde, that he would take it awaie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. &amp;c.

But to contend with hym in suche causes of Councels, Canons, and Stories, whiche he contorteth by all shift of wit, to make them to plie to his gostly purpose, were a long businesse. But maruaile not, gentle reader, though he take so muche vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hym, in suche infinite and intricate Churche Lawes, wherein he thinketh to leade thee in a mase, as not readie for euery man to see and expend: for thou maiest see his impudent boldnesse other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. For if ye note hym well, ye maie finde hym hackyng at the Lawes of the Realme, clippyng the Queenes coyne, the best that her grace hath (nexte to the worde of God) for defence of her Princely estate: the Actes of Parliamente I meane: because he would be ready in seruice to her highnesse, to the beste of his wit and power. Note, howe he trauerseth and wreasteth with his gloses, an Acte of the very firste Parliament, that her grace hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> here caused to bee had, since her raigne and coronation, not so long since, that it can so sone bee out of remembraunce: nor the Actes so harde to come by, but that all the worlde maie expende them.

When ye haue well answered this one question, I thinke suche as bée learned in the law, could deuise more of suche kinde, to set your gaie witte on worke. And if ye list, ye maie read, that suche equitie was prouided for, in the first yere of Kyng Edwarde the sixte, in the .xj.

            <p>I praie you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, whether these rules of the lawes folowing, might not haue place in this cause, where it is saied: <hi>Factum le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimum, retractari non debet, licét casus postea eueniat, quo no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> potuit inchoari.</hi> A facte that was once lawfull, ought not to bee called into question againe, although afterwardes there happen somethyng, that myght hinder the beginnyng of it. <hi>Et multa prohibentur fieri, que facta tamen tenent.</hi> Many thynges are prohibited to be doen, whiche when thei once bée doone, must yet stand. <hi>Indultum a iure beneficium, non est alicui auferendum.</hi> A benefite graunted by law, must be taken from no man.

            <p>Moreouer, if these mariages aforesaied, ought not to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, but muste enioye the benefite of that statute, when it so stode, though it be repealed for hereafterward: why should that act of repeale, made in the first yere of our soueraigne Ladie the Quéenes maiestie, Quéene Marie, takyng a waye only but the libertie for Priestes to marrie for hereafter, impeache or hinder those lawfull mariages of priestes before (aucthorised by as good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> lawe and as often tymes before these daies seen) more then king Edwardes repeale, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or ought, molest these mariages, for their maner of contractyng?

Whiche poincte of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, is in suche absolute wise debated learnedly, in a Booke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> written here in Englande, intituled: <hi>De potestate Regia &amp; Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastica</hi>: that neither this Ciuilian, nor all the Canonistes in Englande, shall euer be able to answere it. For it hath hetherto laine vnanswered these twentie yeres, of all the Romanistes in Christendome. And if this Ciuilian will reade it, and expende it ouer, and doubteth further of any poincte conteined therein: let hym consulte with certaine of the Bushoppes, that bee in moste aucthoritee at this daie, by whose learnyng and collection, the booke was written, and thei can further resolue him.

If it bee obiected, that the Pope can not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with the generall Counsaile, that will not serue.

Whiche lawe of <hi>Prouiso,</hi> although Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the leuenth did muche repine at, and saied, that to make suche a Lawe, was nothing els, but to diuide Christes churche, to destroie Christian religion, and that it was againste all Gods forbode: and though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Pope <hi>Martyn</hi> the v. of that name, wrote sharper letters to Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the .vi. to haue it reuoked: yet the kinges and the nobles afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saied, would none of it, thei would stande to their Lawes whiche thei made in their policy, how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary soeuer Rome lawes were against them, or how faine soeuer the Bushops of Rome would haue had their eyes still bent vpon vs, as my Lorde of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster writeth, in that their vniuersall carefulnesse of <hi>Prouiso.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, looke vpon kyng Henry the eightes Acte, in his .xxv. yere, and fourtene Chapiter, for the preamble: and then smell, if ye can, what this Ciuilian meaneth, by this gaie inuention of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his: to saie, <hi>that vpon a Statute of Repeale,</hi> the Canons succeadeth by and by, in full force and strength. And here, I muche maruell, that one thyng skapeth, not onely this farcastyng Ciuilian, but all his chief doctors of the Ciuill Lawe to. For if this deuice be so greate a warraunte, as he maketh it, to the Commissaries, in the maried Priestes case: how chaunceth it that (because kyng Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:12645:108"/>
statute, before rehearsed, of his firste yere, repealed al his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> progenitours Actes, for punishemente of heresies): thei doe not tell the Spirituall Lordes, &amp; others of the Conuocation, whiche would so faine haue newe mens heades, vnder their old girdels, by the Act whiche was so muche labored for, for heretikes at this laste Parliamente, that seyng now all the old statutes bee put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, for this matter of heresie, and the realme hath no Lawe in strengthe, and necessary it were (as true it is) that heresie should be brideled, that therevpon tombleth me in, all the whole rable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churche Canons, and Lawes by heapes, with all their force and paines. And therefore this Ciuilian might bidde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Ordinaries, and all their Commissaries, how sore and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme soeuer thei listed to bee, bee of good chere, and dispaire not to want their willes: for if thei looke well about them, thei haue now, by the benefite of kyng Edwardes statute (and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, he might be called good king Edward, or king Edward the sainct) more in their handes, then euer thei had these. CC. yeres.</p>
            <p>Now, how this wittie deuice would be receiued, and where it would be most thankefully taken, or whether it would turne to the wealth of the realme? Let other men expende, and make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to this Ciuilian, and to other of his cheif doctors: whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> there were any misterie of mischief in it, or no.</p>
            <p>I thinke, that as in all Kynges dayes sence the conquest, the wise and learned menne of the realme, from tyme to tyme, hath alwaie moderated the Canons &amp; lawes of the vniuersall church, (as small a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the same, as the Romanistes of these daies, in contemptuous comparison, would make their owne naturall countrée, to the aduauncement of a counterfette and vnnaturall congregation at Rome) whiche Churche thei (full aptly) call the temple of God and toke Canons but as rules of consente, and refused them againe as fréely by consent, and extinguished them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and their paynes with them: And yet were no princes of infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as ye make a faier insinuation therof in your v. Chapiter. I. iiij. and euer preferred the Imperiall Lawes of the state of the realme, for their surest inheritances, as the Quéenes highnes at this daie, doeth euen the same, with good deliberation. And
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:12645:108"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> yet the Queenes grace and her Nobles, nor her graces progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, nor their olde auncitours neither, not counted the lesse ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike to God, and to the true churche of Christ for suche bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng in of these sléepyng and dreamyng Canons: of whiche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours saieth my Lorde of Winchester, some of them bee saintes in heauen, and be so honoured and reputed at these daies. So I thinke, the wise and learned menne, at the makyng of the saied act of Kyng Edwarde in his first yere, ment not, that wher thei deuised it specially to resist extremities of lawes, thei should imprudently or wittyngly bryng in tenne tymes more extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> then euer thei were vnder, before that act was made.</p>
            <p>When wise menne, by the occasion of suche cases, haue pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by them selues what signes and profers bee made by this Ciuilian by the case of Priestes mariages, whiche though the Deuill and all his members laboreth by all meanes to foile, yet standyng as thei do, vpon the rocke of Gods lawes (specially for seperation) and that separation beyng against the iudgement of the beste and eldest writers in Christes Churche, standyng the aucthoritée of the kynges Imperiall croune, and so many lawes knitte and combined in suche validitée, as thei be made, I doubt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not but some man at length will saie: <hi>Quòd non est talis casus in tota lege, &amp; quod est valdè difficilis.</hi> That there is not suche a case in all the lawe, and that it is very harde, as easelye as this lawier passeth it ouer. And then againe, rauyng in this one case, of poore Priestes mariages, whom to ouercome in their priuate case, is no great maistery, nor no great care taken, although yet priestes, to suffer violence of priestes, will in thend litle aduaunce the whole Clergie: I saie what myre maie be raked vp, to make a shrewed perfume to their owne nooses, in their owne cases and states, I lette other menne consider. It was wonte to be saied: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Qui vni iniuriam facit, omnibus facit.</hi> He that dothe wrong to one, in effect doth wrong to all. But what forceth this Ciuilian, what lawes soeuer be against hym, so thei bée no better then sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute lawes of this poore outcaste Isle and perticuler Churche of England. And whatsoeuer be iudged of hym, so he may haue the victorie in this cause, what care taketh he, either what miserie

and mischeife cometh to the priestes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hateth so spitefully:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or what inconueniencies maye ensue to the whoole realme, by suche barbarousnes as is induced for want of ministers: or what inconueniencies of vnspeakeable whoredomes and filthines, pretily in some places alreadie begunne and practised, by reason of suche forced separations wil folowe, so he maie haue his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of this noble conquest. For if the glorie of victorie were not so vnreasonably sought for, in his glorious booke: and if he were not beyond al measure incensed with malice against them, as he appeareth: or if he were not the man, that belike hath so highlye aduaunced hymself in his own conceite, that he thinketh no man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dare or will dissent from hym: or els haue set his forehead impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, so headstrong against all menne, that he careth not who loketh in his face: He could neuer be so farre past shame as he is, so openly, &amp; in so many places of his booke to lye, in aduouchyng such aucthorities as he doth, in the perticulers of his probations.</p>
            <p>I maruell, before God, that he is not a shamed so boldly, and irreuerently, to vtter his lyes to the Queenes highnes, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable nobilitée, to all the learned and wise men in the realme, and is not a shamed in his owne conceipte, or at the least waye, stande not in doubt in hymself, that he can not so scape with his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vntruthes so clearly, but that some men will tell them at length to the nobilitie, &amp; other graue personages of the realme, whiche hath not the leasure to peruse and compare his writynges, with the originalls them selues. But it is to true in hym, that is saied comonly: <hi>Malè examinat verum, omnis corruptus iudex.</hi> Full euill is a true cause examined and expended, by the iudge that is corrupt.</p>
            <p>In his eight Chapiter, where he laboureth to proue that all priestes be votaries, whiche he shall neuer be able to proue, of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers Priestes ordered in this realme of England, do the best he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> can: he hath diuerse fetches.

               </note> saieth he, this the Bushops proposition, and thou shalt anone see, whether our priestes be not votaries: and thou shalt espie also, what trueth is in oure newe preachers, that haue slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered the church. &amp;c. Who would thinke that vpon suche protestation, he would euen straight waie for all this preamble, bléere the readers eye with a manifest lye?</p>
            <p>Now good reader, as he desireth thee to examine this poynt, euen so do I beseche thee. And then espie by thy self, what truthe is in this new Ciuilian. And for the triall of his truthe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> aske hym if euer he heard any Bushoppe or suffragane in Englande, speake that proposition to the Subdeacons? And if he haue, thei haue dreamed it of their owne heades: for their haue it not in their owne pontificals, by the whiche thei geue all their orders. Therfore it is a most shamefull boldnes to beare the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in hand that it is so saied by the Busshoppe, when it is not by hym spoken. And therefore in this poincte, he is to impudent, to make his strong argumentes vpon suche groundes, as bee not aduoucheable.</p>
            <p>But yet good reader, leste he should blynde thine eye, with a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sleightie craft, as is all his doynges in his boke, peraduenture he maie for the aduouchyng of his report, bryng thee to a pontificall booke, &amp; shewe thee his wordes in deede.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:12645:110"/>
And if he can proue that, then vpon this poincte, I am content <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that my whole boke be taken for false and vntrue. If he can not proue his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> but yet euen there he vseth a violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted argument against doctor Ponet, alledgyng these wordes: <hi>Vis castitatem ac sobrietate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cum dei auxilio seruare?</hi> Wilt thou,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> through the helpe of GOD, keepe chastitée and sobrietée? Yet in the Englishe pontificall, it is thus: <hi>Vis castitatem &amp; sobrietate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cum dei auxilio custodire &amp; docere?</hi> Wilte thou, by the helpe of God, keepe and teache chastitee and sobrietee? I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende with hym in this saiyng for the bushops, but in his former wordes of his allegation for Subdeacons of Englishe makyng, he shall neuer make it good to his liues end, that those wordes be in the Englishe pontificall. Notwithstandyng, he thinketh that he hath made moste strong proofe of his purpose, where ye see, by that that is hitherto perceiued in his booke, he hath made foure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> principall groundes, that Englishe Priestes be votaries: Firste by <hi>Origens</hi> aucthoritee, writyng vpon the Numbers. Secondly, by the maner of their Orderyng. Thirdly, by the Priestes crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Fourthly, by an argument of <hi>Taciturnitie.</hi> And that once dooen, he spendeth his eighth Chapiter, in prouyng that vowes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:12645:110"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> muste be kepte, whiche belike must be his fifte argumente. And thus these argumentes holde.</p>
            <p>The first, the Priestes where <hi>Origen</hi> was borne, or where he did write, were votaries: <hi>Ergo</hi> Englishe Priestes be votaries. And yet <hi>Origen</hi> did not write so. But in that Homilie speakyng aswell to Laye menne, as to Priestes, saieth, that thei bee moste meete to offer vp the continuall Sacrifice, of Mornyng and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenyng praier, that will kepe continuall chastitie. And then his argument holdeth thus: Thei which can continually praie, kepe continuall chastitee: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Englishe Priestes bee votaries. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thus I argue: Priestes maried, maie offer to God that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Sacrifice of Mornyng and Euenyng praier: <hi>Ergo,</hi> thei neede not to vowe that chastitee, whiche ye speake of. Or thus, <hi>Origen</hi> writeth not there any woorde of Priestes vowes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> in that place he doeth not proue them votaries.</p>
            <p>The seconde, for the maner of the Busshoppes proposition. The Busshop speaketh suche a proposition, to Priestes in Spain or Italie: <hi>Ergo</hi> Englishe priestes be votaries. Now the truth is, no suche proposition is spoken, to the Englishe Subdeacon at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all. Further, this Ciuilian writeth manifestly, euen there thus, that the vowe of chastitee, is no otherwise conceiued of our prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, then as it is propounded to them, by the Busshoppe in suche proposition. Then I reason thus. The Busshoppe propoundeth not this propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our priestes in Englande: <hi>Ergo</hi> there is no vowe in them conceiued, &amp; so none begotten or brought to birth: Ergo, Englishe priestes be no votaries by your owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cession.</p>
            <p>Your thirde argumente hangeth thus. Priestes crounes in their heades signifie a vowe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Englishe Priestes bee vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. Now I haue proued that matter to bee farre vnlike, that their crounes should bee signes of any vowe, but rather of other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thynges. And that ye bee fondly deceiued, as I trust ye doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by this tyme, and then I argue thus. The priestes crounes signifie no suche vowe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> by that signe Englishe Priestes be no votaries. Or thus. The <hi>Nazarea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> shaued of their heere, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their vowe was doen and paste, the Priestes bee like the <hi>Nazare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as ye saie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by the shauyng of their crounes, thei bee
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:12645:111"/>
paste their vowe, and not vnder their vowe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
            </p>
            <p>Your fourthe argument of <hi>Taciturnitie,</hi> holdeth thus. Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes Ordered by the Romane pontificall, kepyng their silence at the Bushoppes proposicion, binde them selues by their <hi>Tacitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> to a vowe of continencie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Englishe Priestes orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their owne potificall, wherein no suche proposition is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, bee v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>taries. Furthermore, your owne difinition is of a vowe, that it should bée a deliberate or aduised promise made to God, for a better entente and purpose. And further ye saie, that by reason of the Priestes profession and vowe annexed, he is a votarie, &amp; can not Marrie. Then thus I argue. Englishe Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> make no suche promise or profession, nor the Busshoppe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth any suche promise, nor any proposition doe include suche profession or promise: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by the maner of their orderyng, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe Priestes be no votaries, and therefore without let of any vowe, maie Marrie. And <hi>Ioannes Genesius</hi> saith, that there is no greater impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t against their mariage, then their vowe, suche as it is. And then standyng, that no suche vowe is made by them, it foloweth, that the greatest impedimente, is by his aucthoritee well wiped awaie: And all these argumentes made for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, holde as well as all those, whiche he bryngeth in for his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> affirmatiue. Thus ye see what doctrine he hath vttered, to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Iudges to leane to, for their hastie proceadynges of diuorsyng suche persones maried. And therefore, if either in his blindnesse, or malice, or yet ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he geueth the occasion to vnlearned Ordinaries &amp; their Commissaries, to attempt wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that thyng, whiche neither Gods worde nor mans worde, can approue or beare: I would not be in his coote for suche threates of Christ: <hi>Ve homini per quem offendiculu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> venit: &amp; bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erat illi, sinatus no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuisset homo ille:</hi> Wo be to that man, by whom offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce commeth: and it were better for that manne, if he neuer had been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> borne, for all the gaines he shal haue in the Chauncerie, as long as he liueth.

            <p>If suche moderation as kynges and Emperours haue made in this matter, will not serue to moue this maister of Chauncery to temper his extremitie: wee will laie before hym some suche potentates, whiche paraduenture he accoumpteth to bee of hier aucthoritée in suche matters, and will soner bee perswaded by them: as Popes, Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sailes, and Bushops decrées. To satisfie his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> expectation somewhat, wee reade in <hi>Platina</hi>: that <hi>Pius,</hi> Pope of Rome, the second of that name, was wont to speake these woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: <hi>Quòd magna ratione sublatae sunt nuptiae a sacerdotibus, sed tamen sibi videri, maiori ratione restituendas.</hi> He affirmed that the cause was great, whiche toke a waie mariage from priestes, but yet there was greater cause, why thei should bee restored to them againe. This was this Popes opinion and iudgement. And further he writeth: <hi>Epistola. 130. contra Bohemos,</hi> that in the primatiue churche, the Clergie had wiues, and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was distributed in bothe kyndes.

            <p>These head fathers at Rome, haue been before now, and be at this daie, I doubt not, more gentle, then we be in this particuler Churche.

Carterius,</hi> a Busshop <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Spayne, a man as well auncient of age, as of Priesthode, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried one wife before he receiued baptisme, and after her death, when he was baptised, maried a seconde wife, and thy iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t geueth thee that he did contrarie to the mynde of the Apostle, whiche in the bedroll of suche vertues as belong to a Busshop, commaunded hym to be admitted to that ordre, which should be the husband of one wife.

For he saith, that all the world is full of priestes, and Busshops whiche were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried menne, of two wiues, one after an others death. Secondly, that he vnderstandeth sainct Paule, a Busshoppe, to be the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande of one wife, not as ye expounde it, of hym that had neuer but one in all his life, but so he haue but one at the tyme of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> consecration.

            <p>If ye will, maister Martin, indifferently expende the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations afore rehearsed, ye shall perceiue that ye be to sore and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, to pronounce that Englishe Priestes, already maried by lawe of the realme, beside the depriuations of their liuynges,

and sequestration from ministryng, should not be able to satisfie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> excepte thei remedie their no fault at all with separation. And for further reforming of your iudgement herein, you should do well to consider, what prudence and moderation, that noble and wise politike Prince Charles the v. vsed in his <hi>Interim,</hi> for Germany where he found the whole estate of the Clergie geuing them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to mariage, without any publike or common consent of the law Imperiall. For though in that order of doctrine he expressed his desier, wisshyng that there could be found many in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie whiche would liue a sole life, and performe a true chastitie in deede: yet bearyng with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that had doen to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie: nether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> proceaded he against them by law to depriuation, nor yet to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but permitted them to continue stil in their ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and liuinges, vpon what priuate authoritie soeuer thei tooke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to marrie.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whiche ye will not make mention of. For after the Canon had named fower of suche vnlawfull copulations, it saieth thus of them. <hi>Quos vt a presenti tempore prohibemus, ita ea quae sunt anterius instituta, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> soluimus.</hi> Which mariages, as for hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we doe forbidde: so those which be already made, we will not disseuer.

            <p>Furthermore, the selfe same degrees of blood, whereof these incestuous mariages be made, are also recited in the Counsaile <hi>Agatensi,</hi> holden vnder Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> the first. <hi>Anno domini.</hi> 428. and there the Counsaile, after dissolution, geueth them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertee to marrie a newe.

But here maie be considered, how muche moderation these Counsailes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to beare, with an inconuenience once passed, to tollerate suche vnnaturall mariages, as thei were: and were contented, onely for necessitee, to forbidde them for afterward.

            <p>And here I would aske this Lawier a question, by occasion of the woordes that there further followeth, of that extrauagant: whether Englishe secular priestes, haue made a simple vowe, or a solempne vowe, in the takyng of their orders?

What bindeth them then in their order? Yea, why be thei not free of all handes? And their mariages good, and indissoluble from all lawes of man? For this bonde, whiche this Lawier vrgeth so importunatly, muste stande either of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and substance of order, either of the nature and bonde of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vowe either of the promise and profession of the Prieste at recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng of his orders: or els of the constitution and positiue Lawe of the Churche.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:12645:135"/>
vnder suche condition: then it standeth onely but of the decrees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and Canons of the churche, whiche can not, nor ought not, nor the Queenes Maiestie will not (as by the firste Article in her Commission appeareth) haue executed, to the preiudice or dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of any Lawes of the realme.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, vpon that deuise that is alledge to defeat sainct <hi>Augustines</hi> sentence and iudgement, affirming that the church, as then, had not defined votaries mariages to bee adulteries, or to be dissolued. If the matter standeth but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Churche: then thus I reason. The Churche hath defined of olde, precontractes to make Matrimonie, and the second contractes to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be voide. The churche of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of late defined the second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with carnall copulation, to be Matrimony, the first contract to be none. In the time of this definition, diuerse persones vpon the seconde contract were maried, and so continue together still at this daie: I aske of you, Master Martin, whether the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Churche of England wil not be warrant inough for their mariages? I truste ye will not dissolue them nowe, though that definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be now repealed again, and restored by an other defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Euen in like maner, the church afore tyme, defined priestes mariages to be no mariages, but to be dissolued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> duryng the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of which definition, priestes wer not suffred to marrie. Now of late, the Church of Englande, whiche, as was shewed before, is as well a catholike, and Apostolike church, as Rome churche, or any other, and of lyke and equall aucthoritée, iurisdiction, and power. This churche I saie, not stelyngly, but aduisedly, in two sondrie cessions, not of the Laytie onely, but of the Clergie, did define Priestes mariages to bee good, and auailable against all Lawes positiue. Then standyng this definition, whye were not their mariages good? and this definition beyng repealed but for hereafter, whie shall it not serue for those that were then made,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and now standyng in strength by Goddes Lawe, and not as yet dissolued by mannes Lawe? But ye will obiect, that the Church definition maketh not the thinge to be, but sheweth it to bee. So that ye maye saie, suche mariages were euer vnlawfull: But then declared vnlawfull, when the church definition was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.

If I were of the nombre of those priestes, who (beyng hindered by no other impediment of Goddes Lawe) had maried vpon the definition of the Princes Law: I would as gladly erre with sainct <hi>Augustine,</hi> and with that age wherin he was, in this matter: as to be a catholike with doctor Martin, and suche other of his affinitee.

For so irritable was Anselme and so soone prouoked without any iust cause, to go to Rome to his holy father. If any thyng went agaynst his mynde, then straygh-way he woulde appeale to Rome to displease the prince: As this lyghtnes of his, is vttered by a frende of his, wrytyng <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vnto hym, beyng at the seconde tyme (as he calleth it) in his exile,<note place="margin">

In conclusion, after the sayde Anselme retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned agayne into Englande, he dyd besturre hym selfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the religious to their loste quietnes, and forced on his extreme decree vpon the priestes returned to their wyues, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng the oportunitie of the kynges absence in Normandie, warryng there agaynst his enemies, and had the victorie of them. Which Anselme, thought it not only enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them from their office: but also to depriue them from their benefices, and drawe them quite out of the cleargie, not once permittyng them to be in the quyers amongste the clarkes: and suche as were not conformable, pronounced them infamous, and decreed farther, that whosoeuer would not relinquishe his lawfull wyfe, the moueable goodes of suche priestes, deacons, subdeacons, and preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, that should haue any familiaritie with their wyues, or shoulde haue any other women in their houses but such as were of consanguinitie nye vnto them, shoulde be forfayted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and delyuered vnto the Byshoppes, and that their wyues with their goodes, shoulde be vsed as adultresses.

For when he had decreed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminatly to go to Rome to complayne, his brothers reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting him that the kinges ambassadour, who should likewise go to Rome, prayed that he might go in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie with hym, he vtterly denied the same, and was vnremouable, saying, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

In whiche extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie yet he continued vnto his lyues ende. About whiche tyme, when the kyng dyd requeste hym for Thomas the younger, newe elected Archbyshop of Yorke, to respyte his profession, wherat the sayde Thomas dyd stande doubtfull: he seuerely aunswered the kinges messengers, that he would

In which discourse he maketh insinuation, that standing the tyme of the prohibition, thers were both fornicatours and adulterers, and such as commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted incest with their nygh kynsefolke, not onlye with their sisters, but also with their owne daughters: so that (saith he) though this good father, after the example of the feast maker called many to the feast, yet in no respect was there any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuous obedience geuen vnto his wordes.

So that the priestes and the prebendaries obteyned so muche with their Byshops and Archdeacons, that suche priestes as dyd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishe, dyd returne againe to their wyues, as is sayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

But thus was not the Romyshe quarrell quieted towardes the kyng: For the pope <hi>Lucius</hi> the thirde, was well contented when one <hi>Heracleus</hi> patriarch of Ierusalem came into the Realme, to moue hym to trauayle agaynst the Sarasens, and was very instant vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym to take that iorney, puttyng hym in mynde of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> oth that he once made before the two cardinalles aforesayde. But the kyng perceauyng the craftie dryft, aunswered, that he would liberally bestowe of his owne to the charge of such vyage: but he myght not depart from his owne lande, and leaue it as a pray to the aduersarie. This aunswere the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch toke very displeasauntly and angerly. The kyng yet somewhat to pacifie hym, accompanyed hym vnto the sea syde: but the more the kyng laboured to satisfie hym, the more was the Patriarch offended, speaking spytefull wordes agaynst the kyng, chargyng hym that he was vntrue to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Frenche kyng (but the more true to his owne lande) &amp; that he slewe Thomas Becket, and lastlye, that he had forsaken the protection of Christes fayth, and in his rage charged the kyng that he was worse then a Sarasen, and sayde of his chyldren, that they came of the deuyll, and to the deuyll they shoulde. But the kyng (saith the storie) kept his paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and sayde that he woulde not in any wise depart out of his owne lande. Wherevpon the Patriarche departed from the kyng in great ire, for that his Foxie deuice toke no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place.

This to be <hi>Rabanus</hi> iudgement, is so aduouched by the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour who dyd abridge <hi>Amalarius</hi> booke, wrytyng <hi>de ordine Romanae ecclesiae.</hi> Whiche <hi>Amalarius</hi> in the begynnyng of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his seconde booke, doth shewe the cause why of olde tyme emonges the Romanes the lessons were read in Greke and also in Latine, as it is at this day vsed (saith he) at Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople for two causes: One for that there were present Grecians, to whom was vnknowen the Latine tongue, and also for that the Romanes were present, to whom was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen the Greke tongue: an other cause to expresse the vnitie of both nations.

But as concernyng the sayde <hi>Rabanus,</hi> it is not vnlyke that he had receaued his iudgement from his maister <hi>Alcquine,</hi> an olde Englyshe wryter, whose auditor he was, and <hi>Alcquine</hi> agayne some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme auditor of Bede, as <hi>Tritemius</hi> testifieth. Wherevpon to consider the iust computation of yeres, it is not vncredible but that such faith towardes the sacrament which we nowe professe, was in the Realme before the conquest, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued tyl Lanfranckes dayes. And for all the examinations and executions which were done in the Englyshe Churche <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> afterwarde, by diuers Ordinaries in the Realme: yet from age to age it was reteyned, and men founde for holdyng that auncient fayth by their inquisitions, though cruelly brente, in such mercie as of late was shewed to poore christian men, women, and chyldren, wherein the order of their doyng ouer that article was alwayes vrged and charged vpon them,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whiche they woulde condempne for heretiques, though their greatest greefe was to heare of those contemned persons, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practises of their lyues and religion so dispised and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued: but thinking by laying that cause of the sacrament to their charge, it would compel al other men to beleue them to be heretiques and worthyly brent. But God doth open men eyes better to iudge, then before was knowen. God graunt for such knowledge men may be thankfull to God in their lyues and conuersations. But to returne agayne to the matter purposed, and to walke in the wyde discourse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> testimonies and examples whiche myght be brought in, to proue both bishoppes and priestes as haue ben in matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in this Realme before the conquest (the recordes whereof howe enuiously so euer haue ben suppressed, rased, &amp; defaced: yet remaine enough of that sort to proue the fact, though the scriptures fayled to be brought forth for triall of this trueth.) And to aleage the stories of other countreys, what bishoppes and priestes of great fame and learning haue ben of this state openly aduouched and commended, were a matter of greate largenesse, the numbers be so many, and therfore the matter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be but needelesse to such as haue any meane syght in sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. So that to rude and vnlearned persons, who esteeme al thinges newe which they haue no remembraunce of, or haue not ben of late dayes in vre, were not worthy any more to be written: And yet to the learned, or suche as make moste bragge of learnyng, all this to muche, especiallye yf they be suche as haue eyes to see and wyll not see, and eares &amp; wyll not heare, heartes and wyll not vnderstande: and therefore let it suffise them whose consciences be fearefull, and woulde gladly be enfourmed of the trueth, at the least waye to serue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their turne, whose cause it is, to serue God in a pure consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the lawfull vsage of his institution, not vnlawfull for them, and geue their humble thankes to God, and let enuious men barke what they can against it. For whyle the Gospell shall haue any credite or estimation, they shal neuer preuayle (after so much lyght of gods worde shewed) to beate downe this institution of God, free for all maner of persons

by the libertie of the Gospell, as all other creatures of tyme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and place be made for mans necessitie and comfort. And yf men crye out agaynst the vnhonest or vnlawfull abuse of Gods institution in any person, I wyshe with them that the abuse were by lawe and decree refourmed. But good men wyshe the libertie therof no more worthy to be taken awaye in it selfe, then they thynke reasonable to be plucked from them any other such benefite of God, erected and instituted by his diuine ordinaunce, to the represse of fylthynes &amp; other abhomination, not to be commonly rehearsed, though to commonly they haue ben vsed of some persons, who be now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the more vnexcusable, hauyng the libertie graunted, yf they defyle them selues as haue ben accustomed.

For he meant not vtterly to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester from all maryed persons a care and desire of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thynges, and to discharge them by all maner meanes to please the Lorde, and to attribute to them the onlye care of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> worldly busines, howe they shoulde please their wyues, as peculierly to them: But he spake only of that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly wont to be done, specially in such matrimonies which be contracted and spent out in worldlynes, that be ledde and entangled with the desire and loue of worldly thynges.

            <p>The affirmantes of this proposition, were almost treble so many as were the negantes. Amongst whiche affirmantes, diuers were then vnmaryed, and neuer dyd afterwarde take the libertie of maryage, as doctor Tailor the bishop, doctor Benson, doctor Redman, doctor Hugh Weston, maister Wotton. &amp;c. Of them that denyed it (notwithstandyng their superscriptions to the contrary) as fewe as they were, yet some of them toke vpon them the libertie of mariage not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> long after, as doctor Oken, maister Rayner, maister Wilso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nowe yf any man may fortune doubt of the iudgement of that notable learned man, and commonly reputed of graue iudgement, I meane doctor Redmayn doctor of diuinitie, he shall heare his very iudgement, which he vttered in the selfe same conuocation, written in a paper seuerally by his owne hande, yet extant to be shewed, &amp; subscribed with his owne name: and thus he saith.</p>
            <p>I thynke, that although the worde of God, do exhort and counsell priestes to lyue in chastitie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> out of the cumber of the fleshe, &amp; the world, that thereby they may more wholly attende to their callyng: Yet the bande of conteynyng from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, doth only lye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priestes of this Realme, by reasons of Canons and constitutions of the Churche, and not by any precept of Gods worde: as in that they should be bound by reason of any vowe, which (in as farre as my conscience is) priestes in this Churche of Englande do not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> make. I thynke that it standeth well with Gods worde, that a man which hath ben &amp; is but once maryed, beyng otherwise accordingly qualified, may be made a prieste.</p>
            <p>And I thynke, that forasmuch as Canons and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:12645:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Rules made in this behalfe, be neither vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nor euerlastyng, but vpon considerations may be altered &amp; chaunged: therefore the kinges maiestie and the hygher powers of the Churche, may vpon such reasons as shall moue them, take away the clogge of perpetuall continencie from priestes, and graunt that it may be lawfull to such as can not, or wyll not containe, to mary one wyfe. And yf she dye, then the sayde priest to mary no more, remaynyng styll in his ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>Iohn Redmayn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus this learned man, in such credite vniuersally in decidyng questions of conscience, doth in a great sort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes, condempne the vniuersal tract of the bolde assertions inspersed through D. Martins whole booke: and therfore yf any man wyll not be resolued by his iudgement to recante such his opinion, yet shall he neuer be able with all the gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stryng floryshe of that booke to discredite hym, or to wynne credite therto. Nowe further to enlarge his conclusions or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> notes with more sounde testimonie &amp; doctrine, should be but superfluous, to such specially of whom Solomon speaketh. <hi>Non recipit (quidam) verba prudentiae, nisi ea dixeris, quae versantur in corde eius.</hi>
