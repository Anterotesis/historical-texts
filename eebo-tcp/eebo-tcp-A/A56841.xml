            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SHORT RELATION
Of the Life and Death of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. FRANCIS QUARLES,
BY
URSULA QUARLES, his sorrowfull Widow.</head>
            <p>THough it be inconsistent with the duty of a Wife, to be injurious in
any respect to her Husband; yet in this my bold undertaking I fear
I shall be so to mine: which I doubt not but he would have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
if he had been living, as proceeding from love; and I hope
his friends will pardon (now he is dead) as being the last duty I can
perform to a loving Husband. Those that see with what pen his <hi>Works</hi> are
written, will say his <hi>Life</hi> deserved a more skilful Artist to set it forth: which
office though many might have been procured to undertake; and to which I
doubt not, but some would voluntarily have offered themselves, if they had
known that such a thing had been intended: yet have I (with much zeal,
though small discretion) adventured upon it my self, as being fully assured that
none can be more sensible of the losse of him, then I, though thousands might
have exprest that losse to the world with more Art and better judgement.</p>
            <p>He was a Gentleman both by birth and desert: descended of an ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and yet (which is rare in these last and worst times) he was an ornament
to his Ancestors. His Father was <hi>Iames Quarles</hi> of <hi>Rumford</hi> Esquire, Clerk
of the Green-cloth, and Purveior of the Navie to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
brother to Sir <hi>Robert Quarles.</hi> His education was sutable to his birth; first,
at schoole in the Country, where his School-fellows will say, he surpassed all
his equals; afterward at <hi>Christs Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where how he profited,
I am not able to judge, but am fully assured by men of much learning and
judgement, that his <hi>Works</hi> in very many places doe sufficiently testifie more
then ordinary fruits of his Vniversity studies. Last of all, he was transplanted
from thence to <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> where for some years he studied the <hi>Laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
not so much out of desire to benefit himself thereby, as his friends and
neighbours, (shewing therein his continuall inclination to peace) by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
suits and differences amongst them.</p>
            <p>After he came to maturity, he was not desirous to put himself into the world,
otherwise he might have had greater preferments then he had: He was neither
so unfit for Court preferment, nor so ill beloved there, but that he might have
raised his fortunes thereby, if he had had any inclination that way. But his
mind was chiefly set upon his devotion and study: yet not altogether so much,
but that he faithfully discharged the place of <hi>Cup-bearer</hi> to the Queen of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
and the office of <hi>Secretary</hi> to the Reverend and learned Lord Primate of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> that now is; and of <hi>Chronologer</hi> to the famous City of <hi>London;</hi> which
place he held to his death, and would have given that City (and the world) a
<pb facs="tcp:64884:3"/>
testimony that he was their faithfull servant therein, if it had pleased God to
blesse him with life to perfect what he had begun. He was the Husband of
one Wife, by whom he had eighteen children; and how faithful and loving he
was, my pen and their tears are not able to expresse.</p>
            <p>In all his duties to God and man, he was conscionable and orderly: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
God and Religion to the first place in his thoughts, his King &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to the second, his Family and Studies he reserved to the last: As for God,
he was frequent in his devotions and prayers to him, and almost constant in
reading or meditating on his holy Word, as his <hi>Divine Fancies</hi> and other parts
of his <hi>Works</hi> will sufficiently testifie. For his Religion, he was a true son of
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> an even Protestant, not in the least degree biassed to
this hand of superstition, or that of schisme, though both those Factions were
ready to cry him down for his inclination to the contrary. His love to his
King and Country in these late unhappy times of distraction, was manifest, in
that he used his pen, and powred out his continuall prayers and tears to quench
this miserable fire of dissention, while too many others added daily fewell unto
it. And for his family, his care was very great over that, even then, when his
occasions caused his absence from it. And when he was at home his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to us to continue in virtue and godly life, were so pious and frequent; his
admonitions so grave and piercing; his reprehensions so mild and gentle, and
(above all) his own example in every religious and morall duty, so constant
and manifest, that his equall may be desired, but can hardly be met withall.</p>
            <p>Neither was his good example of a godly life contained only with<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n his own
Family: others as well as we, have (or at least might have) made good use of
it. For he was not addicted to any notorious vice whatsoever: He was courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and affable to all; moderate and discreet in all his actions: And though it
be too frequent a fault (as we see by experience) in Gentlemen whose disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
incline them to the study of Poetry, to be loose and debauch'd in their
lives and conversations; yet was it very far from him: Their delight could not
be greater in the Tavern, then his was in his Study; to which he devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
late and early, usually by three a clock in the morning. The fruits thereof
are best tasted by those, who have most perused his <hi>Works,</hi> and therefore I shall
be silent in that particular. For though it had been necessary in another to have
spoken somewh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of his <hi>writings;</hi> yet I hope it will not be expected from me,
seeing that neither the judgement of my Sex can be thought competent, nor
(if it were) would the nearnesse of my relation to him suffer me to praise that,
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> commendations whereof from others, I have often blushed.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore rather desire le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve to speak a word or two concerning the
blessed end of my dear Husband, which was every way answerable to his godly
life; or rather (indeed) surpassed it. For as gold is purified in the fire, so
were all his Christian virtues more refined and remarkable during the time of
his sicknesse.</p>
            <p>His patience was wonderfull, insomuch as he would confesse no pain, even
then when <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll his friends perceived his disease to be mortall; but still rendred
thanks to God for his speciall love to him, <hi>in taking him into his own hands to
chastise, while others were exposed to the fury of their enemies, the power of pistols,
and the trampling of horses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64884:3"/>He exprest great sorrow for his sins, and when it was told him, that his
friends conceived he did thereby much harm to himself: he answered, <hi>They
were not his friends, that would not give him leave to be penitent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Exhortations to his friends that came to visit him were most divine;
wishing them <hi>to have a care of the expence of their time, and every day to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to an accompt, that so when they come to their bed of sicknesse, they might lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it with a rejoycing heart.</hi> And doubtlesse such an one was his: Insomuch as
he thanked God, that whereas he might have justly expected, that <hi>his conscience
should look him in the face like a Lyon, it rather looked upon him like a Lamb:</hi> and
that <hi>God had forgiven him his sins, and that night sealed him his pardon:</hi> And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other heavenly expressions to the like effect. I might here adde what blessed
advice he gave to me in particular, <hi>still to trust in God, whose promise is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the Widow and Fatherlesse, &amp;c.</hi> but this is already imprinted in my
heart; and therefore I shall not need here again to insert it.</p>
            <p>His charity was extraordinary, in freely forgiving his greatest enemies, even
those who were the cause of his sicknesse, and by consequence of his death.
For, whereas a Petition full of unjust aspersions, was preferred against him by
eight men, (whereof he knew not any two, nor they him, save only by sight)
the first news of it struck him so to the heart, that he never recovered it, but
said plainly, <hi>it would be his death.</hi> And when his friends (to comfort him) told
him that Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> (the chief promoter thereof) was called to an accompt for it,
and would go neer to be punished; his answer was, <hi>God forbid, I seek not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
I freely forgive him, and the rest; onely I desire to be vindicated from their
unjust aspersions; especially.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide Psal. 31. ver. 7. &amp; 20.</hi> I have hated them that hold of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and my trust hath been in the Lord.</note> [that for ought they know I may be a Papist] <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
I never spake word to any of them in my life.</hi> Which imputation, how slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
it was, may e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ge in his greatest extremity,
wherein his discretion may (perhaps) be taxed by some, but his Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be questioned by any. For, a very able Doctor of the Romish Religion,
being sent unto him by a friend, he would not take what he had prescribed, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because he was a Papist.</p>
            <p>These were the remarkable passages in him during his sicknesse:<note place="margin">Let the lying lips be put to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: which cruelly, disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully speak against the righteous.</note> The rest of
the time he spent in Contemplation of God, and meditating upon his Word;
especially upon Christs sufferings, and what a benefit those have, that by
faith could lay hold on him, and what vertue there was in the least drop
of his precious blood: intermingling here and there many devout prayers and
ejaculations; which continued with him as long as his speech: and after,
as we could perceive by some imperfect expressions. At which time a friend
of his exhorting him to apply himself to finish his course here, and prepare
himself for the world to come; he spake in Latin to this effect (as I am told)
<hi>O dulcis Salvator mundi, sint tua ultima verba in Cruce, mea ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
verba in luce: In manus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum.
Et quae ore meo fari non possint, ab animo &amp; corde sint à te te accepta.
O sweet Saviour of the world, let thy last words upon the Crosse, be my last words in
this world: Into thy hands Lord I commend my spirit: And what I cannot utter with
my mouth, accept from my heart and soul.</hi> Which words being uttered distinctly,

to the understanding of his friend, he fell again into his former Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Prayers; and so quietly gave up his soul to God, the eight day of
<hi>September,</hi> 1644. after he had lived two and fifty years, and lyeth buried in the
Parish Church of S. <hi>Foster, London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus departed that blessed soul, whose losse I have great reason to bewail,
and many others in time will be sensible of. But my particular comfort is in
his dying words, that <hi>God will be a Husband to the Widow:</hi> And that which
may comfort others as well as me, is (what a reverend Divine wrote to a friend
concerning his death) that <hi>our losse is gain to him, who could not live in a worse
age, nor die in a better time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here again, I humbly beg the Readers pardon. For I cannot expect
but to be censured, by some for writing thus much, and by others for writing
no more. To both which, my excuse is, my want of ability and judgement in
matters of this nature. I was more averse (indeed) from medling with the
Petition, then any other thing I have touched upon; lest (perhaps) it should be
thought to savour a little of revenge; but God is my witnesse I had no such
intention. My only aim and scope was, to fulfil the desires and commands of
my dying Husband. Who wished all his friends to take notice, and make it
known, that <hi>as be was trained up and lived in the true Protestant Religion, so in
that Religion he died.</hi>

It met me upon my return home from <hi>Sturbridge;</hi> and did work on my self and
wife, I pray God it may work kindly on us all. We have lost a true friend; and
were the losse only mine or yours, it were the lesse, but thousands have a losse in him;
yea, the Generations which shall come after will lament it. But our losse is gain to
him, (who could not live in a worse age, nor die in a better time) let us endeavour
like good Gamesters to make the best we may of this throw, cast us by the hand of
Gods good Providence, that it may likewise prove gain to us; which will be, if in case
we draw nearer unto him, and take off our hearts from all earthly hopes and comforts;
using this world as if we used it not; so shall we rejoyce as if we rejoyced not in their
using, and mourn as if we mourned not in the parting with them.—</p>

            <head>An Elegle upon the famous Poet
FRANCIS QUARLES.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>IS <hi>Quarles</hi> dead? his active spirit flown</l>
               <l>And none to lend a tear, a sigh, a groan,</l>
               <l>For the worlds losse? me thinks at least all eyes</l>
               <l>(Since tongues can not) should weep large Elegies.</l>
               <l>Expect no Muses; for they at his death</l>
               <l>Compassionate, lost their Poetique breath.</l>
               <l>Expect no marble Tombe; he's above fate;</l>
               <l>His name (if Learning live) shall know no date:</l>
               <l>His issue shall survive posterity,</l>
               <l>This age and th' next, and so t'eternity.</l>
               <l>Peruse his <hi>Phansies,</hi> and his <hi>Emblems</hi> wrapt;</l>
               <l>And see <hi>S. Paul</hi> into the third heav'ns rapt:</l>
               <l>Or else some Cherubim sent down from thence</l>
               <l>T'unfold heav'ns Mysteries in heav'ns Eloquence.</l>
               <l>A Poet-saint he was, in him each line</l>
               <l>Speakes out at large rare Poet, choyce Divine.</l>
               <l>His message done, he flyes unto his Maker,</l>
               <l>Of what he told us here, to be partaker.</l>
               <l>His prison'd soul was so harmonious here;</l>
               <l>Now loose, what Musick, think you, makes she there!</l>
               <l>She wept, then sung; now sung, 'gaine wept in rime:</l>
               <l>Her Rests now know no stop, her joy no time.</l>
               <l>Her Phansy Vision is, she now doth live</l>
               <l>With Angels food, knowledge intuitive.</l>
               <l>By Emblems dark to spell the Deity</l>
               <l>She taught before, now sees Divinity.</l>
               <l>But stay my Muse: the clouds doe interpose</l>
               <l>Twixt thee and her; 'tis better for thee close,</l>
               <l>Then pierce, or peep too farre. Phoebus is set;</l>
               <l>Th'hast pay'd thy tribute light, thy tribute heat,</l>
               <l>Sigh out the rest: or wouldst thou to him go,</l>
               <l>Thy Love, thy Life? Go be entombed too.</l>
