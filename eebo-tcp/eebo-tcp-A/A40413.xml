            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVer ſince it ſeemed good to the <hi>Almighty</hi> to permit
the <hi>pure Evangelical Doctrine</hi> to be profeſt in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> abroad, eſpecially <hi>the
Reformed ones,</hi> have at all times, in their greateſt
<hi>Adverſities</hi> and <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> rhere met with a ſignal <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi>
and <hi>aſſiſtance;</hi> which is manifeſt to the whole <hi>world,</hi>
and both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Netherlandiſh Nations,</hi> do moſt
gratefully acknowledge, and cannot ſuſſiciently praiſe for
the ſame. Wherefore being fallen into theſe infortunate
times, wherein the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe</hi> (as well in relation to
the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> as <hi>Temporal</hi> affairs) ſeems not only to be
<hi>diſturbed,</hi> but even <hi>ſubverted</hi> in theſe parts, by the <hi>Proteſtant
Profeſſors</hi> themſelves. And pondering upon the remedies
neceſſary towards the preventing of ſuch <hi>eminent Evils;</hi>
We could not chuſe but reflect upon <hi>your Highneſs,</hi> whoſe
<hi>Father of glorious Memory,</hi> having imparted unto us by his
<hi>Publike Miniſter,</hi> the ſhare he bore, joyntly with us, in the
concernments of the <hi>Proteſtant Profeſſors, and Churches,</hi> not
doubting but your <hi>Highneſs</hi> retains the ſame inclinations and
thoughts, We have the more confidently adventured, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
theſe <hi>Publike Calamities,</hi> to treat with you theron, and as
well joyntly by the Envoy, which we have deſigned towards
your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> as by theſe our Letters, to impart our minde
unto you, leſt by the retardment of the one or the other,
the <hi>Pubilke good</hi> might be prejudiced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Highneſs</hi> cannot be ignorant, that this preſent <hi>King
of Sweden</hi> entred upon a war, ſome 3 years ſince, againſt the
Polanders; with a pretence, and under a colour (amongſt
other things) to promote the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe</hi> in thoſe parts;
though the ſucceſs thereof proved no other, ſave <hi>The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of ſome hundreds of Proteſtant Churhes into aſhes; The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44877:3"/>
deſtroying of an infinite number of Proteſtant Families; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſing
and diſſolving of ſeveral Proteſtant Congregations, and
the expoſing of the Profeſſors of the Divine Goſpel Truths, to all
kinde of Ignominie and Infamie. Inſomuch, as ſince the memory
of man, the Proteſtant concernments in thoſe parts, never met
with a greater deſtruction, and deſolation; no not under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtical
Governments, as under that pretended Patron, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
of the Proteſtant Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither did theſe <hi>Evils</hi> terminate within the <hi>Confines</hi> of
<hi>Poland;</hi> but the aforeſaid <hi>King,</hi> did (among others) involve
the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> in the like Calamities, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>that moſt zealous Prince for the true Proteſtant Cauſe,</hi> unto
ſuch a paſs, as that he was in danger to loſe his whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as well as his good Subjects, their Livelyhoods, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances,
for the Liberty of their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>And that it may more evidently appear, t<hi>he ſaid King
aims not et Heaven, but the World, coveting to have the Dominion
of the Land, as well as to Lord it at Sea; He did finally ſet upon
the King of Denmark, contrary to the Faith which was plighted,
and the Peace which was made by the Interpoſition, Endeavours,
and Authority of your Highneſs's Father,</hi> without any forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Declaration, or Warning; <hi>a thing which is obſerved
even amongst the Heathens</hi>; aſſailing <hi>a Prince who is a ſtrict
Profeſſor and obſerver of the Proteſtant Faith,</hi> at ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exſpected
time, when he was deprived of all his <hi>Guarriſons</hi>
and <hi>ſtrong Holds,</hi> and did not in the leaſt ſuſpect, much leſs
dream of ſuch a kinde of proceeding, by reaſon of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
proceeding peace, procured by the endeavours of
ſo many Friends, and at ſo great a diſadvantage to the <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner the <hi>Duke of Curland,</hi> did ſadly experiment
the effects of theſe like proceedings; <hi>One who is a Lutheran,</hi>
of the ſame <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> which the <hi>King of Sweden</hi> profeſſeth,
and by his <hi>ſolemn Oath,</hi> will only tollerate in his Dominions;
Yet nevertheleſs after the ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> had conferred ſo great
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44877:3"/>
Benefits on the <hi>Swedes,</hi> as that he thereby became <hi>ſuſpected
to his Lord, the King of Poland;</hi> even after he had made his
<hi>Capitulations for his Neutrality with them,</hi> he was by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of example, and by a ſtratagem caſt out of his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and together with his moſt <hi>Illuſtrious Lady Dutcheſs,</hi>
ann ſeven Children, carried away <hi>Captives to Riga.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as he cannot by the <hi>Holy Writ</hi> warrant the not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of thoſe of his <hi>own Profeſſion,</hi> when he ſees an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to ſeize their Lands and Goods; in like manner his
Zeal, and Vehemency moves him, to impoſe Laws on the
<hi>Proteſtant Reformed Profeſſors,</hi> in matters of their belief, and
to force their Conſciences in Divine concernments, by his
Proceedings againſt them; an evident Teſtimony whereof is
moſt apparent at <hi>Elbing,</hi> wherein we the rather inſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it may beſt be known in <hi>England;</hi> in which place thoſe
of the <hi>Reformed profeſſion,</hi> at their being under a <hi>Papiſt King,</hi>
did enjoy the <hi>free exerciſe of their Religion;</hi> But at preſent,
the <hi>Lutheran Supraviſor,</hi> being placed there as a wrack to
the Conſciences of thoſe who are minded to take <hi>the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi>
upon themſelues, doth enforce them by an unheard of
example, <hi>to approve his Confeſſion, and to obey him in matters
of Religion;</hi> depriving likewiſe the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> (who
are all for the moſt part of the <hi>Reformed profeſſion)</hi> of the
Right and Priviledg which is due to them in the like Caſes;
eſpecially in the ordaining of <hi>Miniſters:</hi> Not permitting
<hi>the Adminiſtration of the Communion, according to the Form of
the Reformed Proteſtant Churches, ſave unto ſtrangers of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Nation, at the requeſt of the Engliſh Reſident.</hi> Moreover
his vehemency is ſo great againſt the reſt of the <hi>Reformed
profeſſors,</hi> as that to the prejudice of Men, and Gods glory,
<hi>The pſalms of David, which for ſeveral years were ſung in their
Churches</hi> (and ought not only to be free unto, but enjoyned
all Men) <hi>are totally expunged out of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things being maturely conſidered; we cannot be
induced to believe, that your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> (as the Swedes do
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44877:4"/>
boaſt will afford them relief, and aſſiſt them to carry on
their unlawful deſignes, ſince they abound and proceed with
ſo much violence, and injuſtice; converting their own
Means, and Forces, and the aſſiſtances which they receive
from others, <hi>to the prejudice, Ruine, and utter detriment of the
Church; and to the diſturbing of the publike peace in all parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as we have been informed, theſe implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Proteſtant Religion, make uſe of the pretence
of Religion, and urge, that their deſigne is againſt the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi>
and chiefly againſt the <hi>Houſe of Auſtria,</hi> who ſhould
have an intent to maſter the <hi>Ports</hi> of the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> as they
moſt malitiouſly give out; and do even <hi>ſlander us,</hi> in that
<hi>we ſhould have made a League with the Catholikes againſt the
Proteſtants.</hi> But as all men know, the War is waged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Danes</hi> and the <hi>Swedes, both of them, of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Profeſſion;</hi> and if the Emperor will not permit the
Swedes to deprive the King of Denmark, and himſelf of
<hi>Holſtein,</hi> (which is an unqueſtionable part of the <hi>German
Empire,</hi> and whereof he is the Supream Lord) but by the
Forces which he hath ſent doth hinder the ſame, doth he
any thing thereby, ſave what belongs to a good, pious, and
Chriſtian Prince? and ſhould he omit the ſame, would he
not be guilty of deſerting the defence of his Territories, and
the neglect of that duty which is committed to him by God?
And if we, as a Member, do aſſiſt him the <hi>Head,</hi> herein, in
each others defence, do we any thing hereby but our duty?
and might we not be accuſed of deſerting our Countreys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
ſhould we not joyn therein?</p>
            <p>Theſe, and no other, are the <hi>Austrian,</hi> and our Intentions,
and Reſolutions; and if happily there chance to be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſſentions between the <hi>Houſe of Auſtria,</hi> and other
Kings, States, and Commonwealths, they relate not at all
to this buſineſs; nor do the like contentions, which others
may have with the <hi>Houſe of Auſtria,</hi> concern the <hi>Roman
Empire,</hi> and its <hi>Chief:</hi> Nor is it juſt that any obſtacles ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44877:4"/>
be made, on this account, as <hi>Impediments</hi> to theſe ſo pious,
honeſt, and neceſſary Endeavours. For it is ſo far from the
Intentions of his <hi>Imperial Majeſty,</hi> to deprive any one of
their Ports, or Havens, as that he doth not ſo much as lay
claim to the leaſt part of any of them; He hath ſent his
Forces to reſtore unto the right owners, that which belongs
unto them; not to bereave them of their goods, or poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<hi>An inſtance whereof may appear by the Iſle of Alſen, not
ſo ſoon taken from the Swedes, as reſtored to the King of Denmark,
its true Lord and owner; that he might take the Defence thereof
upon himſelf, that ſo thoſe commodious Ports and Haveus, which
are ſo advantagiouſly ſeated on the Baltick Sea; might only be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred,
and defended by Daniſh Guarriſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what needs there any further conteſt of words here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
come we to the matter it ſelf; <hi>Let the King of Sweden
therefore reſtore that which he hath unjuſtly and violently taken;
Let him make amends for the Loſſes which we and others have
ſuſtained by his means: Let him give ſecurity that he will not
henceforth invade others, as he hath lately done the Poles, the
Danes, and the Curlander:</hi> and we ſhall in like manner take
care, that none of the Emperors, or of the aſſociated Forces
ſhall at any time be brought into the Field, or made uſe of
againſt any of the Neghbouring, or other ports whatſoever.
Nor ſhall they need to fear the leaſt obſtruction in the Trade
from theſe parts; ſince it concerns us chiefly, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
be free, incouraged, and augmented; Neither do we
ſee how all this can be compaſſed by any ſpeedier means,
ſave, <hi>That all things be reſtored to the ſame ſtate and condition as
they were before the beginning of all theſe Daniſh troubles;</hi> which
is the thing we ſhall mainly endeavour to compaſſe.</p>
            <p>But with what impudence can the <hi>Swedes</hi> blemiſh us
for having entred into a League with the Catholikes? ſince

them alſo of the like Heretical abominations, which

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44877:5"/>
               <hi>Evangelical profeſſion</hi> can thoſe boaſt of, who whilſt they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh

imaginable againſt the ſaid <hi>proteſtant Churches,</hi> and the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

appropriate to themſelves, who, both with Fire and Sword,
have proſecuted, if not well nigh ſubverted, both <hi>Poland,
Denmark,</hi> and one of the not leaſt contemptibleſt parts of
<hi>Germany?</hi> and who, whilſt they condemn thoſe good works,
which the Papiſts account requiſite towards the attaining
unto Salvation; <hi>do live and act in ſuch a manner, as if Heaven
and eternal Glory were only to be acquir'd by ſinning, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of horrid Actions?</hi> Moreover, what ſhare can they
pretend unto the <hi>Name of Chriſtians,</hi> who commit thoſe
things, whereby the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> (who are moſt
careful in keeping and obſerving their promiſes) may now,
as well as formerly, alleadge, to the great diſhonor of the
