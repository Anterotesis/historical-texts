         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the end that the diuersitie of their musick might be a lesson to imitate the one and
leaue the other, and that comparison might make the difference. There is nothing so
difficult as to paralel Princes; if there be any conformitie in their fortunes, it is found
in their vertues, if they haue attained to one end, it hath not been by the same course,
and therefore they say there are a hundreth yeares required to breed a great Prince
or a great Captaine. <hi>Lewis</hi> hath carried, and <hi>Henry</hi> doth yet carry the glorious
Title of the most renowned and magnanimous Princes of their ages: but they haue
not purchased it by the selfe same meanes, the difference hath beene great in their
humours, and in their kinde of gouernement: Both had one kinde of beginning, the
one of the house of Valois, the other of that of Bourbon, two branches of S. <hi>Lewis.</hi>
There was some conformitie in their first fortunes; being both retired from Court,
and both instructed in patience in the schoole of necessitie: The beginning of their
reignes had some resemblance, for both had seene a great and mighty faction raised
against them, vnder two goodly pretexts, the one of the Common-weale, the other of
Religion: both haue been in paine to expell forraine enemies, to pacifie domestique, and
to diuide their humors; but what the one hath done by policie and force, the other
hath effected by the iustnes of his armes, and the mildnes of his clemencie. Both were
troubled to moderate those spirits, which had yet a feeling of ciuill diuisions: they
haue tried the infidelitie of their seruants, and haue made themselues to bee feared
and redoubted; but the one hath maintained the respect of his Maiestie by feare and
seueritie, and the other by wisedome and loue. The raigne of the one was a Sea of

<hi>Lewis</hi> medled with all things and would see and know all; <hi>Henry</hi> is a
Prince of all howers and for all affaires: <hi>Lewis</hi> feared the fat of his people, <hi>Henry</hi>
beleeues that the felicitie of the subiect is the glory of the Prince. <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth

makes choise of the best wits to restore the exercises, peoples the Colledges, and labors

blamed for the little care he had in the breeding, and institution of his son: <hi>Henry</hi>

Dauphin, should be seconded with good instruction, hath committed the care to a
Noble-man, which abounds in wisedome, generositie, experience and fidelitie for the
greatnes of that charge. Hee doth alwaies hold the minde of this Prince elleuated to
things worthy of his birth and courage. France is bound vnto the King, who could
make so good a choice; the election proues the dignitie of the person chosen, makes the
excellencie of the choosers iudgement to bee seene, and shewes that heauen hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired

yonger yeeres to be instructed in learning, by the diligence of a great and excellent
wit, who carefully and indiciously doth shew him vvhat he should know, and vvhat he
should be ignorant of: he giues him the whole vvorld for a lesson; for companions, the
study of Emperors and Kings; for a table, the image of glory; for Philosophy, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> had more care then his predecessors to fortefie his frontiers, and forts. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
hath made great workes for the beautifying of his royall houses, and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
of his people he makes his forts vnexpugnable, and hath freed his affaires
from the outrages and violence of necessitie. <hi>Lewis</hi> was inconstant in his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and did sometime impaire them by change. <hi>Henry</hi> in his greatest affaires saies
nothing but vvhat he does, and doth nothing without premeditation, calling vppon
God in his thoughts. That vvhich is framed in his minde remaines firme. He hath
so much foresight as he preuents all impediments, and hath so great power as nothing
is impossible vnto him. <hi>Lewis</hi> loued a country ruined rather then lost, <hi>Henry,</hi> giuen
from heauen for the generall good of the earth, hath saued, enricht and preserued
the townes, which by the iustice of his armes he might haue spoiled and ruined. <hi>Lewis</hi>
neuer left offences vnpunished, <hi>Henry</hi> hath lost no part of his memory but iniuries.
<hi>Lewis</hi> tooke a delight to cut off the heads of poppy and eares of corne which doe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top
the rest, the torrent of his iustice hath often carried away the innocent with the
guiltie. <hi>Henry</hi> hath so vsed his clemencie towards his greatest enemies, as if the
Iustice of God should demand of him the number, he would easily giue him an account.
<hi>Lewis</hi> left France so weake, so ruinous and so deiected, as it had nothing remaining
but the tongue to complaine: <hi>Henry</hi> hath chased ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de, idlenes and pouerty out of
France, and from the necessitie of his affaires: and to conclude the paralel, there is
not any nation which doth not reuerence the name, admire the fortune, extoll the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
enuie the triumphs, sing or vveepe for the victories, loue the gouernment, and
feare and redoubt the power of this great and incomparable Prince.</p>
            <p>This Historie doth truely show the diuersitie of the two portraits, and giues the
King an incredible content, to see that the raigne of a great, mighty, redouted; and
wise King, may not enter into comparion with his, by the difference which hee hath
set in the order of his treasure, in the number of his forces, in the force of his armes,
in the fortification of his frontiers, in the structures of his great buildings, and in the
restablishment of the publike safety and felicitie. As for the other obiection which I
haue made as done, it is true that <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> hath related the life of this
Prince so exactly and iudiciously, as if <hi>Statius,</hi> who hath written the life of <hi>Achilles</hi>
after <hi>Homer,</hi> did not maintaine my designe by his example, I should yeeld my selfe
vanquished of indiscretion and presumption.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Iudgement must be the poulder of separation to reduce euery thing to his element,
and will show that he hath not so reapt his field, but he hath left some eares to gather:
In like manner I doe not thinke that I haue spoken all things so fully, and cleerely, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, but there will yet remaine something to exercise others after me. The hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is commended that hunts and takes, but he is not blamed if hee hath not taken
all: We must yeeld something to the curiositie and diligence of others. He teacheth
not well that teacheth all. Another spirit will happily finde somethings wherewith
to please himselfe in this goodly ample field of the life of this Prince. I confesse I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

drawne the principall pieces of this building from <hi>Philip de Commines,</hi> but the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the work, the Architecture, and the Ornaments are mine owne. He could not
speake, of his owne knowledge, of the affaires of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth but from the yeare,
1472. when as he left the D. of Bourgundy to serue him; but this History speaketh of
the infancy of this Prince, of his retreat into Flanders, and of all that had happened
memorable throughout the world, during the three and twenty yeeres of his raigne,
and, besides many manuscripts, I haue seene the forraine Histories of those times.</p>
            <p>The ten bookes are extended vpon that which concernes his life, and the eleuenth
vpon the obseruation of that which was done in those times, and of that which is done
now, to show that <hi>Lewis</hi> hath been as much inferiour to <hi>Henry,</hi> as he was held superior
to other Kings. If all things haue not bin exactly and curiously digested, if in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there be found defects, it sufficeth to say that the worke hath been made following
the Court, and printed in my absence: To conclude, mens mindes should not be more
difficult to please then the Gods of the ancients; Hee that had no milke gaue them wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and he that found no wine offered milke, salt for incense, leaues and flowers for
fruits, and fruits for beasts. He that giues what he hath, and doth what he can, is
bound to no more. They that content not themselues with that which seemes good,
trouble themselues to seeke for better. Whatsoeuer happen, all these disgraces shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

            <head>AN ELOGIE OF LEWIS THE
eleuenth French King.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>EWIS</hi> of Valois only like vnto him-selfe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to all other Kings, was borne at Bourges, and
presented at the font by <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Alancon; he
past his infancy in the ruines &amp; miseries of France,
and the most sensible afflictions of his father, to
whom there was a part of the Crowne remaining.
At eleuen yeares the greatest of the Realme, abusing the innocency of
his first age, to couer their discontentment and ambition, made him
the head of a faction, which was so vniust, vnnaturall &amp; odious vnto
the French, as it was presently abandoned euen by them that were
the Authors, and lasted but nine months. At fourteene yeares hee
was married to the Princesse of Scotland, at fifteene Generall of a
royall Army into Normandy and Languedoc: At twenty one hee
put all Germany in alarum, tooke Mombeliart, besieged Basill, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
sixe thousand Swisses &amp; ouer-run Alsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ia. The bayes of this
triumph were all couered with bloud, and soone after with tears, by
the death of the Princesse of Scotland his wife.</p>
            <p>The difficuly which hee felt to submit his yong and boyling hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
to the temper of reason, and his will to that of his father, drew
him from the Court, and intertained him some yeares in Dauphine,
whereas he married <hi>Charlotte</hi> of Sauoy, and made warre against the
Duke of Sauoy his father in law, drawing vnto his seruice some by
promises, others by fauour and presents, but most of all by rigour &amp;
seuerity, oppressing his subiects of Dauphine with vnknowne char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
so as the cyment of his designes was tempered with bloud, sweat
&amp; teares. The King, who was not insensible of Complaints, and wept
by his subiects teares, made it knowne that he did loue his estate bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then his sonne. He came into Dauphine, and at the first glance of
his eyes he dispersed the designes of such as would trouble the order
of nature and the Lawes of the Realme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis,</hi> desiring rather to trust the enemies of his house then his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
bounty, retires to Bruxelles to Duke <hi>Phillip,</hi> wheras he liued six
yeares with <hi>Charlotte</hi> of Sauoy his wife, and there receiued the first
blessing of his marriage, by the birth of his sonne <hi>Ioachim</hi> of Valois,
who dyed presently. All this time taught him a lesson of patience,
being forced to make a vertue of necessity, learning to be wise in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
<pb facs="tcp:14645:6"/>
and constant in aduersity. In the end <hi>Charles</hi> gaue him place
and left him the Realme vnited vnder the obedience of one, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
being expelled, and hauing nothing remaining vnto them but
<hi>Calis.</hi> All the forces of this powerfull house of Bourgondy did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
him vntill hee had the Crowne set vpon his head, which
he tooke at Rhemes. Paris receiued him as it were in triumph, and all
France seemed to reuiue againe at the rising of this Starre.</p>
            <p>The contempt of Princes of the bloud, &amp; the change of officers, the
seueritie in searching out things past, with the oppression of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
were the cause of a league which was made against him betwixt
the Duke of Berry his brother, and the dukes of Burgundy, Brittany,
Calabria, and Bourbon, with the greatest of the realme. A powerfull
and famous faction, which abused the simple, made the wicked mad,
and thrust good men into despaire. The bad successe of the Battell of
Montlehery was not able to shake the constancy and fidelitie of the
subiect. Paris, whose motions had alwaies caused the rest of France
to wauer, held firme, and this great storme fel, and was dispersed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her wals. The greatest Cities of the realme, and the chiefe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued constant in their duties, &amp; the interest of priuat men
being contented, the pursute of the publike good was staied. These ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
being vnbound, <hi>Lewis</hi> had good meanes to breake them. The
D. of Normandy is forced to quit Roan, &amp; the D. of Brittaine auoids
the storme by his submission. The duke of Burgundy is troubled with
the mutinies of his subiects, who desirous of innouations &amp; change
did more affect the Earle of Charolois then the Duke of Bourgundy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> to be reuenged kindles a fire in his estate, and stirs vp them of
Liege, yet making shew that he desired nothing more then the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of the treaty of Conflans: relying too much vpon his wit and
forces, he ingaged himselfe indiscreetly in Peronne, where the Castle
was in show his lodging, and in effect his prison; he saw himselfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to arme against his friends, &amp; to receiue a law from him to whom
he thought to giue it. The assembly of the estates at Tours iudge of
the iniury of his promises, and cannot yeeld that Normandy (one of
the goodliest flowers of the crowne of France) should be dismembred:
they declare war against the D. of Bourgundy. The King takes the
towne of S. Quintin, then Amiens, and seeing that the Duke of
Burgundy, in the desolation of his affaires, was prest to giue his
daughter in marriage to the Duke of Guienne, he doth not in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
imbrace the opportunitie, but is content to haue amazed his
<pb facs="tcp:14645:6"/>
enemy, and grants him a truce, during the which he sees, as from the
shore, that cruell tempest of England which ouerthrew the house of
Lancaster, whom he fauoured, &amp; assured the Scepter in that of Yorke,
succoured and supported by the D. of Burgundy. The Duke of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennes
death brake the truce and hopes of peace, and brought all them
to the brinke of death and despaire which had followed his fortune,
who were reduced to such misery, as then the most miserable, hearing
the discourse, found therein consolation and amazement. Many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
were ouerthrowne, and that rich and famous house of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnac
was full of strange tragedies and reuolutions. The warre,
furiously inhumane, began againe, and the Duke of Bourgundy
armed to reuenge his death vpon innocents. The towne of Nesle
saw heapes of dead carkasses in her streets, and streames of bloud
in her Churches: Beauuais stayed the torrent of his fury, and diuerted
it vpon Normandy.</p>
            <p>The D. of Brittany, although he were gouerned by another head,
considering the danger wherein hee was, submitted himselfe to the
stronger, and seeing the K. at Angiers with an army of 50000. men
came vnto him to demand a peace. The King of Sicily was dispos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est
of his country of Anjou, beeing forced to retire into Prouence with
griefe to suruiue his Son <hi>Iohn</hi> D. of Calabria &amp; Lorraine, &amp; <hi>Nicholas
Marques</hi> of Ponte his grand-child. Hee doth represent the estate of his
age &amp; house in the deuice which he carried of an old stock which had
no greene sprout to make it liue, it was <hi>Rene</hi> D. of Lorraine, Son to <hi>Yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
of Anjou his daughter. The Constable, who would diuide his
heart in two to nourish &amp; entertaine the warre, thrust the duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy
into fury &amp; the King into distrust of him, &amp; hauing left the path
of moderation &amp; wisedome, he came vnto the king by that of pride &amp;
distrust, refusing to represent himselfe vnto his maiesty but armed, nor
to speake vnto him but by a barre, &amp; vpon a causey well garded with
soldiers.</p>
            <p>The D. of Burgondy not able to liue idly during this Truce seekes
for worke in Germany, passeth to Treues, propounds to change his
dukes Crowne for a Kings, &amp; is offended with the Emperor for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it: He besiegeth Nuze, and seeing that the crosses, which he had
in his affaires proceeded onely from the King, he perswades the K. of
England to passe the seas, to renew the pretensions of his predecessors,
and to make a fatall combustion of all France. But <hi>Lewis</hi> diuerts this
storme, and makes a bridge of gold for this King to repasse the sea, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:14645:7"/>
him home as wel content with peace as he was come resolute to
war. The King reapt both honor &amp; profit, and by his foresight disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the great designes which were laid vnder fauor of this army,
and although it had diuers pretexts, as diuers branches of the same
stock of sedition and ambition, they were all dangerous; all the kinds
of this poison were mortall.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Bourgundy was forced to accept a peace of the king,
against whom he had proclaimed warre: The coale, which entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the fire of discord was quenched, and this head that made the
windes to blow; which caused the quiet of France to tremble, was
cut off at the Greue.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Bourgundy, to reuenge a light iniury done vnto the
Earle of Romond, vndertakes a great warre against the Sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>les, which
by the vnfortunate euent of three battels, made him to loose his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
at Granson; his reputation, his forces and his hopes at Morat;
and at Nancy his life, with a part of his estate. The King reapt the
fruit of this warre, hauing fauoured and supported the Duke of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
against the great designes of this Conqueror. Hee seased vpon
both Burgundies, and vpon a part of Artois, and had forced the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
<hi>Maximilian</hi> to leaue the low countries, and to leade the Princesse
his wife into Germany, with repentance of his mariage, if the battell
of <hi>Guinegaste</hi> had not troubled the face of his affaires, and changed
the designes of warre into resolutions of peace, which was confirmed
by the marriage of <hi>Charles</hi> Dauphin of France with <hi>Margaret</hi> of
Austria.</p>
            <p>Age, which neuer comes alone, suffers not the King to vndertake
any long and difficult conque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and binds him to thinke vpon the
meanes to leaue his crowne peaceably vnto his Sonne, as it was rich,
mighty, and more assured then hee had receiued it from his father,
hauing beautified it with many goodly flowers, as <hi>Burgundy, Anjou,
Barre, Prouence,</hi> and the recouerie of the Townes in <hi>Picardy,</hi> and of
some in <hi>Artois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being prest with troubles of mind as much as with the languishing
of the body, and reduced to an estate more lamentable then lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in the which he could not liue, &amp; would not dye: he straue foure
whole yeares against the force of an incurable disease, and repulst
by strange meanes the approches of death, to retaine life, which was
but too long for his miseries, and infirmities, as it had beene too short
for his designes and hopes. He was forced to yeeld himselfe to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
<pb facs="tcp:14645:7"/>
the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day of August 1483. the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. yeare of his raigne, and
of his age the sixtith. He carried nothing from the place which hee
left, but the proud title to haue freed the Kings of France from subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or wardship, capable to command, not a Realme only, but the
whole world. He was interred at our Lady of <hi>Clery,</hi> hauing obtained
from Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth an excommunication against all such as
would lay his body in any other tombe then in that which hee had
built for himselfe, and <hi>Charlotte</hi> of Sauoy his wife. He did often visit
this last abode, and did lye in it so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>metimes, that by the meditation of
death, he might descend liuing into the graue.</p>
            <p>The triumphant Chariot of the prosperities of his life was drawn
by Wisdome, Iustice, Liberality and Reputation; wisdome made him
victorious ouer his enemies, Iudge of the controuersie betwixt the
Crownes of Castile, and Nauarre: Protector of the liberty of the
Common-weales of Italy: Arbitrator of the peace betwixt Rome and
Florence, and then betwixt Rome and Venice, He added the county
of Prouence to the Crowne: Hee vndertooke strange impossible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes.
Iustice, alwayes in heat by his extreame seuerity, did more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
put the sword of execution into his hand, then the ballance of
due consideration: hee caused many great men to feele his rigour
whose processe he began by the execution.</p>
            <p>Liberality, opened him the hearts and gates of townes, which hee
battered with his money; caused many which were distracted from
him to come like Bees at the sound of a bason: hee vsed it to bind the
English to his friendship, the Suisses to his succors, and the Brittaines
to his seruice: Reputation hath held all the powers of Europe in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of him, and hath made him to bee redoubted of strangers,
and feared of his Subiects.</p>
            <p>Yet the differences betwixt the priuate and publike fortunes of this
Prince were great; his fortunes were of long Time in fauour amidst
his prosperities: In his raigne, he was a wise, happy King, a good and
a bountifull maister, a distrustfull friend, a cruell enemy, and a terrible
neighbour; in his house a bad son, a bad father, &amp; a bad husband: he
had no children by <hi>Margret Steward</hi> his first wife, and by <hi>Charlotte</hi> of
Sauoy, his second, hee had <hi>Ioachim, Charles, Francis, Anne</hi> and
<hi>Ioane.</hi>

from the crowne of Hungarie. <hi>Lewis</hi> a great Prince to insinuate,
did not cease till hee had wonne, and drawne them to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
The Earle of Charrolois found it, and aduertised the
Duke his Father, who would not beleeue it, and if hee did, yet
hee dissembled the beliefe, applying himselfe to the humors of
this Prince, for we must not feede a Lyon, or we must please
him<note n="g" place="margin">It is indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bandy against a power which we haue supported and raised: <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> brings in <hi>Pericles</hi> ghost aduising the Athenians not to feed the Lyon or to please him.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Charrolois from that time frowned at them of
Croüi, and there grew so great an Antipathie of wils in the minds
of these two Princes, as all the remainder of their liues they were
but fained friends. They of Croüi made an altar of refuge of the
Dauphins fauour, against the Earle of Charalois, and thought
that, notwithstanding that they were great, both in Alliances and
meanes, yet they had need of some greater support, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens

<hi>Lewis</hi> could counterfet and dissemble his passions so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly,

discouer any thing. But the Earle of Charrolois, being of a harsh dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,

indignation which hee durst not euaporate against <hi>Lewis</hi> who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured

of the Earle of Charrolois house. The Duke would haue <hi>Philip

in the absence of the Lord of Auchy the first, and of the Lord
of Formelles the second Chamberlaine. The Earle of Charrolois
entred <hi>Anthony Raulyn,</hi> Lord of Eimeries. The house was diuided,
some followed the Fathers will, and others the Sonnes<note n="i" place="margin">A controuer sie between two priuate Noblemen, is able to diujde the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one of a whole Court. That which was betwixt Chimay of Emeries, who should haue the first place in the absence of the L. of Auchy, first Chamberlaine to the Duke, was so affected as the father was for the one &amp; the son for the other.</note>. The Duke
seeing the danger which might grow by this adoration of the sunne
rising, made it knowne that he was both master and father, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
his Sonne to bring him the Rowle, and in his presence
cast it into the fire, and then willed him to goe forth. <hi>Monstrelet</hi>
saith, that the Duke commanded the Earle of Charolois to cause
<hi>Croui</hi> to martch in his ranke. <hi>I will not, answered the Earle, they of

offended at an answer so bold and of so little respect) he would haue
fallen vpon his Sonne, but not able to get him he commanded him
to auoid the country.</p>

lost himselfe in a wood and lay all night in a Collyars cabbin, with
hunger in his belly, and choller in his head. He came the next day
to Seuenbergh, a little towne of Brabant, whereas he found one of
his huntsmen, who conducted him to Guinneppe, where as the
Dauphin (the cause of all this trouble) besought him to pardon
the Earle of Charrolois. The Duke would haue held the refusall
of so iust a request cruell, being made, by, and for a person so neere

obeying, hee held the rest very short to command and to end at;
in great enterprises worthy of his qualitie<note n="b" place="margin">Life is very short for great entrriprises; and inconstancie makes it much shorter.</note>. Hee entertained the
Iuie of his hopes in the ruines of this old building: he did not

&amp; monstrous vpon vniust effects. To desire for a crownes cause
the death of him of whom he holds his life, is ingratitude &amp; impiety.
The same day that <hi>Charles</hi> dyed, <hi>Lewis</hi> was aduertised of his death<note n="d" place="margin">They that haue written that these newes were sent by <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Aniou, Father in lawe to <hi>Charles</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, are mistaken, both in the name and matter, for <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of Anion liued since the yeare 1417.</note>.
He went presently to horse to goe into France, fearing least <hi>Charles</hi>
his brother should make his profit of his absence. The Duke of
Bourgundy and the Earle of Chartolis accompany him with
foure thousand horse, chosen out of the flower of all the forces
of their Estates and the Princes their friends.<note place="margin">He makes his entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rheims.</note> Hee entred into

Earle of Witembergh, <hi>Iohn</hi> of Luxembergh, and to the Marques of
Saluces Sonne. From the Coronation they went to the Royall
feast, whereas the twelue peeres were set on either side the King.

King to forget the iniuries of such as had offended him during his

Reuenge had mounted with him to the Royall throne, he had
not trod it vnder foote, he carryed it in his head, it was in his mind,

not so sweet to recompence the good as to reuenge the bad. The

which followed him.</p>
            <p>All the pompe and magnifficence which was made at this entry
did represent aswell the simplicity and ignorance of those times, as
the greatnesse and State of Paris. Good witts in such occasions
do not represent all things so plainely to the eye, as there doth not
remaine some thing where-with to content curiosity, by the paine
it hath to seeke, and the pleasure to finde and to deuine at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of their inuentions. Brokers were then more necessary
then paynters, for they did only set persons of diuers ages and sexes
for all kinds of histories. A Virgin was sufficient to represent the
Citty of Paris, as we finde not any more in bookes, nor in auncient
medalls for Rome, nor Athens; and there were fiue to signifie Paris,
euery one carrying a letter of it name. They were conducted on
horsebacke by a Herald, towards Saint Ladros Church, and there
presented vnto the King. The Cronicle saith, <hi>that they had all perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages

spake vnto the King as they were appointed.</hi>

also three Virgins like Mermaides all naked, and at the Trinity was
the passion of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> represented by a liuing man, being tyed
vnto a Crosse betwixt two theeues. At S. Innocents Fountaine
there was a Hinde put forth, beeing followed by a great cry of
Hounds and Huntsmen. At the Burchery was the Bastille of Diepe,
as the most glorious trophee of this Princes youth. Passing ouer
the Changers Bridge, which was couered ouer head, they let flye
two hundred dozen of small Birdes.</p>
            <p>The King went to pray in our Ladies Church, he supt and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

chiefe Officers, The Duke of Bourgondy and the Earle of Charo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois
made a great part of the pompe, they and their traines being
so ritchly appointed, as there were not any more stately. The King
made shew of great loue both to the father and sonne, but there
was so great a diuersity of manners and humors betwixt <hi>Lewis</hi> and

               <hi>Moruillier</hi> persisted in the bitternes of his discourse, forgetting
nothing that might be said to blemish and disgrace a Prince. Hee
shewed that the Bastard of <hi>Rubempre</hi> had been sent by the King to
stay the Vice-chancellor of Brittanie returning out of England:
That hauing landed at the Hage in Holland, the Earle of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralois
had been too suspitious. The Duke answered that the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
of <hi>Rubempree</hi> had been found faulty. As for his Sonne, the
Earle of Charolois, if he were suspicious, hee had it not from him
but from his mother, who was a very suspicious and distrustfull
woman, and yet notwithstanding if hee had been at the Hage at
the passage of <hi>Rubempre,</hi> he had done no lesse then his sonne<note n="m" place="margin">D.

of a Prince of thirtie yeares old vnto his Father, and which
assures this truth: That who so will be honored of those which be
vnder him, should not faile to respect and honor those that bee
aboue him. The scope of his discourse was to iustifie himselfe for
the taking of the Bastard of <hi>Rubempre,</hi> and the confederacie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Duke of Brittaine and him, wherein hee protested hee
had no other designe then the Kings seruice, and shewing that his

in this reformation. Such as entered into this league knew one
another by a silken point which they carried at their girdles.</p>
            <p>Although the king had spies in all places yet knew he nothing

knew the conception, hee did not apprehend that it should show

the sonne were violent and ill affected towards him, yet the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wanted no iudgement to restraine him, and iudging that

both the Princes of his bloud, and the chiefe of his Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

king not to doubt of their loyalties and affections. The king
was offended at this remonstrance, and reiected it with words
full of spleene, bitternes, and contempt. The Duke of Orleans
being thus roughly handled, and grieued that in an age of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and ten yeares, he was not heard by him whose grandfather
had vouchsafed to heare him in his youth, could not endure them,
not considering that they came from the mouth of his king, who
was not bound to fit them to his humor, and that he must swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them sweetly without murmuring, for the demonstration of
the offence doth but augment it. He died for sorrow two daies
after, the fourth of Ianuary 1465. Hee was interred at Bloys, his

the Earle had commanded him; it was so prest, as if he had made

done it without me.</hi> The Earle of Charolois held downe his head
and made no answere, for that which he had done exceeded the
bounds of all iudgement. The King was commended to haue dealt
so iustly, and the Earle of Charolois to haue committed himselfe
so freely into a strongers hands.</p>
            <p>The conditions of the peace beeing all concluded, the King
gaue to the Earle of Charrolois the Castle of Bois de Vincennes
for his assurance, promising to come thither the next day. Hee
came, where also were the Dukes of Berry and Brittanie and the
Earle of Charolois, the ports were well garded, and the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
fortified, and the King was in the like feare in the Castle, as
the Earle of Charolois had beene in the Bulwarke. Euery man
thought that the Publike weale,<note place="margin">Treatie of peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at Bois de Vincennes.</note> which had beene so much exalted
in this league, should be preferred before all other conditions of
the Treatie. But it is a folly to thinke that what is desired of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
can succeed, when it depends of the affections of few men,
<note n="r" place="margin">Matters done hardly succeede but according to the intent of the first mouers. Priuat interests and designes bande against publike intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and seldom is it seene what all desire is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by few.</note> which haue diuers designes. They talked thereof when as all
was done. The Earle of Charolois had the Townes of either side
the riuer of Somme, Amiens, St. Quentin, Corbie, Abbeuille, the
countie of Ponthieu, Dourlans, St. Requier, Creuecaeur, Arleux,
Monstreuil, Croton, and Mortaigne, to bee redeemed for two
hundred thousand crownes, after the death of the Earle of Charo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois.
The King to retire these Townes had nine monethes before
paied foure hundred thousand crownes. Monsieur did homage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King for the Duchie of Normandy.<note n="s" place="margin">Election of thirty six D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme all that should be done by them.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of Brittaine held some places in Normandy, which he
kept still, for he said he had contributed more, for the charges of the
warre, then all the rest.</p>
            <p>The Conuocation of the estates was resolued, and in the meane
time it was held fit to chuse 36. persons,<note place="margin">Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the disorders of the realme.</note> of all the orders of France,
to prouide with the Earle of Dunois for the disorder of Iustice and
the reformation of the estate. The King made no difficulty to grant
all they demanded reseruing vnto himselfe the liberty to hinder it.
His intent was to diuide the forces of the league, and then to turne
ouer his bookes of the sword and dagger,<note n="t" place="margin">The Emperor <hi>Caligula</hi> had two secret bookes, the one was called the sword and the other the dagger, wherein they were noted that should be put to death with those kind of Armes <hi>Suet. cap. 49.</hi>
               </note> where were written in
red letters, their names which had offended him during his retreat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Flanders, and his fathers raigne, which had followed his brother
and the Princes of the league, and especially they that had receiued
him so easily into Normandy:<note n="u" place="margin">King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth held Normandie the most important Prouince of his Realme, he gaue it to his Brother but to delay him, it was to faire a peece to giue for a portion. <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> saith, he had seene raised in Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die fourescore and fifteene thousand pound sterling.</note> for he would not for any thing haue

            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:14645:56"/>
But the Normans, who did alwaies thinke that their Country did
well deserue a Duke, consented to this change for the desire they had
to haue a Prince, which should remaine within the Prouince. There
were but three which desired rather to leaue their houses then to
change their maister. Iustice had greater power in their soules then
wisedome. The Seneshall of Normandy, the Balyfe of Rouen, and
one named <hi>Picard,</hi> who was afterwards Generall of Normandy. The
History owes them this testimony of honor,<note n="x" place="margin">To doe well among men of honor is easie and ordinary but not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himselfe to be transported with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uptions of the time nor to follow the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent passions of a multitude but to desire the good, to dare vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it and to effect it in a bad season, in the which vice is honored with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of vertue, it is an infallible argument of a spirit wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully disposed by nature to all good and commendable thinges.</note> the which is the
more considerable, for that there is some difficulties to retire ones
selfe out of a presse that runs headlong, and that the imitation and
example of ill, presents it selfe alwaies with much heat.</p>

course, the Dukes of Normandy and Brittaine went to Rouen, the
King did accompany the Earle of Charolois to Villiers the faire.
They lodged together for a proofe of the confidence they had one
of another. The King was the weaker hauing but a small troupe, but
there was order that 200. men at armes should come to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him to Paris. An act of wisedome, as commendable as those of
precedent conferences, and trusts had beene dangerous: for in such
occasions there is nothing more safe then not to giue any aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

him from al subiect to distrust his intentions.</p>
            <p>He entred gloriously into Paris,<note place="margin">The Kings returne to Paris.</note> to haue so happily calmed the
storme which threatened him, and two daies after his arriuall hee

in a prince, when by reason of wisedome or weaknes he cannot doe

like vnto the miserable marriner of Tire, whom one waue cast out
of the ship, and another brought him in againe. His humor did
fauor his bad fortune, wauering alwaies amidst the vncertainty of
his resolutions, and a spirit of contradiction.</p>

at the practises and Intelligences which the Dukes of Normandy
and Brittaine had with his enemie, hee therefore Counsells him to
make warre against them, to make worke in their owne estates, and
to kindle a fire in their owne houses, to the end they should not
haue leisure to cast it against their Neighbours. These two Princes

            <p>The Earle of Charrolois was not long in suspence whether the
King would hold all that he had promised: for hauing sent <hi>Imber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>

of marriage of his daughter, they found that shee was promised to

            <p>France neuer saw so many men assembled to ruine her, but she
shewed that her foundations were good. The forces that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Paris were so great and so many as they might well be admired
both of friends and enemies: for it was an apparent demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what this Crowne can doe against the conspiracie of all others.
Yet Paris did feele of this storme long after, and was so vnpeopled
by this warre, and by a plague which happened in August 1467. as
the king to repeople it drew strangers thither with great priuiledges,
as such as had been condemned by iustice,<note place="margin">Vnpeopling of Paris.</note> by the assurance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie,
and all, as the Chronicle saith, according to the priuiledge
giuen to all banished men remaining in the Townes of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Malo
and Valenciennes.</p>
            <p>The fidelitie of Paris saued the Estate, for if shee had refused en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
vnto the king, he was resolued to retire into Suisser-land, or to

three seuerall places; the first and the greatest towards Paris, the
second towards Pont Charanton, and the third by Bois de Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cennes.

for that one night he found the Bastille gate open towards the
field. The Chronicle saith it was on Thursday the 29. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.
He was conceited it had beene done by <hi>Charles</hi> of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lun,
but he made no shew of it. Wise Princes should not lightly
call in doubt two such deere and precious things, as the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>The best blowes which were giuen at this siege were drawne
from his head, and from the wise resolution which he tooke, not
to haue any thought but to diuide the company, he had forces suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to fight with all the Princes together without paine or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,
they had not yet past their Apprentiship in warre. Onely the
Duke of Calabria knew something, hauing learned it vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
in the warre of Naples. The Earle of Charolois had in his
youth followed his Father in his Armies and Battels, but a long
peace had made him forget more then hee knew. As for the Duke
of Berry and Brittanie, the amazement wherein they were when
as the Canon played vppon their quarter, made it knowne that
warre was not their Element. The Historie hath obserued that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Armie had past the riuer of Seine, the Earle of Charolois
and the Duke of Calabria troubled themselues much to haue the
souldiers march in order, and represents them so well armed as
they seemed to haue a great desire to fight. But when it describes
the equipage of the Duke of Berry and Brittaine, it makes a right
Prosopopeia, seruing onely for the number and pompe. <hi>They did
ride,</hi> saith Phil. de Commin: <hi>vpon little nags at their ease, carrying for
the most part but little light Brigandins, yet some said they had nothing
but little gilt nayles vpon Sattin, that they might not weigh, yet I know
not the truth.</hi> He that goes to the warre without his Armes shewes
that he hath no desire to come neere blowes.</p>

nothing back but that they saw much discontentment in the King

            <p>The Innocencie of the Hostages found fauour in the opinions

The Duke of Bourgundy sent vnto the King to intreat him to cease
that warre, and to consider that the Duke of Brittanies cause was
his. The King to pay him with the same reason, sent him word that
if hee would leaue the protection of his brother and the Duke of
Brittanie, hee would abandon the Liegeois. The Constable of

the Constable, <hi>you choose not, but take all, you will neither haue vs

without him, terming them faint-hearted and without iudgement.
The King made him cease his Armes for sixscore thousand crownes

would make them desist. Which reason made the Duke consent to
receiue the King at Peronne. As soone as Cardinall <hi>Balue</hi> and <hi>du

aduertised of the Resolutions which were taken: wherof the mildest

was that they should keep promise with him, so as he would declare

as he was, it was dangerous to giue him liberty, to reuenge
himselfe, The third that they should send for the Duke his brother,

they past by this straight, that he was constrained (and it is the
greatest violence that may be done vnto a King) to consent vnto a

some thought he resolued to retire himselfe into France. But it is not

            <p>The Duke went early in the morning vnto the Castell to the King

               </note>. But when her Brother let her vnderstand
that if the Siegneurie of Venice did abandon her protection, as
it might doe if shee did not follow her Councels, shee was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to become a prey vnto the Turke, and to serue as a triumph
and spectacle to the people of Constantinople: That shee should
not relye vpon Christian Princes, who would all loue the Iland and
the Realme rather then her selfe, and she should beleeue that they,
courting her Crowne rather then her fayre eyes, she were to blame
if she did not preferre a quiet life and safe abode before an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Royaltie, an assured rest before honor, which was but winde,
and a title which was but a vapor.</p>
            <p>To perswade her, the Historie saith, that to the reasons of feare
and danger, he added those of vanitie, adorned with stuffes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
glorie. <hi>What greater honor,</hi> these are the wordes of <hi>G. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,

then to haue giuen so goodly a realme vnto your<note n="a" place="margin">That spirit is weake which thinkes there are any reasons forcible enough to perswade it to quit acrown.</note> country? and
that they write in the Historie of Venice, that</hi> Catherine Cornaro

            <p>These words entred into the Queenes heart and framed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution

Castle of Azolle vpon the hils of Treuisan.</p>
            <p>Thus the Common-weale of Venice purchased a rich Crowne
without any paine, imploying nothing but her wisedome, with
the which shee hath alwaies preferred easie conquests, before the
most glorious, if they were without hazard. It is a curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
that the Estates doe commonly retaine the humour of
their first founders. The Citie of Rome hath been alwaies possest
with an ambitious desire to raigne, for that her founder was full of
it, who not content to haue recouered the Realme of <hi>Numitor</hi>
his Grandfather, cast his eyes presently vpon Alba, and vppon
the small Estates which hindred the extention of this first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<note n="d" place="margin">The Estate of Rome increased sodainly as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libius</hi> obserues. The Romanes hauing once gotten the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, in a short time they made all the world subiect. <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> So as the first profession was Armes, which hath not been
discontinued by posteritie being desirous of glorie and command.
It seemed that all other vertue except militarie had been defended.
Contrariwise the founders of the Common-weale of Venice were
men which had no such ambitious thoughts, but loued peace and
quiet, who being afflicted with the long calamities of Italy and the
inundation of the barbarians, had cast themselues into these Fens
of the Adriatike sea, &amp; seazed vpon many small Ilands which were
caled <hi>Venetie,</hi> they liued there a time, contenting them with an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

alwaies braued the attempts of the mightiest Princes of the world.</p>
            <p>This first inclination not to arme but for their owne defence,
hath made them contemne Armes, and hath made them more
carefull to maintaine themselues in peace, then to inlarge their
Empire. Who so will consider of their first enterprises shall finde
them limitted with a desire onely to maintaine and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.

make him an absolute sale, or giue him caution for the paiment.
The King of Arragon finding either of these conditions verie
harsh, answered that he could not yet vngage the country, and
that it would bee no honour to him to alienate it, being a part of
the Crowne of Arragon, and that it was a matter neuer heard of to
presse a King to gaue Caution, the pawne being sufficient.</p>

               <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Alençon, whose Grandfather had married the
Earle of Armagnac's Sister, drew his iustificacion from the same
reasons by which he was accused. They said he had receiued Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the King of England, and that <hi>Iohn Bon</hi> had brought them
vnto the King, with the answere. His innocencie therein was very
apparant, for if he had receiued his letters and would haue made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
answere he would not haue giuen them back vnto the bearer.
They were cunning practises, said the Duke of Alençon, of such as
haue gouerned <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth to tempt the fidelity of the Earle
of Armagnac and to haue a share in his spoile. That if <hi>Iohn Bon</hi>
had been a true messenger to the King of England, as he made shew
to be, he had not carried the Letters vnto the king.</p>
            <p>That the Earle of Armagnac was naturally an enemy to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,<note place="margin">Earle of Armagnac a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the English.</note> and being at Font arabic, he carried himselfe in such sort to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

with the English which did trafficke in that Contrie: and it
hapened one day as the yong men of Bayonne were come to dance

            <p>We must end this discourse with these words, that the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

difficult it is to draw them out of armies; hee resolued to vanquish
without fighting, and considering that the Lord of Lescun was the

should make him so weake as all his forces would not suffice for his

a defie. The Swisses beseege Pontarlier vpon the riuer of Doux,

            <p>All this amazed him not, the more enemies the more Triumph.

It was not that which the Kings friends desired, for they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented

he inuented a milde course to haue money, calling together the

            <p>This descent of the English had three great passions to moue it:
Ambition; Reuenge and feare. The King of England commanded

            <p>The Constable let the King vnderstand that he desired nothing

that he would not purchase that reproch to haue yeelded
at the first sight of the enemy, and that he knew his humor not to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14645:99"/>
attempt any thing, but when he may doe it safely, profitably, and
honorably.</p>
            <p>He thought otherwise in his heart, and <hi>Edward</hi> knowing well
that the Constable deceiued them,<note place="margin">The K of England re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents that he beleeued</note> did not conceale it that the duke
had done him wrong to imbarke him vpon his assurances. The
Duke take his leaue, vnder a pretext to goe fetch his forces, and
retired into Brabant to passe at Mezieres into the Dutchie of Bar.
The King of England did not like of the reason of his sodaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
knowing well that the Dukes affaires were in no good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and might impaire. The English were amazed and discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
as they are commonly which ground their enterprises vpon
the promises and passions of strangers.<note n="z" place="margin">They that haue needs of forraine succors promise won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ingage them, and doe not commonly performe halfe their promises.</note> Their wils wauered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
hope and repentance. For all the Townes whereof they
promised themselues the conquest, and which they had sometimes
held, they had onely Perronne, and that was but by way of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to refresh them. The season was incommodious. The Duke
of Brittanie remained quiet to see the game, and who should win.
He had incensed the King too much, who had new drawne, from a
Secretarie of England, two Letters written by <hi>Vrse,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">The Duke of Brittanie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to loyne his forces with those of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue 3000.

the King of England, and the other to <hi>Hastings</hi> his Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine,
which discouer his practises, and the promise which he
had made to ioyne with the English.</p>
            <p>All these reasons make <hi>Edward</hi> incline to a peace, he hath some
about him would gladly haue re-past the sea: His chiefe seruants
were not very eager of warre, and remembring the entertainment
at S. Quentin, they found that the English were too blame to
trust in the French against the French, and to beleeue that Rauens
will pick out one anothers eyes. The Ceremonie was, who should
speake first, there was not any one betwixt these two Princes that
would attempt this mediation, they thought that hee which should
first demand a Peace had confest himselfe vanquished. There is a
great disparitie betwixt the affaire of Princes and priuate men, their
rules and Maximes are very different, like to the Kings of Thrace,

caused the messenger to be put in Irons, fearing that he was a spie;

troupes they would into Amiens. There were long Tables at the

companions attended to entertaine all that came. All the Tauerns
and Innes were full. The Marshall of Gié hauing charge to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue

reckonings,<note place="margin">Gran favor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es comery no escotar.</note> and it was not yet nine of the clock. Among other
commodities the souldiour found it sweet to dine well and not to

or ten thousand, who could neither goe on their legges, nor finde
the gates to returne vnto their quarters, they were so full. They
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14645:102"/>
were content to see them drunke with wine, who would haue been
drunke with bloud. But when they came and told him that it was
dangerous to suffer so many men to enter, he left his howers which
he was saying, and the ceremony of Innocents.<note n="y" place="margin">The Romans did obserue good daies to assaile but all were good to defend. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crob. l. Satur. cap. 16.</hi>

is it necessarie that I tell you that which hath been deliuered vnto mee,
and so acquainted him at large with the numbers that were entred, and
still came, all armed, and that no man durst refuse them the gates, least
they should be discontented. The King was not obstinate, but soone left
his deuotion, and told me that they must not keep the ceremonie of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents:</hi>

ceremonious to this Prince, on which hee would not haue
them speake vnto him of any affaires, <hi>Phil. de Commines</hi> hauing
been in danger of a disgrace vpon that occasion.</p>
            <p>Yet he receiued this aduice in such an humor as he beleeued that
he might referre his deuotion to another time and dispence with it,
to the end that he might prouide that this troupe should retire qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly.<note place="margin">The King dines at the gate of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miens.</note>
He caused his dinner to bee carried to the Porters house, not
to shew his distrust, but to make much of the English which came
in and out. He stayed some to eate at his table, and made others
drinke, and withall prouided for the safety of the Towne, hauing
caused three hundred men to be armed in their Captaines houses,
and appointed some vpon the Portall to obserue the entrie of the
souldiers. The King of England being aduertised of this disorder
sent to intreat the King not to suffer them to enter. <hi>That shall not be,</hi>
answered the King, <hi>but if it please him to send some Archers of his
gard to the Port, they shall let in whom they will.</hi> This was done, the
King hauing by his dissembling obtained that which some greater
brute had made difficult.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lewis</hi> had no money in his Coffers to pay the summes that

that he had heard say,<note n="b" place="margin">That which is past teacheth the present.

still some merry speech among their most serious affaires. And
for that <hi>Edward</hi> had youth, beauty and loue in him, hee intreated
him not to returne into England before he had seene the Ladies of
Paris, and that the Cardinall of Bourbon who was their present
should giue him absolution. <hi>Edward</hi> shewed by his eyes and his

for that he was not like vnto him in iudgement and experience, was

the Treatie, the King of England being highly offended that hee
had fayled of his word, had said that hee could let the King know
his bad seruants, and how to conuict them of treason towards his
Maiestie. The Deputies had not much regarded it, holding it to
be a pollicie to terrifie the King with such practises and Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

            <p>After a long discourse, accompanied with infinite shews of loue,
honor, and respect, the two Kings parted. <hi>Edward</hi> past by the Sea,
leauing Hostages in the delights and feasts of Paris, and the chiefe

The Heralds and trumpets of England at their parting cryed out.

were contented with six hundred pipes of wine, and a pension
which the King gaue them. This English man who was much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with this Peace, found his griefe doubled with this flout, and

            <p>The Deputies of either side met, but could not agree, euerie
one seeking to maintaine his owne. The King told his that he would
not haue so many words, and causing the Dukes deputies to come,
he shut himselfe in with them, and before they parted concluded a
Truce for nine yeares, beginning the 13. of September, 1475. and
ending the same day in the yeare 1484. The Duke would haue
<hi>Baldwin</hi> Bastard of Bourgundy, the Lord of Renty, <hi>Iohn de Chata,</hi>
and <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> excluded and to loose the benefit of this
Truce, the which notwithstanding was not so soone published
to saue the Dukes oth, who had sworne not to hearken vnto it so
soone.</p>
            <p>As they were vpon the Treatie the King of England, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
that the Duke of Bourgundy treated apart, sent <hi>Thomas</hi>
of Montgomerie vnto the King, to assure him that be would return
in the Spring with a mighty Armie, to finish the Duke of Bourgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ruine, but the King, who loued him well where he was, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the Truce which was then in question, was no other then
what had been made with him without any alteration, but that
the Duke desired to haue his Letters Patents apart.</p>
            <p>Thus a peace was made both with the English and Bourgundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
These mists which were so thick as there was no hope to see
the Sunne all the day, were disperced in a moment, leauing France
in the same cleerenes that it was before.</p>

nothing constant in the world, and that nature turnes euery thing

waight. The composition of this body is so strong and vigorous,

to that which the King did to haue this Peace. A wise Prince and
lesse fearefull would haue aduentured a Battell, rather then be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

treating are buried in the ruines of proud and triumphant Rome,

as the little number. Hee commanded them to make <hi>Contay</hi> good
cheere, who made no shew to heare the people of Lions singing
through the streetes the shame and ruine of this battel, the courage
of the Suisses and the rashnes of the Bourgondians, for at that time
there was not a Battell but there was presently a Song made of
it.<note n="l" place="margin">The custome is very antient to make hymms and Songs of Battells and victories.

            <p>This hard incounter bred a great alteration in mens mindes and
affections. Those which feared the courage and admired the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of this Prince, began presently to contemne him after the newes
of this rout. There was not any friend, no loue. <hi>Galeas</hi> Duke of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan
renouncing the alliance the had made with him, besought the
King to renew those which he formerly had with France, and offers
him a hundred thousand Ducats. The King made this braue &amp; proud
answer to his Ambassador. <hi>Tell your maister that</hi> I <hi>will none of his
money, and that once in a yeare I leuie three times more then hee, as for
peace and warre I will dispose as I please, but if he repent himselfe to

content to returne as we was: vpon which wordes the Truces were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished

            <p>This good newes augmented the content which the King tooke
at Lion, whether <hi>Rene</hi> Duke of Aniou came to see him. This good

although he were a great Prince could not haue found a woman,

women, who soone discouered the deceit. The Queene made
shew to be iealous, entertained her loue securely with <hi>D. Bernard,</hi>
so as the great familiaritie he had with her made the world doubt
of her chastitie, and when as they saw that the King honored him
with the chiefe charges of the Realme, making him master of the

<hi>Alfonso</hi> being about twelue yeeres old was proclaimed K. of Castille

his Nature, for whereas hee should haue opposed himselfe against

the Archbishop of Toledo, being sent for to come vnto him, to the

Duke being aduertised of the Suisses march, planted his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
against the high-waies comming to Nancy, thinking they
would come that way, but they tooke the left hand which was
a rough and troublesome way along the Riuer of Mozelle, passing

cast her selfe at his feere, where with teares of reuenge and greefe,
she acquainted him with this iniurie, demaunding Iustice. The
Duke hearing of his barbarous accident, sends for the Gouernour,
who being confronted with this woman, feeles his face to blush for
shame, as much as hers was pale for greefe, who after hee had with
trembling denied a crime which had no other witnesse but his owne
conscience, and tried that villanies are more easily committed then
excused:<note n="q" place="margin">It is a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to colour and disguise a villany. An ancient Lawyer being importuned by a Tyrant to excuse a parricide, which he had committed in killing his owne Brother, answered, That it was much more difficult to excuse an offence then to commit it.</note> hee imbraced the Dukes knees, demaunded pardon of
him, and promised to marrie this woman, to repaire the wrong &amp;
iniurie which he had done her. She craues reuenge for the death of
her Husband, and not the loue or alliance of him that had slaine
him. those that were present aduised her to accept of the offer, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mischeefe was done, and Iustice might well reuenge, but
not repaire the wrong. She being forced to fly to forgetfulnesse, the
Goddesse of the vnfortunate, resolued to giue her selfe vnto him,
who had depriued her both of honour and husband, and to binde
him vnto her for his life, which he could not saue but by her means.
The promises were written, concluded, and sworne, whereunto the
Duke added this Article, that the husband and dying first without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
all his goods should remaine to his Wife. This concluded;
their hearts did sacrifice to the concord of marriage, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to liue louingly together. It seemed there was nothing
else to be done, nor that so cleare a heauen as was that day, should
haue any lightning or thunder. The Duke turning towards the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
demaunded if she were content: <hi>I am my Lord</hi> answered she,
<hi>by your bountie and Iustice. I am not,</hi> replied the Duke, who wayed
how much the Commonweale was wronged in this crime: that a
Prince may well declare, but he cannot make an offender innocent:
that he is bound to do Iustice,<note n="r" place="margin">A Prince doing Iustice equally, wins more glory then if he had giuen limits to the Sea, vanquished Monsters, ruined hell, and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heauen.</note> &amp; to giue an accompt of innocent
blood, there being no triumph equall to that which a Prince raiseth
to his glorie in doing Iustice. He commanded the woman to retire,
&amp; caused the Gouernor to be carried to prison, giuing charge that
he should loose his head in the same place wher he put the womans
husband to death,<note place="margin">A woman depriued at one time of two hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</note> and that he should bee also put into a Coffin.<note n="s" place="margin">D. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of Gonzaga, Lieutenant Generall to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. in Italy, made the like reparation to an Italian Lady. Hee caused his head to be cut off that had committed the rape, hauing first made him to marrie her, &amp; to giue her all his goods.</note>
Which done, he sent this woman to the prison, who being amazed
at this spectacle, &amp; to see her selfe the widow of two husbands in so
short a time, was so violently opprest with greefe, as within a short
space she followed the way which these two men had made her.</p>

But notwithstanding all these aboue-named things, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the present necessity of Christian people, our sacred holy Father,
hath shewed himselfe partiall in this matter, against the said Signiory,

are so strange to thinke of, as the Vniuersall Church, and euery vertuous

haue beene aduertised, that our said holy Father hath said; that in this
warre against the Florentines, Venetians, and others of their part, hee
would employ his Person, Goods, and all that he could furnish. The
which is a very strange thing, that the goods and reuenewes of the
Church, which are appointed for the seruice of God, defence of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke

such warres, and for such Factions against Christians, and to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

they suffer the indue exactions which are made at Rome, by expectatiue
Buls and other meanes, and by the Vacants which they leuy, contrary to
the holy Cannons and Decrets of the Church, made, and constituted, by
the holy Fathers, and against the determination of the Vniuersall

gotten, to any Earledomes and Signories, to giue them vnto men of base
condition, and to aduance them, without precedent merite, or without
any aide or succour which they haue giuen vnto the Church. Among
all the Kings and Realmes of Christendome, we, our sacred Realme of

He complained of the contempt of his authority, and told
the Embassadors of the league, that he lamented the obstinacy of
their Princes, who would not hearken to the voyce, and wholesome
counsell of their father, whose bounty they did abuse, and had more
confidence in their owne Armes, then affection to the Church
their mother: That he was exceeding sorry that the Kings Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
and the good Offices which he had done to the holy Sea,
should remaine without effect, that for his part, his conscience
should neuer accuse him to haue contemned any thing for the
good of the Church, that his armes were alwayes open to receiue
them that would repent. And for that the Embassadors of Venice,
Florence, and Millan, demanded leaue to depart, he declared that
they were free, that he would not force the necessity of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne;
but if they would stay, they might with all safety, that it
might be, time and their presence, might make those things easie,
which seemed difficult;<note place="margin">Intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

off to be vnited againe more firmely.</p>
            <p>But it is more time to repasse the mountaines, and see how the
King makes his profite of these last accidents. Estates are like vnto
ships, all things are not so well, but there is still some disorder: It
seemed that the Duke of Bourgundies death had brought France
to that estate, as she could not desire any thing else to make her
felicity perfect; But there is yet another Duke which hinders this
perfection: It is he of Brittany, who since the Treaty made at
Victoire neere vnto Senlis, hath not discontinued his practises in
England, forgetting that the English had alwayes reserued this
Prouince for the exercise of their Armes, when they should be
weary of peace;<note n="f" place="margin">

bad tearmes with the King. The Duke was more earnest and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hereof, when he saw that he had lost the Duke of Bourgundy,
assuring himselfe that the King would fall vpon him, and that it
would be verified of him what the Fable sayes of the Larke in the
Hawkes tallants:<note n="g" place="margin">The weake receiues from one that is more strong, what Law he pleaseth.

the Army camped on Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> Mountaine, and vpon little

The great Maister was informed of euery thing in the Turkes Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

and left the Infidels, making shew that the onely zeale of religion

discouered that which they could not learne, but by him. But his

            </p>
            <p>He refresht the Garrison in S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Tower, and placed of the
most valiant Knights, and best Souldiers to guard it; he viewes the
ruines which the battery had made, and causeth them to be repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

were so receiued,<note place="margin">Assault gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the Turkes.</note> as in lesse then an houre they lost 700 Souldiers,
besides them that were wounded; and they that retired suddenly

to Rhodes, to giue God thankes for this victory.</p>
            <p>The Turkes, to weaken the forces of the besieged, and to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
them the more easily being diuided, batter the Towne in
many places<note n="p" place="margin">The Artillery battering the walles of Rhodes caused the Iland tremble; and it was heard plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Iland of Castle Rosso, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East, an incredible way off.</note> with peeces, and Engines of warre of an vnknowne

The assailants made some shot, whose noyse was like vnto
Thunder, and their ruines like that of Thunder-bolts. The Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
had a Canon which they called the <hi>Tribute,</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

forced Mil-stones, and Rockes, with such great violence, and so

of Engines, the stones whereof ruined houses where they fell. And

the chiefe force and defence of Rhodes,<note place="margin">The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw seeks to poyson the great Maister.</note> he set two men to poyson
him: the first being surprized, and trembling at the first demaund

            <p>Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> Tower did so command the Port, as the enemy
thinking that all the defence of Rhodes depended theron, gaue an
assault by night, when as they thought that the besieged, tired with
the continuall toyles of the day, had neglected the defence, they
made their troopes to land secretly, and marched directly to the
Mole, (it is the Port whereas sometimes the Colosse, one of the
wonders of the world stood<note n="u" place="margin">The Colosse of the Sunne at Rhodes, was 70 cubits high of brasse set vpon the port, all ships past betwixt the legges: It was ouerthrowne by an Earth-quake, and laie long vpon the shore: <hi>Mabia,</hi> a Captaine of the Sarazens, hauing defeated <hi>Constant,</hi> the son of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to <hi>Heraclius,</hi> in a battell at sea, seized vpon <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and sold the mettall of this Colosse to a Iew, who laded 900. horse, and sent it to Alexandria, in the yeare 614. that is to say, 1460 yeares after that <hi>Charles</hi> the Indian, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Grauer, had made it.</note>) but found them that attended them,
who repulst them in such sort, as they lost a great number of their
companions.</p>
            <p>The Bashaw by these first attempts, did iudge of the Issue of the
siege, thinking that he did beate in vaine against this rocke, and
that he might win the great Maister by some other meanes; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to speake with him vpon the ditches banke, where hee
told him, that hee wondered at his presumption and rashnesse, in
seeking to resist so mighty a Prince, and obstinately to refuse him
tribute,<note n="x" place="margin">It is a troublesome and importune demand, to require a tribute of free-men; yea it is insupportable to them that are born to seruitude. The King of Castille demanded from <hi>Muly Alboacen,</hi> King of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado, the Tribute and Arrerages, to whom the Embassadors answered, that the Kings of Granado, tributaries to them of Castille, were dead, and therefore their bond was voyd; and that in Granado they carried no more gold nor siluer, but heads of Lances, Arrowes, and such like Armes, to turne them against their enemies, and to free themselues from seruitude and charge.</note> seeing that he could not receiue more honor, then to be

Tributary to a Prince, to whom the greatest of Asia, Affricke, and
Europe paid tribute.</p>
            <p>Although the great Maister did not thinke it fit to spend time
in words, and answeres, for that in such occasions, a Generall
should not haue his hands on his tongue, but his tongue in his
hands, yet would he not suffer the Bashaw to returne without an
answere, as without any profite of his discourse; and therefore he
said vnto him: <hi>Know that thou hast not to doe with base and effeminate
Asians,<note place="margin">Generous answer of the great Maister.</note> but with Christian Knights, who are ready to burie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

            </p>
            <p>The walles of Rhodes had in few dayes endured 3500 Cannon
shot, the Towers, the Bastions, with the goodliest buildings,
were beaten downe and ruined: there was a breach on all parts,
but in the knights hearts, who were resolued to loose themselues,
rather then to leaue it.<note n="y" place="margin">Constancy and courage is neuer beter tryed, then in Townes besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, whereof there haue been admirable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples seene.

            <p>All things beeing ready, forty thousand Turkes came vnto the
assault towards the Iewes wall, and the quarter of Ierusalem, with
such fury, as if their Prophet had beene behinde them, like vnto

               </note> The attempt was so great, as the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
could not hinder them from planting of their ladders, the
wall was wonne, and their Ensignes set vp in signe of victory; but
they continued not long: the great Maister, and <hi>Anthony</hi> of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busson,
Vicount of Montelier his brother, came to succour them:
they finde many Turkes within the Towne,<note place="margin">Scalodoe repulst.</note> whom they cut in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

            <p>They say, that in this assault, the Turkes saw<note n="a" place="margin">This vision is related at large by <hi>I. Bosio,</hi> in the first part of his History, accordingly as it is set downe in the Text, the which to auoyd repetition, I omit.</note> in the aire vpon

with a Camels skinne, followed with a great troope of armed
men, all glittering, which seemed to come to succour the towne:
that the assailants were so amazed and terrified with this vision,
as they that were neerest vnto the walles, durst not goe on, and
they that were farre off, fled. This miracle hath beene mentioned
by all the Historians that haue written of this siege: and <hi>William

The Bashaw mad at their great constancy and resolution,<note place="margin">Retreat of the Turks</note> retired,
&amp; caused his Artillery to be carefully drawne away, whereof a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
should haue an especiall care; for the losse is dishonorable:
He caused it to be imbarked, with his hurt men. The rage which he
could not poure forth vpon the Inhabitants of Rhodes, shewed it
selfe round about the Towne, leauing no tree vn-cut, Vine vn-puld
vp, nor house vn-burnt. The Bashaw going out of the Port, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
two great ships, which <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> K. of Naples sent to their

            <p>The Prince of Orange gaue him mony, and caused him to bee

that the Cauallary hath great aduantages, for a horse-man hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>Touching the pay, we know that the difference is great betwixt
the pay of a man at Armes, and that of a foot-man; and that it is
easier to raise a thousand foot, then a hundred horse. For the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

            <p>For the commodity of the leading, bee it to march, lodge, or
fight, the foot-men passe in all places, whereas the Cauallary
comes often into such difficult passages, as the men at Armes
should rather desire flying, then ordinary horses. Speaking hereof
with a braue French knight, very well knowne in these last warres,
and who hath yet command amongst the Kings men at Armes, he
said vnto me, <hi>That the discommodity of forrage had beene so great, as
the horsemen were sometimes fifteene, or twenty leagues from the campe
to supply their wants: That some went to warre with fiue or sixe Horse,
who fought but vpon one, and yet the people were forced to feed these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
beasts, with their keepers: That ten horse-men had more Carts
then a company on foote. And if his aduice might purchase credite, they
should therein imitate the Spaniards, who giue honors, recompences, and
markes of vertue to the foote, and the contrary to horse-men.</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">It is more honourable in Spaine to bee among the foot companies then among the Horse.

            <p>The Horse-men were the losse of the battell at Courtray, and the
footmen defeated the Earle of Flanders before Gand. The horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
seeking to haue all the honour of the battell at Poitiers, came
to charge before that the foot companies had meanes to ioyne,
this was the cause that the English, whose force consisted wholly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14645:145"/>
in Foote, wonne the Battell. At the Battell of Guinegaste, the
Arch-duke <hi>Maximilians</hi> Horse-men abandoned the Foote, who
stood firme, and kept the place of Battell. Wee haue formerly
seene, that the men at Armes at the Battell of Mont-lehery, who
seemed as if they would haue supported heauen with their Lances,
fell vpon their owne Archers, and trode them vnder their feete,
doing them more harme then their enemies.</p>
            <p>It is true, that whatsoeuer was fortunate and glorious in this
Encounter, came from the Arrierban, or Gentlemen of Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe
of Dauphiné, who made the Fore-ward vnder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
of the Baron of Sausonnage, who was slaine there: for
of foure hundred Gentlemen which dyed in this Battell, there
were foure and fifty of Dauphiné. Before the troubles, their names
and Armes were to bee seene in a Chappell in the Conuent of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins

horse-men out of Armies; if Rome<note n="p" place="margin">To them that say, the Romans made their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest by Foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, wee may answere, that in like manner, the Parthians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased their Empire by hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: And that <hi>M.

to make a vertue of necessity: for meaning in the beginning
to haue all the people fit to serue in Warre, and all hauing not

He restored the Salt-pits of Commachio, contrary to the ancient

he caused a Fort to be built neere vnto <hi>Cap d' Argent,</hi> to bound his

            <p>The Archbishop on the 13 of Iuly, the same yeare 1482. caused

            <p>Yet for all this they did not cease to wish that the Pope would
earnestly embrace the reformation of the disorders of the Church.</p>
            <p>Desires of this kind are iust, but wee may not presse them with
heate of passion and indiscretion of zeale.</p>
            <p>An example shewing that it is not reasonable, in such sufferings
and perplexities of the Church, that the pride of any priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should presume to reforme it: Wee must leaue those
thoughts to Princes and Magistrates. The simple multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
must attend with patience at the foote of the
Mountaine, vntil that <hi>Moses</hi> descend to let them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the will of God: The Ship wherein
that holy Family is included, which hath
neither sight nor day, but towards
heauen, shall in the end appeare
most glorious ouer the
waues of the deluge, and
shall come vnto the
Mountaine of a
happy tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.

               </note> His forces grew weake, but his
courage was fortefied &amp; strong, vpon
an apprehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he had that they
would make designes vpon his graue,
and that they would not stay vntill hee
came to the end of his Carriere. Hee
desired to end it with the Authority, Maiesty, and Reputation that
he had begonne, and would not that they should know him dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor that they should hold him mortall: Hee workes so, as in
the West of his life, the shadow of his reputation and respect is
as great as at the Noone-day of his raigne: Yet he finds that his
iudgement hath not the force and vigour which it formerly had;
that the remainder of his life is become sower,<note place="margin">Age is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> that age comes

melancholy, agitations of the minde, a slow Feuer, and
the paines of the Emerauds: He hath more prouision then he hath
way to go, he gathers and laies vp when hee should abandon and
let go.<note n="c" place="margin">Age becomes couetous when it hath not any need of goods, it feares the earth should faile it: One demanded of <hi>Symonides</hi> why he was so sparing in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his age; for that said he: <hi>I had rather leaue my goods after my death to my enemies, then in my life time to haue neede of my friends.</hi>
               </note> His designes are great and spacious, and his desires grow
yong, hee cannot free himselfe from new hopes, his soule is as it
were hung betwixt the feare of death and the hope of life, his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is a Milstone which the continuall course of affaires
doth turne day and night: And although his life passeth away
in languishing and griefe; yet had he rather endure the paine, then
not to be, desiring rather to be freed from it, then from life, the
which how painefull soeuer it be, hath some houre of ease:<note n="d" place="margin">There i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Antisthenes</hi> the Philosopher was in extreame paine, hee cryed out, <hi>Who shall deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these miseries?

               </note> For if
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14645:157"/>
paines be violent they are short, and if they be short, they giue
no leasure to complaine: Going to heare Masse at a little Parish
neere to the Forges of Saint <hi>Chinon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King suddenly and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously sicke.</note> hee found himselfe very ill,
and fell into a great weakenesse, and faintings, loosing his
speech and all knowledge. Hee was speedily succoured by the
Signior of Bouchages, who was his Phisition, and afterwards
Arch-bishop of Vienna, hauing taken a glister he recouered
his spirits, went to horse, returned to the Forges and there
dyned.</p>
            <p>But hee had so great a difficulty in his speech, as hee could not
be vnderstood but by signes. <hi>Phillip de Commines,</hi> who serued him
as Grome of his Chamber in this sickenesse, was also his Truch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>He vnderstood little of what was said vnto him, but he felt no paine:</hi> Hee made mee a signe to lye in his chamber, he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce many words; I did serue him fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene daies at his meate and about his person, as Groome of his Chamber; the which I held for a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and was well respected. <hi>Phil. de Com.</hi>
               </note> when as he confest himselfe to the Officiall of Tours: And
for that being surprised with this sickenesse they carried him from
the Table vnto the fire,<note place="margin">An Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,</note> and would not suffer him to come neere
vnto the windowes; hee remembred all this, and being come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himselfe, he demanded who they were that had staid him by
force, and kept him from taking of the aire, being named vnto
him, he chased them away and would no more see them, for hee
did neuer like that King <hi>Charles</hi> his father should be forced to
eate, for that the Subiect should not in any thing force his
Prince.<note n="f" place="margin">Wee doe not willingly see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue beene the secret wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of our faults, or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.

            </p>
            <p>He thought that as soone as a Prince suffered himselfe to bee
gouerned by his seruants, he was, as it were, in tutelage and serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines his authority to the last gaspe.</note>
and he would not that this great authority, the which he had
so absolutely maintained all his life, should bee in any thing
restrained, so as immagination being weakned and troubled by
age; Melancholy and distrust could not endure that he should bee
contradicted or disswaded from any thing, hauing these words
often in his mouth: <hi>Do you thinke that I know not what I do?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
did so much afflict him,<note place="margin">He feares contempt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of sedition.</note> as the feare that his infirmity
should be knowne:<note n="g" place="margin">There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that a Prince, which beginnes to grow old should so much preuent, as to make it knowne that hee grows heauy, &amp; that the vigour of his spirits is weakened: For ambition of rule is so itching a thing, as euery man will giue order to these defects.</note> For hee thought that as soone as his weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and infirmity should be discouered they would hold him as
dead, and vnprofitable to the world, that he should be contemned
of his Subiects, who would passe sudenly from contempt to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Hee feared that in the end they would make him beleeue that
his sences were distracted, and that they would controule him
in the expedition of affaires: wherefore, as soone as he felt his
faintings past, and that his spirits beganne to returne, hee would
dye in action and standing:<note n="h" place="margin">

               </note> he caused all the dispatches, made
by his Secretaries,<note place="margin">Hee cals for dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> to be brought vnto him, seeming to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

made shew to reade the letters, and although he sometimes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them vpside downe, and had little knowledge, yet no man

yeare, for that hee had employed all his pollicies and inuentions

King (who was weakned with his infirmity) entred into some

twelue whole yeares in a Cage of Iron, that the Church
was scandalized, and his liberty wronged. The Cardinall of
Saint <hi>Peter ad vincula</hi> (who afterwards was called <hi>Iulio</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and was come into France to mediate a peace) tooke the
King in this good thought,<note n="l" place="margin">The question is great vpon the exemption of Church-men out of the power of Princes: Some hold it is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Law of God, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by grace and concession.</note> made him to apprehend the offence

France, and for this cause was much fauoured by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King
of Naples: he dyed Bishop of Preneste, and was interred at Saint
<hi>Praxede.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prelate had all his life time warlike thoughts and
inclinations, and a chollericke and stirring spirit: The Cronicle
saith that in the warre of the Common-weale, hee went day and
night on horse-backe to visite the Guards: Hee got a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the King to go and muster the Souldiers at Paris. The
Earle of Dammartin seeing the confusion and disorder which
this Prelates ambition caused in publicke charges, besought the
King to suffer him to go and hold a chapter in the Cathedrall
Church at Eureux.</p>

the great and excellent vertues of <hi>William</hi> of Estouteuille
Cardinall of Rouan, will shew themselues heere gloriously:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14645:158"/>
Hee was the ornament of the Cardinals of his age, and neither
feare of danger nor apprehension of ill did<note n="m" place="margin">To do good where there is no danger is a vulgar thing, but to do good where there is perill is the proper office of a good man: to do euill is too easy and too base.</note> hinder him from
doing good. Rome cast her eyes vpon him, as Athens did
sometimes on <hi>Aristides;</hi> He was wonderfull iealous of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Robe, and considering that the world was but a
Theater, on the which euery man was bound to play the part,
which his vertue, or fortune, had giuen him, hee would alwaies
performe his with constancy and honour: King <hi>Charles</hi>
the seuenth, commanded him to go to Rome, with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
which hee sent to Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> the third, to yeeld
him obedience, but hee excused himselfe, not for feare to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his sufficiency,<note n="n" place="margin">Ignorance &amp; weaknesse feare any encounter, for that they thinke being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared one with another, their imperfections will presently appeare.</note> to the encounter of a greater, but not to
offend the honour of his Cardinals place, which did not
allow him to accept of any Legation, but from the Popes
authority.</p>
            <p>With the same courage that he maintained the honour of his
Hat, hee defended that of the Church, and of France.
The Barrisell, or Prouost of Rome finding a man in committing
a flagrant delict or heynous crime, and hauing no hangman
to execute him, presently forced a poore Priest, whom hee
found begging in the streete, to doe this office: Hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
in vaine to tell him that he was a Priest, and a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and that he had neuer done an act vnworthy the one or the
other:<note place="margin">Cruelty of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uost of Rome.</note> The Prouost, who had abandoned the Helme of reason to
the storme of choller,<note n="o" place="margin">A iudgement transported with choller, is like vnto a Shippe without Pilate and without helme, or a lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, out of the which the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is expelled by the fire and smoake which is in it: The end of all that is done in choller is the beginning of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentance.</note> the which had fild his spirit with fumes,
felt himselfe so transported with passion to punish the crime, as
hee would not hearken vnto the innocent, but threatned to
make him play the part of the offendor, if he would not do that
of the Hang-man.</p>
            <p>The feare of death, which had forced greater men to doe
worse, made him resolue to this infamous excution, after
which he retired himselfe, holding downe his head for shame,
into the house of Cardinall <hi>Estouteville,</hi> where hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of this wrong, and demanded iustice. The Cardinall
considering that by the iniury of this poore man, the dignity of
the Church, and the honour of the Nation was interressed, sent
for the Prouost, and hauing let him know his fault, commanded
his Muletier to hang him at the barre in his Hall, with one of his
Mules halters: At the sight of this Prouost, hanging at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
the Popes Officers made great complaints, and the
Cardinall <hi>Estouteuille</hi> was ready to retire into France, but
Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> being aduertised thereof blamed the cruelty
and iniustice of the said Prouost, who had so affected the
punishment of another,<note n="p" place="margin">It is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course of iniustice to plunge it selfe into the mischiefe wherhinto she would draw others: <hi>Dat poenas dum exigit:</hi> They bee ruines which breake vpon that whereon they fall.</note> as hee had not considered into what
danger hee engaged himselfe: Hee commended the Cardinals
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14645:159"/>
iustice, and entreated him not to leaue Rome.</p>
            <p>He remained 28. yeares there, and dyed the same yeare when
as King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth left this life: Hee was made Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine
to <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, Bishop of Ostia, and Deane of the
Colledge: Hee caused Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> Church to be built, and
did much inrich that of Saint <hi>Mary</hi> the Great: The Chanons of
this Church, and the Monkes of the other, did not yeeld that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
vnto his memory which they ought: For being ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre

            <p>Many thought that this sickenesse had toucht his heart, and
made him more sencible of the miseries and calamities of his

had not preuailed any thing, and they expected no ease but what
should come from his owne motion:<note n="r" place="margin">Hee had much opprest his people <hi>(saith Phil. de Comines)</hi> and more then euer any King did, Authority and perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could not moue him to ease them; It must come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe, as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would haue done, if God had preserued him from sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good to doe well whilst we haue leasure, &amp; that God giues health and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to men.</note> He propounded to reforme

many sheepheards of the Countrey of Poictou, to sing, to make

Castle of Ambois the 22 of September, in the yeare of grace 1482. and of
our reigne 22. By the King, my Lord the Dauphin, the Earle of Beaujeu,
the Earle of Marle, Marshall of France, the Archbishop of Narbona, the

            <p>The date of this Edict discouers the mis-counting of <hi>Philip de

               <note n="n" place="margin">
                  <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> was sent into Sauoy, to set at liberty the Signior of Illins a Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinois, whom the King had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Duke <hi>Philebert</hi> his Nephew. When as the Earle of Bresse sawe the Kings Armie at Maston, hee did what they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> who saith, that in the yeare 1483. the King would see
the Dauphin his sonne, whom he had not seene in many yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and that soone after he had spoken vnto him, he fell into the
extremity of his sicknesse, whereof he died: for this Remonstrance
was made in the Castle of Ambois, in September 1482. and the
King died not before August the yeare following. But to resolue
the doubt of times, it may be that the King some few dayes before
his death, had a will to see the Dauphin, when as they conducted
him to Paris, to make his entry, and to celebrate his marriage, and
that <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> not beeing at Ambois when this first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance
was made, beeing stayed in Dauphin or Sauoy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King had sent him with Troopes, against the Earle of
Bresse, hee had no knowledge thereof, and therefore hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>That the King had not seene the Dauphin in many yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>

It is the Image of truth, and as the image is perfect, that doth right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represent the Originall, so a History should represent all things in their simple truth.</note> and if Truth can haue
but one vniuersall face in all things, how can it accord the
Chronicle with this Edict? It writes, that the King going to
Saint <hi>Claude,</hi> and before his departure out of Tourraine, sawe
the Dauphin at Ambois, and gaue him his blessing: That
in the moneth of October, the same yeare, beeing fallen into
a Relapse of his sickenesse, hee caused himselfe to bee carried
to Ambois to exhort him to that which hee should doe, which
makes mee to wonder, if in matters that bee secrete and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,
Writers doe not alwayes giue full, perpetuall, and
immutable Assurances, seeing that in these they dispense so
freely with the Certainety.</p>
            <p>The Instructions which the King gaue vnto the Dauphin, were
found Good and Holy, but they could yeeld no good fruits,
but with a peace. All the rest without it had beene of small vse,
there being nothing whereof a Father, who leaues a yong heire,

all the Pretences of the Crowne of France to the House of

nothing so miserable, as to see a Prince expeld his Countrey, and

of foure sonnes of <hi>Iohn</hi> the second, Duke of Bourbon, of <hi>Charles</hi>
Cardinall of Bourbon, of <hi>Peter,</hi> Lord of Beaujeu, of the Bishop of

a Writer had neuer cast his eyes vpon this house, which had
held all them of France in admiration, and had not spoken of the
actions of <hi>Iohn</hi> the second, Earle of Vendosme, which were no

comfort himselfe by the knowledge he had of this Princes humor,
who did not loue any of his bloud, nor them whom his Father had

still preserued the reputation of the ancient fidelity of them of his

And although that <hi>Iohn</hi> the second Duke of Bourbon had declared
himselfe of the league of the Common-weale, for that the King
had dispossest him of the gouernment of Guienne, from whence

<hi>Lewis</hi> his children; one of which was prisoner to the Earle of

him reuolt, so the feeling of his owne interest did not make him
discontented. His father had carried the Staffe of Lord <hi>Steward,</hi>

that it is no more lawful for the greatest Prince of the bloud,
then for the least Officer of the Crowne to prescribe a law to the

a Countrey, at that time, full of wood, and wilde beasts, causing the said
Lord <hi>Peter</hi> of Bourbon, his son-in-law, to remaine at Montereau-faut-yonne,

straightest Cypres-trees are vnfruitfull.</p>
            <p>Hee was not so bountifull of his fauours to the Lord of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeu,
but hee was as sparing to the Duke of Bourbon his brother:
he had an implacable hatred against <hi>Iohn,</hi> Duke of Bourbon, sonne
to <hi>Charles,</hi> the <hi>Achilles</hi> of France. This hatred was nourished with
a fresh apprehension, for that this Prince lamenting the disorders
of the State, the miseries and oppressions of the people, and the
bad vsage which <hi>Charles,</hi> Duke of Berrie suffered, had laid the first
foundations of the league, had left it by the Treaty of Ryon, and
re-entred againe into it vpon despight, for that during this Treaty,
the Duke of Millan, by the Kings commandement, had ouer-run
and ruined his Countrey of Beaujolois and Forrest.</p>
            <p>But for that hee was a Prince of great power, great courage, and
great credit in the heart of all France: hee would not euaporate
this fire of reuenge and indignation which hee had against them,
and considered rather what he might doe, then what he should do.
And the Duke, who was acquainted with the disposition of this
King, knewe well, that all Princes write offences done them in
brasse, and the seruice which they receiue, vpon sand; wherefore he
remained long in his Dutchy of Bourbonois, and would not come
to Court.</p>
            <p>The King, whose chiefe care was to weaken his enemies, and
to diuide them, gaue him the gouernement of Languedoc, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
the remembrance of things past. Vpon this assurance
the Duke of Bourbon shewed that hee did not breathe any thing,
but the Kings seruice; neither had he any greater content, then to
yeeld him proofes equall to his affection: and therefore hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him to Peronne, and we must beleeue that without him
in this voyage hee had giuen his Enemies more courage to
execute those dangerous councels, hauing resolued to stay him:
For besides the respectes of Alliance, the Duke of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gondy,
respected this Prince, who had the two principall
partes necessary in great Captaines, Valour and good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.<note n="l" place="margin">The two qualities necessary in the Generall of an Army are, Valour and good fortune. <hi>Duo sunt quae Claros Duces faciunt, summa virtus, summa foelicitas.</hi> Lat. Pac. Paneg.</note>

to shake his loialty, no not if he should be reduced to the misery

wipe away the blemish which distrust had put in this Princes eyes,
yet would he not trouble the content which hee had receiued by
the testimony which his conscience gaue to fidelity and vertue.
The King also fore-seeing that if his enemies were fortefied, with
his fauour and forces, hee should be much troubled, hee coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to come vnto him. The Duke excused himselfe vpon a
resolution which hee had taken to liue quietly in his house, the
which no man could enuy him, hauing purchased it with incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
toyles and crosses. Hee besought the King to suffer
him to rest in the port of this tranquility after so many stormes, and
to content himselfe with the seruice which the other Princes of his
house, and his Bastard the Admirall did him.</p>
            <p>The King entreated and coniured him to come, and to reape
the same fruits in Picardy which he had sometimes receiued in
Guienne,<note n="n" place="margin">The honour of the glorious victory of Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migny is giuen to <hi>Iohn</hi> the second Duke of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, who then tooke the title of Earle of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, for hee charged the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish with such fury, as with the losse of tenne men onely, hee defeated fiue thousand Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and tooke 1400. prisoners.</note> to the shame and confusion of the English, sending

was not lesse glorious then at Fromigny.</p>
            <p>The Duke being loath to faile France in so great an occasion,
and remembring that his predecessours had not desired a more
glorious graue then to die vpon a field of battell couered with
the bloud of their enemies,<note n="o" place="margin">The Princes of the house of Bourbon who haue dyed for the seruice of the Crowne, are <hi>Peter</hi> of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, slaine the 19. of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1356. at the battell of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> his sonne at the Battell of Brignay neere vnto Lyon: <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> at the Battell of Agincourt 1415. <hi>Francis</hi> at the battell of Saint <hi>Bridget</hi> on holy Crosse day in September 1525. <hi>Iohn</hi> at the battell of Saint <hi>Laurence, 1557.</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> at the siege of Roan, 1562.</note> and to free the King from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite,

solicite him with all vehemency, he deliuered the Constables let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into the Bishops hands, protesting that hee would neuer carry
Armes against the Kings seruice. The effects did not differ from
his words; for seeing the Duke of Bourgundies troupes approach
to enter the Country, he went to horse and put them to rout: The
Earle of Conches was slaine there, the Earle of Rousillon Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
of Bourgundy was taken prisoner there, with the Earle of
Dammartins sonne, and the Signiors of Longy de Lisle, Digoin,
Ruygny, Chaligny, and the two sonnes of the Signior of Viteaux,
one of which was Earle of Ioygny: Being then assured of the
discent of the English, and that they had passed the Sea, he came
vnto the King with sixe hundred horse, and commanded part of
his Army which was neere vnto Beauuais. Matters being reduced
to those tearmes that the King desired, and the King of England
hauing repassed the Sea, he retired himselfe to Moulins to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

foreseene a farre off, considered without amazement, and attended

things new or renued in all other Kingdomes of Europe, as if the

Nauarre and Scotland. And although they were things farre from

to cure him: they entertaine him with vaine hopes, and diuert his
thoughts from any thing that might augment his waywardnesse:
And for that they told him, that a Northerly winde, which did
then reigne, made mens bodies sickly, and did hurt the fruits, he
commanded the Parisians to goe in Procession to S. <hi>Denis,</hi> to cause
it to cease.<note n="i" place="margin">The Chronicle saithn, that to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea this, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly winde, all the Estates of Paris went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers dayes in procession to S. <hi>Denis</hi> in the moneth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, &amp; that the same pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were made in May follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the kings health.</note>

When as <hi>Peter,</hi> Duke of Bourbon his son-in-law, entred into his

            <p>This good man vndertooke to make this Prince capable of
two things, the hearing whereof is difficult to men, and Kings are
very hardly taught: to loue God, and to contemne the world. The
world entertaines their minde with so many things which men
think worthy of loue, as they cannot lodge any other affection in
their hearts, and do not thinke of the loue wherewith the Angels
liue and burne, being the fire of the Intellectuall world, as the Sun
is of the coelestiall, and the Elementary of ours. Princes in stead of
louing God, loue themselues, they finde that all is made for them,
they dispose so absolutely of all the beauties and pleasures of the
world, as they desire no other: they haue vnder their powers so
many great and goodly spirits, as they haue no will to change their

            <p>The exhortations of <hi>Francis de Paulo</hi> did cast some seeds of the
loue of God into this Princes heart; but the cares of the world
were the birds which carried it away, and did smother it in the

            <p>The marriage being celebrated at Paris, whereunto all the

lodged that night in the holy Chappell, and the next day passed

            <p>This commandement of the King incountering a spirit, which
was milde, tractable, and temperate, had not the effects it should

of the best of his age, being nothing but mildenesse and courtesie.

Gouernour did hide her often vnder his Gowne, when as the
King met her, to the end hee should not bee troubled with
the sight of her. The hatred of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the death of <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, her brother, and the diuorce
of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, her husband, changed all the sweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of her life into the bitternesse of the Crosse, and imbarkt
her as in a tempestuous Sea, whereas shee found no other
Port but that of death. The children of great men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

The way to heauen is full

imprisonment in the great tower of Bourges, he receiued no other
succour, nor assistance but from this Princesse. The cause of
their Diuorce was Sterrility, and want of consent in marriage.
CLAVDIVS of Seyssell saith that hee gaue her vnto him, to
the end that sterrility, and barrenesse, might depriue him of
all meanes to haue children, so much he hated and abhorred the

            <p>Her consolation was in this solitarinesse, for that shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
the liberty which shee had long desired: The King gaue
her the Dutchy of Berry for her portion, the Towne of Bourges

the Annunciado, otherwise called the Order of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
the which was allowed and confirmed by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the
sixth, in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred and one, and shee
caused the Monastery of Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> of Bourges to be built:
The habite of her Religious women is a blew, or skie couloured
Gowne, a white Kercher, and a red Scapulaire, with a Cord of
tenne Knots, signifying the ten Vertues, or Consolations, which
the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had in her life<note n="l" place="margin">The ten Knots of this Cord had relation first to the purenesse: secondly, to the wisedom; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; fourthly, to the faith; fiftly, to the vertue, sixthly, to the praise; seuenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; eighthly, to the pouerty; ninthly, to the patience; and tenthly, to the pitty of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine <hi>Mary.</hi>

               <hi>Charles</hi> his sonne succeeded him at the age of thirteene yeares:
The Histories of those times, speake much of the greatnesse of
his courage, and the weakenesse of his braine: They all agree that
hee neither had any great vnderstanding, nor much wit: Two
great defects in two little words, the which are much dilated in
the actions of his life, whereas wee see that hee attempts light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

with the like feuer of the braine to <hi>Charles</hi> the seuenth his
Grand-father, and to <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth his Father, who both
feared their Children; and that for this cause hee soone past o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

that this Prince <hi>was alwaye little,<note place="margin">Dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth</note> both of body and vnderstanding;
but hee was so good, as there was neuer a better creature seene. Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
of Seissill saith, That hee was a good Prince, Noble, and of
a greater courage then of body, couetous of honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
desiring all good and honest things as much as his age
could beare, and that hee failed in the flower of his youth, when
as hee began to vnderstand his owne affaires. <hi>Peter Desrey</hi> a
Champenois, who hath written his Chronicle, saith; That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
past the weaknesse of his first Age, youth gaue great hopes
of more force and vigor of his Spirit, and that hee did exercise

The Phylosophy of Princes is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, faith and sincerity, other scyences are but as Paintings, as <hi>Plato</hi> saith.</note> 
               <hi>After the death
of his father</hi> (saith this Chronicler) <hi>and that hee had taken vpon
him the Royall dignity, he began very willingly to reade bookes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the French tongue, and had a desire to vnderstand the Latine;
and to do like a good Prince, hee imployed his youth willingly to serue
God deuoutly, and to heare the councell of wise men, desiring to learne
how to gouerne well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that the carelesnesse of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth

               </note> For it
is true, that hee strooke more amazement into Italy at the brute

former times.</p>
            <p>Hee put all the Potentates in alarme, Pisa at liberty, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

of his desire greater then those of his hopes; hee entred armed
into Rome, with his Launce vpon his Thigh, hee planted his
Cannon on the Market-place, and made himselfe to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and admired of all men for the Deputy of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God, for the reformation of the disorders of Italy: and
without striking stroake, or pitching any Tent, hee entred a

Conquerour into Naples; and in his returne, hee marched (as it
were) vpon the belly of Italy, being all banded against him, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

glory and fruit which shee promised vnto her selfe by this voyage,
it sufficeth that the cause was iust and glorious: for wee must

               <item>2 A particular examination of his actions, his piety, his deuotions, &amp;
pilgrimages, his good deeds to Churches, his behauiour toward the Pope.</item>
               <item>3 What he was towards King <hi>Charles</hi> the seuenth his father, towards
his sonne, his wife, and the Princes of his bloud.</item>
               <item>4 Maiesty: The care hee had to preserue the respect: hee did not affect
pompe: who were the chiefe officers of his Crowne: hee is very wary to
confer titles of honor and dignity, he contemnes the mark of maiesty.</item>
               <item>5. Magnificence: The order and expences of his house: he receiues the
Embassadors of forraigne Princes with great state. His buldings.</item>
               <item>6 Clemency: He leaues no offence vnpunished: his Prisons and Cages of
Iron, a rigorous vsage of the Dukes of Alençon and Nemours: Hee
reuengeth old offences which he had receiued before he was King, and
forgets not them of the league: Seuerity in the end makes him feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and distrustfull.</item>
               <item>7 Iustice: He institutes the Parliaments of Bourdeaux and Dijon: hee
loues not the Parliament of Paris: a free and couragious admonition
made by the President <hi>La Vacquerie:</hi> how chiefe Ministers should
carry themselues to Princes: Of the Kings Audiences.</item>
               <item>8 Wisedome: He was alwayes accompanied with feare, he let slip the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to do his businesse in England and Flanders, he can choose men
and draw forraigne Princes to his deuotion, as the Archduke of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,
<hi>Cosmo di Medicis,</hi> and others; he drew vnto his seruice the
Lord of Lescun, and Creuecoeur, and <hi>Philip de Commines.</hi> His
tongue offends his wisedome.</item>
               <item>9 Liberality: He is neither couetous nor liberall: he hath formes to giue
which bind much: hee entertaines many Pentioners: his liberality
passeth to excesse, empties his Coffers, driues him to necessity, and to
lay rigorous Impositions vpon the people.</item>
               <item>10 Valour: Proofe of the greatnesse of his courage in diuers encounters,
what care he had of warre. His policie and military discipline.</item>

Father, and his neerest Kinsmen the Princes of his Bloud, and his
Seruants. Of all these things the Iudgement shall bee reserued
to truth and discretion, which will haue the memory of Princes

draw fauours from the King, it was good to make himselfe to

might terrifie him, and held his spirit in the apprehensions of
warre.</p>
            <p>This great rigour, which the King vsed towards him, might
well bee excused and maintained with this great reason, not
to make the Princes of the bloud great in a time of trouble
and liberty. If his brother had had a greater share in the
State, and if his portion had lyen neerer to his enemies,
the League of the Common-weale had continued longer. In
the beginning hee thought to content him, in giuing the
Dutchy of Berry<note n="u" place="margin">The Dutchy of Berry was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him for his portion in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember 1461. &amp; in the yeare, 1465. he entred into the Dutchy of Normandy, and the Lands which the Duke of Orleance held there, as the Counties of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne and Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueuille.</note> to him, and to his Heires Male, then the
Dutchy of Normandy, with power to impose all sorts of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies:
But hee did all this onely for the necessity of his affaires,
and to dispierce, and cut assunder the storme of the League:
Soone after, hee draue him out of Normandy, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him to retire, and with-draw, himselfe into Brittany, as poore
as euer.</p>
            <p>This seuere course was approued and allowed by the three
Estates, who held it not fit, nor conuenient, to pull so goodly a
Flower from the Crowne, saying; that hee should rest himselfe
contented and satisfied with the offer which the King made him
of twelue hundred pounds Sterling yearely rent, with the Title
of a Dutchy, and foure thousand eight hundred pounds
Pension:<note n="x" place="margin">This offer was made, according to the Ordonance of King <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1374. by the which he would that <hi>Lewis</hi> of France his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond son should haue twelue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling yearely rent, for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and 4000. pounds giuen him to furnish him.</note> In the end, hee gaue him the gouernement of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,
but hee commanded <hi>Iohn</hi> of Popincourt, President of
the Accounts at Paris, not to inuest him with his Letters,
before hee had deliuered, and resigned vp the others, and made
his renounciation: This was but a scantling of the whole peece,
for of this great, spacious, and goodly Prouince of Guienne,
hee had nothing but the Country of Bourdelois, Bazadois, and
Landesse: Hee neither enioyed it long, nor yet possessed it
quietly; for being there, hee presently found great troubles
for the limites, and bounds, which the Kings Officers stroue and
contended for, and for the which the Duke of Bourgundy
would haue taken Armes, but it was compounded and verefied by
the Court of Parliament two yeares after. Death gaue him
a more contented, quiet, and certaine Portion in the other

            <p>If death had not done the like grace to the Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,
and drawne him out of the cares and afflictions of this
life, hee had declared the cause of the same resolution
the which hee made knowne to King CHARLES the seuenth:
The violent death of LEVVIS Duke of Orleance his

father, hauing inuited the English to mount vpon the Stage,
and there to act the part of Kings of France for many yeares,
made him to take Armes, and to ioyne the reuenge of this
death to the defence of the Crowne: Hee was taken prisoner at
the battell of Agincourt, and carried into England, where hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
fiue and twenty yeares. His liberty and rest came from
thence, from whence proceeded the causes of the miseries of
his house, and of his captiuity. <hi>Phillip</hi> Duke of Bourgundy,

did shew that hee had beleeued them too lightly who had

would giue him the Castle of Milan. Hee past into Italy to
take possession of the Dutchy,<note n="a" place="margin">It is a great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in a Prince to beleeue that lightly which is represented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity of a great designe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the most tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are subiect to suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to bee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with these goodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions. <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitas error magisest quam culpa &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem in opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis cuiusque mentem facil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limè irripit.</hi> Credulity is an errour rather then a fault, and it doth easily creepe into the best mens minds. <hi>Cicero.</hi>

reproached vnto the French, neuer to thinke of their returne
when they passe the Mountaines, being there hee was presently
vnfurnished of all necessary meanes to worke any great effect,
and was forced to end his enterprises as soone as they beganne. The
conquest of the County of Ast was the fruite of his voiage, the
rest remained to FRANCIS SFORCE. This County of Ast

               <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of Orleance was successour to this bad vsage, and
to the end that this contempt might bee a counterpoise to the

            <p>According to the Maxime, to humble the Princes of his bloud,
hee intreated the Earle of Angoulesme no better, and would not
suffer him to thinke of marrying the Princesse of Bourgondy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
rather that that great and mighty Estate should be in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

vnder the rocke of contempt and necessity, and kept them

that hee should not shew himselfe but once a yeare, like to the first
Kings of France: But my meaning is to speake of that inuiolable
and glorious respect which bindes a Prince not to say, do, or yeeld
to any thing contrary to the dignity of his Crowne, which cannot
endure to be forced, and doth neuer shew himselfe in publicke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

            <p>Thus his Maiesty was feared of the greatest Princes of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,

the seuenth his Father, hauing made the Earledome of Foix a
Pairie for <hi>Gaston</hi> of Foix, hee confirmed this erection; but hee
made not any new. This house of Foix was in those times one of
the most famous in Christendome, and compare with Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Princes<note n="o" place="margin">We find that in great ceremonies the Earles of Foix are named before the Princes, and had precedence of the Earles of Vendosme. There is no other reason but that the eldest of Princes houses precede the yonger of other houses, and therfore at the Estates held at Tours, the Earles of Neuers, Eu and Foix, had precedence of the Earle of Vendosme.</note>

               <hi>Gaston</hi> of Foix, who liued in the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, went
equall with Kings: when as King <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth was at Tholousa,
he sent the Earle of Sancerre Marshall of France; and the Signior
of Riuiere, one of the chiefe of his Councell to the Earle of
Foix, who was then at Mazere, to intreate him to come vnto him,
or else he would goe to see him. He did not excuse himselfe vpon
the Indispositions of his great Age, and being sorry that hee had
not preuented this summons, he parted from Mazere with six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

that presenting himselfe vnto the king, hee was followed by two
hundred Gentlemen, all cloathed in silkes; among them there
was noted the Vicount of Bruniquet and his brethren, <hi>Roger</hi> of

and head of the house of Montespan,<note n="p" place="margin">

and Families haue their periods like to all other worldly things)
could not desire a more glorious fall, then into the house of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc,

            </p>
            <p>He fauoured the house of Lauall with the like declarations of
honour,<note place="margin">House of Lauall.</note> the which was long before held for one of the worthiest
of France, hauing neuer wanted children, nor the first dignities

not like a little flye vpon the face of his reputation to beautifie it,
but a malitious vlcer to disfigure it. It is the duty of a good Prince
to giue authority to the administration of his soueraigne Iustice, to
maintaine those venerable heads which conceiue the Oracles, and

left him at Paris, to command there in his absence. The Earle of
Maine sought to make vse of this occasion, and of his fauour to
haue certaine priuiledges verified. The Court of Parliament being
prest, and in a manner forst, put this clause in the verification; <hi>By

not beeing able to restraine or moderate them, haue often
allowed the oppositions which the Parliaments haue made to
their Edicts, and fauoured them for that they were conformable
to reason, and agreeing with the publicke good. For although
the Soueraigne bee aboue the Lawes, and that hee may dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
from Right and Law, wherein Soueraignty doth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consist, yet it is necessary that the absolute power bee restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

shall commaund you any thing, if you finde any difficulty, I shall bee
content you acquaint me with it; which done, without any further reply
I will bee obeyed.</p>
            <p>But when the State is gouerned by a wise Prince, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is grounded vpon great and eminent vertues, they haue
no other part in the Estate,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the king is an Ocean.</note> but the Honour and the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

But if the Prince haue other Reasons, and other respects,
and that his thoughts go not the common way, it is not for them
to shew themselues difficult, neither must they attend a third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and it were better to dissemble and support some things
extraordinary to the Princes will, then to incense him. It is well

height: His Prouost went and tooke prisoners out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sergerie
of the Pallace, and caused them to bee drowned
right against the Mercers Grange. Towardes the end of his
dayes, hee found his Conscience much opprest with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Iustice: hee would haue repaired it, but he was come to
the Sabaoth of the weeke, when it was no longer lawfull to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>In Aprill 1482. hee sent vnto the Court of Parliament an Act

Princes are like worke-men, their Officers are the Iustruments with

all charges bee distinguished and haue their bounds, that the

            <p>The Princes eare is like vnto the Temple of the Goddesse

eares at his feete: Those which are vniust, are dead towards the
King, and mortall towards God for him that makes them: Wee
must speake vnto the King as if God vnderstood it, and none must
speake vnto God as if we were vnderstood by men. There are
some which demand things of Kings which they would not giue
to them that aske them, and others that would blush if the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which they make vnto God were knowne: Wherefore a Prince
sends such petitions to whom hee pleaseth to see if they bee iust
and ciuill; It were impossible for him to heare them and determine
them, without doing wrong to those affaires which require no
delay to resolue on. The greatnesse of his Maiesty is wronged
when as they make him discend into the care of base things.

Townes of Brabant, Brussels, Antwerpe, Macklin, and Louan, and
to leaue him the Country of Flanders in Soueraignety without

from the necessity of affaires, then from the Kings intention, who
desired nothing but to aduance his affaires in Bourgundy and

This great and profitable skill to diuide their minds, that might
hurt him, did not onely stetch to the seruants and ministers of the

<note n="n" place="margin">The Archduke <hi>Sigismond</hi> of Austria was wonne by the King, whose par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hee followed both against the Duke of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gondy, and the Archduke <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imilian.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which hee had made in his fauour, beleeuing them that sayd, that to shorten his hopes, hee would shorten his life.</note> and turned him sometimes against the Archduke <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
his perswasion being of such force with this Prince, (who was
good and tractable) as he made him beleeue that <hi>Maximilian</hi> had
designes against his life, the sooner to get possession of his Estates,
which were assured him after his death. <hi>Sigismond</hi> in the end disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
this fraud, and found that the ruine of the Archduke his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
toucht him so neere, as the Franch-County could not bee
lost, but the County of Feret would be also exposed to great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

of so mighty a neighbour; and therefore hee yeelded to a leuie of

to relieue and defend Dole, the chiefe Town of the Franch

entry to the rest of the Armie. The Towne was exposed to sacke

the Estates at Tours vpon this subiect, were vehement; and it
was particularly said, <hi>That the men at Armes, the Gentlemen of the

goe and fetch Wine, Fish, Spices, and other excessiue things from the

            <p>
               <hi>King</hi> Lewis <hi>the eleuenth sought to remedy these disorders, and

did it not effectually: for his Edicts had neither constancy nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.<note place="margin">Edict to reforme Souldiers.</note>
The Chronicle saith, that in the yeare 1474. being at
Creil, hee made an Edict touching the Men at Armes of his
Realme, by the which hee declared,</hi> That a Launce should keepe but
sixe horses: that is to say, the Launce three horses for himselfe, his
Page and Cutler, and the two Archers two horses, and one horse for the
Groome, and that they should no more haue Paniers to carry their Armes;
and withal, they should not lodge aboue one day in a village. <hi>And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouerit
was proclaimed,</hi> That no Merchant should sell vnto the said
Men at Armes, or lend any Silkes and Chamblets, vpon paine of loosing
the money which the said Souldiers might owe them by reason thereof:
and also that they should not sell vnto them any woolen-cloath of aboue
three shillings three pence an Ell.</p>
            <p>The disorder of Silkes was as great in those times as it had been
little knowne in precedent Ages.<note n="p" place="margin">
                  <hi>PHILIP</hi> the faire made an Ordonance for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of apparrel, according to the condition and difference of persons.

It allowes a Duke, Earle or Baron of sixe hundred pounds sterling a yeare rent, or more, to make foure suits of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell euery yeare, and no more, and as many for their wiues, and forbids Lawyers and Clarkes which are not in dignity, to make Gownes for their bodies of cloth of aboue sixteene Soulz the Ell of Paris.</note> This dissolution was one of the
causes of the rarenesse of Gold and Siluer, which was no more to
bee found but in Chaines of gold, and in their purses who had had
meanes to transport it out of the Realme to haue Silkes. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of France complained at Tours, and it was said, <hi>That euery
man was clad in Veluet and Silkes, and that there was not a Fidler,
Groome of the Chamber, Barber nor Souldier but ware it, that they had
Collers, or Rings of Gold on their fingers, like the Princes, and that there

could not leaue him in the ignorance of things necessary to reigne

            <p>When they haue searcht into the causes of this great desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they haue found that auarice hath contributed most; for when
as they found that great wealth was not gotten by the profession of
learning; that they which had consumed most in good bookes, had
wasted their estates vnprofitably, and contemned their fortunes:
that onely pleading got the graine and left but the straw for other
professions: Men studied no more to be learned but contented
themselues to be Doctors: The Law it selfe, which makes a great
part of polliticke knowledge, was, in a manner, abandoned, and
her excellencies dishonoured with an infinite number of ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
glosses and vaine questions: Wherefore Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3.
who laboured, more seriously then happely, to restore that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to honour, did often complaine that auarice had made the
Liberall Sciences Mechanicke, and that many past impudently
from the first precepts of Grammer, to the study of the Lawes, not
staying neither at Phylosophy, nor any other good Art: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
throughout all the East good bookes were not knowne but to
some rare and eloquent spirit, and in the West the Latine tongue
was growne barbarous, the Syriac vnknowne, and the Greeke so
odious, as it was no ignorance in the most learned to skip a Greek
word and not to reade it.<note n="t" place="margin">Ignorance is so shamelesse as shee glories of that shee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands not. In those times when they met with a Greeke word, they were dispenced with, if they made no stay at it, and the Reader said: <hi>Graecum est non legitur.</hi>

The taking of Constantinople did wholly ruine learning in the
East, and was the cause to make it reuiue in the West, by the care
of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the fifth, and of great <hi>Cosmo de Medicis,</hi> who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together the sad Relickes of this Shipwracke: They caused
the good bookes of all the Greeke Authours to be sought out and
preserued, and did lodge and entertaine them that were capable to
make them speake Lattine. This misfortune made them to arriue
in Italy as into a Port of safety, against the tempest of Greece, or
rather as some precious moueable rescued out of a great fire, they
found a sweete retreate, and an honourable resting place in the
house of <hi>Medicis.</hi>

               <p>To see things which God hath done in our time,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. chap. 13.</note> and doth daily,
shewes that he will leaue nothing vnpunished; And we may see
plainely that these strange workes come from him, for they are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall,
and his sodaine punishments, and especially against
them that vse violence and cruelty: Who, commonly, are no
meane men, but great Personages, either by their owne absolute
power, or by the Princes authority.</p>
               <p>When God meanes to change the fortune of a Prince,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. chap. 3.</note> from
good to bad, or from prosperity to aduersity, he prepares him ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of no force, suffers his seruants to become treacherous, and
makes him distrustfull and iealous of them that are most faithfull.
<hi>Example of</hi> Charles <hi>Duke of Bourgundy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God giues the Prince as he meanes to punish Subiects,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. chap. 9.</note> and to
Princes Subiects, and disposeth of their affections towards them
as he meanes to raise or ruine them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:14645:219"/>
God hath not created any thing in this world,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. chap. 18.</note> neither men nor
beasts, but he hath made him some thing opposite, to keepe him in
feare and humility.</p>
               <p>God speakes no more to men, neither are there any more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
which speake by his Mouth; For his Faith is ample and
plaine to all those that will heare and vnderstand it, and no man
shall be excused for Ignorance, at least they which haue had hope
and time to liue, and which haue had their naturall wits.</p>
               <p>The misery of Princes is when as God is so offended as hee
will no longer endure them,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. chap. 18.</note> but will shew his force and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Iustice, and then he doth first of all take away their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which is a great wound for them it toucheth: He troubles
their house, and suffers them to fall into diuision and murmure.
The Prince fals into such indignation with God, as hee flies the
counsell and company of wise men, and doth aduance Vp-starts,
Indiscreete, Vnreasonable, Violent men, and Flatterers, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
whatsoeuer he saith: If he must impose a peny, they say two:
If he threatens a man, they say he must be hanged; and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of all other things: And that aboue all things they cause them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be feared; They carry themselues insolently and proudly,
hoping that they shall be respected and feared by this meanes, as if
Authority were their inheritance.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Princes.</head>
               <p>THere is good and euill in Princes,<note place="margin">In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</note> for they are men like vnto
vs, and to God onely belongs perfection.</p>
               <p>When as the vertues and good conditions of a Prince are greater
then his vices,<note place="margin">In the same.</note> he deserues great praise; for that such personages are
more inclined to all voluntary things then other men, as well for
their breeding and little correction they haue had in their youth,
as for that comming to the age of man, most men seeke to please
them, and to applaude their humours.</p>
               <p>No man should attribute any thing to himselfe,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. chap. 4.</note> especially a
great Prince, but should acknowledge that grace and good fortune
comes from God.</p>
               <p>Great Princes are much more suspitious then other men,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. chap. 5.</note> for the
doubts and aduertisements which are giuen them, and oftentimes
through flattery without any necessity.</p>
               <p>Princes and they which rule in great Estates should bee very
carefull not to suffer any faction to grow in their house, from
whence this fire flies throughout the whole Prouince: But this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
not but by a Diuine instigation. For when as Princes or
Realmes, haue beene in great prosperity and wealth, and haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
from whence that Grace did come, God hath raysed them
enemies of whom no man doubted.</p>
               <p>God doth a great fauour vnto a Prince when he makes him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to winne men,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. chap. 9.</note> and it is a signe that he is not infected with the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14645:219"/>
odious vice and sinne of pride, which doth purchase hatred with
all men.</p>
               <p>Princes and great men that are proud and will not giue eare to
any,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. chap. 10.</note> are sooner deceiued then they that are affable and heare wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
               <p>God shewes a great grace vnto a Prince,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. chap. 10.</note> when he knowes good
and euill, especially when the good precedes.</p>
               <p>Aduersity teacheth a Prince to be humble,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. chap. 10.</note> and to please them
that he hath need of. <hi>Example of</hi> Lewis <hi>the eleuenth, expelled from
his fathers Court in his youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Prince which hath entred into league with others,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. chap. 12.</note> should
dissemble many things which may breed diuision betwixt them:
and as he is the stronger, so should hee bee more wise. It is the
counsell which the Lord of Contay gaue vnto the Earle of
Charolois, who was discontented; for that the Dukes of Berry and
Britany held councels in his chamber and presence, diuided from
him.</p>
               <p>I neuer knew Prince that could discerne the difference of men,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. chap. 12.</note>
vntill he had beene in necessity and in action.</p>
               <p>Princes haue sometimes need of them whom they haue contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<hi>Example in King</hi> Lewis <hi>the 11.</hi> Edward <hi>the 4. and the Earle of
Charolois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Princes impart their authority to them that are most pleasing
vnto them, both for the age which is most sortable vnto them, and
for that they are well conceipted of them: or sometimes they are
led by them who know and gouerne their delights. But they which
haue vnderstanding, returne soone when there is neede.</p>
               <p>I haue seene Princes of two humours, some so subtile and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. chap. 16.</note>
as no man knew how to liue with them, and they did still ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that they were deceiued: the others trusted enough in their
seruants: but they were so grosse and vnderstood their owne affaires
so ill, as they could not discerne who did them good or euill. And
these are presently changed from loue to hatred, and from hatred
to loue. And although that of both sorts there are few found
good, nor any great assurance in them: yet I had rather liue vnder
the wise then vnder fooles. For there is more meanes to purchase
their fauour: but with the ignorant there is no meanes to be found,
for that there is nothing done with them, but with their seruants
whom many change often. Yet euery man must serue and obey
them in the Countries where they are, for they are bound vnto it.</p>
               <p>To pardon, to be bountifull, or to do any other grace, are things
belonging to the Office of Princes.</p>
               <p>A Prince, or any other man, that was neuer deceiued, cannot be
but a beast, nor haue knowledge of good and euill, nor what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
there is.</p>
               <p>Men are not all of one complexion,<note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> and therefore the Prince
for the lewdnesse of one or two, should not forbeare to doe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to many. For one alone, being the least of all those to whom
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14645:220"/>
he hath done any good, may happily do such seruice as it shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
all the villanies which the others haue committed. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in the Hostages of Leige, whom the Duke sent away free, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the opinion of the Lord of Contay, who concluded to put them to
death, some made the Liegeois grow obstinate in their reuolt, others
were the cause of their reduction, and the instruments of the wise nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
of the Lord of Imbercourt to draw in the Duke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the greatest signes of Iudgement that a Prince can shew
is to draw vnto him vertuous and honest men: For he shall be held
in the opinion of the world to be of the disposition and humour of
such as are neerest about him.</p>
               <p>God hath not ordained the Office of a King or Prince to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
by beasts; nor by them who through vaine glory say, I am
no Clarke, I refer all to my Councell, I trust in them, and so giuing
no other reason, go to their sports: If they had beene well bred in
their youth, they would haue other reasons, and bee desirous that
both their persons and vertues should be esteemed.</p>
               <p>God cannot send a greater plague vnto a Country, then a
Prince of weake vnderstanding: for from thence proceed all other
miseries; First growes diuision and warre, for he alwaies puts his
authority into an other mans hand, the which hee should be more
carefull to keepe then any other thing, and from this diuision pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
famine and pestilence, and all other mischiefes which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
of warre.</p>
               <p>Princes hate them mortally that seeke to keepe them in
feare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wise Princes do alwaies in their Designes seeke some honest
and apparant coulour:</hi> Example in <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Estates to assemble at Tours, and there made his complaints
against the Duke of Bourgundy, to haue a Subiect to breake the peace.</p>
               <p>Of those bad Princes, and others, hauing authority in this
world, which vse it cruelly and tyrannously, not any, or few, haue
remained vnpunished: but it is not alwaies at a prefixed day, nor at
such time as they that suffer desire it.</p>
               <p>It is no blemish to Princes to be suspitious, and to haue an eye
ouer those that go and come: But it is a great shame to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and to loose by his owne errour; yet suspitions should haue a
meane; for to exceed is not good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A weake and couetous Prince endureth any thing:</hi> Example in
the Emperour <hi>Fredericke,</hi> whom the Authour cals a man of a faint
courage, and who endured all for feare of spending.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no reason a Prince should thrust himselfe into danger
for a small matter,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. chap. 1.</note> if God hath not abandoned him:</hi> Example in the
Duke of Bourgundy, who vndertooke a war against the Suisses for a very
light occasion, and without hope of profite, considering the nature of the
people and country.</p>
               <p>Princes giue not honours and riches at their pleasures that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them.<note place="margin">In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Princes feare not to thrust a seruant into danger if neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note>
The Duke of Bourgundy had commanded <hi>Phillip de Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
to go to Calice, which he durst not do without some assurance: The
Duke commanded him to passe on, although he should be taken, promising
to redeeme him.</p>
               <p>A Prince gouerned by other counsell then his owne doth in
the end returne to that which is most necessary for him:<note place="margin">Lib. 3. chap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Example
in the Duke of Brittany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Prince should alwaies feare to put any thing in hazard.<note place="margin">Lib. 6. chap. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There is not any man,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. chap. 12.</note> of what dignity soeuer, but doth suffer,
either in secret or in publicke, and especially they that cause others
to suffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The condition of two Princes, which haue beene enemies, is
therin miserable; that they cannot by any meanes assure themselues
one of an other.</hi> Example in <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, and <hi>Charles</hi> Duke
of Bourgundy: When they were together at Leige, there were not fifteene
daies past that they had made and sworne a Peace, and yet <hi>(saith the
Authour)</hi> there was no trust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The old age of a Prince makes him patiently to endure many
things:</hi>

               <p>VVIth wise and great deliberation,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. chap. 3.</note> and the Assistance of
Gods Grace, that Law and Ordonance was made in
France, that the daughters should not inherite the said Realme,
least it should fall into the hands of a forraigne Prince, for hardly
should the French euer haue endured it, neither do other Nations:
And in the end there is no great command whereas the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
doth not remaine to them which are of the Country; the which
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:14645:221"/>
you may see by France, whereas the English haue had a great
command within these forty yeares, and at this day they haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left but Callice, and two little Castles, which cost them
much to keepe: The rest they lost with much more ease then they
conquered it, and they lost more in one day then they got in a
yeare. The like wee may say by the Realme of Naples, the
Iland of Sicile, and other Prouinces, which the French haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
many yeares, and at this day there is no signe nor memory
of them, but by the Sepulchres of their Predecessours. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they should endure a Prince of a Forraine Nation, with a
small traine well ordered, and himselfe wise, yet shall they hardly
do it with a great number of men: For if he brings with him a great
Traine, or he sends for them vpon any occasion of warre, they fall
out with the Subiects, as well for the diuersity of their humours
and conditions, as for their violence, and for that they are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
in the Countrey as they that are borne there, and especially
when they seeke Offices, Dignities, and the Managing of
great affaires in the Country. A Prince that will shew himselfe
wise, when he goes into a Forraine Country, must reconcile all his
Townes, and if he bee endowed with this vertue (which onely
comes from the grace of God) it is to be esteemed before any other
thing: And if hee liue the age of a man hee shall haue great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and affaires, and all they that shall liue vnder him, especially
when hee shall come to age, and his men, and seruants, shall haue
no hope of amendement.</p>

at which time they haue no discourse but of pleasures: But when

whereof they speake, through loue or hatred, or for that they will
oppose one against another, and sometimes by the indisposition
of persons, for we must not hold that for Councell which is done
after dinner. Some may say, that men committing any of these er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
should not be of a Princes Councell. To whom I must answer
that we are all men, and he that would finde out such as should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
speake wisely, and should neuer be moued nor distempered,
must seeke them in Heauen, for they are not to bee found among
men: but to recompence it, there may bee some one in Councell
which shall speake very wisely, and much better then he hath beene
accustomed, and so one helpes another.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14645:222"/>

               <p>Ambassadours which come from true friends,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. Chap. 8.</note> and where there is
no cause of Ielousie, should be well entertained, and may see the
Prince often, according to the qualitie of the Princes person, for
if he be not wise nor honest, the lesse he is seene the better. If Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
come from Princes, which are not friends, they should be
receiued and intreated honourably, they must appoint trusty and
wise men to accompanie them, and dispatch them presently, for it
is a bad thing to keepe an enemy with him.</p>
               <p>Although warre were begunne,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. Chap. 8.</note> yet should they not breake off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Treaties or Ouertures that are made of Peace, (for they know
not when they shall haue neede of it) but intertaine them all, and
heare all Messengers, doing the said things, and keeping good gard,
what men should goe vnto them, and who should bee sent both by
day and night, but as secretly as might be. And for one message
or Ambassador which they should send me, I would send them two:
And although they were weary, saying, that I should not send any
more, yet would I send when as I should haue meanes and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie.
For you cannot send a better Spy, which should haue so
good meanes to see and vnderstand. And if they be two or three,
it is impossible to keepe so good gard ouer them, but the one or the
other will haue some speech, or learne some thing from some of
them: I meane holding honest tearmes, as they doe to Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.
And it is likely that a wise Prince will alwaies endeuor to haue
some friends with his aduerse party, and preuent it as hee can: for
in such affaires they cannot doe as they would; Some will say that
your enemy will grow more proud. I respect it not; for I shall
know more of his newes, and in the end shall reape both the profit
and honour. And although that others may doe the like with me,
yet will I not forbeare to send: And to this end will heare all practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and not breake any, but still find new matter. Moreouer, some
are not alwaies so iudicious as others, nor haue so great experience
in these affaires, neither haue they so great need. And in this case
the wisest gaine alwaies.</p>

               <p>It is dangerous for any one to hazard his estate vpon a battell,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Chap. 2.</note> if
he may auoide it. For although the number be small that he loose,
yet the hearts of his men are danted, and the change more then can
be imagined, as well in feare of their enemies, as in contempt of
of their Master and of their trustie seruants, and they fall into mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies
and practises, demanding more boldly then they were wont,
and they grow angry if they be refused. One Crowne before would
haue satisfied them better then three wil now. And if he that hath lost
be wise, he will not at such a time hazard any thing with them that
haue fled: But onely stand vpon his gard, and seeke out something
easie to vanquish, whereas they may be Masters to put fresh cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
into them, and take away feare. Howsoeuer, a lost Battell hath
alwaies a great traine, and bad for the looser: True it is that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
should seeke it to shorten their worke, especially they
that haue good footmen, and better then their neighbours, as wee
may say at this day the English or Suisses. I speake not this to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
other Nations, but those haue had great victories, and
their men are not to hold the field long without imploiment, as
the French or Italians can doe, who are wiser, or more easie to
leade. Contrariwise he that gaines growes into greater reputation
and esteeme with his men then before. His obedience encreaseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his subiects. In this estimation they grant him whatsoeuer
he demands, and his men grow more couragious and hardie: Also
the said Princes do sometimes grow so glorious and proud, as they
miscarry afterwards, and hereof I speak vpon knowledge: But such
grace comes onely from God.</p>
               <p>Euery one should be fearefull to hazard a battell that is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Chap. 4.</note>
But if there be no remedie, before he come to it, he must cast
all the doubts that can be thought on. For commonly they that
doe things fearefully make prouision for all euents, and gaine
oftener then they that proceed with pride: yet when God will haue
a hand in it nothing can preuaile.</p>
               <p>Euery man should doe what he may,<note place="margin">Lib. 2 Chap. 3.</note> and what he ought in a day
of Battell, and acknowledge that it is one of the accomplishments
of the worke of God, begun sometimes vpon small occasions, and
giuing victorie sometimes to the one, and sometimes to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>IT is an easie matter to begin Warre betwixt two great Princes,

and begin a warre: And I tell you that Kings and Princes are
much the stronger when they vndertake it with the consents of
the subiects, and are more feared of their enemies. When it is a

if it be from strangers, and therein good subiects should not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
nor refuse any thing, and the accident cannot be so sudden
but they may call some men, such as shall bee named. It is not
done without cause, and therein they vse no fixion, nor entertaine

And if he hath a faire Wife or a Daughter, hee shall doe well to

it, so as the men at Armes were payed euery two monethes at the

               <p>IT is a great aduantage for Princes to haue read Histories in their
youth,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Chap. 6.</note> where they may plainely read of such assemblies, and of the
great fraudes, deceipts and periuries, which some of the ancients
haue vsed one against another, hauing taken and slaine them that
haue relyed vpon such assurances. It is not said that all haue vsed it,
but the example of one is sufficient to make many wise, and to giue
them a will to stand vpon their gard: And in my opinion one of the
greatest means to make a man wise is to haue read ancient Histories
and to learne to gouerne himselfe wisely thereby, and by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
