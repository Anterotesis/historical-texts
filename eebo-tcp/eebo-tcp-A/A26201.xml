            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it conduced to the gaining of that vaſt eſtate) we ſhall ſet down

a Perſon that for ſome reaſons ſhall be nameleſſe) he allowed
him, beſides other accommodations, ſix ſhillings a week to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his dyet; of this ſix ſhillings, he for a twelve Moneth
together ſaved three and ſix pence <hi>thus:</hi> He uſually appointed
his Maſters Clients to meet him at the Golden Lyon in <hi>Bell-yard</hi>
in the morning, where it coſt him little or nothing, and thence
to his Maſter till Dinner time, and then with the ſame Clients
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45194:3"/>
he went to an Ordinary, where he would never allow himſelf
above a groat; he would uſually ſay of himſelf that ſince he
came from his Uncle, one <hi>Williams</hi> with whom he was inured
to this cloſeneſſe and partimony, he never ſpent <hi>a penny idely
upon any occaſion,</hi> but either upon his own abſolute neceſſities, or
elſe in ſuch Company where he was in actual purſuit of gain
and advantage; for this ſeemed to be a maxime with him.</p>
            <p>1 That whoſoever gave himſelfe to <hi>ſpend</hi> his <hi>money idely</hi>
ſhould find that thereby he diſorder'd the <hi>method of his affaires,
he weakned the ſtrength of his mind, he loſt thoſe happy houres and
opportunities of gaining more, he diſappointed thoſe that dealt with
him,</hi> ſo that he had better give away ſix pence, then ſpend
two pence; and this likewiſe he laid down for a rule, that that
Man was <hi>open</hi> to ruine and deſtruction that was given to lay
out money upon any Company or any other account <hi>upon hope</hi>
without a cleer inſight into that emolument he might have by
it, and as much aſſurance as can be made within humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability;
and therefore he uſed to ſay that Men of a ſanguine
complexion, much given to hope, could never be rich, there
being (as he obſerved) ſo much uncertainty in affaires, and ſo
much deceitfulneſſe in Men, that he would ſay, <hi>diſtruſt or beg.</hi>

            <p>In ſome time (the Perſon we mention got by his care and
good Husbandry) great credit with his Hoſt in Fetter-lane, a
very rich and thriving old Man, who admitted him to ſo much
familiarity with him, and put ſo much truſt in him, that he
committed to him his accounts, and allowed him his dyet,
with other faire advantages for his paines and care while he
lived, and made him one of his Executors when he dyed; In
that Will there was paſſed to the Executors for uſes therein

now one <hi>Killigrew</hi> laid claime to two Acres of Land, which
theſe Executors reckoned among the <hi>pertinentia,</hi> but in Law

that Mr. <hi>Killigrew</hi> claimed this eſtate as Brother to the Perſon
to whom the foreſaid Teſtator had deviſed his Land, defeated
him of the ſaid meſſuage, becauſe there appeared no intent to
make it an eſtate—tayl, but a fee-ſimple;— and beſides Mr.

Lands of forty pounds a year mortgaged to him for ſeven

            <p>BEſides his thrift in Dyet, he was very cloſe in Apparel;
for as the faſhion of thoſe times went, he wore a Trunk
Hoſe with Drawyers upon all occaſions, with a leather Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
and plate Buttons; and his ſpecial care was to buy good
Cloth, Linnen and Woolen, the beſt being beſt cheap, and to
keep them neat and clean, for he obſerved <hi>that diſt and dirt</hi> did
cloaths more <hi>harm then wearing;</hi> and ſince when his cloaths
were miſplaced, he would ſay to his ſervants, I weare cloaths
enough, you need not weare them too; he obſerved that the

the notes he gathered as he read, ſo that they might be

out a Commiſſion of <hi>Bankrupts</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Squire,</hi>
and the Commiſſioners by virtue of their commiſſion, ſold thoſe
goods to the Plaintiffe, <hi>Audley</hi> upon the three and twentieth
of <hi>Nov.</hi> aforeſaid, and the Defendants afterwards converted
them to other uſes,—this was argued ſeveral dayes at the
Barre, and the ſole queſtion was, whether <hi>John Hill</hi> and <hi>Alice
Squire</hi> becoming <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> after the extent and before the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45194:7"/>
Liberate the ſale of the goods by the Commiſſioners to the
Plaintiffe, <hi>viz. Audley</hi> were good enough, it was argued that
this ſale was good thus, <hi>viz.</hi> for not withſtanding this extent
the property of the goods remained in the conuſor, and by the
King are only ſeized into the Kings hands, but that ſhall not
deveſt any property from the Conuſors, for they be but as it
were in protection of the King; and then when the Conuſors
became <hi>Bankrupt</hi> before the Liberate, thoſe goods are in the
power of the commiſſioners to ſell and deſtribute among the
Creditors; but all the Court reſolved againſt <hi>Audley</hi> that
theſe goods extended before they became <hi>Bankrupts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by the Liberate after they became <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> could not
be ſold by the Commiſſioners, becauſe they being extend were
<hi>quali in cuſtodia legis,</hi> ſo as the Conuſors have not any power to
give, ſell, or diſpoſe of them, and it was therefore with much
a do adjudged for the Defendant.</p>
            <p>Theſe intricate Caſes make up <hi>Audleys</hi> life, a life of intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies
and miſteries, wherein he walked as in amaze; and went
on as in a labyrinth with the clue of a reſolved mind, which
made plaine to him all the rough paſſages he met with; he
with a round and ſolid mind faſhioned his own fate, fixed and
unmoveable in the great tumults and ſtir of buſineſs, the hard
<hi>Rocke</hi> in the middeſt of Waves.</p>
            <p>He took care to accompany himſelf with ſome Grave and
reverend Divine to his dying day; from whom if he gained
not piety, he gain'd the reputation of it, you ſhould have in
his Chamber upon the Table a large Bible, &amp; Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi>
Sermons, and if you ſurprized him not you might find him
buſie with one of theſe Bookes; but if you come ſuddenly he
was in his Cloſet,—he was a great frequenter of the Church
in the time of Divine Service; but for Sermons he cared not
for them, and he was ſomething concerned to ſee Religion (as
he uſed to ſay) <hi>made a meer Preach;</hi> he would uſually ſay that
we might very well content our ſelves to go to Heaven the old
and good way which our forefathers went in; what (ſaith he)
are we wiſer then our forefathers?—ſeek wiſdome among the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45194:7"/>
Ancient and in length of dayes underſtanding, yea in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as well Religious as Civill this was his rule; <q>that the
judgements of men experienced, aged, and wiſe, yea though
they ſpeak without any proofe or demonſtration, are no leſs
to be hearkned unto, then as being demonſtrations in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
becauſe ſuch mens long obſervation is as an eye, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they preſently and plainly behold thoſe principles that
ſway over all actions;</q> that which makes men wiſe is the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of principles out of their own particular experiments;
and the framing of our particular experiments according to
the rule of their principles will make us ſuch as they are;—
the times will never be well (he ſaid) untill we had Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeths</hi>
Proteſtants againe in faſhion,—here's now one ſaith
one thing, and another ſaith another, ſo that a man cannot tell
what Religion to be of; he obſerved that the great ſcandall of
our Religion is the great <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> of our Clergy men; they
muſt have their hundreds and thouſands a year when as fome
fifty or threeſcore might ſatisfie an honeſt man to buy him a
few Books, and meat, and drink, and cloathing, wherewith he
ſhould be contented; for he allowed not marriage in a Clergy
man, for ſaid he their <hi>Children never thrived;</hi> and their Wives
were uſually left in a poor condition, when the Parſon is alive,
they lead a merry life; but when the Parſon is dead and gone,
where then is the Parſons Wife; truely he wondred what the
Papiſt meant when he affirmed that the poor ſinner ſhould be
ſaved by his workes; I reſt ſaid he often in this, that ſalvation
is not of workes but of grace; for if of workes then we ſhould
have ſomething to boaſt, but when we have done all, we are
but <hi>unprofitable ſervants;</hi> he would much complaine of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
preaching of the late times, when he could hear
of nothing but of Hell and damnation, whereas they are prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the Goſpel,—the glad tidings of Salvation; he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
upon the Lords Prayer as an abſolute forme of Prayer to
which none can adde by any their new inventions, which he
would conſtantly ſay morning and evening;—Virginity he
looked upon as meritorious, and therefore he would ſay to an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45194:8"/>
old Maid of his, I like thee the better becauſe thou art unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed,
to which ſhe replyed, In troth maſter I like you the <hi>worſe
becauſe you are unmarryed;</hi> he thought all Religion conſiſted in
this, <hi>Do unto others as thou wouldeſt have others do unto thee;</hi>
this is the Law and the <hi>Prophets.</hi>

            <p>WHen he had ſetled himſelf in a very good Eſtate, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to quit his ſmall gaines at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> and to fly;
at ſome greater ones at Court, he buyeth an excellent place at
the Court of Wards for 3000. <hi>l.</hi> where he got this vaſt Eſtate,
of which place being asked what was the value of it by the
year, he anſwered (as another in the like caſe) that it might be
worth ſome thouſands of pounds to him, who after his death
would go inſtantly to Heaven, twice as much to him who
would go to Purgatory; and no body knowes what to him
who would adventure to go to Hell; one asked our old man
how he made a ſhift to live ſo long?—he anſwered I have a
good place at Court, and ſeldome doth a man die in a good
place there; in the Court of Wards he gained money by doing
a good Office, <hi>viz.</hi> in hindring ſome great perſons to make a
prey of young Heires, for ſome fees allowed him by the Heires
relations, and therefore he was the father of the fatherleſs:
Although the three Honourable perſons under whom he lived,
looked upon the livings that fell into their hands by wordſhips
as theirs to diſpoſe of, and not to make profit by; in ſo much
that one of them when two rich Parſons endeavoured to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
one another in offering great ſummes of money for a great
place; asked a third Parſon who ſtood by looking for a ſmall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45194:8"/>
living but of great worth, what will you Sir give for this
great place? not a peny anſwered he, for it is againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
then ſaith the Honourable perſon, you Sir deſerve the
place beſt, you ſhall have it, though I ſay they were ſo juſt that
they were deafe to all importunity, beſides that of a known
worth, joyned with piety and induſtry, yet this Gentleman
under them made great advantages of ſuch things, that in vaine
did thoſe maſters throw away the bribes when this ſervant
might catch them up at the firſt rebound, yea before ever they
come to the ground; as we know what Lord Keeper it was in
the later dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who thought himſelf an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
man, was ſpoken of for the buſineſs of his ſervants in the
ſale of Eccleſiaſticall livings; he had the beſt way for the cleane
conveyance of ſymoney of any man in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that old
wayes of Symoney which were uſed in the Ancients times (as
appeares by the Councells prohibiting them) were but bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to the cunning contrivance of the Symony engineeres in
our times; as if they cared not to go to Hell, ſo it were not
the neereſt way, bnt that they might fetch a far compaſſe round.</p>
            <p>1 He would tye the Clarke to give him a Bond of ſo much
money to reſigne at within 8. or 10. moneths after inſtitution
and induction; the forfeiture of which Bond was his money
for the living.</p>
            <p>2 He would take a Leaſe of a Parſonage under value for
three yeares, and ſo gaine his wiſhed for ſumme, in ſo much
that he was called the <hi>Parſons Tenant;</hi> being asked how he
thought to be ſaved? he anſwered he hoped his Landlords
would pray for him;—and being asked whether he was not
afraid of a curſe upon his Eſtate from Church livings ſo ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouſly
obtained? he anſwered that he thought that Church
goods bleſſed him; for ſaid he <hi>a little that a man hath of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
mans, is better then if he had all the riches of the ungodly;</hi> and
withall he added that if the Clergy could in conſcience allow
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45194:9"/>
money for their benefices, he could in conſcience receive it,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>He was obſerved very ſucceſſefull, inſinuating with the maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

of <hi>Naſſan</hi> that popular Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> is ſaid to wine a
Subject from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to his own party every time
he put off his Hat; ſo it was ſaid that as often as <hi>Audley</hi> put
off his Hat to the maſter of the Court of Wards and Liveries;
he gained a young Heir; It's diſcourſed of him (though I do
not beleive it) that he joyned with another in all cauſes in the
Court of Wards and Liveries, that one ſhould be for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe,
whom charity preſumed alwayes injured; the other for
the Defendant who was to be pittyed as compelled to Law,
with this condition to reſtore the money to the party againſt
whom the cauſe went, to give him his due, he was a good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
for he would not only hear, but examine his client, and
pinch his cauſe where he found it was foundred, for he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that many clients in telling their caſe, rather plead then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it, ſo that the Advocate heareth not the true ſtate of it,
till opened by the adverſe party; thoſe men who underſtood
more then all before the client hath told halfe runne without
their errand, and will returne without their anſwer, if the
matter were doubtfull, he would only warrant his own dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<q>yet ſome keep an aſſurance office in the Chamber, and
will warrant any cauſe brought unto them, as knowing that
if they fail, they looſe nothing but what was loſt long ſince
their credit; when his name was up, his induſtry was not
down:</q> for he ſaid he could not live by his credit but his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;—
there was an Heir belonged to the Court of Wards,
about whoſe Lands this was a controverſie where his Lands lay,
ſaith <hi>Audley</hi> if you cannot find his Lands in the Country, how
can we find them here.</p>
            <p>A Lord borrowing money of our <hi>Audley</hi> when he

            <p>In his place he kept Servants long: being asked the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
I keep them awhile, becauſe I have need of them; and I
will keep them awhile, becauſe they have need of me. Bnt
indeed he knew that there was nothing better than an old
Servant, as who had made his Maſters Intereſt his own, with
whom he would live and dye; and as one who underſtood
his Maſters buſineſs by long acquaintance and experience. He
had once fallen out with a Gentleman, who ſhewed him ſome

               </gap>gs he would ſpend againſt him; he asked, Whether they
had any bottom? Yes, ſaid the Gentleman: Nay, then I
care not; for here I have a conſtant Spring, and I cannot
ſpend in other Courts more than I gain in this Court.</p>
            <p>During his continuance in his Office at the Wards, he
would complain that there were ſo many Knights who were
ſo poor; Nay (ſaid a Gentleman of a free Speech and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour)
I hope you Mr. <hi>Audley</hi> will build Almes-houſes
for all theſe poor Knights. He perſwaded a Gentleman to

            <p>In the Court of Wards he watched the Incumbrances that
lay upon the Eſtates that came thither, and he undertook
them, complying with the Neceſſities of the Owners, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

to riſe higher, for I fore-ſee my Fall; which happened ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
juſt before the late War, when the Court of
Wards was put down; whereby, with other Accidents, he
loſt above an Hundred thouſand Pounds. He would ſay,
That his ordinary Loſſes, were as the ſhaving of his Beard,
which would grow the faſter thereby. The loſing of this
place, was like the loſing of a Member, which was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable.</p>
            <p>About that time he would needs be diſcourſing of the
Vanity and Trouble of this World, and of his Intention to
retire to a private Life; whereupon a merry Friend of his,
told him a Story of an old Rat, <q>That would needs leave
the World, and therewith acquainted the young Rats,
that he would retire into his Hole, and ſpend his dayes
ſolitarily, and would enjoy no more Comfort, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them upon his High Diſpleaſure, not to come in unto
him. In Obedience to his Command, they forbear two
or three dayes; at laſt, one was more hardy than the reſt,
incited ſome of his Fellowes to go in with him, and he
would venture to ſee how his Father did, for he might be
dead. They accordingly went in, and found the old
Rat ſitting in the midſt of a rich Parmezan Cheefe, gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45194:10"/>
with all its Might.</q> He encouraged them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
and would ſolemnly ſay of them openly, That
they were Horſe-leeches, that only ſucked the corrupted
blood of the Law: He trades only in Quirks and Tricks,
his High-way is in By-paths, and he loveth a Cavil, better
than an Argument; an Evaſion, than an Anſwer. He had
this property of an honeſt man, That his Word was as good
as his Bond; or he could pick the Lock of the ſtrongeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance,
or creep out at the Lattice of a word; therefore he
counted, to enter common with other, as good as his own
ſeveral; for he would ſo vex his Partners, That they had
rather forego their Right, than undergo a Suit with him; he
would fall in uſually with thoſe Perſons that he ſaw
fell out.</p>

may, ſaid he, but let me, ſaid he, have ſome ſix or ſeven Suits
for my <hi>recreation:</hi> he would keep company with the Benchers

that they ſhould Club for Wine, or Ale and Tobacco, he
would ſay (Gentlemen) I will go along with you as far as a <hi>penny</hi>
goeth; when they reply'd, what can a penny do? he would
ſay more then you imagine: <hi>for there is not a penny you ſpend

fie, why are you ſo Idle? there is not an hour in the day, but you

might gain ſix pence in, and ſure two pence: It's a ſad thing
he would ſay, to ſee Gentlemen, under pretence to learn Law,
here learn to be lawleſs: not knowing by their ſtudy ſo much as
what an Execution means, till they Learn it by their own dear
experience: By his Scriveners means he grew acquainted with
moſt of theſe young gallants; nor were the youngſters ſo needy,
as the other was ready to feed them with money, ſometimes
with a courteous violence, forcing upon them more then they
deſired, provided the ſecurity were good, or the advantage
great: ſometimes he would adventure to truſt, if his eſtate in
hope were over meaſure, though he himſelf were under age;
he adviſeth them to be good husbands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſell firſt the ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
part of their Eſtates, perſwading them that they ſhould
not be ſenſible of ſuch Sales, which would make their means
more entire, as counting the gathering of ſuch ſcattering rents,
rather burdenſom than profitable: this he would have at half the
value, ſo that the feathers would buy the gooſe, and the wood pay
for the ground: and when the poor Gentleman had with his
money ſtopped one gap by prodigality, he would open another:
O how the Principal, the Uſe, the Uſe upon Uſe ſwell the debt
to an incredible ſumme, until half the Eſtate was ſold, and
then the old man knew, that when half the Eſtate was gone,
the Gentleman would live as if he enjoyed the whole; and
though he abated in Poſſeſſions, he abated not in Expences:
how cunningly would he put his decoying Gentleman upon ſuch
projects as in hope of recovery would ruine them, or it may
be, which is worſt, he would engage two decaying Gentlemen
together, until they both miſcarried: how ſubtilly would he
let his debts grow on until they became to a conſiderable ſumme:

            <p>TO give him his due, he had a courage as a Maſter extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
that made him Overſeer of all his buſineſs, either in
perſon or providence, ſo that a thrifty Fellow that ſerved him,
gained not above 400 pound under him, in the ſpace of thirty
years: He was very careful in his Accounts: This being a Rule
with him, <hi>If the Maſter makes no Account of his ſervant,
the Servant will make ſmall Account of the Maſter,</hi> and cares
not what he ſpendeth or doeth, who is never brought to an
<hi>Audit</hi> and Reckoning: He would ſay, That the duſt that fell
from the Maſters ſhooes, was the beſt Compoſt to manure
ground.</p>
            <p>He allowed his Servant board-wages, whereby they might
provide for themſelves what was wholeſome, ſufficient and
neceſſary: The Wages he contracted for, he duly and truly
payed his Servants. If he finds a ſervant utterly unuſeful, ſo
that he cannot fairly prevail with him to do him any good or
himſelf, he rid his hands of him, and fairly put him away;
neither diſcompoſing himſelf in fretting at him, nor troubling
himſelf in correcting him: ſuch things being neither fit for him,
nor uſeful for his ſervant, which might torment him, but not
reform him, and ſo make him keep his faults, and forſake his
Maſter:—He loved dearly thoſe ſervants that continued
with their Maſters: Therefore he allowed at his death ten
pound apeece to forty Maids that had continued three years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their Maſters. He ſaid, he deſired not a wiſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
who would not do, but diſpute: and he obſerved, that
ſimple ſervants (underſtand ſuch, whoſe capacity is bare mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
without ſurpluſage equal to the buſineſs he is uſed in) are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45194:12"/>
more uſeful, becauſe more managable then other men, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in matters wherein not thier brains, but hands are required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet if a Maſter out of want of experience enjoyns him to do
what is hurtful or prejudicial to his own State, Duty herein
makes him undutiful, if not to deny, to demur in his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and chooſing rather to diſpleaſe then hurt his Maſter,
he humbly repreſents his reaſons to the contrary: he deſired
that a ſervant ſhould make true, direct and dutiful Anſwers to
his Maſter, and he liked the ſervant that induſtriouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to provide ſomething for himſelf whereby he may be
maintained in his old age.</p>

            <p>COmpany is the greateſt pleaſure of the nature of man: yet
he reckoned ſolitarineſs better then a debauched compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
for the wildneſs of the place is only uncheerful while the
wildneſs of looſe perſons is dangerous: he would not avoid
miſcarriages onely, but the very occaſions of them: among
which bad company (the limetwigs of the Devil) is the chiefeſt
eſpecially to catch thoſe natures, which like the good fellow
<hi>Planet Mercury</hi> are moſt ſwayed by others: in all company he
ſtood upon his guard, and though with them, yet he was not
of them: the company he kept was the comment whereby he
diſcovered the cloſeſt man: Let other men ſtudy Books, he for
his part would ſtudy Men.</p>
            <p>He liked that Proverb very well: He that eats Cherries with
Noble men, ſhall have his eyes ſpirred out with the ſtones; for
he obſerved that they who live conſtantly with men above their
Eſtates, ſhall reap ſhame and loſſe thereby: if thou payeſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45194:12"/>
payeſt along with them, thou wilt be thine own ruine: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was very welcome to his betters, as being ſuch a one
as though he paid not a penny of the ſhot, he ſpends enough in
lending them his time and diſcourſe; and he would ſay he might
loſe, but could not gain by inferiors company: he liked men
of a communicative nature, remote diſcourſes, were as full, as
fluent, and their judgements were as right as their tongues rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
—His friends were few, but choice: his great friends
uſed to wait upon him in great ſtate to gain credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute:
one among the reſt came always attended with a large
retinue, who it ſeems were onely hired for the time, and ſo
diſmiſſed when the complement was over; this was obſerved
by the old man: and one time the Grandee taking his leave
of him with extraordinary Complements, ſpare your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
ſaid he, for I believe I ſhall ſhortly ſee you again,
but let me, I pray you, ſalute your ſervants whom I ſhall never
ſee again: he loved ſerious men, and would ſay that a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
jeſt make fools laugh, and wiſe men frown; Its good to
make a jeſt that is harmleſs mirth, but it is naught to make
a trade of jeſting, that is weak folly: he could not endure to
hear any abuſed who were dead; for to wrong their memories,
is to wrong their ghoſt of their winding ſheet: he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dute
any ſhould ſcoff at their defects who are not able to
amend them; nor to have any flouted for his profeſſion if it
were honeſt and painful: he would ſay, <hi>He that loſeth his
friend for a jeſt, deſerves to die a beggar in the bargain: yet
ſome think their conceit like muſtard, not good except they bite:</hi>
Friend, friend, ſuch let thy jeſts be that they may not grind the
credit of thy friend, and make not jeſt; ſo long, until thou

rejoyced to ſee his Tenants thrive, yea, looketh upon it as a
great honour to himſelf, when he perceived that God bleſſeth

in this Caſe, as with the Drunkard. If the Drunkard
ſhould ask me againſt which of the ten Commandments he
offended, I confeſs I could not readily give him a direct pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Anſwer: Not that he ſinneth not againſt any, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſinneth againſt ſo many of them, that it is hard to

by diſtempering his Body; he ſinneth againſt
the ſeventh, by enflaming his luſt; he ſinneth againſt the
eighth, by making waſte of the good Creatures of God.
Right ſo is it with our <hi>Vſurer</hi> in this Caſe: He would poſe
me, that ſhould ask me the Queſtion, Which of theſe three
Rules fetcheth in the <hi>Vſurer,</hi> and his Calling. Verily I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

howſoever, among the three, I am ſure I have him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
be ſimply unlawful (as moſt of the Learned have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded)
then the firſt Rule hath him. I ſhould be very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to condemn any thing as ſimply unlawful, which any
even imaginary conjuncture of Citcumſtances would render
lawful; and would chooſe rather by an over-liberal Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to <hi>cover a multitmde of ſins</hi> (if I may abuſe the Apoſtles
phraſe to that ſenſe) than by a too ſuperſtitious Reſtraint
make one. Yet the Texts of Scripture are ſo expreſs, and
the grounds of Reaſon brought by learned Men, ſeem ſo

Charity in my ſelf, as to abſolve any kind of <hi>Vſury</hi> (proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo called) with what Cautions or Circumſtances ſoever
qualified, from being a ſin. But I will ſuſpect mine own,
and the common Judgment herein, and admit for this once,
<hi>(dato non conceſſo)</hi> That <hi>Vſury</hi> be in ſome Caſe lawful, and
ſo our <hi>Vſurer</hi> eſcape the firſt Rule, which yet cannot be,
till his Teeth be knocked out for biting: But you muſt
knock out his Brains too, before he eſcape our ſecond Rule.
I dare ſay, the moſt learned <hi>Vſurer</hi> that liveth (and they
ſay ſome learned Ones are <hi>Vſurers)</hi> will never be able to
prove, That <hi>Vſury</hi> (if it be at all lawful) is ſo lawful, as
to be made a Calling. Here all his Doctors, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45194:17"/>
and his Advocates leave him. For can it poſſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into any reaſonable mans Head to think, That a man
ſhould be born for nothing elſe, bnt to tell out Money, and
take in Paper? which if a man had many Millions of gold
and ſilver, could take up but a ſmall portion of that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
time which God would have ſpent in ſome honeſt and
fruitful Employment. But what do I ſpeak of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of reaſonable men in ſo plain a matter, wherein I dare
appeal to the Conſcience, even of the <hi>Vſurer</hi> himſelf; and
it had need be a very plain matter, that a man would refer to
the Conſcience of an <hi>Vſurer.</hi> No honeſt man need be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of an honeſt Calling; if then the <hi>Vſurers</hi> Calling be
ſuch, what need he care who knoweth, or why ſhould he
ſhame with it? If that be his Trade, why doth he not in
his Bills and Bonds, and Noverints, make it known to all
men by thoſe Preſents that he is an <hi>Vſurer,</hi> rather than write
himſelf Gentleman or Yeoman, or by ſome other ſtile? But
ſay yet our <hi>Vſurer</hi> ſhould eſcape, at leaſt in the Judgment of
his own hardned Conſcience, from both theſe Rules, as
from the Sword of <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Hazael:</hi> There is yet a third
Rule, like the Sword of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to ſtrike him ſtone-dead, and

when for a certain ſpace the Mountain forbore to ſend forth
flames, Mr. <hi>Greſham,</hi> with eight of the Sailors, aſcended the
Mountain, approaching as near the vent as they durſt, where,

given to Violence and Oppreſſion, eſpecially towards his
Poor Tenants and Vaſſals: but God ſuffered it not long to go
unpuniſhed: for the Night before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day, as he lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep
in his Houſe at <hi>Lockwood</hi> ſeven Miles from the City of
<hi>Glaſcow,</hi> he heard a voice ſummoning him to appear before the
Tribunal of Chriſt, and give an account of his doings: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he awaked, and being greatly terrified, he called to his
Servants to bring light, and ſit by him: he himſelf alſo took a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45194:19"/>
Book in his hand and began to read: but the Voice calling the
ſecond time, ſtruck all the Servants to an amazement: the ſame
Voice calling the third time far Louder and more Fearfully, the
Biſhop, after a heavy groan, was found dead in his Bed: his
Tongue hanging out of his Mouth: A fearful Example of Gods
Judgment againſt the Sin of Covetouſneſs and Oppreſſion.</p>

this Hiſtory following to poſterity, as a
moſt certain thing:</head>
               <p>THat <hi>Leontius Apamienſis</hi> a moſt faithful
religious man that had lived many
years at <hi>Cyrene</hi> aſſured them, that <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſius</hi>
(who of a Philoſopher became a B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>.) found
at <hi>Syrene</hi> one <hi>Evagrius</hi> a Philoſopher, who had bin
his old acquaintance, fellow ſtudent and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
friend, but an obſtinate Heathen: and
<hi>Syneſius</hi> was earneſt with him to become a
Chriſtian, but all in vain: yet did he ſtill follow
him with thoſe Arguments that might ſatisfie
him of the Chriſtian verity; and at laſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
told him, that to him it ſeemed but a
meer fable and deceit that the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
teacheth men, that this world ſhall have an
end, and that all men ſhall riſe again in theſe
bodies, and their fleſh be made immortal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,
and that they ſhall ſo live for ever,
and receive the Reward of all that they have
done in the body, and that he that hath pity on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45194:20"/>
the poor, lendeth to the Lord, and he that gives
to the poor and needy ſhall have Treaſures in
heaven, and ſhall receive an hundred-fold from
Chriſt, together with eternal life. Theſe things
he derided. <hi>Syneſius</hi> by many arguments aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him that all theſe things were certainly true:
and at laſt the Philoſopher and his children
were Baptized. A while after he comes to <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſius,</hi>
and brings him three hundred pound of
Gold for the poor, and bid him Take it, but give
him a Bill under his hand that Chriſt ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
it him in another world. <hi>Syneſius</hi> took the
mony for the poor, and gave him under his hand
ſuch a Bill as he deſired. Not long after the
Philoſopher being near to death, commanded
his ſons that when they buried him, they ſhould
put <hi>Syneſius</hi> Bill in his hand in the Grave;
which they did: And the third day after, the
Philoſopher ſeemed to appear to <hi>Syneſius</hi> in the
night, and ſaid to him, <hi>(Come to my Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre

received the Debt and am ſatisfied; which

was buried with him, but ſent to his ſons who told
