            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>n that Feſtival. This I have done not only as <hi>compliant</hi> with your Chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:31803:3"/>
Commands, but as ſolicitous to <hi>conform</hi> all my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the publick Good of your City, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Countrey. In w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> a great part of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> and many precious ſouls, as well as mens bodies, Lives, Liberties, Honours and Eſtates are embarqued: All which have for our ſins been long engaged in a tempeſt of <hi>War</hi> and ſea of <hi>Blood;</hi> nor have they been able to make any fair <hi>Port</hi> or happy <hi>Haven</hi> theſe many years, ſince they loſt their Pilots and Compaſs, their Kings and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, by the various <hi>Euroclydons</hi> of mens paſſions, Luſts and Intereſts; which have toſſed them to and fro with every wind; &amp; made great waſte of all that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious for Religion, Juſtice and Honour, beſides Eſtates and Lives of men in the three Kingdomes; threatning all either with ſpeedy and utter <hi>Shipwrack</hi> by forreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, or an everlaſting ſtorm by domeſtick confuſions; untill the unexpected and undeſcerned providence of God began to open to your and the Countryes prayers <hi>ſome door of hope,</hi> by the prudent, valiant and ſuccesfull Conduct of the preſent Lord General <hi>Monck:</hi> from whom all good men expect all good things: nor can he deceive them without deceiving and deſtroying himſelf and his Countrie.</p>
            <p>Your gratitude to God for this ſeaſonable dawning of Mercy (which ſeems to beſpeak a great calm) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd your ſolemn Convention that day; and my preaching to you. In which work you cannot wonder if I endeavoured to ſhew my ſelf a <hi>Work-man</hi> that needed not to be <hi>afraid</hi> or <hi>aſhamed;</hi> being very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with you of the great, many and long hurts of the <hi>daughter of my people,</hi> both in Church and State: I then declared them to you: I deplored them
<pb facs="tcp:31803:3"/>
with you; I propoſed the methods of cure to you, as fully as the time would permit; and as freely as became my duty to my God and my conſcience. As I would not injure any man, or feſter the times: ſo I abhor to flatter them, which is the greateſt injury a Preacher can do to Church and State.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>I</hi> hear were offended (the fate of Chriſts, of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts, and of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching) at the plain dealing I uſed (which poſſibly was from their own rawneſs and ſoreneſs, more then from my roughneſs or ſharpneſs) As I aim to do things faithfully &amp; ſeaſonably, ſo decently and diſcreetly: Nor do I think I am to learn thoſe <hi>Cenſorious Catos</hi> how to preach, any more than they will learn of me how to buy and ſell; or how to fight and war. No man may wonder if I dare to reprove thoſe ſins which ſome dare to do, or approve, but dare not hear of, or repent.</p>
            <p>The parrheſie or freedom of my ſpeech as a man, a Chriſtian, and a Preacher was ſuch, as became my feeling of the publick miſeries; my deſire of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick tranquility, and my ſenſe of that fidelity I ow to God, to my Countrey, to you, and to my own ſoul.</p>
            <p>Theſt are not times to palliate and ſpeak ſmooth or ſoft things: Never age had fouler humours or prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tumours; more felt and more painfull; more hard, and leſs mollified; Theſe I would help to cure, that ſo we might recover publick health, together with out wits, and reaſon; our Laws and Religion, our good Conſcience and Government: our Peace and Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: all which we have loſt, ſince we loſt our heads in Church and State. Our full and free Parliaments, conſiſting of King, Lords and Commons; in which
<pb facs="tcp:31803:4"/>
the ſoule and life, the honour and happineſs of theſe Nations are bound up.</p>
            <p>And no part of it is more concerned then your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſometime flouriſhing, and ſtill populous City; in whoſe happineſs the whole Nation will be happy, and in its miſery all muſt be miſerable. Since <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is not only as a ponderous <hi>Byas</hi> to the great bowl, (which draws all parts towards it) But it is as the <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſse, Lady</hi> or <hi>Queen,</hi> to which every <hi>Village, City</hi> and <hi>Countrey</hi> of the Nation (as officious <hi>Hand-maids</hi>) ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to preſent all manner of coſtly comlyneſs; not only feminine, as the ſuperfluity of peace and plenty; but alſo maſculine; for <hi>London</hi> is (like <hi>Pallas</hi> furniſhed as with men of Counſel and Conduct; ſo with Treaſure and Strength, with all ſorts of Armes and Aminition; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Camera Imperii Britanici,</hi> The Metropolis of the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Empire, a vaſt Magazine of men &amp; money, a nurſery of all Arts, Mechanick, Ingenuous and Military: a great entertainer of Learning; and a noble encourager of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wanting nothing to make it ſelf and the Nation happy, if it have ſuch heroick minds and honeſt hearts, as become ſo rich, ſo great, and ſo Chriſtian a City.</p>

            <p>I hope God hath prepared bleſſings for you, and by you for the whole Nation; by opening your eyes, humbling your hearts, diſpoſing your minds, and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your ſpirits to thoughts of Juſtice and Piety; of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Reſtitution and Peace: We have had <hi>wounds</hi> and <hi>hurts</hi> enough; <hi>ſlight healings,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong Deluſions</hi> too many.

            </p>
