            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>For the Honourable
ROBERT BOYL, Esquire.</head>
            <p>I Know nothing (Sir) more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with right Reason, or which
deserves more to be Reform'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Learned men, than their way
of Dedicating Books: And that we
may the better understand what ought
to be done in this Age, let us look back
into what was done by the Antients.</p>
            <p>The Poets did indeed invoke their
Gods or the Muses in the beginning of
their Works, but that was rather to
obtain their assistance, than to bestow
upon them Panegyricks; but their
praising the Gods was a safe Subject
in which they could not exceed: And
therefore, though these Invocations
were the first occasion of writing Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to Mortals, yet Flattery in this
made them mistake their Model so
far, that at last some of the Poets did
likewise invoke the Assistance of their
<pb facs="tcp:53064:3"/>
Emperours, as if they had been Gods
as well as Patrons.</p>
            <p>Others of the Poets did very anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
Dedicate their Works to Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
as <hi>Hesiod</hi> who was older than <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
dedicates or rather addresses his
first Poem to <hi>Perses;</hi> but 'tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that he and others in such
like Addresses rather excite the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom they address to Vertue
and Glory, than magnify them for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
attain'd to the perfection of either
or both. Yet some of these Poets have
left us Dedications so excellent, that
they are as little to be imitated as
censur'd, such as:</p>
            <bibl>Hor. Epist. 1. Lib. 2.</bibl>
            <l>Cum tot sustineas &amp; tanta Negocia solus:</l>
            <l>Res Italas Armis tuteris: moribus ornes:</l>
            <l>Legibus emendes: in publica Commoda peccem,</l>
            <l>Si longo Sermone morer tua tempora, Caesar.</l>
            <p>And others of them, such as <hi>Virgil,</hi>
end their Poems with very decent and
delicate Complements, as that which
closes the <hi>4th</hi> Book of his <hi>Georgicks,</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53064:3"/>
which exceed, in my humble Opinion,
the fam'd and large Dedications of
<hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Causabon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was usual amongst the modest An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
to address their Books to such
as they thought able to correct them,
seeking rather Advice than Patronage:
And thus <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us in the
Life of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> That <hi>Scylla</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
wrote an History, sent it to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi>
to be corrected;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and
the <hi>Greek</hi> word used there,
seems to me to import only <hi>adlocutio.</hi>
And I think that the Antients have
found Protection and Patronage even
in those Addresses wherein Advice
was sought for; who durst have cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd,
as <hi>Tully</hi> observes, what <hi>Brutus</hi>
or <hi>Pomponius Atticus</hi> approved?</p>
            <p>Some also prefixt modest Prefaces,
wherein they acknowledged the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
done them, and told the occasion
of their Writing, as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus;</hi>
others did thereafter in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Writers of <hi>Tragedies</hi>
and <hi>Comedies,</hi> address themselves in
a Prologue, as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:53064:4"/>
               <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and this I think he did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to give his Fancy scope, as a Poet, to
praise with the Latitude that Poets
take; for that is the first Debauch
I find committed of this kind,
for he could not have said greater
things to a worse Man.</p>
            <p>To shun which Excess, some gave to
their Books the Names of the Muses, as
<hi>Herodotus;</hi> or of men of great Merit,
as <hi>Plato</hi> did in his <hi>Socrates,</hi> or <hi>Tully</hi>
in <hi>Laelius,</hi> &amp;c. or else omitted all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,
as <hi>Thucidides, Livy, Salust,</hi>
or at most extended not their Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
beyond a mere Compellation, such
as that in St. <hi>Luke</hi> to <hi>Theophilus,</hi>
by which possibly may be meant any
Christian under this appellative Name,
rather than a particular Patron or
Friend, as some Books are now addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the Christian Reader, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
it may be of him; for 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
that the Church-men imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
and thus <hi>Origen</hi> dedicates his Book
against <hi>Celsus,</hi> with this Compellation,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: And <hi>Eusebius</hi> names
<pb facs="tcp:53064:4"/>
his Patron <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>At last the word Dedication was
brought in by Flattery, and Books
were dedicated to Men in imitation of
their dedicating Temples, Statues, and
other things to the Gods; nor did this
extravagant way of excessive praising
ever appear till the World was under
<hi>Tiberius</hi> corrupted in all its Morals.
This depraved Custom was also much
heightned by the Panegyricks, made by
<hi>Pliny</hi> to <hi>Trajan,</hi> and by <hi>Eusebius</hi> to
the Great <hi>Constantine,</hi> who thought
that they might more justly praise the
good than others might impious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
tho' I am afraid the Eloquence
which charms us in those two Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
shall never be able to account for
the ill Example they have given.</p>
            <p>My design in all this is to shew, That
we can as little justify our Flattery by
the Practice of the Antients as by the
Principles of Reason, by which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
regulated their Eloquence; And
therefore it seems to me, that Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
should be brought back to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Model, either of a naked Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
<pb facs="tcp:53064:5"/>
which satisfies abundantly
Friendship, or of acknowledging Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
which satisfies gratitude, or of
exciting the persons to whom we write,
to deserve those praises which are now
most unjustly bestow'd upon them, which
is a Christian Duty. And I cannot but
observe three very ill Consequences
which arise naturally and necessarily
from our late Dedications; the first is,
That they learn men to lye and flatter,
and Custom hath almost legitimated
this Crime, and made it a Duty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
They have poison'd the very
Fountains of Truth so far, that Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
can hardly distingnish betwixt
those who have deserv'd well or ill,
Flattery thinking always fit to supply
by its excessive praises, what is wanting
in due merit; and therefore by how
much their Patrons deserve ill, they
praise so much the more, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mark of Vertue in an Author or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in a Patron now is, that there is
no extraordinary thing said in any
Address to the one by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he other; for
who can believe an Author speaks truth
<pb facs="tcp:53064:5"/>
in his Book, who lyes and flatters in
its very beginning; or that a Patron
has any modesty or common sense, who
suffers himself to be so imposed upon?
If the Patron believe what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
says, he must be a fool; and if he
believes him not, he must think the
Author one; and since they who lye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably,
are thought fools in all things
else, why not in this too, in which they
exceed the most Romantick Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
for they only would impose on us
in things which we know not, but these
in things wherein we cannot but disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them? and I wonder why they do
not as well praise the <hi>French</hi> King for
having found out <hi>America,</hi> or for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vanquisht <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,
as for those things which they of late
ascribe to him in their Dedications.
Thirdly, Our late Dedications have
really corrupted the Eloquence of the
Age; for whereas the true Ornaments
of Eloquence are to be natural and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in expressing our Thoughts, these
Dedications have blown our style into
a Tympany, and have ruined it's natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:53064:6"/>
Beauty by fulsome and ill placed
daubing Paints: Which
made <hi>Chrysippus,</hi>

<hi>Laertius</hi> tells us, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
all Dedications
to Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

but this were to run from

but to hold out a Lanthorn to those
who are ready to split on a Rock; and

me Reputation: And I send this

common Standard of Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53064:7"/>
men, since that charms
in one Country, which is abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in others, and the very ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
lines which divide King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
seem likewise to divide their
way of thinking, and to make a
different Geography in the Reason
which they adore, as well as in
the Earth on which they tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
every Age of the World has
almost had a different way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
and every Age in Man
suggests to him contrary thoughts,
in the present he condemns what
himself formerly admir'd: So lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
influence has it upon the best
refin'd Judicatures and Assemblies,
that the most infallible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the most learned Judges,
and the most zealous Patriots must
trust to Voting, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
to Reasoning, and they are
by this likewise so often misled,
that it may be expected men will
one day agree to decide matters
by the fewest Votes, as the wiser
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53064:7"/>
have always told us, that Votes
are rather to be weighed, than
numbred. It has often grieved
me, that men could guess the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
and determination of any
point to be debated, before they
heard the Reasons to be produced
upon either side, and to hear them
laugh at such as trusted to the
solidity of the Reasons they were
to produce, being fully convinced
that the point would be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Interest, and not by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The <hi>Inka</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> was much
in the right, when he regreted,
that his Predecessors had not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to worship a reasonable
Man; yet his choice in this had
been unsuccessful; for it would
have been as hard to have found
him, except he had believed his
Priest, who had undoubtedly told
him he was the man. And tho' I
believe not that French Physician
who assures us, he found in his
Travels a Nation that differed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53064:8"/>
from us in our way of
reasoning, as if God design'd to
shew Mankind that his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
is not tyed in this to any
known measures; yet I see, even
amongst our selves, that Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
(the gentler name of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice)
Pride, Revenge, Bigotry,
Education, and every thing else
pass for Reason, except Reason it
self, which makes me oft-times cry
out, <hi>Is this that noble Creature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
after the Image of God, for
whom Christ dyed, and who is to be
Co-heir with him of his everlasting
Kingdoms.</hi> All which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it is undeniably true, that
there is something in man more
sublime than can be ascribed to
flesh and blood, that dull matter
could never inspire him with these
penetrating, subtil, comprehensive,
generous, and elevated thoughts,
which made the Pagans believe,
that his Soul was <hi>particula Divinae
Naturae,</hi> a parcel of that same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53064:8"/>
Substance of which the Gods
were formed, and that men so
qualified were demi-Gods, and
God Almighty himself has by a
surer Revelation revealed to us,
that this Noble Soul was formed
after his Image, and it was most
consequential that God who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
being to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to some of his Creatures, to
the end his Greatness and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
might be known to them, he
should in order to this breathe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them somewhat that might
comprehend, at least, some Ideas
of that infinite Perfection; and
therefore it was necessary that the
Soul should be an image of what
was infinite, and that we might
understand this from some exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
and sensible representations
and things, he has formed his very
body (the Casket wherein that
Noble Jewel is kept) after a very
wonderful manner, thus by small
and interceptible Rays darted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53064:9"/>
his Eye, the representations of
the vast Hemisphere, are imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so on that little Tablet, that
it seems as great and distinct there,
as in the Original; all he ever
heard is laid up in his memory,
as distinctly as Papers in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet.
And almost by the same
motion of the Tongue; or at
least, without any studied va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation,
vast numbers of delicate
words, or harmonious sounds,
do, in a way unknown, and
unperceptible by Flesh and Blood,
sally out in mighty Swarms and
Armies, which passing thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discovered,
through the Air, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at many thousand Ears in
the same Figure, Ranks, and
Files, wherein they were at first
spoke; and there, in a spiritual
way, they charm some, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
others; they animate some,
and discourage others; working
almost as great varieties as they
bring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53064:9"/>
Divine Wisdom also foreseeing
that Interest would perswade men
to pull all to pieces, whilst each
drew all to himself, he imprest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Soul common Principles,
which even those must reverence
who neglect them, and therefore
they err, not in the rule, but in
the application, and cheat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by Subterfuges, the recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to which infers necessarily,
that these Principles are submitted
to by the most stubborn, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
respected by the wildest in
sublunary matters; and yet in
what concerns our immortal Souls,
and eternal state, we are more
negligent, as will appear too clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by these following Particulars
which I have classed according to
their different inferences.</p>
            <p>I have oft-times admir'd to see
men busied about nothing, save ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and sensual Objects; but it
is yet stranger to find, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
such as are convinc'd, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53064:10"/>
Knowledge is as much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to all other things, as the
Soul is to the Body; there are
yet some so sensual, even in this
point, that the knowledge they
seek after is but a meer delicate
sensuality. Mathematicians consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
chiefly how to measure Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Physicians how to know and
cure men, as Souldiers do how
to destroy them. But the study
of Christian Morality (which has
for its Object the Soul of Man
heightned by the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
teaching him how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the duty of that Soul to
God) is too much neglected, as
a thing obvious and easie: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
when our Saviour came into the
World, he neither taught Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
Medicine, nor Physiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
tho' all these were much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in that Age wherein he
assum'd our Nature; and he could
have made himself as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
by clearing mysterious
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53064:10"/>
doubts in these, as by working
Miracles; but he passing by all
these as less useful Notions, and
such as too frequently divert and
distract, rather than inform; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
he was come to make Man
happy, and begins his Ministry
by an admirable Sermon on the
Mount, whereby, in order to the
making him happy, he teaches
him to reason rightly upon his
duty to God and Men: and it is
strange, that we should think dull
matter is able to afford more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Contemplations, than that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that sublime, that vast, and
that nimble Soul, which retains
so far the Image of its Maker, as
to be inscrutable in all its facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and Oh what wonderful
Springs and Motions, what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
windings and flights, what
boundless and new Spheres and
Worlds are there in his Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and what things are daily
said, and Volumes written on the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53064:11"/>
Love to Women, which is but the
excursion of one of them. Our
diseases cannot conceal themselves
being tyed to matter, but the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
of our immortal Souls are so
concealed by Self-love, which
loves to cover its own imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to hide its own retreats,
that they are past finding out;
and if a little Microscope can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to the Eye new and strange
things in Objects that have been
daily seen, without being conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for many Ages; what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
discoveries may serious
thinking men make in so immense
an Object that has been so much
neglected? especially since the
thoughts of Man do change and
vary themselves into as many
shapes, and give themselves as
many colours as they please: and
every Duty or Errour is really a
different Object as they are in
conjunction with, or in opposition
to one another; whereas all other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53064:11"/>
Objects are incapable of such Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations
either from themselves or
others: And tho' God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to be known in his Works,
yet he seems on purpose to have
made the knowledge of them so
unsearchable to Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and the success so little able
to reward or honour their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
to the end they might the
more relish Moral Philosophy,
which is then only uncertain when
like the other it grows more a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
than a Duty.</p>
            <p>In my reasoning I will use the
Forms prescrib'd by God himself
in his holy Scriptures; wherein
when he would convince man of
his Folly, Sin, or Ingratitude, he
argues with him from his own
concessions, in these cases, or his
own practice, on all other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
As for instance, when he
sends <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> he asks
him what the Man deserv'd, who
having great Herds and Flocks
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53064:12"/>
of his own, took a poor Man's
Lamb out of his Bosom? And
<hi>David,</hi> having in great anger
sworn that he should die, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
then tells him, it was his
case, and condemns him from
his own mouth: And God says
to his People, who acknowledg'd
him to be their Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but walk'd not suitably to
their acknowledgment. <hi>If I be
a Father, where is mine Honour,
and if I be a Master, where is
my Fear?</hi> Malach. 1. 6. He calls
to them, <hi>Isai. 1. 18. Come, let us
reason together;</hi> and admiring the
unreasonableness of unthinking
Man, he appeals to the Heavens
and Earth, <hi>Hear, O Heavens,
and give ear, O Earth, for the
Lord hath spoken! I have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
and brought up Children,
and they have rebelled against me!
The Ox knoweth his Owner, and
the Ass his Master's Crib: But</hi>
Israel <hi>doth not know, my People
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53064:12"/>
do not consider!</hi> And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Gospels, we find our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
confuting the <hi>Iews,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
all his Hearers. Nor do
I find so much delicate reasoning
in any of those Books, highly
esteem'd by our Men of Sense,
who slight too much that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
one, which God himself
owns as his sacred Word: And
I admire our Saviour, as much
for his Reasonings as for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
Thus when he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
Men of the folly of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
immoderately for the things
of this World, he asks them,
What profit shall it be to gain
all the World, that soon perishes,
if they lose their own Soul,
which is Immortal? <hi>And which
of you,</hi> (says our Lord) <hi>by taking
thought, can add one cubit to his
stature?</hi> And urges them, not to
fear want, because, if they who
are sinful know how to provide
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53064:13"/>
for their own Families, how
much more shall your Father,
which is in Heaven, know how
to provide for you, if ye be
his Children? <hi>Behold,</hi> (says our
blessed Maker) <hi>the Fowls of the
air, for they sow not, neither do
they reap, yet your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
feedeth them; are not you
much better than they?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For establishing this my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
it is fit to consider, that
such as are reasonable, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to shew it in the greatest
concerns; and it implies a want,
or weakness of Reason, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and delicate in inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and silly things, and yet to
err and be careless in matters of
greatest consequence: And who
would not laugh at an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
or a General, who would
value himself upon his Dancing
or Playing upon the Lute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
upon these Exercises the
time due to his King, Country,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53064:13"/>
and Negotiations; which makes
me admire, why in this foolish
Age, we call these Men of good
Senses, and strong Spirits, who
can criticise <hi>Virgil, Iuvenal, Livie,
Tacitus,</hi> or it may be, understand
the Mathematicks, or Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whil'st we are convinc'd,
that albeit they believe there is
a God, yet they mind him not,
and care less for their Souls than
they do for any of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
recreations, tho' they are
forc'd to tremble at its ill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when they begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it.</p>
            <p>One of the things which
prompted me to write this Book,
was the reading of a <hi>French</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
<hi>De la Iustesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> wherein, tho'
he made me expect great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
by promising to learn us
to think justly; yet it only
taught how to chuse true Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets,
or understand Criticisms,
and such trivial knacks: But,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53064:14"/>
alas, it is more to be regreted,
that Men should have the sense
to laugh at others, for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
considered the Plot and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of their Plays; whil'st ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who pass for refin'd Wits,
want one in their whole life;
and where the want of it is not
only a greater shame, but is of
greater danger, since a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
err here without being rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to all eternity: And one
of these great Wits, without a
solid design in his life, appears
to me, like a glorious, first-rate
Ship, magnificently equipp'd,
richly gilded, and abundantly
provided of all necessaries; but
because it wants a Rudder, and
a skilful Pilot, fluctuating in a
great Storm, and near a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Shore, on which it is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with violence, threaten'd by
the Wind, and overflown by the
Billows; sometimes shatter'd by
one Rock, and sometimes by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53064:14"/>
till at last it sinks down
irrecoverably into an unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and dreadful Abyss. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then is the Owner of this
Ship, who looks on unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
and perhaps, would not
leave his Whore, Game, or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
or that Poet, who wrote
his Play without a Plot, most to
be contemn'd? Yet he who has
no design to save his immortal
Soul from endless torments, is a
much greater Fool than either;
which recommends to me the
sense of a Wiser, tho' a Heathen
Poet, on this subject, and which
I wish the whole Tribe would
seriously consider.</p>

            <p>It is a pleasant thing to hear
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53064:15"/>
us admire Men, for considering
exactly the Anatomy, Specialities,
and Natures of Fishes, Fowls,
Flies, and other Insects; and yet
never consider whence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
came, whither they are
going, or what is their duty
whilst they remain here. And
I wonder why we should think
it just, to look upon Men in
<hi>Bedlam,</hi> tho' they be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
in many things, if they
be very distracted in any one;
as I know one, who seem'd a
discreet Person, and could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
most pertinently in every
thing, till they spoke of the Moon;
but upon hearing that nam'd,
fell instantly a staring, and into
great extravagancies, believing
himself to be Secretary to the
Moon: And others will be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
enough, till you mention
the name of such a Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and yet we do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
such mad and distracted,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53064:15"/>
who, tho' they understand to
measure Heaven, never design to
enter into it; and who can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquently
convince Men of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Torments, and fright them
from the wicked course which
lead to these, and yet ruine
themselves on the precipices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which they guard others.
And who would not think a
Physician mad, for all his skill,
if after he had made a learned
discourse, to prove a liquor to be
Poison, he should drink it off
himself; and yet more, if he
would not take an Antidote, tho'
ready, and which he knew would
secure him.</p>
            <p>I shall but lightly touch that
ridiculous and impudent extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of some, who, rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to reason, than having
it, take pains to perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others, that there is not
a God, whilst even the subtilty
which they use, when they are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53064:16"/>
endeavouring to prove this their
Assertion, does necessarily prove
his Being: It being impossible,
that Matter and Chance, (their
great Idols) could forge and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
such subtile notions: And
how can they imagine, that since
their own little Affairs could not
be managed without foresight and
conduct, that yet this Great and
Glorious Universe, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
so many Millions, such
as they, should be so exactly
and justly governed, by blind
Chance? If there were no Men
but the sillie and humorous As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serters
of this Opinion, I should
be asham'd to bring Man as an
instance of the Power and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God: Let us then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this Creature, form'd of I
know not what, fed, breathing,
and growing in the Womb, we
know not how; but from those
despicable beginnings, one rises
in a short time, to measure the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53064:16"/>
Heavens, to calculate their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to imitate their Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Thunder; another does
for his own Glory, form such
Models of Religion as seduces, and
draws after him Millions of Men,
contrary to their former Interests,
as well as former Inclinations:
A Third, by his Skill, Conduct,
and Courage, makes even the
remotest Countries of the World
to tremble, overturning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
that World, whereof
he is so small a part: And a
Fourth, by drawing sweetly, and
gently together very distant and
different reflections, and thoughts,
which come readily, as it were,
upon his call, from their several
repositories, forms an Harangue,
or a Poem, which pleases or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the hearers irresistably, as
they have commission from their
Author; it being harder to resist
them than to make them: Can
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53064:17"/>
so regular things be ascrib'd to
wild Chance, or such subtile
things to dull Matter, which by its
Nature, moves necessarily and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
choice? The best contriv'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
can only repeat; but Man
chuses his own thoughts, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or changes them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>I desire our Wits to consider, that
every thing which they see, or
know, is so marvellously fitted to
some use, that as they could not
be wanted, so they cannot be
contrived better: And it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
to answer with <hi>Epicurus,</hi>
(who, tho' he denied Providence,
yet denied not a Deity) that these
things were not made for these
uses, as we pretend, but were, in
process of time, made use of to
these ends by Wit or Necessity:
For even Bruits do immediately
after they are brought forth, run
to those things which they need,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53064:17"/>
with greater exactness than Man
could teach them; and how could
Men, by Reason, make every
thing useful, if so infinite a Being
did not direct and supervise their
almost infinitely various Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Designs, and instruct them,
by the use of Thinking, (that
wonderful Engine) to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
every thing to its true use.
The next thing I recommend to
them, is to consider that all the
Principles of Justice and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without which, the World
could not subsist, depend upon
the belief of this infinite Being;
for how could I convince a Man
without this, that it were not
fit to poyson his Brother for an
Estate; or his Prince, when he
thought that by that he might
step into his Throne; which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
might be done covertly
enough, to escape the punishment
of Laws, if they could that of
Conscience: Nor is it of any force
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53064:18"/>
to tell us, that Politicians have
only invented this for their own
conveniency, since even this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
presupposes that there was
a pre-disposition on the Spirits
of Men, to receive and submit to
this impression, which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable
proof of its truth;
and this trick had not been long
believ'd, had it been only such;
nor could their inventions secure
us against private Treachery, tho'
it could against open Force; nor
can I omit to observe from this
answer, how unfit these Men
would be to govern others, and
how unsufferable they are under
all Governments; who thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to contempt that which they
confess to be the great Engine
of Government. I might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
urge the consent of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which, by how much they
became the more polish'd and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliz'd,
do so much the more rest
on this belief. The certainty that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53064:18"/>
has arisen from Predictions which
are above Nature, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Effects wrought by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
even against it, are confirm'd
to us, by the unerring testimony
of those Senses, which our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists
make the only and sure
test of Knowledge. And do not
we perceive, that that light of
Reason, which by constant and
penetrating reflections, in time,
discover'd, overcame, and baffled
every Cheat and Errour; has
notwithstanding, more fully fix'd,
ascertain'd, and clear'd the Being
of a God, whose Power affords
us such Protection; and whose
Providence affords us such beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and pleasant Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that to love that life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
believing his Being, is to be
without that Sense and Wit which
these wild Scepticks pretend to;
who, whil'st they shun to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
make themselves so, and
whil'st they pretend to pass for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53064:19"/>
Wits, demonstrate themselves to
be Fools, and Brutish. I purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avoid the proof of this by
Metaphysical Arguments, because
God's own way of proving it, is,
by desiring us to consider the
Sun, Moon, and Stars, and the
other Objects which are obvious
to all Men; for it was fit, that
what was to be universally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
should be inferr'd from
what was universally seen: And
such as understand not those Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical
Notions, are apt to
beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e that there is a design to
impose upon them.</p>
            <p>But since our curiosity must be
always somewhat satisfied with
Arguments raised above Sense,
I shall offer this one: It cannot
be deny'd, but that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Man that can compare
two or more different things,
such as, Whether the pain of the
Head or the Leg be greatest?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53064:19"/>
And that this cannot be done by
any thing that is material, is
very clear; for if so, it must be
done by something that touches
at once both the things to be
compared, and no material thing
can do that in the same points;
and if it be in different points,
then it cannot judge of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the two; for
they must be touched in one
common point, else there can
be no application of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Judge, to both, at the same
time: And if this judgment
must be made by something in
Man that is immaterial, and so
is able to extend its indivisible
self to both the things to be
compared; then it necessarily
follows, that this must be a Sp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
for there can be nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
bur a Spirit; and if
we can once comprehend a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
we can never deny there is
a God: For the hardest things
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53064:20"/>
that are objected against his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are those which strike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Being of Spirits in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>Because few or none are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
distracted by this kind of
Madness, tho' they could wish
they were, by smothering their
Reason with Illusions, that they
may cover their Crimes to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
with the hopes of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I hasten to another kind
of unreasonable Men, who, tho'
they acknowledge there is a God,
do yet, by a deplorable negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
little mind how to please
and obey him. And that I may
enforce upon my Reader, the
weakness of their Reasonings, I
wish any of us would think,
that if a Society of Men were
Shipwrack'd upon, or sent Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to an unknown Isle, were
it not most unreasonable for them,
to sit Reading, Discoursing, or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53064:20"/>
Gaming, and not to think who
were Masters of that Isle, and
how they might live in it; and
if they learn'd that it belong'd
to a great Prince, who had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power of Life and Death,
were it not unreasonable, not to
desire to obtain his friendship?
But much more to reject it, if
he offer'd it with Riches and
Preferment, upon no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
save that they would attend
at his Court, love him, and not
wrong one another? But this is
our condition in a much strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
case; for we are here in a
World created by God Almighty,
in which he can kill and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
not the Body only, but
the Soul too; nor for some time
only, but for ever; nor requires
he any harder condition of us,
than that we would love the
Lord our God with all our Hearts,
and our Neighbours as our selves;
which are so far from being hard
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53064:21"/>
Lessons, that one would think
we could not but take great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in them, if they were not
prescrib'd to us as our Duty: For
if a Man be admir'd once for
his great Courage, Conduct, or
Learning, who would not be
pleas'd with being allow'd to
converse with him? Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us would not have taken
pains to have been lov'd by <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
as his Friend, but more, as
his Son? But if <hi>Caesar</hi> had been
as expert a Mathematician as he
was a Souldier, and could have
burnt his Enemies Ships, like
<hi>Archimedes;</hi> if he had invented
Gun-powder for his Magazins, and
found out the whole new World,
as well as conquer'd a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part of the old: How much
more would we yet have esteem'd
him? And to proceed further, if
this <hi>Caesar</hi> could either have sav'd
his own life, by knowing the
secrets of, or by killing alone
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53064:21"/>
all his Assassinates, or prolong'd
for many hundreds of years
that of his Servants; we should
yet more have rejoyced in his
Service and Adoption: But what
is all this to the Infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Great King of Kings,
whose Servants, Friends, nay, and
adopted Sons we may be? He
it is who govern'd <hi>Caesar,</hi> as
he does the Flies or Ants, who,
with one word made <hi>Caesar,</hi>
and all the Wrld, whereof he
conquer'd only a part, which he
was not able to retain. By whose
skill, the Heavens were stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, in which, vain <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
greatest Ambition was to be a
little Star: Who not only knows,
but in one moment, governs all
the various, and almost infinite
thoughts and designs of Angels,
Men, and Devils; and who forces
them all, how contrary soever
to one another, to agree in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53064:22"/>
great designs he has in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World.</p>
            <p>Who would not rejoyce to
serve a Master, that knew when
he were innocent, and who, as
he is exactly just to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
so could not be impos'd
upon by others, to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice;
and tho' even swarms of
Witnesses combined against them,
could see through the Mists
that they threw up, which
no Earthly Master, how just so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
can do? But such is our
Heavenly Master, who can also
not only enrich us when we are
poor, and cure us when we are
sick; but can tame our Passions,
illuminate our Ignorance, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
our Inclinations, sweeten our
Tempers, and make all these Joys
compleat, by the removal of all
Fears or Jealousies that can end
or lessen them. Can we give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reasonable account, why we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53064:22"/>
should be careful to keep the
Road exactly, if we knew there
were great Precipices on every
hand, into which whoever fell,
were irrecoverable; and yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that in our voyage to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
there are Precipices that
lead to dreadful Pits of Fire and
Brimstone, kindled by the wrath
of an angry God: We notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
go on carelesly, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at such as admonish us, and
minding little trifles, which we
are convinc'd will please no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than we possess them.</p>
            <p>How falsly do we reason, in
reflecting on our selves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
For we think them mad
who endeavour not to get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cur'd, when they find they
are tormented with Gout and
Gravel; yet who amongst us is
at any pains, so much as to seek
remedies for his Passions and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which of all other Diseases
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53064:23"/>
torment us most: And if we
heard a Fellow in Livery, value
himself upon the Richness of his
Suit, would we not esteem him
an airy and foolish Creature? But
if we saw a Man who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and going to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
admire himself, and talk of
his Power and Glory, would we
not conclude him distracted? And
yet this is the true State of a
Vain and Glorious Monarch, who
has nothing but what he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from an Infinite God, who
can recal it when he pleases;
and who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whil'st he talks of his
Glory and Greatness, is by that
God condemn'd to die, as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemably,
as must the meanest
Slave, over whom he insults. And
since we would laugh at a vain
Coxcomb, who whilst he were
entertaining his friends in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
house, as if it were his own,
were taken out of it by the ears,
and forc'd to tremble under the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53064:23"/>
lash; how ridiculous must we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>Belshazzar</hi> (and which is the
case of too many other great Men)
who whilst he was feasting all his
Nobles, and perswading them of
His independance, was seized by
an irresistable horrour which shak'd
him all to pieces.</p>
            <p>I doubt not for all this but Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men will think they may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
value themselves on their own
great Parts and Skill; and you
may read long Lectures made by
them on this Subject; but how
unreasonable are they in this, since
these Endowments are given them
as external things are given to
others; and a School-Boy may
more justly admire himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he can repeat excellent lines
made by another: or a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the borrowed Furniture, that
he would make us believe to be
his own, were within, and not
without doors, or were finer than
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53064:24"/>
that borrowed stuff which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had, whom he despis'd. If
two poor men should borrow, the
one ten, and the other a thousand
pounds, the difference of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
Summs should not cease
to leave both of them equally
poor. But he is really a wise and
reasonable man, who knowing
that what he has is borrow'd, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
not to boast of it as his
own, but to repay as much as he
can the Interest to the true Owner
for the Loan. Let us then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Period with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's
just reasoning, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 7.
For who maketh thee to differ from
another? and what hast thou that
thou didst not receive? Now if thou
didst receive it, why dost thou glory
as if thou hadst not received it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being once in company with a
great Wit, who seeing two poor
Chair-men sweat in carrying a
gross corpulent vain Fellow; he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53064:24"/>
cry'd out, that he had rather be
hang'd than serve so meanly such a
Rogue. Whereupon I told him he
was doing a meaner thing, in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Extravagancies of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and tyrannous Statesman, to
please whose extravagant humour,
I had seen him sweat more than
these poor men did; who had also
in this the advantage of him, that
they did so to get bread for their
Family, whereas he did the other
to feed that Ambition and Avarice
which tended to destroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Man's unreasonableness appears
also in the unsuitableness of the
Means he uses, to the Ends he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
to himself. Who would not
think him a Fool, who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to cure a mad Dog by
putting a golden Collar about his
Neck? Or who would think to
cure a Fever in a man by bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great Office on him? But
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53064:25"/>
are not men such Fools, when they
think they can quiet their Passions
by Riches, or their Minds by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement?
Spiritual distempers
are to be cur'd by spiritual means,
and as the finest Thoughts cannot
feed the body, so neither can the
greatest Riches, or any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
thing satisfie the immaterial
Soul.</p>
            <p>If I were desirous to get Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
would not I endeavour
to please him from whom I were
to expect it, and not his Enemies?
but tho' we say that we expect,
or at least wish to be Favourites
to God Almighty, and to be by
him happy for ever; yet we spend
not our time in obeying him, but
in serving openly and assiduously
the World, the Devil, and our
own Lusts, which are his declar'd
Enemies; and that too so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
that any reasonable man
cannot upon considering our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but conclude, That either we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53064:25"/>
car'd not for what he could give,
or else that we were subtle enough
to cheat him, or strong enough to
over-power him.</p>
            <p>If a man were going to live in
another Country, would he not
endeavour to accustom himself to
the Customs of it, and to carry
with him things that were useful
in that Country? And would we
not laugh at him, if he spent his
time in building and adorning
that Inne which he were to
leave? But this is our condition,
who bestow all our thoughts on
the things of this World, from
which we should expect to remove
every moment, and in which we
cannot stay long.</p>
            <p>It is most strange that men, to
secure themselves against Fortune,
should put themselves more and
more into its power: For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
we use are to grow richer
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53064:26"/>
and greater, and nothing subjects
us more to accidents than these
do; for it is for these that men
are pursued, and destroyed, and
they are oftner crimes than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
            <p>God has promised, that <hi>if we
seek we shall find, if we knock
it shall be opened;</hi> so that Prayer
is the true way to attain to what
is desirable: and men may pray
securely at their own Bed-side, or
in walking about their own Field.
But yet men will leave this sure,
safe, and easie way; and sail to
the <hi>Indies</hi> amidst storms, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
through the Desarts of <hi>Arabia</hi>
amongst Thieves, to get unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Riches; expose themselves
to Cannons, and watch in Camps
to get Honours, trusting the Seas,
Winds, and Cannons more than
their own kind and merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who made and governs all
these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:53064:26"/>
When we have Children, we
are very desirous to leave them
well secur'd, and consequently
provide them Estates; but tho'
we take pains to breed our Colts,
and Hawks, we take no pains in
teaching our Children their duty
to their Master, as we do those
Beasts; and probably by not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bred to a just way of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they may lose by one extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
all that we have left them,
or at least live unhappily in not
knowing how to use it aright.
And the same Parents which
would bestow their Estates to free
their Children from burning for a
month in a Fever, will, to get
them a little addition to that same
state, breed them so, as may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
their burning to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>If any man were guilty of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
and so needed the King's
Pardon, would we not think him
a meer Brute, if he should instead
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53064:27"/>
of seeking it earnestly and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
run up and down railing at him,
and reviling his Laws? Yet most
of our Wits, who have indeed
more guilt than wit, and are not
sure what moment they shall be
damn'd for ever, make it their
business, rather than sport, to treat
in ridicule his Divine Majesty and
Laws.</p>
            <p>Let us a little examine the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness
of mens arguing in
matters of Honour, wherein they
pretend to be so exact, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and we shall be convinc'd
how weak their Reason is.</p>
            <p>And in the first place, would
not right Reason dictate to us, that
those things are fittest for men of
Honour, which are most approv'd
and recommended by that Judge
whom all acknowledge to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
best what is great, glorious,
and just? Who would believe any
thing to be honourable for a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
which <hi>Caesar</hi> or Mareshal
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53064:27"/>
               <hi>Turenne</hi> had condemned as unjust
and mean? And if this Rule hold,
we must conclude, That it is the
Almighty God, the Glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of Heaven and Earth, and of
the heart of man, and not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
Courtier, the huffing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
or the unstable and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Rabble, who must give the
Rules to just Honour and true
Grandeur. Nor should the best
of moral men be able to perswade
us, that any thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is honourable,
but according as it agrees with
the reveal'd Will of that Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and Infallible Judge; for if
he be Infallible, it is ridiculous
that his judgment should not be
acquiesc'd in; and if we think him
not Infallible, we cannot think he
is God.</p>
            <p>If any man should call one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd,
especially if he were a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Quality, he would resent
it irreconcileably; and yet are not
all such as are guilty of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53064:28"/>
guilty of Perjury? and to
aggravate this Perjury, it is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
against a Lady, to injure
whom, and to whom the breach
of an ordinary promise would
be thought a shameful Crime;
but yet much more, when it is
considered, that upon that Oath
the Lady had deliver'd her self
up, and by the like Oath had
forsaken all the rest of mankind:
So then, if Perjury be a Villainy,
when committed in the most tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
things, and to a person who
neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> obliged us; what can it
then be, when committed in the
greatest concern, and when the
Oath was given in the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
manner, and under the
greatest obligation to the most
deserving person, and to one of
that delicate Sex, which the most
unworthy are unwilling to injure
or cheat?</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but all who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Reason, will acknowledge,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53064:28"/>
that Ingratitude is the most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
of all Vices, and most
inconsistent with true Honour.
And if a Prince had obliged one
of his Subjects, behaving himself
as a kind Father to him; would
he not be a very Rogue if he
were ungrateful; but yet more,
if he refused to obey him, after
many Promises and Vows, nay,
and after many Pardons, having
several times relapsed again and
again into those Crimes, and even
employed the Forces, with which
the King had trusted him, against
himself? And yet the King of
Kings, and our Heavenly Father,
having heaped hourly such favours
on us, that it needs a mans whole
time to repeat them, because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moment of our time makes a
part of them, we ungrateful Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants
employ all the strength
of our Spirits and Bodies in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
him daily, to that height,
that tho' we our selves tremble
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53064:29"/>
when we think with confusion
upon them, and vow against, and
mourn for them; yet we reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men return with the Dog to
the vomit, and with the Sow to
the puddle; and add the breach
of our new Vows to our old sins.</p>
            <p>I know that Pride has form'd
for its own defence a body of Law
call'd Point of Honour; as one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whereof, amongst others, I
urge how unreasonably men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
their Honour, in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to take a man's life for a word,
damning both themselves and him,
and by way of Complement draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
innocent men (and such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
as have the greatest Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for them) into the same ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and condemnation; which in
spight of all the Gallantry imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
does prove how little use
of true Reason men have, tho'
they value themselves very much,
as if they were the sole Masters of
it. For this is not only contrary
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53064:29"/>
to the Law of God, the true
Fountain of Honour, as of all good,
but to the Laws of our Country:
And what can be more absurd,
than that some private, young, and
ranting Hectors should be able to
make that pass for generous and
gallant, which whole Nations as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
have after much reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and deliberation condemned
as a Crime in all Ages and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
and even the same men,
who brag of this when enrag'd,
and in the field, condemn it in
Parliament and in cold blood?
But nothing discredits this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roism
more, than that those, who
would not yield up their revenge
to God, nor their Conscience,
have been frighted from it by the
French King and the Gallows.</p>
            <p>If one man give another the
Lye, he must pay down his life,
because a Man of Honour would
rather chuse to dye than to be a
Lyar, or rather thought one; but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53064:30"/>
this Man of Honour will flatter,
till all Men laugh at him for
lying so grosly; and this Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of Knaves must likewise
make his Patron a Fool, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
capable to believe what none
believes, save himself; so that this
Flatterer, who yet passes for a
Man of true Honour, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Liar, and his Patron a Fool.
How oftentimes also have we seen
these Men of Honour lie and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to promote Faction, and to
please the Multitude, which they
were thereby designing to cheat,
as if the addition of a Cheat
could make a Lie honourable.
Rebellion and Pimping are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
flights of Glory and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to which, fashionable Men,
and Men of Honour can only
pretend, and a Prerogative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
to those Men who are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
virtuous. If Men, who are
tender of their Reputation, were
reasonable, would they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53064:30"/>
that all these their Crimes
and Vices are known to that
Great God, who is the Fountain
of Truth, and the Rule of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and shall at the Great Day
be known to Men and Angels?
If a Lady considered, that all
her unchast thoughts, and a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who passes for an Honest Man,
that all his Secrets and Cheats
would be discover'd to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
though as guilty as they,
it would confound them: How
then will all Men look, when the
Sins they are endeavouring to
cover, shall be laid open in that
Illustrious Assembly, where In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
and Knowledge shall be
in such high perfection? How
can we then be judg'd Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creatures, when we dare do
that before the Almighty God,
who is of purer eyes than that
he can behold iniquity, which
we durst not attempt before our
own Servants, who depend on
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53064:31"/>
us, and are as frail as our selves?
And if we cannot abide the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of our own Conscience,
how shall we be able to hold up
our Faces in so glorious a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature?
And can Men be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creatures, and yet not
mind so great a Concern?</p>
            <p>Fame, that tacite acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Immortality, even in
those who believe it not, is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
so extravagantly, that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
it self is not more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable:
For to gain the opinion
of a brutal multitude, we sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to them our Duty, our
Quiet and our Security; and what
design can we have, or return
can we expect for all this? For
if we be not Immortal, what sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
our being esteem'd, when
we are to have no being? And
why should we give our selves
real Trouble for an imaginary
Good? And if we believe the
Christian Religion, it teaches us,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53064:31"/>
that either we must be sav'd or
damn'd; if sav'd, Fame from Men
will signifie nothing, when we
discover how foolish we were to
adore such Worms; if damn'd,
that which made a great part
of our Crime, cannot be an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviation
of its Punishment. But
if a Man, believing there is a
God, did argue justly, he would
value highly the being esteem'd
by that Wisdome that cannot err,
and whose fuffrage will last to
all Eternity. Men can only raise
our Character, without being able
to raise our Merit, but our great
Master can really make us me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and open the eyes of others
to understand it, when true, which
no Man can do, and his esteem
brings Rewards suitable to its
Greatness; and therefore is only
worthy of our pains, especially
if we bestowed that pains in
serving him, which we do in
gaining Fame; we might expect
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53064:32"/>
from his goodness what can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be valuable when obtain'd
from Men, because of their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
or secure, because of their
Injustice or Caprice. If we saw
any of our acquaintance running
up and down among mean and
ignorant People, to perswade them
to praise and admire him, we
would laugh at his folly, as well
as vanity; but this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of us poor blind Sinners,
who are sick and dejected, if
our silly, blind Fellow-Mortals
do not admire us, and praise our
Actions.</p>
            <p>I have remark'd in my own
time, that some, by taking too
much care to be esteem'd and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd,
have by that course miss'd
their aim, whil'st others of them,
who shunn'd it, did meet with it,
as if it had fallen on them, whil'st
it was flying from the others;
which proceeded from the unfit
means these able and reasonable
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53064:32"/>
Men took to establish their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
It is very strange to
hear Men value themselves upon
their Honour, and their being
Men of their word in Trifles,
when yet that same Honour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tie them to pay the debts
they have contracted upon so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Promises, of secure and
speedy repayment, starving poor
Widows and Orphans, to feed
their Lusts; and adding thus,
Robbery and Oppression to the
dishonourable breach of Trust.
And how can we think them
Men of Honour, who, when a
Potent and Foreign Monarch is
oppressing his weaker Neighbours,
hazard their very lives to assist
him, tho' they would rail at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their acquaintance, that
meeting a strong Man fighting
with a weaker, should assist the
stronger in his Oppression.</p>
            <p>The surest and most pleasant
path to universal Esteem, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53064:33"/>
true Popularity, is to be just;
for all Men esteem him most,
who secures most their private
Interest, and protects best their
Innocence; and all who have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
notion of a Deity, believe that
Justice is one of his chief Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;
and that therefore, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is just, is next in Nature to
Him, and the best Picture of Him;
and to be reverenc'd and lov'd:
But yet, how few trace this Path,
most Men chusing rather to toil
and vex themselves, in seeking
Popular Applause, by living high,
and in profuse Prodigalities, which
are entertain'd by Injustice and
Oppression, as if rational Men
would pardon Robbers, because
they feasted them upon a part
of their own Spoils; or did let
them see fine and glorious Shows,
made for the honour of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
upon the expence of the
robb'd Spectators. But when a
virtuous Person appears Great by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53064:33"/>
his Merit, and obey'd only by
the charming force of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
all Men think him descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from that Heaven which he
serves, and to him they gladly
pay the noble Tribute of deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Praises.</p>
            <p>Another great Class of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to prove how ill Men
reason in matters of greatest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
may be brought from
the Contradictions we are guilty
of in our Conduct. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Life is the thing in the
World most valu'd, for without
it, we can enjoy nothing; and
yet, so unreasonable are we, that
for a Complement, we will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
it so far, as may be rather
call'd a losing of it. When time
is going, we cry out against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
for having made it so
short, and when it is gone, we
would give all the World to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
it; and yet we are weary
of it so far as to bestow Money
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53064:34"/>
upon any thing that will help to
spend it; and give it away in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits,
to such, to whom we would
not give any thing else. We would
for no Money quit one Year of
our Life; and yet for the same
Money; which we so undervalue
in the express exchange, most
Men do really give away very
many of their best years, since
they are spent in gaining Money.</p>
            <p>We exclaim against Tyranny,
Usurpation and Oppression, and
in this we are much in the right:
But why then do we admire, and
cry up such as have been great
Oppressors and Usurpers, as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,
Coesar?</hi> for in this, we are
not only unjust upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but Enemies to our selves;
for that esteem we put upon them
who have been such, invites o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to make us the prey of our
own Errors.</p>
            <p>Most Men do admire, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselves to all others, which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53064:34"/>
is a great proof of our unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness;
but yet, even these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stay with themselves, and by
being afraid to look into their
own hearts, contradict the esteem
which yet at all times they have
for themselves, to an unsufferable
Excess. All Men desire to prefer
the best Company; and when
Men prefer any Company to the
being alone, they demonstrate
that themselves are not the best.
Most Men, when they are young,
contemn Riches, and love them
when they are old; and though
our Wits scorn to think, or say
with the vulgar, yet even these
are swayed as much, and as stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by vulgar Vices, as those who
never exclaim'd against the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
Crowd. All Creatures
stand in awe of others, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the esteem they have of
them; and tho' we admire our
own Perfections, and value our
selves far above our proportion,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53064:35"/>
yet stand we not in awe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
wickedness when alone, which
we durst not commit if others were
present; and thus we are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
that we want a due
reverence and esteem for our selves,
where we ought to have it, and
have it excessively where we ought
to want it totally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Self-love,</hi> the falsest tho' the
subtilest of all Reasoners, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to perswade us, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
we shall, by seeing our
Enemies ruined, remain our selves
the more excellent Creatures, our
Rivals being thus depress'd: And
this is that hid reason which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
to us that Passion which is
truly most inhumane. But what
an improper Argument is this,
for we are not one whit the
more excellent, that another is
ruined by an Accident. Another
Argument brought by Revenge,
is, that thus we shall secure our
selves against our Enemies, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53064:35"/>
so Revenge would pass with us
under the disguise of Self-defence;
but because this would seem cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly,
and be in effect, a tacite
acknowledgment of Fear; we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
say, that in Revenge, we
will teach others not to attack
us. But all these are false rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings;
for no Man secures his
true Quiet by Revenge, for it
raises an Enemy within, which
is always present, and able to
disquiet: And all Men conclude
themselves obliged to destroy the
Revengeful Man, by the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that he pursues his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
and thus a Man is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
by it till it be satisfied, and
frighted by it after he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd.</p>
            <p>Most Men desire to be in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
from a secret desire to
be admir'd; whereas when they
are in Employments, they do not
those Just and Virtuous things,
for which they would be truly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53064:36"/>
admir'd: And albeit Self-love
makes them believe, that the
being fear'd is a mark of true
Dominion; yet they consider
not, that even Dominion is only
at the bottom desireable, because
it is a sign of Merit and innate
Excellency; and does please, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it makes us believe, by the
Suffrage of others, that we are
Noble and Excellent Persons, of
which, even the least reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cannot seriously be perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
except they believe they
have done virtuous things. And
thus it were more reasonable to do
what is really virtuous, than to
cheat our selves, with thinking
that others admire us. And it
is very unreasonable not to do
things rather for Virtue it self,
than for the Applause which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
it, since that Applause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
its desireableness from Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and so Virtue it self should
be much more desired: And which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53064:36"/>
shews yet more the weakness of
our Reason, tho' in this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the undeniable Sentiments
of Mankind, yet we are cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into it by a mistake, as if
it were easier to attain to the
Applause of Virtue, than to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
it self; whereas, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
it must be more difficult
to attain Applause, since it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon many thousands of
Rivals and capricious Fools; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Virtue springs from a Man's
own Breast, and we may have
it, and keep it, in spight of all
Mankind.</p>
            <p>Every Man also, may in his
private Station and Employment,
find thousands of Instances to
confirm this Truth. And thus
a Courtier should consider,
that when he sees his Prince
bow and pray to a Superiour,
before whom, he acknowledges
himself to be a Worm and a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
that certainly it is fit to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53064:37"/>
do nothing to displease that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Power, for gaining the
favour of that Prince who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores
him; and who would not
think him mad, who would scorn
to depend on a Monarch, but
would take pains to flatter his
Footman? When a Lawyer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
that Men take such pains
to secure in Law an Interest that
cannot be secur'd against Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
he should in reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that it is brutish not to
take more pains to secure that
which shall never fail: And when
he observes how zealously the
Eldest Men defend a Life that
Accidents, nay, and Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
will end with the Process,
should he not consider, what
pains should be taken to secure
a Life that continues for ever,
free too from that Care, and those
Sicknesses, that even before Death
make this Life miserable.</p>
            <p>If a Souldier who were besieg'd
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53064:37"/>
by his Enemies, should abandon
his Watch, and spend his time in
Gaming and Drinking, or should
lose the glorious opportunity of
defeating them, for a Feast; or,
as <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> for a Mistress:
Especially, if they be such Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
whom we know, would
not only kill, but torment us to
Death, were he not to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Fool? But that is our case;
for being surrounded with Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and Devils, we spend our
time in Toyes and Trifles, and
whilst we hear that others have
receiv'd an Immortal Crown, for
having overcome their Spiritual
Enemies, we, who value Fame
and Glory so much, spend our
time in pleasing two or three
silly Courtiers, whom we despise
whilst we attend them, and laugh
at the Actions which we seem to
admire. A Merchant were ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
if he should spend his
Stock and his time in buying up
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53064:38"/>
Wares that were unfashionable in
that Country where he has his
abode; and yet most Men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themselves wholly in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Riches, and getting that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which can neither be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to Heaven with them, nor
can comfort them when they are
in Hell. And I have oft applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the remark of a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who hearing a whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
admire one of her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
for a great Wit, told them,
that his Father had left him a great
Estate, which he had spent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Whores, that he had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
married a Whore, and had
chang'd the Orthodox Religion,
in which he was bred up, for a
worse, and was not devout in
that neither; and desir'd them
to consider if that Man deserv'd
to be call'd a Wit?</p>
            <p>Nor are we only unreasonable
in pursuing our Pleasures and
Vices; but the very measures we
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53064:38"/>
take in being Virtuous, shew how
weak our Reason is, and how ill
we use it. For our Friendship is
for the most part but the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
those for whom we have a
kindness, to those who deserve bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
both our kindness and those
employments; and thus we rob
the Commonwealth, to repay the
debt our Gratitude owes. The
Courage of many is but a hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
disguising of their fear, or
a dull ignorance of their danger.
For when a man goes to Battel,
he fears to dye; but to disguise
this fear, he considers the shame
of flying, and knowing certainly
that his Reputation would be
ruined, he fears more this certain
loss, than the hazard of being
kill'd: but if he cannot attain to
that, he at least braves it out, and
endeavours to cheat others, when
he cannot satisfie himself.</p>
            <p>Liberality and Charity are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
but the disguised effects of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53064:39"/>
Vanity, wherein men tacitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
rather their own perpetuity,
than the advantage of those on
whom they bestow what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in which they act very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably:
for if they lent it to
God, he would restore it with a
very enriching interest: But in
bestowing it on Fame, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
it on a Cheat, which has
oft deceived both them and others.
And it still seems strange, that we
will bestow it on that Multitude
(for Fame and the Multitude are
the same thing) to preserve any
one of whom from starving, we
would not bestow one farthing.
And yet the World esteem those
who do such things more than
they do reasonable and judicious
persons.</p>
            <p>It is one of the chief and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Dictates of Reason, that
we should do to others as we
would wish them to do to us. But
tho' we exclaim against our Equals,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53064:39"/>
poor Mortals, if they refuse us
this measure, yet we allow it not
to our great King and Soveraign.
If we heard that any who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be our friend, did sit
tamely and hear us rail'd at, and
contemn'd, we would conclude
them base and treacherous; and a
King would for this treat His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as Rebels; but yet we sit
not only to hear impious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
rail at Religion, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at Providence it self, with
so little resentment, that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and even admire the Miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.
I remember that I suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
once to a Person of Quality,
who was busie about his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts,
to consider if our Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
should spend our Rents up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own Affairs, or upon
maintaining his own Family or
Luxury, and much more if he
should riot it away with our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
would we not hate him as
a Rogue, and at least recal the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53064:40"/>
Trust we gave him. But the Great
Master of the Family of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
having appointed us only to be
Stewards, not to appropriate, but
to bestow the Estates he gave us for
the use of his poor Children and
Servants, preferring us kindly to as
much as may satisfie our Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency,
for so the Scripture, and
even Reason it self, teaches us:
(for why should the Wise God
have bestowed so much upon
some, whilst others want, if he
had not design'd to level all by
this necessity of distribution) yet
we see his Children starve, whilst
we employ the portions due to
them upon the Wicked who are
his Enemies. And thus we use
the Almighty God at the rate we
would not suffer from the meanest
of our Servants. And so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
are even such as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of the reasonableness of
Charity, that by doing their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
actions in publick, they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53064:40"/>
lose the reward, by not preserving
the true design of it; for as our
Saviour argues, <hi>Mat. 6. 4. It is very
just, that since they bestow their Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to gain the applause of men, they
should be rewarded with the applause
for which they bestowed it;</hi> And
how can they expect a reward
from God, to please whom it was
not given; and he is not obliged to
repay what was not lent him: And
they cannot expect double pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for being paid by men, the
Obligation is fully satisfied.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude these Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with what ordinarily we
conclude our unreasonable lives,
and that is Death-bed Repentance,
which of all things is the most
unreasonable. For if we believe
the Rewards and Torments which
attend our future state, and make
the delay so dangerous, why de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
we? And if we believe neither
of these, why repent we? The
one cannot but make our present
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53064:41"/>
pleasures very bitter, by the fear
that must thereupon haunt us; and
the other cannot but needlesly cut
off the pleasures which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
as inconsistent with true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
But which of us being
condemn'd to horrible Torments,
would delay to seek a remission
till the last hour? or being invited
to leave our Cottage to receive
a plentiful Estate, would delay to
undertake his Journey? and yet
we easily delay our Repentance,
which can only preserve us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
Sinners, from eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and which would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bring us, poor Wretches, to that
Inheritance of immortal Glory.
And tho' we condemn our selves
for leaving the dispatch of our
little Concerns till the last hour,
yet we delay that great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Work, on which a long
Eternity hangs, for every trifle.
And that which aggravates much
this Neglect, is, that the Reasons
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53064:41"/>
which encourage us to it are as
weak, as the thing it self is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and dangerous. For the hope
we may live, has for its founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a frail Body, that every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
can destroy; and it is a
wonder, that when we hear of
so many unexpected deaths, we
should not tremble to think, what
if I had dyed? And tho' the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God be as infinite as his
Justice, yet it is insupportable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
in us to think, that we
can be sav'd when we please: this
is not only to undervalue him as
the last thing to be chosen, which
implies that our infinitely glorious
Maker is of all things least wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of our choice, but in this we
exalt our selves above him, as if
we might command him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
upon us Heaven and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
when-ever we thought fit
to call for it. And which of us
would bestow the meanest favour
upon him, who would resolve to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53064:42"/>
oppose, or but neglect us as long
as he pleas'd. The delaying makes
us the unfitter, not only to crave,
but even to receive, Mercy; and
since all our life, albeit as piously
spent as humane frailty can allow,
is short enough for so great a
Work; what can we expect from
a few sickly hours distracted by
new pains, and amazed at so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
old sins? And the Scripture
having commanded us to repent,
and bring forth good Works; it
has every where made good Works
and a subsequent Amendment of
our Lives, the mark as well as
fruit of sincere Repentance: and
therefore since a Death-bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
must want this proof, it
cannot but be by so much the
more uncomfortable to us and our
friends. Nor is there any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Soul, who having receiv'd so
great and undeserved a Pardon,
would not desire to be able to
live, that he might magnifie that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53064:42"/>
Infinite God to whom he ow'd it.
I know that the Thief on the
Cross has been a stumbling-block
to many others; but we reason
very weakly from this instance of
God's Mercy: for he by believing
the Divinity of our Saviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
all that could have been said
against it, when even the Jews
were desiring him to come down
from the Cross, and they would
believe in him, and the other
Thief was reviling him; did evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as much Faith in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
Span when dying, as the
best of us can do in a prolong'd
Life. And it being fit for the
Saviour of the World to shew his
Power and Mercy when he was
leading Captivity captive, that
happy Thief can be no Precedent
for us who remain unconverted
after so many Miracles, that no
reasonable man can now doubt of,
especially if he never heard, as
its probable, of that Gospel which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53064:43"/>
we have so oft undervalued, and if
he has not neglected former offers of
Mercy which we have so oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd.
And shall we presume on
God's Goodness, because one man
was sav'd, and but one, to preserve
Mankind from despair; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring,
that as the Thief ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a Pardon when he sought
it, so <hi>Esau</hi> found no place for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
tho' he sought it earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. And tho' those
who came in at the last hour, got as
much as those who had wrought
at the first; yet it is remarkable, that
it is said, they came not sooner,
because no man had desired them.
But let me conjure any noble Soul
to consider, that if God be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Adoration of Angels
through all Eternity; and that we
confess, that to walk, like <hi>Enoch,</hi>
with him, will be so amiable and
glorious, why should we delay it
for Pleasures that are unworthy of
a reasonable Soul, and which last
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53064:43"/>
but for a moment? For at least
we lose so much unexpressible Joy
and Pleasure; and in delaying our
Repentance we continue to be sick
when we may be whole, to be
blind when we may see, to be
poor when we may be rich, to
lye in Prison when we may live at
Liberty, and to be Slaves to our
Enemies when we may be Heirs
to a Kingdom. All which induce
me to believe, that they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
Repentance, design not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
but flatter themselves with
a false conceit of it; for to repent
is to be grieved, and no man who
is grieved can put it off at his
pleasure, no more than a man can
be griev'd or not as he pleases. As
also if a man resolv'd sincerely to
repent, 'tis necessary that he were
convinc'd of the greatness of his
danger, and were actually asham'd
as well as afraid thereof; and if
he were truly touch'd with these
Convictions, he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53064:44"/>
in the Courses which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
them. And to finish all, is
it not the height of unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for a man to continue to do
these things, of which he knows
he must be asham'd, and for which
he resolves to be exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and afflicted? And if we were
coming into a Room where a man
were wounding himself, would we
not conclude him yet madder if
he told us, that he would give
himself more and more, because
such a man got so many Wounds,
and yet was cured.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let me therefore conclude this
Discourse with the noble and just
Reasoning us'd by St.</hi> Peter, 2 Epist.
3. 10, 11. But the day of the Lord
will come as a thief in the night, in
the which the Heavens will pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with a great noise, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
shall melt with a fervent heat,
the Earth also and the works that
are therein shall be burnt up: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then that all these things shall be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53064:44"/>
dissolved, what manner of persons
ought ye to be in all holy Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Godliness?</p>
            <p>And what a frighted Creature
will the greatest Hero be, when
he finds himself in the midst of
a burning World, having greater
terrors within his Breast than these,
rais'd by an Omnipotent God, and
which will force him to cry to
the Hills and Mountains to fall
upon him, and cover him from
the face of this angry Judge?</p>
            <p>But these great and sad Truths
need (alas) to be preach'd by an
Angel, to Hearers standing upon
the brink of their Grave, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Heaven and Hell open'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them.</p>

            <head>PART II.</head>
            <head type="sub">Whence proceeds it that Man
is so unreasonable, and how
to improve our Reason.</head>
            <p>IT is indeed very strange,
that Man, who improves
daily so much in all Arts
and Sciences, that are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so necessary, so easie, nor
so advantageous to us, should
still decrease in this excellent
Study, this Noble and Useful
Knowledge: Let us then enquire
a little into the occasions of these
Errours in his reasonings, and
we shall find them so silly, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53064:46"/>
they also discover to us new
Weaknesses in his Reason.</p>
            <p>I know that we generally
charge this on Man's Atheism, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
he would reason justly, if
he believ'd the Principles I have
laid down; but this is a mistake,
for Atheists reason most weakly,
as well as others, and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequentially
to their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
for even Atheists disquiet
themselves for Fame and Money,
and by Whoring and Drinking
destroy their Bodies, which is all
they dote upon, and should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
and which shews their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness,
according to their
own Principles; and that Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is not the cause of false rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
appears clearly, because such
as are not Atheists, reason falsly;
and we may observe, that such as
believe that by the ill Diets they
use, their terrible pains will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd,
do yet adventure on them;
oh, that they only of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53064:46"/>
were the unreasonable Men!
But how unreasonable are they,
who believing there is a Crown
of Glory reserv'd for those that
will run that Heavenly race, chuse
rather to sit Tipling and Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that believe the Son of
God stands stretching out his
arms, ready to preserve them,
and yet will rather sink down
into that fearful Pit, from which
there is no redemption; who will
rather starve than seek that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Manna, and languish of
their Wounds, than seek the Balm
of <hi>Gilead,</hi> from the hand of a
loving Father; whom no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on others can awaken, nor
Mercies to themselves can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige;
Sick amidst so many Cures;
Poor, amidst such Plenty; Blind,
notwithstanding so much Light;
and Insensible, in spight of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Convictions.</p>
            <p>But how can Men reason well,
since they neither understand the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53064:47"/>
true use of Reason, nor what Man
is? And these are the two first and
great occasions of our Errours.</p>
            <p>As to Reason, let us examin
our selves narrowly, and we shall
find that Men think they need
not Reason in the great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
designs of Life, as if
these were matters to be taken
upon trust; And as if Reason
were to be us'd only in matters
of State, or in Debate or Trade.
And I desire to know, who sits
down to reason with himself,
why he lives so or so, or to know,
if what he does, is according to
the Rules given him, for regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Actions. I have my self
spent Twenty years in reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eagerly to secure other Mens
Estates; but I have spent very
little time to consider, by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
reasoning, why do I spend
so much time in reasoning for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men, and yet so little for
my self? tho' in the mean time,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53064:47"/>
I do but too much prefer my
self to all others? You will find
some Divines very busie in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether God from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
could have made Creatures,
and yet these Men will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what shall become of them
in Eternity. The cure then of
this, is to consider Reason, not
as a Tool, useful for Gain or
Fame only, but as a Square, put
in our hands, by our kind God,
to instruct us how to make our
Actions straight and even; and
as a Workman does first mind
to have all regulated by his Square,
and after his work is finished,
applyes the Square to what he
has made; so ought we, when
any thing is design'd by us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to do all in it by the
rules of Reason, and when the
Action is ended, examin if it be
so: And to invite us to this,
God has not oblig'd us to seek
for this any foreign or remote
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53064:48"/>
Remedy; no, nor to owe our
Remedy to any other; but has
plac'd his Candle in our Breasts,
and honour'd us with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our own Governours and
Directors. Let us then think,
and think of matters of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and of matters that
import us; let us think as much
of Heaven, which cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from us, when once we are
possessed of it, as we do of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Estates, in the possession of
which we cannot be secured.
Let us think as much upon our
selves, whom we value too much,
as upon others, whom we value
too little.</p>
            <p>We use oft-times our Reason
to argue falsly for Interest, or
by Pre-ingagement, and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches
our Reason, after which
it continues easily in this Errour:
For this takes off that Reverence
and Esteem we ought to have
for just reasoning. Thus Lawyers
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53064:48"/>
favouring still, and being oblig'd
to maintain the cause of those
who have retain'd them, force
their Reason to find Arguments
for their own side; Divines think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves oblig'd to defend
the Positions of that Church
wherein they were born, reason
still in its defence: States-Men,
to fortifie their Partie, endeavour
to perswade all Men to embrace
it; and Orators, not excepting
the Philosophers amongst them,
to beautifie their discourses, urge
things that are meer Flourishes,
having much Lustre, but no
Strength; great instances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are to be seen in <hi>Seneca,</hi> and
generally in all the Heathens, who,
as I shall shew expresly elsewhere,
were forc'd, by not knowing the
true Principles whereupon Reason
was to be built, to maintain by
false reasonings the true Principles
that they design'd to recommend.
We do likewise form our Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53064:49"/>
by our Interest, and guide
not our Interest by our Morals;
and after we have form'd any
Design, we find out Reasons to
perswade us that it is just: And
thus we oft-times mistake Interest,
Imagination, and Prejudices, for
solid Reason; the true cure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
lies in being painful and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in our first Reasonings; and
as careful not to commit Errours
by false and careless Arguings,
in matters of eternal Happiness,
as Mathematicians are in their
Demonstrations about Figures and
Conclusions, which cannot secure
them against one Misfortune, nor
add one day to their Lives.</p>
            <p>Bigotry, and false conceptions
of Religion, do also darken much
our Reason; for sometimes, by
implicit Faith and Infallibility,
(those great Tyrants over Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
we accustome our selves
to Laziness, wherein we lose the
habit of Reasoning; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53064:49"/>
by imposing upon us things
inconsistent with it, and by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us that it is a dangerous
Guide, we lessen our own esteem
for it, and create insensibly in
our selves a Jealousie that it is an
Imposture; and we baffle it so
on these occasions, that at other
times it dares not try its own
strength. I confess, that it ought
in a just submission yield to his
commands who made it, nor
should we hear the Servant when
the Master speaks; but except
when the will of God does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
ordain ones Reason to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
we ought not to deny our
selves the true exercise of it, to
please Men, who understand not
its true strength, or do upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
impose on us the abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. And this has infected
us so far, that by it all other
Sciences did fall very low. And
if some bold Defender, such as
<hi>Cartes</hi> and others, had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53064:50"/>
we had been led by implicit
Faith, in all the Objects of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as well as in all the Objects of
Faith; and every School-man
would have exacted as much abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
submission to his own Dictates,
as we should pay to the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Commands of our infallible
Creator. And oft-times Self-love
passing for Religion, blinds us
whilst it promises Illumination:
As a clear instance whereof I
shall desire any wise Man to
consider, that if this were true
Zeal which led Men to hazard
all they have for the ridiculous
difference about indifferent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
or Tenets, why do they not
hazard all they possess for the
defence of the Christian Religion
against the Turks; since in sound
Reason, and by a Mathematical
certainty, the whole is to be
preferred to a part; and to
prove that this is the effect of
Self-love, and not of true Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53064:50"/>
it is very observable, that
the less the differences be in such
cases, we are ordinarily the more
passionate in them, being inclin'd
rather to have our Sentiments su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd,
than the Commands of
God obey'd; most men being to
themselves their own only God,
and being asham'd that they
should err even in the meanest
circumstance.</p>
            <p>Men may think me insolent
when I tell them that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not themselves, but they
should bear this from me; who
would willingly wish that they
could justly tax me of a Lye in
it. But for my security I must
put them in mind, that Monsieur
<hi>Paschal</hi> told them before me, that
he had laid aside the study of the
Mathematicks, because few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to converse with him in
it, and betook himself to consider
Man; as thinking that a Subject
so near, and of such concern to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53064:51"/>
every one, that all could not but
understand it; and yet he found
this less understood than the other.
But that I may contribute my
mean Endeavors for clearing them
in this, I must desire them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that Man being created to
love and admire God, it must
follow by a necessary consequence,
that God was to be the Center of
all his Knowledge; and right
Reason was a drawing of all his
Conclusions as so many Lines, to
rest upon God as that Center. But
Man designing to exalt himself,
does by a woful mistake make
himself the Center, and Self-love,
as another Reason, draws all into
this design. And thus, whereas
we should study to understand the
excellent Works of the Creation,
that in them we may understand
the Infiniteness of that wonderful
Creator; we study them only
thereby to adorn our own Spirits,
and thus to raise an Esteem in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53064:51"/>
others for us: and crook in all
the Conclusions we make to our
selves and our Conveniency, as
the Center of all our Designs. And
thus we have invented new Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Arts, and Recreations, such
as Criticisms, Rraillery, Comedies,
Tragedies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> meerly that our
Works may be admir'd as much
as his. And therefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
we can ever reason justly,
since all the Lines of our Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tend to a wrong Center; but
if we return to our Duty in resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to love and admire him, and
not our selves, every Conclusion
being drawn from true Principles
and Positions, would recover its
original streightness. And thus if
we ador'd God more than Kings
and Princes, we would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
God to please them, that
we might be enrich'd or advanc'd
by them. If we studied only to
know him in his Creatures, and
not to raise our own Fame by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53064:52"/>
them, we would not toil and vex
our selves to acquire Fame; nor
forget serving and adoring him,
that we might get time to know
those Sciences, and be esteem'd
for, and delighted in that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Self-love, amongst its other
Cheats, hinders us to study Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Morality, because that would
let us see how vile and frail we
are; and therefore, as a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
it carries us impetuously
to study other Sciences, wherein
we may admire our own Wit and
Sagacity: but that which seems
to me the true Notion of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, that it should be a design
to know and admire God in his
Works; for which Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
and Mathematicks are to
be studied; in his Providence,
which we may know by History;
in his Justice to be known by
Law; and in his governing the
Soul of Man, which is the Object
of Moral Philosophy: but above
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53064:52"/>
all, in himself and the Mysteries
of our Salvation, taught by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
when well directed.</p>
            <p>A Proof of which, as well as a
new Cause of our Errours and
Reasoning is, That the first Rule
by which our Reasons are squared
and directed, are the Writings of
those Illustrious Heathens, who in
our Youth are recommended to us
as the only Guides and Patterns:
The best of which, such as <hi>Plato,
Epictetus, Seneca,</hi> and others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absolutely ignorant of Man's
great Disease, which is Original
Sin, could not but mistake the
Remedies of his Actual Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
and knowing nothing more
excellent than their own Reason,
they concluded it was sufficient.
And having from their Poets and
Traditions learned mean, low
thoughts of their Gods, who were
in those days made the chief A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the sins they should have
punished, and describ'd as more
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53064:53"/>
employ'd in satisfying their own
Passions, than in governing of the
World. Those misled Philosophers
did not only equal themselves to,
but raised themselves above the
Gods, whom they taught others
and themselves to adore. And to
that height did this mistake in
their Reasoning fly, that <hi>Seneca</hi>
concludes his Wise man much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to the Gods, because the
good they did, arose from the
necessity of their own Nature;
whereas man being left to a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in his Actions, made them
good by his own wise choice.
<hi>Epictetus</hi> founds his Philosophy
upon that only Principle, <hi>That the
things within us are in our own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but the things without us are not.</hi>
Whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> from Heaven
assures us, That <hi>of our selves, as
of our selves, we can do no good.</hi>
And our own Experience doth
most convincingly agree with St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> against <hi>Epictetus.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53064:53"/>
a Principle in any Science
should be an uncontroverted Truth,
we find daily that this Principle
is an absolute Lye. For that man
who thinks that he can with an
unerring hand govern his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
has never undertaken the
subduing of them. And <hi>video
meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor,</hi>
agrees much better with our own
Experience, as well as with St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> who, tho' among the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Saints, complains justly,
<hi>Rom. 7. 15. That which I would,
that do I not; but what I hate,
that do I:</hi> and therefore is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to cry out, <hi>Who shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me from this body of Death?
Cicero</hi>'s Discourse concerning the
Nature of Gods, and <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
of the Immortality of the
Soul, may convince us how weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those great Patterns of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
do reason, even upon those
Subjects where Reason was not
altogether mistaken. And from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53064:54"/>
those, and all the Writings of the
Ancient Pagans, I do more justly
conclude, That those great Ideas
which our Masters have given us
of them, and the Eloquence which
shines every where in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
have misled us from the
ways that lead to the New <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi>
and from admiring the
Beauty of Holiness which shines
in those Scriptures, which have
God Almighty and the Holy One
of <hi>Israel</hi> for their Author and
Subject, and in which we are
taught to expect more help from
Heaven, than from our selves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our innate and original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
which is more to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by praying than think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and can never be overcome
without that Humility and Self-denial,
which was absolutely
unknown to the Heathens, as I
hope to prove in another Discourse,
where these thoughts shall have
their full scope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:53064:54"/>
I am far from designing in this
to root out Self-love, but rather
to direct and improve it. For
certainly God has grafted Self-love
in every Man's Heart, to
the end, Man might thereby be
the more oblig'd to love him, to
whom he owes all those Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
which he loves in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and that he may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
oblig'd to preserve himself as
a part of the Universe, and which
is in general preserv'd by every
Man's loving himself; and so far
has God allow'd this Self-love,
that he punishes Man when he
destroyes himself. But that Self-love
which I here inveigh against,
is a false and imposture passion,
whereby Man makes himself the
Spring, from which all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
follow, the Mark at which
they aim, and the Rule by which
they are to be squared, than which
nothing can be more unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For how can we justifie
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53064:55"/>
our selves, in requiring absolute
deference from all that is ours, if
we yield it not to that Infinite
Being to whom we owe all; and
as he brought us out of nothing,
so we should still remember that
we are nothing before him. If
every Man made himself the
Rule, and drew all to himself,
what a distracted thing would
this World be, and how impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
would it be for any Man
to live comfortably in it? And
as a private Man would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
mad, who in a Court,
would think that all things should
be design'd there for his Glory
and Pleasure: So much more is
Man a distracted Creature, when
he makes himself the chief aim
of all his Actions. Whereas, if a
Courtier take great care to please
the Monarch, and to design his
Glory and Advantage, he will
thereby raise himself in a securer,
as well as a juster way. And
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53064:55"/>
therefore because Self-love is so
strong an Oratour, and is still
at the bottom of all perswasion,
we should examine cautiously,
what is urged upon us under the
disguise of Self-love, and whether
we do really love our selves when
we yield to those things to which
we are tempted. I shall conclude
this Period with a sad Assertion,
That in spight of all that Men
profess, yet too many really, at
the bottom, mistake themselves
so far, as to think that they have
no original Frailties, and therefore
that they are able to command
their Passions, and that they need
no Divine Assistance, that they
are nothing else, save that body
which we see, that they are not
to die so soon, and that the things
they are doing now are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things to be car'd for, and
will remain with them for ever.
And if most Men have this <hi>Idea</hi>
of themselves, I desire to know
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53064:56"/>
how they can draw just conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
from such mistaken Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>Another cause of our Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so weakly, is, that the things
of another World are too remote
to seem great to us, and too spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
to be discerned by carnal
Eyes. The least thing, when
plac'd immediately before our
Eyes, will intercept, and exclude all
further prospect; and even the
least conspicuous Objects, and
Sensual things do, by a constant
tide of emanations, flow in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
upon us, so as to fill
our thoughts, and leave little
room for any thing else. But
as a Remedy to this, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that since even Corporeal, and
Sensual Pleasures charm us only
when we think much upon them,
it follows, that thinking is the
Source, and Origin of Esteem:
tho' we see not the Riches of a
golden Mine, yet our belief will
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53064:56"/>
make us toil for it, and the hope
of succeeding to an Estate will
oblige us to follow eagerly what
that hope suggests. And since
<hi>Faith is the evidence of things
not seen,</hi> it does represent things
to come, with a certainty, that
makes them present; and albeit
it may be objected, that we have
seen some such things as these
Mines, and Worldly Successions,
and therefore it is that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and love them more; yet
that is of no moment: For the
miracles that Men have heard of,
and the wonderful works of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
which we daily see, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
when born in upon us,
by the conviction of our own
Consciences, seem as strong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
as any that sense can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
Conscience, that luminous
Sense of the Soul, being stronger,
and more perswasive to any that
will hear it, than any of our dull
and outward Senses, which have

only assistance from stupid Flesh
and Blood: Conversation also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
things Spiritual and Divine,
will be in place of Sensual Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to us, and will represent
a future Life, and the World to
come to a hearkning Soul, as if
it were present; nor will the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
fail to assist that Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
which has him for its
only and ultimate scope.</p>
            <p>The Soul cetrtainly being a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
substance, can more easily
unite it self to immaterial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
such as a future state of
Happiness, than to the terrestrial
Objects, with which we fill it;
and the only fault is in us, who
do not apply our selves to the
thinking on these. Do we not
find that such as aspire to Fame
are more taken with it than any
Man is with Meat or Drink, yea,
and Life it self, for the conquest
whereof all these are contemn'd:
And yet Fame is a meer imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53064:57"/>
Object, that has nothing
affecting the Senses otherwise than
by thinking nothing Present, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Corporeal; and generally,
the Spirit of Man is more pleas'd
with Expectation than with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
present Possession whatsoever;
so far, that if we expect any lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
accident, it will busie more
our thoughts, and fasten them
more to it than a thousand things
of greater value already possess'd.
This then can be no such hard
task as our laziness perswades it
to be.</p>
            <p>Tho' we be convinc'd of the
truths on which I have founded
my Observations, yet we advert
not to them, nor heed them.
Thus tho' an Object were most
conspicuous, yet if we dote so
upon any other, as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never to
turn our eyes that way, we shall
not be taken with either its Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
or Beauty. We are bred up
in a great esteem for the things
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53064:58"/>
of this World, and so are rather
pre-engag'd than blind, and buy
not that Pearl of price, because
we have laid out our Stock on
other trifles, which is a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in our Reason, and for which
we would contemn other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants:
And this is to be cur'd
by having a true value for things,
and by rectifying all our <hi>Ideas;</hi>
and therefore, he who resolves
to reason justly, should begin first
to consider, when any thing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs,
of what use it may be,
and of what value it is. As for
instance, Is this Land, for which
I am sinfully providing Money,
worth Heaven? or this Man,
whom I am to please, abler
to make me happy than God
Almighty, to whom in this I
prefer him? And so, like a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Chymist, resolve every thing
into its true Principles, and then
try its value; and like a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
who has been often cheated,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53064:58"/>
resolve at last to consider what
such things are worth, whether
they will be fashionable where
we are going, and whether they
will return us the Stock we lay
out upon them?</p>
            <p>For improving this thought,
we should consider, that tho' we
discover truths, yet we do not
take time to ponder them suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently:
And thus, tho' we be
convinc'd, yet we improve not
sufficiently our convictions. Self-love,
and the love of Ease has
us'd us to a partial and superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
way of enquiry; and from
this also proceed these wanderings
which weaken those pious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and disturb that earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Prayer, by which we can
only procure a just illumination
in our reasoning; desultoriness
of thought grows daily when it
is not lessen'd, and the next days
wanderings are the punishment
of those which we suffered to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53064:59"/>
prevail yesterday. But should we
not be asham'd, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think our Salvation worthy
of some serious hours, since it
is that which God Almighty has
constantly design'd, and follow'd
from all Eternity, tho' we are
far more concerned in it. And
that we can spend many entire
hours upon a question of Law
or Mathematicks, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fix our thoughts upon that
Infinite Being, in whom there
are far more infinite Perfections;
an Object that can never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted,
where every thought
would open a new Scene of
thoughts, yet more delightful;
by which, Angels have been for
many thousands of years detain'd
in constant raptures, contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those admirable Mysteries,
which the Scripture tells us,
the Angels desire to pry into,
finding by a constant enquiry,
new matter of holy Learning,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53064:59"/>
and blessed Curiosity; and are
said by God himself to have
learn'd this from those happy
Christians to whom those myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were first reveal'd, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8.
Learn then, O Christian, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
thy Spirit, try first by
what means thou usest to fix
it on other occasions, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
these from the obvious
advantages that pious fixation
will yield above all others; beg
humbly, by Prayer, a new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to thy native Forces, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to God that thou hast taught
thy own thoughts this seditious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and tumultuariness of which
thou complain'st, and hope, that
as by frequent yieldings thou fed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
that Vice into a habit, so
that by frequent and resolute op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
thou may'st destroy that
obstinate and dangerous habit,
and introduce a contrary one,
which will make thy fix'dness
easie and pleasant. Frequent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53064:60"/>
do also not only make
us argue more strongly and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily,
but do warm us into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
first, and then into a love
for that for which we contend:
And thus Lawyers are oft-times
convinc'd, even in the ill Causes
they plead; and Hereticks fix
themselves in their Errors, by
frequent contests for them. Why
then should we not argue more
frequently both against our selves,
and with others, upon these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Truths, by which also we
should be engag'd in honour to
walk sutably to these truths, of
which we profess to others that
we are convinc'd? And who
could be so absurd, as after he
has been debating against another
for his Drinking, yet would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
him to a Debauch? But, alas,
every Man loves to debate in his
own Calling, except the Christian:
And it is become as much a shame
to talk of Devotion as it ought
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53064:60"/>
to be our Glory and Delight; and
men seem afraid to debate, lest by
being too much convinc'd of what
they ought to do, they should be
too much terrified for what they
have done; and so these Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
beget an uneasiness to them,
when to gratifie their humour;
they are tempted to renew their
sins.</p>
            <p>Hypocrisie affords us a clear
proof of this partiality, as well as
of Man's contradicting himself;
for to confess there is a God who is
Omniscient, who knows the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of hearts, and before whom
there is nothing hid in Heaven
or Earth, and yet to think that
we can conceal our thoughts from
his all-seeing Eye, implies a flat
Contradiction; as it also does to
care for nothing but what may
cause an esteem in our selves, for
our selves. We really value o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens approbation, because
it confirms us in our own: nor
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53064:61"/>
would the vainest man alive va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
all the flatteries imaginable, if
he thought he could not deserve
them. Yet in Hypocrisie we must
know, that we deserve not the
applause to which we pretend, and
it is worthy of our thoughts to
enquire impartially, how men can
reconcile these in themselves; for
the most debauched Reason will
not adventure upon any Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
without some seeming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.
And tho' at the first
it may seem that want of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is the cause of this, yet
this cannot be; for if we know
not that we are masquing, it is
no Hypocrisie; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
Hypocrisie requires great
reflection, because it needs much
precaution. The Reason then of
the first must be, That as to God
we trust our Repentance, and to
his Mercy; as if forsooth, we did
him little wrong, by making his
Creature appear more excellent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53064:61"/>
than it is, and as if it might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
his Service to let others see,
that we are many times more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than they, or that we did God
good Service in encouraging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be Pious by our good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and that we by Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
do only raise an esteem, or
come to an employment by which
we may be truly serviceable to
God in our other actions. But I
really think, that the Heart of
Man is so narrow, that it can hold
only one Scheme of thoughts at
once, and therefore this little Soul
being fill'd with a desire of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
and with the shame of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
silly and undeserving, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
indeed, but all its reflections
look that way. The man is full
of this, and intent upon it, and
so he sees not the Contradiction,
how palpable soever it be; but
yet it is so notorious and discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
that I may justly conclude
his Reason weak, if not blind,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53064:62"/>
who does not discern it. The
Cure then of this subtile Cheat
must be by pursuing this Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
into its secret recess, by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Player before he put on
his fine Cloaths and Disguises, by
turning all our thoughts to God,
and from our selves, adverting se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
and impartially to every
little circumstance in the design
that is to be considered.</p>
            <p>I have oft-times admired the
prevalency of Custom above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and tho' Brutes, who want
Reason, or Children, in whom it
is yet scarce ripened, be led by it;
yet what a strange thing is it, that
in men who have Reason in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,
Custom becomes not only
a second Nature, but overcomes
Nature, and is a second Nature,
because it almost extirpates Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which was our first Nature.
For tho' the older we grow, our
Reason should grow the stronger,
yet it falls still weaker, and melts
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53064:62"/>
so before Custom, that even the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and dutiful Actions we do,
seem rather the effects of Custom
than of Reason. For if they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Reason, the same Reason
which prompted us to do them,
would oblige us to act vertuously on
all other occasions. And we see that
we alter our Vertues as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions
and Customs of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
change. But to conclude this
expostulation, I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that a man should be call'd
reasonable, after he has trusted
the making Laws and Moulds for
living happily and dutifully to
the Multitude or Crowd, the
worst of all Judges; and which
we our selves contemn as an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
giddy, and capricious Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Of which influence of Custom
over Reason, many different Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
occur to me; for sometimes I
think that Customs establish and
fix themselves in us whilst we are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53064:63"/>
yet young, that Reason can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defend it self nor us, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as to unusual Pleasures,
which are the proper and natural
objects of our first years: and like
Weeds that have over-grown the
ground, tho' never so fertile, they
hinder the better Plants from
growing up. To prevent which,
it is necessary that we teach young
ones to reason very early, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom
them to a Christian Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
that is better than what
they can learn in the Schools.
Thus we may make Custom it
self useful rather than hurtful to
Reason, and teach it to serve,
whereas now it governs. And I
know one who cur'd his habitual
Swearing by arguing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
That since even the King's
Enemies were able to restrain
themselves from speaking Treason,
by reflecting on its dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
it was strange, that he
who was convinc'd that Swearing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53064:63"/>
did draw on more dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
could not abstain from
a custom that was altogether hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
without the least allay of
pleasure or advantage, to which
the others might pretend.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I think, that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
having the force of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
which supports it, they all
concur to pull back a well resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Man from his vertuous reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions;
and Custom prevails ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by numbers than by strength:
And to prevent this, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for a man who resolves to
Reason justly, to withdraw for
some time from the Crowd: <hi>Prov.
18. 1. A man,</hi> says <hi>Solomon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
separated himself, meddleth
with all Wisdom;</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> tells
us, That <hi>sanabimur modo à caetu
separemur.</hi> Jesus Christ also who
has triumphed over the World, is
by strong Intercessions, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in against this potent Enemy,
who has shewn us, that he can
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53064:64"/>
throw out and dispossess that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
whose name is Legion: but
the Multitude is never so corrupt,
but that still some are to be found
who can assist us in reasoning
justly upon things; and we should
also remember, that we value so
little the Multitude, that we stand
not in awe of what they say of
us, when we are gaining Money,
or satisfying our Pleasures: why
then should we still spend all we
have, and deny our selves all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in following Custom, or court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fame; since Custom and
Fame are but the Dictates of the
Multitude, an Homage which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
men are forced to pay
the Rabble, because they dare not
seriously reflect on what they do?
Or which designing men pay them
in hopes to make them first Tools
to their Ambition, and thereafter
Slaves to their Tyranny.</p>
            <p>But at other times the strength
of Custom flows from our laziness,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53064:64"/>
who love the way that is chalked
out to us, and think it safe to
follow, rather than lead the crowd;
cheated to this by a cowardly Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
which proves our never
having considered the Nobleness of
our own Origine: which is to
be cured by a generous resolution
of despising difficulties; and of
being Slaves, as all persons are,
who love better to obey, than to
examine the Dictates of others;
and we are most unreasonable,
when we have so strong desires
to lead the Multitude to our ruine,
as in seditious Tumults and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and yet will be content to
be tamely led by them in what is
much nobler and of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.
How much more
do we praise those great Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who govern'd the Multitude
by their Vertues, than those Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants
who adored them by
submissions? There is Light in
Vertue and Religion, and there
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53064:65"/>
is none dares resist it; it is able to
astonish as well as convince: nor are
men so wicked as not to desire to
be assisted by some happy Genius,
in what they are convinced is best.
And every man almost stands on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in awe of another, expecting
and wishing some <hi>Moses</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
their delivery.</p>
            <p>Generally Self-love seems to
lead into these Sentiments, as
thinking the Multitude will cry
up their own inclinations, and is
unwilling to check that Multitude
from which it expects applause;
and whose many Suffrages it needs
to maintain it, against that inward
sense it has of its own weakness
and silliness: and this is to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a noble reflection upon the
dignity of our first Creation; and
a desire to be again like to that
God whose Image at first we were,
and whose Sons we may yet be,
if we can raise our hopes above
those lower Spheres of sensual
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53064:65"/>
Joyes and Pleasures which poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
us when they seem sweet,
and cheat us when they appear
great.</p>
            <p>One of the dreadful effects of
our following the Example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is, that we think it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to be as reasonable as they:
And thus we foolish and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Mortals, stint and bound
one anothers goodness; now this
we shall easily perceive to be most
unreasonable, when we consider
that no Man will satisfie himself
in being as powerful or rich as
his Neighbours; tho' these be
much less desireable for a Soul
and Spirit, which is the Image of
an Infinite God, and is, after all
its best endeavours here, very
far from attaining to that degree
of perfection which is even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to the life of a Christian.
Devotion is a Race, and who is
it that when he runs with many
Rivals, will content himself to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53064:66"/>
be in the throng, especially if
the Prize be considerable: And
therefore the Apostle exhorts us
to <hi>forget those things which are
behind, and to reach forth to those
things that are before, pressing
towards the mark, for the prize
of the high calling in Christ Iesus,</hi>
Phil. 3. 14. We are not only
obliged to press on to obtain
the Crown, but being pursued by
our spiritual Enemies, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to use all the speed that
is possible. And would not we
conclude him mad, who if he
were pursu'd for his life, would
not desire to be past all danger,
but content himself that he were
not the last amongst those who
endeavoured to escape?</p>
            <p>It is strange, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that Custom does so lead
us when we go not where we
ought to go, but where others
have gone before us, yet we oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
err to a contrary extreme,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53064:66"/>
and by a contrary reason, which
is as false and more dangerous
than the other, reasoning weakly
and falsly from a design and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be singular, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to be admir'd; thus even
whilst in this we oppose the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
we design to please them
too; for no Man admires what
does not delight him; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
these same contradictors
would have chosen rather to
have gone to Fame in the beaten
path, by a direct pleasing and
following of them; but finding
a Crowd before them in it, which
they could not pass by, they,
by a long and a dangerous circuit,
run before, and endeavour to keep
the Pass on their Rivals, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them from coming up at
Fame; and tho' they want the
multitude at present, yet they
hope to make them follow, else
they would not differ from them;
for few would care to continue
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53064:67"/>
alone till the last, tho' they love
to be singular at first; yet this
humour is a very great Enemy
to true reasoning, for it intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a habit of arguing falsly;
and it is difficult in this dark
estate to recover our road; if we
once quit our light, one errour
emboldens us to commit another,
and it is the punishment of it,
when committed; even those
who care not to oppose Truth,
love to be consequential in their
opposition; for to do otherwise,
were to be guilty of a double
and more palpable vice in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning.</p>
            <p>Another great hinderance to
right Reasoning, is Sensuality:
For though I am far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their opinion, who think
the Soul nothing but the Animal
Spirits; since we cannot conceive
how matters can think so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately
and subtily, yet there is
no doubt but the tempers of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53064:67"/>
Body has great influence on the
Mind; and that Sobriety does
purifie the Blood, and make these
animal Spirits fitter Organs for
the Soul; as on the other hand,
Drunkenness drowns it, Gluttony
stupifies it, and even after that
time has dissipated those loads
which oppress the Soul, there
remains a stock of dregs which
are easily inflam'd into Lust, Rage,
and other brutal Passions, which
in a more lasting manner inslave
it. Therefore Pagans have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
Sobriety as a Diet
for the Soul as well as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the Scripture Fasting, as
a Religious Duty; and since
there is none of us so Brutal,
but if we were about to Preach,
Plead, or assist in a publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature,
we would be careful
to avoid all these Excesses, lest
thereby our Reason might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
or clouded; we ought
much more to shun them, with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53064:68"/>
an Eye to the service of an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
God, and the preservation
of our immortal Souls, minding
in this the observation of the
Prophet, <hi>Wine, and new wine
take away the heart;</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of our Saviour, <hi>See that
you be not overcharged with sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
and drunkenness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remain yet two vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Enemies to our Reason to
be subdued, Bigotry and Raillery;
which tho' they be contrary to
one another; Bigotry treating
things that are ridiculous as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
and Raillery treating things
Sacred as ridiculous, yet they
both conspire against our Reason,
and are the favourite extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the times, which obliges me
to insist the more upon them.</p>
            <p>I define Bigotry to be a laying
too much stress upon any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
point of Religion or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and the making all other essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Duties subservient thereto,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53064:68"/>
and got its name from an occasion
extravagant like it self. <hi>Rolland</hi> first
Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged to do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to <hi>Charles</hi> King
of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Du Lange verb. Bigot.</note> for that Dutchy, refus'd
to kiss his Foot, except the King
would raise it himself to his mouth;
and when it was told him that the
Solemnity consisted in his tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the King's Foot and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it, he answer'd, <hi>Ne se bigot,</hi>
that is to say in old <hi>Norman,</hi>
Not so by God; Whereupon the
King and Court derided him, and
the <hi>Normans</hi> were from that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
called Bigots, as they who
adhered pertinaciously to Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Extravagancies. These latter
Ages having, in this dotage of the
World, produc'd multitudes, who
mistaking Reformation for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and seeing some Devout
Men admired for separating from
Idolatrous and Superstitious Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
because they would not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53064:69"/>
reform great and fundamental
Errours, imagined that every
thing was to be stuck at with
the same zeal which these shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in matters of greatest conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and by a farther effect of
the same zeal, they proceeded to
force others to concur with them
in their extravagancies, which
surprising distraction forced Men
to bestow on them the name of
Bigots; Superstition could not
so well agree to them, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only an excessive Worship
paid to a Deity, true or false,
from an ill-grounded fear of
mischief from it: nor could dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matising
serve, that being only
a positiveness in any Opinion,
joyned to the vanity of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Dogmatizer had
right to dictate to others; nor
Opiniarity, because that consists
only in adhering too stifly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Opinion in spight of the best
Reasons; nor Schism, because it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53064:69"/>
is an unnecessary separation; nor
Heresie, for tho' it is an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Errour in some important
point, yet it is always in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith; whereas Bigotry
rests only in matters of small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
but tho Bigotry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
relates to matters Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
in our late acceptation,
yet it is by an easie stretch u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to express opiniatrities of all
kinds; and if we consider its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
we must conclude, that
it has been drawn to matters
Ecclesiastick, and is appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
now to them, because they
are the most remarkable and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
instances or effects of this
mischievous Principle. For we
may justly say, that Bigotry is the
Hypochondriacism of Reason, the
Bedlam of Religion, and the Ape
of Infallibility.</p>
            <p>Instances of this Bigotry, as
they are very frequent, so they
are very ancient. The Apostles
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53064:70"/>
themselves were forc'd very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to inveigh against Zeal that
was not according to Knowledge;
and the chief of their Scholars,
who had been so happy as to
hear them preach, did yet rend
the Church by a dreadful Schism,
which soon after grew to that
heighth, that the Western Church
excommunicated the Eastern, for
differing from them in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of <hi>Easter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The best way to deter Men
from spending their time and
zeal in the service of Bigotry,
either as its Chaplains, or as its
Emissaries or Executioners, will
be to consider the great defects,
under which it labours, and the
sad effects which it produceth.</p>
            <p>The first pernicious effect of
Bigotry, is, that it obtrudes on
us things of no moment as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the greatest importance.
Now, as it would be a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in a Man's sense to take a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53064:70"/>
Star for the Sun; or in an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour
to insist tenaciously on a
point which deserved no conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
so it must be a much
greater errour in a Christian to
prefer, or even to equal a meer
circumstance to the solid points
of Religion.</p>
            <p>But these mistakes become
more dangerous, by inducing their
Votaries to believe, that because
they are Orthodox in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
they are the only People
of God, and all who joyn not
are Aliens to the Commonwealth
of <hi>Israel:</hi> And from this springs
first, that they, as Friends of
God, may be familiar with him,
and, as Friends do one to another,
may speak to him without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or premeditation; thence
it is that we hear dreadful
nonsense insolently vented in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
Prayers, such as would
induce one to think that they
do not believe him to be a God
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53064:71"/>
to whom they shew so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect;
for who can think that
Infinite Wisdom can consider them
as Friends, who dare address to
him so unsuitably? Bigotry hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus corrupted our reasoning
in matters of Religion, it easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves
it in the whole course of
our Morals and Politicks.</p>
            <p>The Bigots in the Second place
proceed to fancy, that they who
differ from them are Enemies to
God, because they differ from
God's People; and then the Old
Testament is consulted for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
denouncing Vengeance
against them: All Murders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Sacrifices by the Example
of <hi>Phineas</hi> and <hi>Ehud;</hi> all Rapines
are hallowed by the <hi>Israelites</hi>
borrowing the Ear-rings of the
<hi>Egyptians;</hi> and Rebellions have
an hundred forc'd Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
brought to patronise them.
But I oftentimes wonder where
they find Precedents in the Old
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53064:71"/>
Testament for Murdering and
Robbing Mens Reputations, or
for lying so impudently for what
they think the good Old Cause;
which God foreseeing, has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us not to lie, even for
his sake.</p>
            <p>The Third link of this Chain,
is, That they fancying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be the only <hi>Israel,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that God sees no sin in
them, all is allowable to them;
and (as one of themselves said)
<hi>They will be as good to God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth is, That such as
differ from them are Bastards,
and not the true Sons of God,
and therefore they ought to have
no share of this Earth, or its
Government; hence flow these
holy and useful Maxims, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is founded in Grace, and
the Saints have the only right to
govern the Earth; which being
once upon an occasion earnestly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53064:72"/>
press'd in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s little Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it was answered by the
President of his Council, That
the Saints deserved all things,
but that Publick Employment
was such a drudgery that it would
be unjust to condemn the Saints
to it, and that the securest way
to make the Common-wealth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
was to leave them in a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
retirement, interceding for
the Nation at the Throne of
Grace.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Errour in their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
is, That seeing their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
flow immediately from
Heaven, no earthly Government
can condemn any thing they do,
in prosecution of these their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions;
thence it is that they
raise Seditions and Rebellions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any scruple of Conscience,
and believing themselves the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and Friends of God, they think
themselves above Kings, who are
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53064:72"/>
only their Servants and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.</p>
            <p>It may seem strange, that
such Principles as Bigotry sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
should be able to produce
so strange effects, and many fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
persons pretend it to be
from God, because it prevails so.
But this wonder will be much
lessen'd if we consider first, That
the greatest part of Mankind are
weak or dishonest, and both these
support Bigotry with all their
might. Many virtuous Men also
promote its Interest from a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
good nature, and vain
Men from a design of gaining
Popularity. These who are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblig'd
by the Government joyn
their Forces with it, to make to
themselves a Party; and those
who are naturally unquiet or
factious, find in it a pleasant
divertisement; whereas on the
other side, few are so concern'd
for Moderation and Truth as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53064:73"/>
the Bigots are for their belov'd
Conceits.</p>
            <p>There is also a tinsel Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in it which dazles the Eyes
of unthinking People; and this
arises either from the new Zeal,
that like Youth, is still vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
and has not as yet spent
it self so as that it needs to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish;
or else, from the Bigot's
being conscious that his Opinions
need to be disguis'd under this
hypocritical Mask.</p>
            <p>Severity also encreases the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Zeal of Bigots. Humane
Nature inclines us wisely to that
pity which we may one day need;
and few pardon the Severity of
a Magistrate, because they know
not where it may stop. I have
known also some very serious
Men, who have concluded, that
since Magistrates have not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in other things a great
concern for Devotion, their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
against these Errours
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53064:73"/>
must arise either from the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of their temper, or from
some hid design of carrying on a
particular Interest, very different
from, and oft-times inconsistent
with the Religious Zeal they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.
And generally, the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
believe that all Superiours
are inclin'd to triumph over those
who are subjected to them;
many have also a secret perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that the Magistrates are still
in League with the National
Church, and its Hierarchy, which
they suspect to be supported
by them, because it maintains
their Interest, and they are apt
to consider Churchmen but as
Pensioners, and so as Partizans to
the Civil Magistrate.</p>
            <p>Many are drawn into the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of such Opinions as they
see Men suffer difficulties for
But this mistake was foreseen by
the Primitive Church, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declared that <hi>non Paena, sed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53064:74"/>
Causa facit Martyrem.</hi> Christian
Prudence does not allow a Man
to sell his precious Life for an
incompetent Price; Forwardness
that way does not always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
an Opinion: Men of
all Perswasions have died with
firmness; Pagans, yea, Women
for their Country or Husbands
have shewed a courage beyond
any of these Bigots or Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts.
The History of <hi>China</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
a notable Instance of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical
Bigotry; an Hundred
Thousand <hi>Chineses,</hi> who had born
tamely their Nation's being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slav'd
by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> without
making any Effort to recover
their Liberty, chose rather to
dye than conform to the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
in turning up their Mustaches
after their Mode; Vanity well
disguis'd can flatter Men with
the Glory of Martyrdom; and
its observable that this Firmness
faints often where Executions are
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53064:74"/>
Private; however, this should
prevail with a Wise Magistrate,
never to make Religious Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Criminal.</p>
            <p>The true Cures then of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
seem to be, First, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to plant Reason early and
carefully in the Hearts of Young
ones, or to recover it in those
of more advanced Years; for
this is a more solid and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
way, than the immediate op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
or offering to cure this
Imperfection it self, will prove;
Men love their old and familiar
Acquaintance; Traveling abroad
conduces much to this Cure;
for such as converse only with
those of their own Perswasion, are
daily warm'd into new degrees
of Zeal; whereas, when we see
that Men of true sense differ
from us, we will be inclin'd from
a Christian Modesty and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
first to doubt our own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
and then to hear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53064:75"/>
The Orthodox Clergy
should by their Pious Lives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to this Cure; and even La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks
should, by their serious and
Devout Conversation, convince
them that Sincerity and Piety
are not inseparable from such hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Conceits. These poor
deluded People should consider
what Mischiefs and Desolations
those <hi>Vulcanos</hi> of Zeal have brought
upon this Island by their dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eruptions; there being but
very few Families, in which some
of their Children have not been
sacrificed to this <hi>Moloch:</hi> Nor
can our Navies or Armies se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us while this Enemy lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
within us, and is cherished
by us. They should also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that Religious Reason
left to it self will at last over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
those prejudices, which, like
Meteors, may shine for a time,
but will at last vanish into the
common and undistinguish'd Air.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53064:75"/>
But the best of all Remedies,
is, to consider seriously the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Practice of our Blessed
Saviour (to form our Reason by
which is the great design of this
Essay) and therefore they should
remember, that our Saviour fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
the inconsequentialness of
their Actions, did observe, that
they did start at Straws, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Camels; that they tithed
the Mint and Annise, but forgot
the great things of the Law. Our
Saviour's reasoning in the Parable
of the Publican and Pharisee,
should humble all spiritual Pride;
and his humble and submissive
Form of Prayer should bridle the
indiscretion of all rude Addressers;
He suffered the Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi>
to call for Fire from Heaven, that
he might thereby instruct the
World how unsuitable their Zeal
was to his Gospel; he reasoned
against fighting <hi>Peter,</hi> that if his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53064:76"/>
Kingdom were of this Earth, his
Servants would fight for him;
and if he needed any Assistance,
he might call for Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
Nor can I think, after this
Instance, our Saviour would
have trusted <hi>Peter,</hi> in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
with two Swords, since
he was so forward in his own
presence, when he had but one:
But if others will be so blind
as not to follow our Saviour's
way of reasoning, let us at least
follow it, in praying for them,
because they know not what
they are doing; yet I wish both
they and we would consider,
that we resemble too much at
this time the unhappy <hi>Iews,</hi> who,
by fighting amongst themsleves,
for small matters, relating to
their Religious Rites, occasioned
their being totally destroyed, and
extirpated by the <hi>Romans</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:53064:76"/>
I know no greater enemy to just
thoughts or Reasoning than Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
and Satyrs, and the new way
of reasoning by ridiculous Similies.
Most Men are so famous for this
kind of arguing, and do by it
confute and baffle so much all
who oppose it, that it passes
for the stronger way of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Victory being still account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Effect as well as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of strength: But yet this
way looks so sillie to Men when
they retire and are alone, that
they begin to wonder what it
was that pleas'd them so before
they left the conversation. And
therefore I think it worth my
pains to search a little into the
causes of this vulgar errour, why
Men are so much pleased with
raillery, and why it prevails so
in the World at this day?</p>
            <p>The first cause of this, in my
opinion, is, that Men naturally
love Truth, as the Eyes do Light,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53064:77"/>
or Bruits Food; for Truth is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Light and Food of the
Soul; yet missing it, after much
enquiry, and a passionate search,
they do either conclude there is
none, and so laugh at all others
who seek it, or in revenge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
it as a Cheat; and this
breeds at first Raillery and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;
even as we see, that when
Gallants are rebuked by a severe
Mistress, they please or revenge
themselves in railing at her, or
treating her in ridicule. As
States-men and Courtiers seldom
fail, when thrown off, to use the
Court and Employments from
which they are fall'n, after the
same manner. And since too
few seek after Truth it self, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and unrewarded; others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
weary of the toils and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
required in true reasoning;
rest on this, as the easiest; even
as Men content themselves with
gilded Plate, when they cannot
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53064:77"/>
attain to true Gold; and Raillery
has become by this as ordinary as
the false Jewels, with which so
many now please themselves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead,
of true ones; and at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and on the publick Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
even of business, the one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
brisker than the other.</p>
            <p>Raillery pleases also mens Self-love
better than Truth; for Truth
is too severe to flatter our Vanity,
and too honest to serve our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
whereas Raillery does
tempt the Jester to flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and is an ordinary occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for others to flatter him as
a formidable Wit: Nor can the
World find so fit a Tool for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
as Raillery; since few durst
even for fear of checks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
stab their Neighbour, or
for Honour wound him when his
back is turn'd, if it were not in
a pleasant jest, which makes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
pass for Wit, and cheats the
Satyrists into a belief that they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53064:78"/>
design not to wrong him, but to
please the company: The Hearers
also would hate such Enemies to
Mankind, if they were not so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd
with the way, that they
had not time to think on the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
This misfortune also attends
it, that it tempts men to do or
say many things on which they
would not otherwise adventure;
presuming that their Wit, which
is so much admir'd, will also fright
or bribe others from accusing or
punishing them.</p>
            <p>Truth is a sober and equal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
free from all transports and
hateing them, and so seems dull
and flat to young and warm Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
whereas that passion which
accompanies Raillery, either in
Joy or Revenge, is more vigorous
and elevated; and it is indeed a
wonder to think what force and
energy there is in the Soul, when
the Sails of its Imagination are
filled with the prosperous gale of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53064:78"/>
Applause, and by what secret
springs the Fancy is able to raise
it to such heights when it is
warmly pleas'd; or what infinite
numbers of ravishing Images ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to a strong Fancy: And how
it creates so many pleasant notions
out of other Mens Infirmities:
And what great variety and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it constantly produces, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always various Scenes of Joy, to
the wonder even of sober men:
I deny not, but some do from
good Nature, and to please the
Conversation, scoff and jest, and,
as I said formerly, some seeing
it so much admir'd, think it is
truly good, it being a kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
to believe that good which
pleases others; and some seeing
Victory attend it, think it is the
strongest way of arguing; and,
thus this Weed rises and spreads,
and we sit with delight under the
refreshing shades; and with these
raptures of Malice or Pleasure,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53064:79"/>
Scoffers are so much taken, that
they have not the leisure to think
on what they ought to do, or
even on what they are doing;
and thus they forget frequently
the duty they owe to great men,
to whom they have access, and
can hardly keep themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that moderation in Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Eating, Drinking, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Exercises that are requisite
for preserving Health and Quiet,
or for observing the Rules of
Decency and Discretion: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That Jesting and Satyrs are
so far from being a relaxation of
Spirit to those who are wearied
with serious Employments, as is
pretended, that they are oft-times
rather a new and studied toil,
and most of these extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
 could scarce be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
like bitter and sour Fruits
which can hardly be eaten, except
when confected with great care and
expence. But if we look further
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53064:79"/>
into the matter, we shall find that
nothing wrongs more both Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Piety, and is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to true Friendship, or
more inconsistent with Sincerity.</p>
            <p>For clearing whereof we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that every Faculty of the Soul
contributes in a peculiar way to
our reasoning: the Judgment does
bring solid Arguments, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
Instances, Examples, and
Citations, the Fancy or Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
beautifies rather than illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
its Objects with Similies,
Metaphors, and other Rhetorical
Figures; so that Raillery neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the other two, sports it self
lightly amidst those Flowers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
minding the great business;
and I have observed, that few
who have been once bewitched
with this way, ever minded any
other. This suffers them not to
penetrate further than the outside
of things, and so it is impossible,
that they who use it as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53064:80"/>
divertisement, can have any
deep thoughts, or can search into
the bottom of Affairs.</p>
            <p>I have also observed, that Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
arises oft-times from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
of all persons and
things, and nothing can be more
contrary to Religion or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than this is. To Religion,
because, when a Man contemns
all that God has created, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalues
what the Almighty
himself was pleased with, and
rejoyced in, and scorns those great
Exemplars of Piety and Devotion,
whom God has called his Friends,
and Men after his own heart; and
so in effect he concludes, that
God (blessed be his holy Name)
made not good choice, and knew
not how to value men a-right.
And therefore I stand astonish'd
to hear Ballads against <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>David</hi> so much admir'd by such
as confess there is a God, that
the Scriptures are his Dictates,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53064:80"/>
and they the Pen-men of these
Scriptures, and so Secretaries to
God: Nor do such Scoffers make
good States-men; for none are
such, save they who from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Conviction and Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
manage publick Affairs to
the advantage of those who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them: Whereas they who
believe that nothing is worth
their pains, can never do any
thing with affection and vigour;
and since they care not for the
things themselves, and scorn such
as employ them, they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
care for what Events attend
them. Have we not seen some of
these great Wits prove the worst
of all States-men in our own
days? and as far below the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in management as they were
above the wisest in Wit and
Sharpness. What Friends also
these prove is sufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to those whom they have
lost for a Jest, after all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53064:81"/>
they could have done them:
And it is very observable, that
if Three or Four of them be in
a Room, they who remain after
such Conversations will fall on him
who is gone with all the malice
imaginable; and we very seldom
see two such Wits true Friends.</p>
            <p>I shall end these Reflections
with this Addition, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Satyrs are made up of
Impiety, Malice or Baudery;
the First, unworthy of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
the Second, of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and the last, of a sober
Man; and in which Railers have
Atheists for their Masters, saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Wasps for their Comrades,
and oft-times Fools and mad
Men for their Superiours. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Men who do things that
they must be asham'd of, and
whereof the pleasure is lessen'd
in the present time by checks of
Conscience, and grows bitter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by fear of Torments; a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53064:81"/>
quality our Saviour never coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd,
which his Favourites
have ever zealously decry'd, in
which Buffoons and Players have
exceeded the greatest Kings, the
most Renowned Hero's, and the
Wisest men; a cowardly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy
which ever attacks the
Weak, and a merciless humour
which triumphs over the Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate;
upon which accounts all
men make it their Interest to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Scoffer, as finding in his
Ruine their own Self-defence;
and because they know he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be pleased except they be
miserable, therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that they cannot be secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till he be humbled.</p>
            <p>I design not by this to lessen
the esteem due to true Wit, and
that pleasantness in conversation
which arises from it as Flowers
do from the Root. The Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
certainly design'd to make all
men happy, and there is no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53064:82"/>
without pleasure; and as
he rejoyced, when he saw that
all that he had made was good,
so he was desirous that Man might
find out this good, both for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself thereby happy, and
for inviting him the more to
magnify the Creator, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to sweeten the miseries which
naturally imbitter humane Life:
God has illuminated some with a
pleasantness of humour, which
rejoyces the Society into which
they come, as the Sun illuminates
the Room into which it enters;
these are they who having peace
of Conscience at home, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
allowed to be glad; and who
having Wit, employ it in turning
the right side of things to them,
understanding as well to find out
what is pleasant in any Object as
Artists do to find a Mine of Gold
in a barren Mountain. This is
the true use of Wit; and if at
any time they use it to treat
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53064:82"/>
Vice or Extravagancy in ridicule,
it is not from Malice to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but from desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him, and Mankind by him.
There is a justice in Scourging,
Defaming, and Banishing Vice;
and this Jurisdiction is given by
Heaven immediately to such as
have sense; of whom, upon that
account, the greatest Rulers stand
in awe; and so much reverence
is due to them, that the rest of
Mankind bestow applause accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their inclinations: Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
then, and sullen Moroseness
in Wit is the tyranny of this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction:
If it be insolent, it is
but the wrong side of this delicate
Picture, a flashing Light, which
at first dazles, but thereafter blinds;
a delicious Fruit corrupted into
bitterness, and a beautiful Face
wrinkled by fretting humours.</p>
            <p>The Ancients term'd Wit a Salt;
and that is not fit for Food, but for
Seasoning; it may be us'd plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53064:83"/>
in Conversation, moderately
in Business, but never in Religion.</p>
            <p>They who enter into a Faction do
not properly reason weakly: but
desert Reason altogether, as one
does who leaves his own to go into
another Country, whereof the Laws
Customs and Language are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
The design and center of
Faction is to drive on such a Project,
and adhere to those who prosecute
it. And therefore nothing must be
allow'd or argu'd but with respect
to these. Hence it is that in vain you
reason with them; for one may
transubstantiate as soon as convert
them, all that their Friends say is
unanswerable, and they contemn
and scorn what is said by their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
when they cannot answer
it; there is no crime they dare not
commit, for the Guilt seems but
small when divided amongst so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
bearers, they warm themselves
by clubbing into a kind of belief, and
they vote themselves into a shadow
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53064:83"/>
of Infallibility; whilst they cry out
against others as Slaves to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
they become really Slaves
to the Faction, their Liveries and
Chains being seen by all, except
themselves; but the great Salary
with which their Bondage is to be
rewarded, is Applause from their
Friends, or it may be the Mob, to
whom naturally their Appeal lies,
and the getting into the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where they will be abhorred
for practising every thing they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
decry'd, &amp; so have that repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for which they toil'd, blasted
by their own old Arguments; this
extravagancy is in it self so unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to all devout and reasonable
men, that it is forc'd to use Railery
to baffle Religion by Bigotry, and
Reason by Railery; and I believe that
Faction was the first introducer of
the one into the Church, and of
the other into the State.</p>
            <p>My chiefest wish then shall be,
that God who has ennobled me
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53064:84"/>
with right Reason, may make me
happy in the right use of it; that
I may neither sell it for Money,
nor barter it for Fame; and that
it may never be dazled by the
shining brightness of Favour, nor
clouded by the black shadows of
Fear; and tho' the portion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon me be very small,
that yet I may employ that one
precious Talent so, as that I may
have from my Glorious Master
that only desireable Character,
<hi>Well done, good and faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
thou hast been faithful in a
few things, enter thou into the joy
of thy Lord,</hi> Matth. 25. 23.</p>
