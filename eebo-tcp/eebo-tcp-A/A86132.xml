            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any Precepts of Moralitie the latter part of this Chapter hath ſummoned up together. Among which there is not any more important, more difficult then this I have here read you, nor at this time more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. Important it is, for it comprehends the ſubſtance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Precepts before and after it. Such as, <hi>Be of the ſame minde one to another: Recompenſe to no man evil for evil: Provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men. Not avenging your ſelves; but give place unto wrath: I thine Enemie bunger, feed him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor this onely; but it includes the whole compaſſe of Charity towards men: ſo that in this one precept all the Law towards our neighbour appears ſummoned up. For as <hi>love is the fulfilling of the Law:</hi> ſo peace is the fulfilling of our love. <hi>Love worketh no evil to his neighbour:</hi> And peace multiplieth all good upon our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Peace is the complement of all bleſſings upon the bodie politick, as health is of all bleſſings, on the body naturall. As
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116081:3"/>the ſafetie of our naturall bodies conſiſts in a kinde of peace among humors, and a union of all parts and members: So the ſafetie of all Civill bodies, in peace or harmonie among ſeverall affections, and the union of all members politick. So that fulfill this one dutie, and fulfill all duties, to the common ſociety of men belonging. The happineſſe of private perſons is contained in the publick: The happineſſe of the publick (when all is done) will be found to conſiſt in peace. Live peaceably then, and ye take the readieſt way to happineſſe, both for your ſelves, and others, for your private and for the publick intereſt. So that a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant dutie then lyeth in this Text, can hardly be imagined.</p>
            <p>Yet as it is very important, ſo tis very difficult. That may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the two limitations annexed: <hi>If it be poſſible,</hi> and, <hi>As much as lyeth in you. If it be poſſible.</hi> So that ſometimes the work may be neither poſſible, not yet lying in us. And yet even then, we are not diſcharged, till we have done all we poſſible may, and all that lyeth in us, with all the faculties and powers of minde and body to accompliſh it. And the latter of theſe will coſt us diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie enough; by which we may take an eſtimate, how hard a buſineſſe we are now toward: and how great need, as of our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours, ſo of our fervent prayers: That what appears beyond our power, the God of power and peace both, would vouchſafe to make up, and remove all difficulties from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
            <p>It is his work we are about. To him that made Heaven and Earth nothing more acceptable, then to make peace among men; Nor any thing more becoming the honour of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> for the very end of Chriſts coming was to make it. It was the laſt bleſſing our Saviour beſtowed on his Diſciples at his going. <hi>Peace</hi> I <hi>leave with you: My peace I give unto you.</hi> St. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 27. The laſt and the firſt, at his coming. For at his birth, it was a main part of the Angels ſong, <hi>Pax in terris, Peace on the earth.</hi> When again he roſe from the dead it was his firſt ſalutation, <hi>Pax vobis, Peace be unto you:</hi> Joh. 20.19. And when he began firſt to teach, it was among his firſt bleſſings, <hi>Beati pacifici, B'eſſed be the peace-makers'</hi> Himſelf therefore ye finde ſtyled by the Prophet, <hi>Princeps pacis, The Prince of peace,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. By the Apoſtle, <hi>Deus pacis, The God of peace:</hi> Heb. 13. Nay, <hi>Ipſe, pax noſtra, our very peace;</hi> who hath broken
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116081:3"/>down the partition wall: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. His Diſciples tearmed in Scripture, <hi>Angeli pacis, Meſſengers of peace.</hi> How beautifull are the feet of them, that bring the glad tydings of it! <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. Sent forth to teach the world with peace in their mouthes, <hi>Luk</hi> 10.5. known all the world over by this Charter; <hi>In this ſhall all mers know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another.</hi> Joh. 13.35. And what love without peace? His Goſpel therefore we finde intituled, <hi>The Goſpel of peace;</hi> His righteouſneſſe, <hi>the work of peace;</hi> His glorious kingdom, <hi>the Peace that paſſeth all underſtanding.</hi> Tis the generall Preface of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, <hi>Grace and Peace be with you. The beginning of the wayes of God the Redeemer, who came to guide our feet into the way of peace;</hi> and the end of our way, the finall ſum of heavenly bliſſe, <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace.</hi> So that neither to this life, nor the life to come; Neither to happineſs temporall, nor happineſs eternall; Neither to God nor Man, to Policie nor Religion, can ye conceive any thing more agreeable then Peace, or any Precepts more to be valued, then ſuch as ſhew the way to it.</p>
            <p>Not to hold you too long in Prefacing; but to proceed to a diviſion of the Text. Two parts there appear at firſt ſight in it. Firſt, a duty generally required, <hi>Live peaceably with all men:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a limitation of that duty, implying in ſome caſes a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of it, and that two wayes expreſſed, <hi>if it be poſſible,</hi> and, <hi>as much as lieth in you:</hi> In the former Generall, that is, the Duty required; ye may take notice of three Particulars; firſt, the thing injoyned, namely, Peaceably living; ſecondly, the parties towards whom 'tis injoyned, and they are Men; thirdly, the indifferency or univerſality of thoſe Parties, <hi>with all men.</hi> Theſe three Particulars, together with the two limitatations annexed make in all five parts of our Text. Firſt, <hi>Live peaceably,</hi> ſecondly, <hi>with men,</hi> thirdly, <hi>with all men,</hi> fourthly, <hi>If it be poſſible,</hi> fiftly, <hi>As much as lieth in you.</hi> To proceed orderly, we begin with the thing enjoyned, which is the ſubſtance of the Dutie,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Live peaceably.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things would here be inquired of. Firſt, what Peace is, and then what it is to live peaceably; As touching the firſt, What Peace is, School-writers inform us it is, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nio virtutum appetitiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> a union of powers appetitive, ſo that all creatures capable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116081:4"/>of appetite, are likewiſe capable of Peace or diſcord, according as their particular appetites agree, or diſagree. Now as of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers creatures the appetites are divers, and ſometimes repugnant one to the other; ſo alſo in one and the ſame creature are found different appetites, betwixt which ma fall out now and then repugnant and contrariety; as betwixt the ſenſuall appetite and the rationall, whereby it comes to paſs that one and the ſame party other-whiles is out of peace with himſelf: Hence is it that Schoolmen make a double degree of Peace, one <hi>ad extra,</hi> betwixt the appetites of different parties, which they call concord, or outward peace. Another <hi>ad intra,</hi> betwixt the ſever all appetites of one and the ſame party, which they call mentall or inward peace. To the accompliſhment of Peace in its perfection, both theſe would concur. Firſt, a quiet of our own hearts within, that our affections be not divided among themſelves, by running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contrary appetitites. And ſecondly, quieter concord with our neighbours without, that their affections contrary to ours, divide us not againſt them. Of theſe twaine, the latter in our Text ſeemes principally intended, namely, outward peace, or concord, for it is, <hi>Live peaceably with men,</hi> and yet the inward may not be excluded, becauſe unleſs a boſome peace be well cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, externall peace is quickly broken: Inward tranquility (ſaith one) is the ground of outward, unleſs our domeſtick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites amongſt themſelves be at unity among our neighbours, we cannot chuſe but jarr and breed diſſention. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, That no evill man can rightly fulfill this precept of our Text, becauſe ſuch an one is diſtitute of inward peace, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ever and anon raiſeth tumults within him; his reaſon and his ſenſe diſtract him ſeverall wayes, and he obeyeth two Maſters, with others therefore he can hold no conſtant friendſhip, who is ſo unſtable and at variance with himſelf, <hi>Non est pax impiis, There is no peace ſaith my God to the wicked, Iſay</hi> 57.21. How can there be? While their boſomes within, are like a troubled ſea, whoſe waves caſt up mire and dirt? And yet an appearance of peace there may be for a time, as betwixt <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilot</hi> there was (you know upon what occaſion) but as true friendſhip that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, which is not founded in goodneſs, no more true peace: for peace and friendſhip go together: Falſe peace and not to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116081:4"/>truſted is the friendſhip of wicked men, for while they purſue each one the pleaſure of his ſenſuall appetite, to have their fill of theſe temperall good things (things which cannot be enjoyed by many) needs muſt they fall ſometimes upon deſire of the ſame honor, or profit, or pleaſure, which diverſe cannot ſhare between them, from whence ariſeth envie, trouble, and diſcord, driving all peace out of doores.</p>
            <p>To give you therefore the right Peace here diſcribed: It is ſuch a Peace as preſerves, firſt, our own hearts and affections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed within. And ſecondly, upholds laſting concord and agreement with our neighbours without. Both theſe would be had, for to keep outward correſpondencie and not inward, to make ſhew of Peace in our behaviour while our hearts are fraught with envie and malice, what can be worſe hipocriſie? And to keep inward peace, without any outward ſignes, as great an indecorum, if not impoſſibilitie; for how can any think his conſcience ſhould be at peace with God, whoſe actions are not peaceable towards men? <hi>He that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeene, how can be love God whom he hath not ſeene?</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Iohn:</hi> and he that keeps not peace with his neighbours with whom he hath not alwayes to do; how can he keep peace in his own affections with which he hath ever to do? Both kinds therefore muſt go hand in hand: And ſo ye ſee in part what Peace is.</p>
            <p>Next we demand what it is to live peaceably? What ſhould it be, but to dedicate our lives and labours to the maintenance and propagation of this Peace? not only to preſerve Peace where it is, but to introduce it where it is not. Nor to reſtore Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, when it is loſt, but to continue it after it is found; nor to cheeriſh Peace only, abiding with us, but to hold it faſt when it would part from us, and when it is gone, to purſue and ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, never to reſt while we have found it. <hi>Inquire pacem</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>ſeek peace,</hi> and <hi>Pacem perſequimini, follow after peace, Heb.</hi> 12. Be inſtant, and ſeek earneſtly as ye would for ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewell being loſt, or ſome dear friend parted away in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; and when ye have found it, make much of it: nouriſh it, protect it, ſtrive to prolong and inlarge it; all this is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not only to obtain, and purchaſe, but to maintain and propagate Unity all we may, and to look that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116081:5"/>our Peace be right and orderly, without deformity, ſchitme, or partiality, without hipocriſie, oppreſſion, or injury, to live par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, without inconſtancie, or giving over: well therefore rendered, <hi>Not have peace</hi> (as ſome Tranſlators reade it) <hi>but live peaceably,</hi> that is, continue in Peace.</p>
            <p>Many and weighty are the labours comprehended in this, word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Live peaceably,</hi> 'tis but a ſhort ſaying, but very tedious and weariſome offices it requires; one while we are to ſtudy all things that may pleaſe and reconcile, another while to take away all that may diſtaſte and give offence. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all manner of moleſtations are to be indured, and we muſt not be weary of our patience; and ſometimes our own right yeelded up to mitigate other mens impatience. Above all the manners and diſpoſitions of thoſe we deale with would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that we offend not unwittingly, many indignities are to be put up, many affronts fo given, many injuries and unkinde ſpeeches buried in oblivion, and all little enough to make up this duty of living peaceably.</p>
            <p>Nor is it a buſineſs thus labourious only for the practiſe, but generall alſo, for the obligation, <hi>As live peaceably with all men:</hi> So all men whoſoever ye are think it your duty thus to live. 'Tis a precept not for mean men only, who are liable to ſuffer injuries, but for great and mighty ones ſpecially who have power to do injuries; nor for inferior people alone, who live under then ſhelter of Peace, but chiefly for Governors and Magiſtrates who have the cuſtody of Peace; nor for learners only, whoſe diſſentions are often out of ignorance, but ſpeciall for Teachers, who can ſpread diſſention by their knowledge: For all men, and of all ſorts, it is a needfull duty. That neither their meaneſs make them diſpair of ſeeking Peace, nor their greatneſs render them careleſs how they break Peace. For

               <hi>Peaceably with men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with good reaſon have we the parties thus plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, leaſt any ſhould boaſt (as ſome do) of their inward peace, while we ſee no outward fruit. At peace with God, and their own conſciences, O that they are! ſure of their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no men more; and yet ſo unquiet with their neighbours, ſo full of carping, cenſuring, wrangling, and fault-finding, ſo little peaceable outwardly, as no men leſs. Are theſe the ſons of peace think ye, or any friends to it, who for an unkind word, can treaſure up many years malice? For croſſing them in their fond opinions, raiſe ſlanders, ſpread libils, practiſe all miſchief to undermine their brethren, or make them odious: for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſome diſlike of their faction, fall to hoſtility, rob, and ſpoile, and purſue with the ſword, men under the ſame <hi>Laws,</hi> and Religion with themſelves? And yet many of theſe love God with all their hearts, that they do, and are ſo poſſeſt with his Spirit, forſooth, the ſpirit of Peace that they cannot err a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; A likely matter doubtleſs, that the ſpirit of Peace ſhould abide in their hearts, whoſe works tend to nothing but diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy works</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Iames</hi>) ſo may we ſay, Shew us your inward peace by the outward fruits of it; witneſs your love to God by your love to your neighbour, If not, never talk of regeneration and peace made with heaven, while ſo little tokens of it appear upon earth. <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> and by the diſpoſition of the heart man worketh; if no peace in the works, no peace in our words or ſpeeches, then none in the heart, queſtionleſs: Never therefore boaſt of Peace, other where ſeated, unleſs ye have peace with men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With men:</hi> And that every way; with their affections, and with their judgements with their purpoſes, and with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, with their conceptions; yea, and with their opinions, if it be poſſible.</p>
            <p>And yet where we ſpeak of opinions; worth noting it is, what <hi>Aquinas</hi> tels us, That Peace is properly a union of parts appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not of parts intellective. If we varie in opinion one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, this ought not to breed variance in our wils by and by,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116081:6"/>were men, as they ſhould be, peaceable. But becauſe moſt people are wedded to their affections, making opinions and all, bend after their ſenſuall appetites; therefore where they finde others differing in opinion, immediately they make a rent in affection too, all becauſe their own opinions are too much affected. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it becomes Charitie, not to follow the ſway of our ſenſuall appetites and affections, but to be governed by reaſon. And to interpret the opinions of others with favour, ſo long as they are not dangerouſly deſtructive to the Chriſtian faith, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon quiet. Nay, a peaceable minde will abate ſomewhat of the ſtiffeneſſe of his own judgement for peace and charities ſake, and deny his own wiſdom in matters of leſſe importance, to ſalve other mens folly. And this makes the precept of our Text very difficult, for what more various, then the opinions of men? <hi>Tot homines, tot ſententiae;</hi> Eaſier it ſeems to have peace with wilde beaſts, peace with diſeaſes and furies, peace with winds, and Seas, then with men in this ſenſe; And yet as far as divine truth, and the publick ſafetie permits, we are to labour after this peace alſo, ſo we can in any fort reconcile mens meanings to the truth, or bear their untruths, without perill of the Churches diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, we are to endeavour peace; not with men onely, but with the affections, the judgements and opinions of men.</p>
            <p>With the judgements and opinions of men; but yet not with the wrongfulneſſe of their judgements, nor the error of their opinions: no, take heed of that. It is live peaceably with men: not with the vices, and corruptions of men; but with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and with the perſons live peaceably as we ought we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, unleſſe we be at ſtrife with their corruptions. He that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loves the nature, hates the depravation of what he loves; and he that is a true friend to ſuch and ſuch parties, he can be no friend to that which deſtroys and marrs the parties. Think not your ſelves therefore tyed to conſent to the errors of men. Sooth them not in their vices: nor with thoſe falſe prophets in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſowe pillows to the elbows of ſinners; or cry peace, peace, to thoſe whoſe juſt deſtruction is threatned from heaven. But ſetting their vices, and dangerousing agements a ſide, have all peace with the parties, bear no manner of hatred to the man, however ye abhor the wickedneſſe of the man, but pitie him in his perſon as your
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116081:6"/>brother, endeavouring to cure him, and ſet him right, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all charitable friendſhip in your hearts towards him; how ever for the ſoundneſſe of his future peace, ye be conſtrained ſometimes, to ſuppreſſe all outward tokens of preſent peace. Nor think it enough that you ſtand thus charitably affected to ſome few, whom you can well brook, nay there follows after the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the indifferencie or univerſalitie of the parties, Live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably not with men onely, but with all men; which is the third point of our diviſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With all men:</hi> That is, not with our friends, or Benefactors alone; why who doth not ſo? But with our very Enemies and perſecutors. For this is right Chriſtian perfection, to love thoſe that hate us, and return good to theſe that hurt us. <hi>Cum his qui pacem oderunt, pacificus eram,</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) with ſuch men have <hi>I laboured agreement, who when I ſpake unto them thereof, made them ready for battell.</hi> Pſal. 120.6. And to do our text right: this comes home to the meaning of the Apoſtle. For the beleeving Chriſtians in <hi>Rome</hi> to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, were but a ſmall partie, in compariſon of thoſe Infidels, Pagans, and Jewiſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites, wherewith the world then abounded, from whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe litile quiet could be expected, if they made open profeſſion of their beleef, he wills them to avoid all viſible ſcandalls, and as much as in them lay, to have peace with theſe of a different faith, giving no offence neither to the Jew, nor to the Gentile, nor to the Church of God, for if you love them that love you only, what reward have ye, and if ye ſalute your brethren only, what do ye more then others; Nay, live peaceably with them that would have no peace, overcome their evill with your good, and convert the bitterneſs of their malice, into ſweetneſs and concord, by the abundance of your kindneſs and peaceable car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; have peace not with your acquaintance only, but with ſtrangers and aliens; nor with good men alone, but with evill too; nor with quiet natures and none elſe, but with froward and perverſe; nor with friendly neighbours that uſe you well, but with croſs and contentious ones, yea with your enemies, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and perſecutors, never ſo far eſtranged, in affection, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or Religion, do as much as in you lieth to have peace with all men.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:116081:7"/>
            <p>And good reaſon for it, both in generall and particular. In generall ye are commanded to love all, and conſequently to your power to agree with all: If no agreement never talke of love; Peace is the fruit of love, and therefore a mong fruits of the Spirit, ſet by and by after love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. As far as your love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, therefore your peace ſhould extend, none to be excluded from the limits of your concord; becauſe none to be excepted out of your <hi>love your neighbour as your ſelf,</hi> that is, every man as your ſelf: And if love may not be denied to our enemies, then not Peace neither. <hi>Servants be obedient to your Maſters, not to the good and gentle only, but even to the froward</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Peter) for this is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, if for conſcience ſake ye indure grief, and for the love of peace be content, not only to do well, but to ſuffer evill too.</hi> This in generall.</p>
            <p>In particular. There is not that condition of men to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, for which ſome reaſons and inducements appear not to invite us to peace: Are they our friends, our acquaintance, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or alliance, why, what a ſhame is it to fall out with ſuch? 'Tis like the jarring of humors in one and the ſame body, which uſually foreruns ſickneſs and death; ſo is it if men of the ſame linage, and bloud, the ſame countrey and breeding, the ſame order, profeſſion, or Religion ſhall be at emnity; Are not theſe bonds ſufficient to keep us from hatred? With whom do we think to have peace, if civill relations, if ſacred knots and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations cannot hold us in. Are they ſtrangers to us? ſo much the more to be honored and pleaſed that they may not ſpeak or think ill of us whom we ſhall meete but ſeldome; Are they our betters? take heede how we provoke them, they have power on their ſide, or may have quickly; Are they our inferious? pitty to contend with ſuch weaklings, whom be their cauſe right or wrong, we in reſpect of our mightineſs ſhall ſtill be thought to oppreſs; Are they our enemies, and ſuch as have wronged us? ſo much more glorious the victory, to maintain peace with them that hate peace, and to overcome their evill with our good; Are they foes to our Religion, enemies to the truth of Chriſt, men of reprobate and wicked manners? have as little converſation with them as you may, but have peace notwithſtanding; to ſhun them ye are allowed, ye are not allowed to ſtrive with them: the like may be ſaid of the worſt of our Perſecutors, Infidells, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116081:7"/>Athieſts, Incendiaries of Church or State: though you are to beware contagion from them, yet to your power preſerve Peace and Charity with them; pray for them, revile them not, enter not into open contentions and compariſons with them; let them not in any caſe fire you into impatience and ſtrife; but endeavour with all meekneſs of wiſdom to win them home, and draw them to the right. No unreaſonable doctrine it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it be a difficult one. <hi>Live peaceably with all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, but how if no peace will be had unleſs I partake of mens wickedneſs? No living in <hi>Bethel</hi> unleſs we will worſhip the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calves? No ſtopping the mouthes of wicked Elders, but by giving up our Chaſtity, as poor <hi>Suſanna</hi> was put to it? No ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing the unruly multitude, unleſs we will affirm an impious lye? which was the cauſe of <hi>Calib</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> among the ten Spies. No ſcaping the rage of the people, unleſs we aſſiſt them in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a new fangled Religion after their fancie, as <hi>Acon</hi> was conſtrained to do, ſhall we make light of our conſcience, and forſake God and his truth for our quiet ſake? No, there is no ſuch neceſſity laid upon you, ye are not ſo ſtreight laced, there followeth a difpenſation in the Text when ſuch caſes falls out, and that not a ſingle one, but a double, <hi>If it be poſſible, and as much as lieth in you.</hi> That brings us upon the fourth Generall of our Diviſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be poſſible.</hi> So then 'tis apparent ſometimes it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>And as much as lieth in you.</hi> So that there are ſeaſons when you can do no good upon them. A twofold exception there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears therefore from this generall rule. One riſing from the nature of things themſelves. If the difference be ſuch as cannot be reconciled with ſafety to a good conſcience, then look to your conſcience, let peace go.

And that ye have, in <hi>quantum in vobis, as much as lieth inyou.</hi> If one of theſe will not take place, the other may; if the work of peace in it ſelf be not poſſible, if we can<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ur ſouls, yet at
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116081:8"/>leaſt, <hi>Quantum in vobis,</hi> that is poſſible; we may do ſtill as much as lieth in us, though toward us outwardly, ſuch adverſaries will have no peace, yet inwardly we may have peace toward, them; though the compleate perfection of the work they will not permit, yet the indeavour of the work ſo far as are able, in us they cannot hinder; And that ſhall ſuffice to diſcharge us. Of theſe two conditions, therefore briefly in their order. And firſt of the former, <hi>If it be poſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A form of ſpeech this is which implieth often difficulties in the buſineſs; and ſometimes impoſſibility; difficult where the parties to be reconciled are froward, and ſelf-willed enemies to Peace in <hi>Davids</hi> language. Impoſſibility where no agreement will be had, without loſs of a good conſcience: Where Gods honour, or the adminiſtration of Juſtice, or the diſcharge of our calling lieth at ſtake, ſo that we cannot have peace with men, unleſs we will be irreligious, unjuſt, or unfaithfull. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer caſe where peace is only difficult; that ſhould ſtir up our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence the rather; indeavour with ſo much the more patience, and unwearied induſtry, to overcome the frowardneſs of thoſe we have to deale with; and where ſo precious a Jewell as Peace is to be compaſſed, with expence of our labour or our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there ſpare for no coſt or pains. But where it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a ſervant of God, where nothing will do it but the ſale of a good conſcience, there rouſe up our courage, and prefer not outward peace before inward; mens contentment, or our own temporall commodity or ſafety, before Gods honour, our ſouls quiet, and the publique good. But it will here be demanded, how we may know when Peace is poſſible, when not: Six caſes are mentioned by ſome Divines, ye may refer them to the three heads aforenamed, of Religion, Juſtice, and Faithfulneſs in our calling. Of Religion firſt. God himſelf (in caſe his publique worſhip be indangered) enjoyns us flatly to break the peace. <hi>If thy brother the ſon of thy mother, or thy ſon, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> not ſpare, nor conceal him, but thou ſhalt ſurely kill him, Thy <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all be firſt upon him, and afterward the hand
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116081:8"/>of all the people, Deut.</hi> 13.6. Thus ye are to underſtand it, in caſe of temptation to manifeſt Idolatry, Blaſphemy, Hereſie, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie, from the true faith and worſhip of God: we can have no peace, nay, we can have no mercy; we are not allowed to ſpare and conceal the party ſo tempting us, but deliver him up to juſt puniſhment, be he never ſo neer, or dear to us. Secondly, where our ſelves are perſecuted for Religion, or Vertue, or obedience to Gods Law in any kinde, and there is no way of ſatisfying our perſecutors, or delivering our ſelves from trouble, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying our faith, yeelding up our vertue, or violating our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods Commandements. In theſe two caſes, the one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, the other defenſive; for preſervation of our Religion, and our duty to God no peace poſſible.</p>
            <p>Two other caſes follow, which belong to Juſtice. One where we are paſſive, or thoſe who are one with us: and we are violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſaulted contrary to Law and equity. We may then break the peace for our own preſervation, in defending our ſelves, ſo we do it <hi>Cum moderamine inculpate tutelae,</hi> go not beyond what is needfull to our honeſt defence, or theirs who depend on us, as our wives, children or family. The like holds when we are violently handled, becauſe we will not joyn with others in breaking Peace, and trampling down Juſtice. <hi>Cast in thy lot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: We will finde all precious ſubstance, and fill our houſes with ſpoile, Prov.</hi> 1.13. Thus where in defence of Juſtice to our ſelves, and our own private, being innocent, and againſt wrongfull Authority, our lot is to be paſſive. Another caſe may fall out, wherein it becoms us to be active, though ourſelves, in our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſt ſuffer not: and that is, where we ſee our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent neighbours wrongfully abuſed, and diſtreſſed to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by lawleſs hands; we may there riſe up in reſcue of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed innocence, and do as much in our neighbours caſe, as we would wiſh done in our own. Thus <hi>Lot</hi> reſiſted the <hi>Sodomites</hi> in behalf of the Angels whom they invaded with violence: And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuccoured the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſtriving with the <hi>Egyptian, Exod.</hi> 2.12. And thus every good man, armed with wealth and power, may, and ought to ſtand up in defence of the poor widow and fatherleſs, againſt their tyrannous oppreſſors. Nor are they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116081:9"/>breakers of the peace in ſo doing: but theſe cruell grinders of the poor, whom they reſiſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe two belong to Juſtice. Two caſes more remain which concern faithfulneſs in our Calling. One where we are Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, with power ſufficient in our hands, and have the cuſtody of the publick peace committed to us. There as in defending the innocent we muſt be ſtout; ſo in chaſtiſing the guilty not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, nor ſuffer dangerous offenders to ſcape unpuniſhed, for fear of diſquieting our ſelves or them. The peace is rather broken by tolerating ſuch monſters, then by our ſtirring to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them. The like is to be ſaid for lawfull officers of Juſtice, Sherifes, Bay liffs, Serjeants, Conſtables, being lawfully deputed by right and authority from their Prince, and Countrey, they may and muſt break the peace with thoſe they go to arreſt or apprehend according to their Office; if without breaking the peace it may not be done. To this head ye may aſſign all the work of the Souldiary in a lawfull war; Commanders, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or common Men; for what are ſouldiers, if duly called, but legall executioners of Juſtice upon rebellious offenders, whom Supream Authority hath rightly condemned? This is one caſe of fidelity in our Callings; where in protecting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, or puniſhing the guilty, we are conſtrained to open war. Another is in reproving and admoniſhing tranſgreſſors, a war more private; and this in ſome degree belongs to every man by his generall calling, as a Chriſtian, and a debtor of Charity to all men: for 'tis a direct charge of Almighty God, <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him, Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>And if thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thee and him. Matth.</hi> 18.15. where we ſee our neighbour in deadly perill of his ſoul, we may and muſt rebuke him, and not fear breaking the peace with him, ſo the manner of our reproof be charitable and diſcreet, and the occaſion probable, to do good by our reproving. But Miniſters of Chriſt if we be, and ſo have a ſpeciall calling to reprove, Neceſſity is then laid upon us, and wo be to us if we be ſilent: afraid we muſt not be to ſpeak, where its likely we ſhall do not hurt, how little hope ſoever there be of do<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng good. Toward thoſe under our charge, if it be, the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116081:9"/>bond of our partleular calling lieth heavy upon us then. <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman over the houſe of Iſrael, Ezek.</hi> 33.8. <hi>When I threaten the wicked, if thou ſpeak not to warne him: he ſhall die in his iniquity, but his bloud will I require at thy band:</hi> Then whether it be likely by our reproving to amend, as <hi>David</hi> mended by <hi>Nathans,</hi> or likely rather for our unfaithfulneſs to be inraged againſt us, as <hi>Ahab</hi> againſt <hi>Michaiah,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> at St. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> yet upon the Lords errand we poor Miniſters muſt go, come life or come death, come peace or come war, only where its probable we ſhall indanger others by reprehending, and fire offenders into more miſchief, there both charity and diſcretion alloweth us to be ſilent. In all other caſes to have peace with known ſinners, is to have war with God, and our own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Nor fear we to be charged for Peace-breakers, in troubling the dangerous eaſe of wicked livers; it is they that break the peace, not we; who fear not to break the Laws of God, ſaith <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe.</hi> Who was it troubled <hi>Iſrael,</hi> think you, <hi>Ahab</hi> or <hi>Eliah,</hi> or who to be blamed for diſquieting the land in <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> time? <hi>Ieremy</hi> or the ſeditious Princes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that would not indure <hi>Ieremies</hi> meſſage from their Maker? Nay, he that tranſgreſſeth breaks the peace (ſaith <hi>Chriſostome.</hi>) He that reproves tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors (ſpecially Gods Miniſters) doth but his duty. And ſo ye ſee the ſix Caſes wherein at all times it may not be poſſible to have peace with all men. Howbeit in all theſe caſes, and in all others imaginable, one thing remember: Though you be forced to break the peace outwardly, preſerve it inwardly; though in <hi>rebus ipſis,</hi> ye be compelled to ſtrive, and in word or deed to have contention, yet in heart be at peace: Still be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared inwardly with hearty love and readineſs to agree, when ever the offence outward ſhall be removed. And this is our <hi>Qumtum in vobis,</hi> the ſecond limitation: <hi>As much as lieth in you.</hi> Though it be not ever poſſible, <hi>yet as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</hi> That is the firſt and laſt part of our Diviſion.</p>
            <p>A limitation we have here, not to be ſpared at any hand, we cannot ſay, <hi>if it be poſſible,</hi> is proviſo enough; nay, even when it is not poſſible to have peace on both ſides, ſome-what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116081:10"/>lyeth in us, ſtill to be done, that there may be peace on one ſide. That long of us it may not be, the knot of unity is broken. If it be poſſible, had that onely been ſaid; why then in any of the caſes aforementioned, or in any like; we ſhould have thought our ſelves, upon a little tryall, clearly at libertie. Being no longer poſſible to make peace, let go the reins to ſtrife, never ſeek farther means to agree, but if peace ſucceed not at firſt offer, wrangle, and brawl, and break Charitie with all bitterneſſe, and never have done. Nay: Even there, where ye cannot agree; do yet what lyeth in you to agree: <hi>Seek peace, and enſue it</hi> ſtill, even when the Sword of War is in your hand. In this kinde it is ever poſſible to fulfill the Apoſtles precept: <hi>Have peace with all men.</hi> That is, do what lyeth in you towards it. To ſettle perfect peace on both ſides is not ever in our power. Concord, as it is betwixt two parties at the leaſt, ſo upon the good will of both parties it depends. Unleſſe both ſides yeeld and meet, no true concord. Wherefore if one partie continue perverſe, perfect peace is a thing impoſſible: yea but <hi>Quantum in volis,</hi> that is not impoſſible. There may be peace, on one ſide, one partie may be willing to agree, and do all that lyeth in him toward it. And then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, tis no more long of him, he hath fulfilled this Text, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth peaceably with his Neighbour, as far as is poſſible on his part. But ye will ask, What means are to be uſed? Or when may we perſwade our ſelves, we have done what lyeth in us to live peaceably? Sundrie Rules are here given by ſundrie Authors. I ſhall point you briefly to ſome of the principall by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and ſo commit you to God.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, where our ſelves onely are injured, Gods honour, and the publick not indangered: there by our own private wrongs ſit we down. Forgive, forget and put up without more ado; ſeek no manner of revenge for ſuch. For as the former clauſe, <hi>If it be poſſible,</hi> provides for the glory of God, and the common welfare, that the publick take no wrong. So, <hi>as much as lyeth in you,</hi> provides for ſafetie of our own ſouls, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of private injuries we looſe not Charitie, and ſo looſe Heaven. If therefore he be a froward Enemie, and difficult to be won, do not you ſit down by and by, and ſay; Peace is no more
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116081:10"/>poſſible, I am diſpenſed within this quarrell; But aſſay with all loving offices to win him, and do to the utmoſt of what lyeth in you. Is he weak? Bear with him. Captious? give him no offence. Is he humourſome? obſerve times to pleaſe him. Is he over-talkative? ſay little to him. If haſtie to anger, provoke him not. If ſtiffe upon what he conceives his right, part with ſome of yours. If with good uſage to be won; ceaſe not heaping all manner of kindneſſe upon him. If with yeelding to be wrought on, ſubmit and give place, yea though your cauſe be the better, ſo the publick ſuffer not. If none of all this will do, yet ſtill pray for him, love him, hope the beſt; give not over by the mediation of others to gain him, though your perſonall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour be fruitleſſe. Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and being ſtrong in love, to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Singular to this purpoſe is that memorable Proteſtation of St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> I, my brethren, what ever you do, am determined ſtill to live peaceably, with you, and to love you, how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beloved of you: I will cleave to you, though I finde you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing; Nay I will cleave to you, though my ſelf be unwilling. Long ſince have I chained my heart to yours, in the firm bond of Charitie, that ſtedfaſt knot, that falleth not away; with thoſe that be turbulent, I will be calme; with thoſe that trouble me, meek and patient, like one no way troubled. At all times will I give place to wrath, that at no time I may give place to the Devill. Thoſe that are intractable, will I wearie out with friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offices. Them that are unthankfull, will I lade ſtill with more benefits. Thoſe that deſpiſe me, will I not ceaſe to honour. In ill language I will go away with the worſt. In good language I will ſtrive to have the beſt; And even thoſe that revile me, ſhall for my milde behaviour be forced to admire me, if not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me. This is the voyce of a Soul, fully bent on the diſcharge of this Text. And he that is as ready to do all this as to ſay it; we may be confident comes very neer the Apoſtles meaning in this place.</p>
            <p>That theſe Leſſons appear not too hard for us, take notice of the fountain virtues, from whence they proceed. And thoſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116081:11"/>are, Humilitie, Love, and Patience; Three virtues, which well ſettled in us, would take away all ſtrife in the world, and make up our <hi>Quantum in vobis</hi> abundantly. Humility firſt would teach us to ſtoop to inferiours, and though our cauſe be the better, yet to yeeld for Peace ſake, and the common benefit, to men in a worſe: <hi>Bear ye one anothers burthens</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt.</hi> Galat. 6.2. Bear a burthen he cannot well, that will not ſtoop to take it up 3 Agree with his Adverſarie, he will not eaſily, who is high minded, and deſpiſeth his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, diſdaining to incline and bend to men in virtue, or power, beneath him.</p>
            <p>But Love removes this difficultie; Love as it covereth a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of offence, ſo it can bear with a multitude of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; teaching men to look not every one on his own things, but on the things of others. Not to be wiſe in our own eyes, or ſtiffe in our own judgements; that is, to pleaſe our ſelves, but every one to pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification. By love we ſet our ſelves in our neighbours ſtead, accounting our ſelves one perſon with him, eſteeming our neighbours benefit, ours, his grievance, ours, and ſo doing in all reſpects, as we would with done to our ſelves; ſuch love crowns our humility: when the Apoſtle therefore had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the <hi>Cal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſians</hi> to humbleneſs of minde, he adds to make ſure work, <hi>Above all things put on Christ, which is the bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs, Col. ſ.</hi> 3.14.</p>
            <p>Charity being well put on, will lead us to patience and long-ſuffering, the hardeſt burthen of all three. But to love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is hard; How many unkindneſſes, and unthankfull carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages doth love teach Parents to bear patiently from their children? It is no love indeed that is not long ſuffering. By this we draw neer the ſemblance of Gods love, who is kinde to the unthankfull and the evill, making his Sun to ſhine upon the evill and the good, and ſending raine upon the juſt and unjuſt. By Patience we are inabled for the moſt needfull work of all to the continuance of Peace, namely, not aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our ſelves: for of the two, more guilty is he of ſtrife, that renders evill (ſaith one) then he that offers evill. He
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116081:11"/>that doth wrong ſeldome thinks it wrong, his inſolence or his ignorance perſwades him 'tis but right; but he that requires wrong, is perſwaded 'tis evill he hath ſuffered and evill he reſolves to render, ſo he confeſſeth the wrong: Somewhat worſe of the two therefore it is, to requite injury, then to offer it, worſe for Peace, if not for conſcience. The Proverb there holds true, <hi>That the ſecond blow breaks the peace, not the first:</hi> for were we patient in taking wrong, and rendred not evill for evill, all ſtrife would ſhortly be at an end, the fire would go out of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now if with all our Patience, and Love, and Humility, we cannot win our adverſaries, yet we are not diſcharged, This <hi>Quantum in vobis</hi> reacheth further ſtill. To our Patience, we are to add Perſeverance, <hi>Not to be weary of well doing,</hi> that is, of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring evill with patience, but hold out in our meekneſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, ſtill offering reconcilement, ſtill ready to forgive and agree, if our adverſaries never ſo late will come in, though we are ſmiten on one cheek, turning the other; though we have loſt our coat, ready to part with cloak and all; ſo Peace may be found in the end; and if no peace come yet never give over praying and indeavouring, and trying all poſſible means, that ſo the fault may not lie on our ſides, but that it may appear to the world, we have done to the utmoſt of what lieth in us; and having done that, refer the event to God, Saying, O Lord, we are ready to do and to ſuffer for the love of Peace what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou ſhalt enable us: But if for the puniſhment of our ſins, and the chaſtiſement of this Nation, it be thy pleaſure ſtill to withold ſo great a bleſſing, yet give us hearts alwayes detirous of peace, ever more patient and acknowledging our ſtrips lighter then we deſerve. But if our tears and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after ſuch a length of ſuffering may finde any acceptance with thee; be pleaſed, O Lord, to defer the bleſſing no longer; but ſay to the deſtroying Sword this day, It is enough. Stop the iſſues of bloud, and heal the wounds of this fainting Kingdom: Soften the moſt obdurate hearts that block up the way. Thou that art the God of Peace, command peace, make it thine own work. So bleſs this Treaty, that it may anſwer the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116081:12"/>hopes and deſires of thy poor ſervants; And that our lives and converſations may anſwer thoſe vows and promiſes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and thankfulneſs, which upon granting our deſires we have made to thee; that ſo peace with our Brethren may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the peace of a good conſcience, and eace of conſcience lead us in due time to the peace of thy Kingdome, even that <hi>Peace which paſſeth all underſtanding.</hi> To which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to bring us, who hath ſhed his moſt precious bloud to puchaſe it for us. To whom with the Father, and the holy Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
