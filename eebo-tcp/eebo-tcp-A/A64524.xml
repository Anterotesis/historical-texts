         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>VVhitehall, Auguſt 19. 1695. This Morning came in an Expreſs from my Lord <hi>Berkeley,</hi> with an Account of the Bombarding of <hi>CALAIS.</hi>

               <p>MY Lord <hi>Berkeley</hi> anchored with the Fleet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Calais</hi> the 16th of this month, but it proving too calm, nothing was done till next day, when about 11 in the morning Colonel <hi>Richards,</hi> with the Bomb Veſſels, ſtood in to the Eaſtward of the Town, and Anchoring in 3 Fathom Water, began to Bombard it with ſuch good Succeſs, that by one a Clock the Town was ſeen on Fire in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places; at which time the Enemies half Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies came out, and ſtood to the Eaſtward under their own Shore, thinking thereby to annoy the Bomb Ships; but our Brigantines, and ſeveral Men of War ſtanding in to them, Commanded by Captain <hi>Greenaway,</hi> gave them ſuch a Reception, as put them in great Confuſion, and with much ado they regained the Peer-heads; After which we received no other diſturbance than the uſual Salutes of their Cannon and Mortars from their ſeveral Batteries. Our Bomb Veſſels continued firing till towards 5 at Night, during which time we Shot into the Town about 600 Shells, which by the ſeveral Fires we ſaw, we judge to have done very conſiderable Execution. We have received little Damage, either as to Men killed, or Damage done to our Veſſels. Captain <hi>Osborne</hi> of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> Ketch was killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Falmouth, Auguſt</hi> 15. On the 12th came into this Port two <hi>Zealand</hi> Privateers, called the <hi>King William,</hi> and the <hi>Middleburg,</hi> of 26 and 24 Guns; They have been out two Months, and taken three French Privateers, and one Pink laden with Wine and Brandy. The ſame Evening came in ſight of this place about 14 Sail of Hamburg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers, under Convoy of a Man of War of 50 Guns; They came from <hi>Milford</hi> Haven with the <hi>Streights</hi> Fleet, but could not keep way with them; And on the 12th a Dutch Veſſel was taken out of their Company by 3 French Privateers, but the <hi>Litchfield</hi> Frigat coming in, gave Chace to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plimouth, Aug.</hi> 16. The 14th came into this Port His Majeſty's Ship the <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and brought in a Ship of 140 Tuns, called the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> which ſhe retook the 12th inſtant off <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> Yeſterday came in the <hi>Rupert</hi> from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> with a ſmall French Privateer that was lately taken near <hi>Milford.</hi>

               <p>This Evening all things were prepared to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack a Stone Redoubt at the Foot of the Cohorne, near the Sambre; but upon the approach of our Men, a Lieutenant and 15 of the Enemy that were in it, Surrendred.</p>
               <p>Our Batteries continue to play upon the Caſtle and Coehorne with very good Effect, and in 2 or 3 days we hope our Breaches will be ready for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſault.</p>
