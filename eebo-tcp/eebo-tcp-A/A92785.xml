            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>As it was Atteſted by Mr. Francis Searſon, Surgeon, who was preſent at the Killing of him.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ON the 10th of <hi>September</hi> laſt we diſcover'd this Sea-Monſter upon the Coaſt of <hi>Denmark,</hi> which at
firſt ſurprized us; for the Female was alſo with him, tumbling in the Water very near him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
cauſing great Waves both about and before them (which as we came near) we perceived they
perform'd by plunging themſelves ſometimes under water, and other times by toſſing up their Tails, which
were very large and broad. The Female was much leſs both in length and bulk than the Male; and being
advanced nearer, we had full View of them both, their upper parts being viſible above Water. We were now
within Cannon-Shot; whereupon the Capt. ordered ſome Guns to be forthwith fired at them; and 2 or 3
Balls very happily wounded the Male in the Head, which made them ſeparate, and the Male immediately
made to the Shoar, which was about 2 Leagues diſtance. Upon which the Captain gave Orders to ſail after
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when at ſome convenient diſtance, mann'd out two Boats with Men, each to attack him. The Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
made reſiſtance by moving about in the water, and with his Tail Killed 3 of the Men in one boat, which
ſo terrified the boats Crew, that they threw one of their Oars at him, which he haſtily catch'd up in his
hand, and mounted aloft into the Air, and for ſome hours forced blood out of his Noſe (like water out of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine)
which fell in great quantities into the boats, and upon the Men, which encouraged them to attack him
more vigorouſly, perceiving that he was wounded. He continually tumbled about in his defence, gaped, foa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and made a moſt hideous Noiſe at his Mouth, and ſtunk exceſſively, and we were 24 hours in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him. The Female kept at ſome diſtance all the time, and appeared to be very diſconſolate, and made
ſometimes towards the 2 boats, and other times the Ship, who ſent ſeveral Shots after her, which cauſed her
to keep at the greater diſtance. In this Attack his head and one of his hands were much ſhattered; ſo that we
cut off only one of his hands, by reaſon of the prodigious weight of the other parts, being alſo in fear of the
Females Attacking our boats in our return to the Ship, having ſpent much time in viewing and meaſuring
the ſeveral parts, which are as followeth.</p>
            <p>1. The whole Creature weighed (according to Computation) at leaſt 50 Tuns, and was 70 Feet in
length. 2. The upper part Reſembles a Man, from the middle downwards he was a Fiſh, had Fins, and a
Forked Tail. 3. His head was of a great bulk, contain'd ſeveral hundreds of weight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had a terrible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.
4. He had ſhort, coarſe and curled hair upon his head. 5. His Noſe was long and large. 6. His Eyes
were alſo large, and ſo were both his Ears. 7. His Mouth was Anſwerable; for when he opened it, it was
at leaſt 2 yards wide. 8. His Teeth were thick, long and ſharp. 9. His Chin was 2 Feet long, and had a
beard 16 Feet long. 10. His Neck was 1 yard long, and 4 yards round. 11 His Arms lar<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="2 letters">
