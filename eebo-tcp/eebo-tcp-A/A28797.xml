         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

BUT
A Cable-Rope double-twisted for JOHN TAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LER
the Water-Poet.</head>
            <p>I Should be loath to foule my fingers with any base
Pamphlet that comes from <hi>Oxford,</hi> if the venom
of their malicious spleenes were darted onely
against my particular self: But when through my
sides they wound the honour of the Parliament,
and our Armies abroad, I cannot but set Pen to
Paper, and pay them back again in their own
kinde. And who d'yee think I should meet abroad
for a <hi>Rogue in Print,</hi> but one of our City Water-rats,
the doughty <hi>John Tayler,</hi> who according to the knavish Custome,
changes his name upon every new paper-designe? Sometimes he calls
himself <hi>Thorny Ailo, Mercurius Aquaticus,</hi> and now he entitles himself,
<hi>NO MERCURIVS AULICUS,</hi> I thought I had lately sent
<hi>rope</hi> enough for all the <hi>Parrets</hi> in Oxford: But I perceive they will be prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
still; and therefore I must unmaske the Mysterious Masters of the
Science of railing. There are three grand paper-Conspirators well known
by the Name of <hi>Mercurius Aulicus, George Naworth,</hi> and reverend Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>John Tayler</hi> the Water-tankerd, by whose sprinklings in this great
dearth of Wit and Honesty, the University is cherished and kept in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit:
These three are they which pumpe and <hi>Pimpe</hi> about with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
Noddles in the behalf of Popery. Murder and Rebellion against
the State; they are Liars in all Elements. <hi>Aulicus</hi> for Land-l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

have so much <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Spanish,</hi> that I cannot understand you with my
Wits; for should they goe a rambling after your far-fetch'd conceits,
perhaps I should never recover, or call them back againe.</p>
            <p>Thou railest against Master <hi>Pym,</hi> and rakest in the ashes of the dead,
most sacrilegiously rifling his grave of the honor due unto it: But I know
that Malice and Envie survive the Funeralls of worthy men, as well as
their vertues; and whereas thou talkest of <hi>receiving wages with Achitophell,</hi>
and <hi>Machiavell,</hi> I tell thee that the day of Account and Receipt is not
come as yet, though the declination of your <hi>Culminating</hi> signes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes

If thou wilt not beleeve this <hi>Prognostick</hi> of mine, what thinkest thou of your

They shall receive their wages, I warrant you, though none of their <hi>Pay.</hi>

more of Gentility or Nobility, but the bare out-side, to be Cuckolds, nay,
and some of them contented ones too, very well contented to be dubb'd
and <hi>Palatin'd,</hi> and this is his usuall kinde of lying: you have another
kinde of lying, which is as common as lying a-bed, the Art of lying, and
be-lying our Armies, the proper gift of your rebellious Faction. This

not then driven out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ever since up and downe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
And have the Northern <hi>Incendiaries</hi> fared ever a whit better;
their god-lesse Regiments being all dispersed, and the principall Abettors
forced to seek their fortunes in forraign Parts. They had raised the flame
to such a height, that the Kingdome began to be a little too hot for them.</p>
            <p>But to say no more of this, seeing it is apparent, <hi>I</hi> will <hi>cut thee for the

play the <hi>Asse,</hi> and lose his Kingdome? VVas it not for saving <hi>Agag</hi> the
King of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> alive, whom he should have destroyed as an utter
enemy to <hi>Israel?</hi> VVhat shall we think then will become of that King, or
those Counsellors, which have made Peace, and spoke friendly to those
which have cut the throates of 200000. <hi>Israelites, I</hi> mean <hi>Protestants</hi> in
<hi>Ireland?</hi> If <hi>I</hi> should Prognosticate on such a businesse a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> this, what would
become of them: and if Justice should suffer thee to live to see the event,
thou wouldst then confesse that there were some more realities in my
Predictions, than in the Bookes of <hi>Fortune,</hi> the <hi>Shepheards Kalendar, Erra
Pater, Mother Shiptons</hi> Prophesies, or the long-ear'd <hi>Outacousticou</hi> of
<hi>Albumazar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> could willingly Prognosticate somwhat concerning thy villanous <hi>Self;</hi>
and now <hi>I</hi> think on't, it is very neatly couch'd in the <hi>Anagram</hi> of thy name,
and it is the very thing which the men of thy <hi>Element</hi> doe foretell of thee,
and to this they say, there needs no Art, for they can doe it without the
help either of <hi>Necromancy,</hi> or <hi>Hydromancie,</hi> having had experience too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of your <hi>Bank side,</hi> and <hi>Beare-Gardes</hi> rogueries; and they all agree with

compleat <hi>Anagram,</hi> than which none could ever have framed a better to
speak thy deservings: But thou wilt except against this <hi>Anagram,</hi> as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
because that I place an <hi>E,</hi> where thou puttest an <hi>O,</hi> in spelling thy
<hi>Sir-name;</hi> I will then deal <hi>critically</hi> with thee, and prove that thou are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of an <hi>Innovation</hi> or <hi>Corruption</hi> in thy Name; for all our Trades, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
Callings and Offices in <hi>England,</hi> doe for the generall, end in <hi>or,</hi>
as <hi>Habberdasher, Ironmonger, Draper, Sculler, &amp;c.</hi> and none of them in <hi>or;</hi>
look in <hi>Holinshend</hi> his discription of <hi>England,</hi> and he tells us, that this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
was derived from the <hi>Saxon</hi> language, which Nation had once pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of this Iland: And therefore thy Name being the name of a Trade,
ought sure rather to follow the generall, in being spelled <hi>Tayler,</hi> and not
<hi>Taylor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhat is the reason Sir, that you spell false? Is it because your <hi>Skellum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
would not have the world to thinke, that your <hi>Pedegree</hi> was derived
from such a Lowsy, <hi>Snip snap</hi> Originall, as to have thy Ancestors thought
to be <hi>Taylers.</hi> Such an extract were too good for thee: No, thou art <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
from the Tayle of the Dragon, which thou ran'st to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to lay
hold on as the surest stay: And now that the Beast begins to be faint and
weary, and is unable to support Popery any longer in <hi>England,</hi> you are
even at your wits end: thou lookest toward <hi>London</hi> with a heavy heart,
not for the offences and vilanies which thou hast committed here, and
since thy departure, against this famous City; but because thou darest not
come hither again to commit more, and play more pranks than thou hast
done formerly. So that I suppose, thou art even ready to <hi>Joyn Halter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for want of necessary maintenance; And therefore I'le expresse
some Charity towards thee, though an enemy, and put thee into employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

unlesse he return to his Auncient Throne, in a lawfull Assembly
of the Gods: And that whil'st he was abroad managing those tempests,
which the anger of <hi>Iuno</hi> had raised, she stupified him by <hi>Circean</hi> enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

they are of kin, being double every way, double-tongued, double-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

they shall be Plunder'd and tolmented, and never be suffer'd to Quarter
in <hi>Virgo,</hi> (tell <hi>Rupert</hi> so, for that is his Heaven, his <hi>Turkish Paradise,</hi> and
