            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOt only in former times, but alſo in this old Age of the World, nothing hath been deeper buried, nor hitherto more deſired by all, eſpecially the lovers of Art, than the knowledg of that great Myſtery of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> which by a known word is called the <hi>Philoſophers-Stone;</hi> We therefore preſerving the Inſcription of the Monument, do raiſe this knowledge, buried and obſcured under the pretext of the <hi>Tomb</hi> of the moſt wiſe <hi>Semiramis,</hi> formerly Queen of <hi>Babylon,</hi> out of its Grave, and

            <p>But ſome haply of no ſmall ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity will imagin that this Tomb may be opened by Womens work, or Childrens ſport: but let them know that this Knowledg is a moſt deep River, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lamb wades, that is, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right profiteth; and the Elephant ſwims, that is, the moſt Learned do fluctuate, yea are drowned in their opinions, errors and doubts; whilſt one is yet doubtful concerning the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the great Work, yea generally a ſtranger to it; another very ſolicitous

               <head type="sub">Of the Phyſical ſubject of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers Stone.</head>
               <p>THE Fear of the Lord is the beginning of our Work, and the end Charity, and love of our Neighbour. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring therefore with the aſſiſtance of our good God upon ſo divine a Work, it muſt be firſt enquired, what the ſubject thereof is. For as a Plough-man in vain prepares his Ground for Harveſt, unleſs he be aſſured of the Seed; ſo alſo he prepares the Chymical Ground without any recompence, if he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109423:5"/>
knows not what he ſows therein: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in at this day many do perplex themſelves, and are hurried into different opinions.</p>
               <p>But this is not a place to diſcuſs all theſe things, whilſt ſome do ſeek it in the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Kingdom in Blood, Sperm, Sweat, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Hair, Dung, Egs, Serpents, Toads, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others are with great diligence imploy'd in the Vegetable Kingdom, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Wine for the unprofitable Magiſtery. For though it be manifeſt to us, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Medicine of our health may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in either Kingdom, and indeed in Man, (eſpecially in his heart) as alſo in Wine: for as Gold contains the vertues of all Minerals, ſo do theſe two comprehend the powers of all Animals and Vegetables as contracted into one; yet that the great work of Philoſophers could be made from them, was never in the thought of any Adept, it is therefore requiſit to be ſought in the Mineral Kingdom. But there is alſo here a great company of Diſſenters, ſo that we have need of an <hi>Oedipus.</hi> For ſome there be that think to extract it out of the middle Minerals, as they call them, namely, Salt, Nitre, Alom, and ſuch other, but all in vain, becauſe they have in them no Argent vive, into which they may be reſolved; in which error even we in our primitive ignorance were alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109423:5"/>
It remains therefore to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that Metals are the Phyſical ſubject of our bleſſed Stone. But here alſo the matter is in ſuſpence, becauſe Metals are ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſome imperfect.</p>
               <p>But in fine we ſay, that all fuſed Metals, but eſpecially the not fuſed, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, may by the intimate depuration of their original pollution (which yet is very difficult, and by outward appearance ſcarce poſſible) be the ſubject of the Stone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſaith <hi>Flamel,</hi> ſome have operated in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> others in <hi>Saturn,</hi> but I (ſaith he) have operated and found it out in <hi>Sol:</hi> and in <hi>Exercit. ad Turbam</hi> it is read, 
<q>
                     <hi>That all Metals clean and unclean are internally</hi> Sol, <hi>and</hi> Luna, <hi>and</hi> Mercury, <hi>but there is one true</hi> Sol, <hi>which is drawn from them.</hi>
                  </q> 
And the Author of the ſecret work of the Hermetick Philoſophy, <hi>Can.</hi> 16.ſaith, 
<q>
                     <hi>He that ſeeks the Art of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and perfecting imperfect Metals but by the nature of Metals, deviates from the truth; for Metals muſt be expected from Metals, as the ſpecies of Man from Man, of Beaſt from Beaſt.</hi>
                  </q> 
And <hi>Can.</hi> 18. He proceeds thus: 
<q>
                     <hi>Perfect Bodies are endowed with a more perfect Seed; under the hard ſhell therefore of the perfect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals lieth the perfect Seed, which he that knoweth how to extract by Philoſophical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, is entred into the Royal Path.</hi>
                  </q>
So
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109423:6"/>
alſo that Anonymous <hi>Philalethes</hi> in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction into the King's Sacred Palace, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. concerning the progreſs of the Work in the firſt forty days; There is indeed in all (even in the common) Metals, Gold, but nearer in Gold and Silver, though (as the ſame <hi>Adept</hi> ſpeaks well) there is yet one thing in the Metallick Kingdom of an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable off-ſpring, in which our Gold is nearer than in common Gold and Silver, if you ſeek it in the hour of its nativity, which melts in our <hi>Mercury,</hi> as Ice in warm Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But leaving now theſe more imperfect Metals, at preſent we declare thoſe two great and more perfect Luminaries <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> to wit, Gold and Silver, to be the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical ſubject of the Stone, which way a great part of the Philoſophers have followed, and came to their deſired end. Which ſame thing <hi>Augurellus</hi> ſhews, 2 <hi>Chryſop.</hi> when he ſaith, 
<q>
                     <hi>Take a Metal pure, and purged of all its droſs, whoſe Spirit recedes in its ſecret part, and being preſsed with a great weight, lives privily, and deſires to be releaſed from bands, and to be ſent out of priſon to Heaven, being ſpread into thin plates.</hi>
                  </q>
The ſame in <hi>Chryſ. lib.</hi> 1. 
<q>
                     <hi>Seek not the principles of Gold any-where elſe: for in Gold is the ſeed of Gold; though being cloſe ſhut up, it retires further, and is to be ſought by us with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109423:6"/>
tedious labour.</hi>
                  </q>
And concerning the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of both the Luminaries, <hi>Lully,</hi> that Star of Spagyrick Philoſophy, in his Book, P.M. 28. ſaith, 
<q>
                     <hi>Two are more pure than the reſt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Gold and Silver, without which the Work cannot be begun or finiſhed, becauſe in them is the pureſt ſubſtance of Sulphur perfectly purified by the ingenuity of Nature; and out of theſe two bodies prepared with their Sulphur or Arſenick, our Medicine may be extracted, and cannot be had without them.</hi>
                  </q>
And <hi>Clangor Buccinae</hi> ſaith, 
<q>
                     <hi>You muſt operate prudently and expreſly, becauſe neither</hi> Sol <hi>nor</hi> Luna <hi>can be without ferment, and any other ſeed or ferment is not proper and uſeful, but Gold to the red, and Silver to the white; which bodies being firſt ſubtiliated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der weight, muſt then be ſowed, that they may putrify and be corrupted; where one form being deſtroyed, another more noble is put on; and this is done by the means of our Water alone.</hi>
                  </q>
From hence a certain Anonymous in his Anſwer excellently concludes; 
<q>
                     <hi>As Fire is the principle of Fire, ſo Gold is the principle of Gold; ſuch as the Cauſe is, ſuch is the Effect; ſuch as the Father, ſuch the Son; ſuch as the Seed is, ſuch is the Fruit; Man generates Man, and a Lion a Lion.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay, The Philoſophers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the matter ought to be ſuch, that the Poor as well as the Rich may obtain it;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109423:7"/>
from whence that ſaying is, 
<q>
                     <hi>God hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this treaſure to be ſought by all men; nor doth he deny that great Good to any man, except to him that makes himſelf unworthy by the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved affections of his heart.</hi>
                  </q>
And <hi>Geber,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>You ought not to conſume your goods becauſe of mean price: if you underſtand the principles of Art, which we ſhall deliver to you, you will attain to the compleat Magiſtery.

               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Calcination of Bodies out of the ſecret Work of the <hi>Doctor and Biſhop of Trent</hi> for the Philoſophers Stone: Metals to be diſſolved ought to be firſt calcined or purged in <hi>Lac virginis,</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> being moſt fine and ſubtilly filed, muſt be diſſolved in <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and diſtilled rain-water in which <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> or common Salt hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109423:9"/>
then it muſt be precipitated into a moſt white Calx, and waſhed in decanted water, and the Calx muſt be edulcorated in other rain-water hot, that all the ſaltneſs and acrimony may be taken away, then muſt it be dryed, and it will be a moſt pure Calx.</p>
               <p>But Gold muſt be calcined after this manner: Make an <hi>Amalgame</hi> with Gold (which muſt be firſt depurated by the Body of the black Eagle, that it may be made beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and glorious above meaſure) and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury very well purged with Salt and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and ſtrained through Leather, put it in purified <hi>Aquafortis,</hi> that all the Mercury may be diſſolved, decant the <hi>Aquafortis</hi> from the Calx of <hi>Sol,</hi> waſh the Calx as aforeſaid in warm water, and dry it with a gentle heat, that Calx (if artificially and lightly reverberated, yet ſo that it flow not) will be converted into a moſt beautiful <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gold that it may be reduced into the firſt Matter, or Mercury of Philoſophers, is thus otherwiſe calcined, whereof <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> in his 7th Book of <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitation, declares, namely; that Metal muſt be calcined with revivified Mercury, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercury with the Metal into a Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, digeſting them together, till an <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:109423:9"/>
be made, then ſublime the Mercury with a moderate Fire, and bruiſe it with the metallick Calx, and as before, repeat the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and ſublimation, and that ſo often till the Calx being put to a burning Candle will melt like ice, or wax. This Metal ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, put to digeſtion in Horſe-dung or in <hi>Bal. Mariae,</hi> moderately hot, digeſting it for a month, and the Metal will be converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to living Mercury, that is, into the firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is called the Philoſophers Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and the Mercury of Metals, which many have ſought, but few have found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joachimus Poleman</hi> of the Myſtery of the Philoſophers Sulphur, by help of his dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and ſatiated Corroſive, divides a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal into the leaſt Atomes, and dilacerates it to be delivered to the fiery <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving it to a tinging Soul.</p>
               <p>It is calcined by us another and better way, which Calcination we rather call the firſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and it is done by pouring the Wine of Life to the Calxes of <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Luna</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, put into a Phial, (which is our <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> of which hereafter in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.) to the heighth of a fingers breadth, and putting to an Head or Alembick, they muſt be digeſted in Aſhes, or alſo in Sand, and coagulated; being coagulated, you muſt pour on new <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> as before, and coagulate, and

ſealed, and in a gentle heat of <hi>Bal.

And thus is made the ſecond and true Solution of a Metal into viſcous water, or a certain Oleity with the preſervation of the radical moiſture, in which is the true metallick Sulphur, together with the true and moſt noble Mercury: for one of them is always the <hi>Magnet,</hi> and remains ſolving with the ſolved, and deſires to continue inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and that becauſe of the ſimilitude of ſubſtance. Wherefore the Ancients ſaid, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rejoyceth in Nature, Nature overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and altereth Nature, whereby the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or formal Solution is diſtinguiſhed from the corroſive Solution. But you muſt know that from <hi>Luna</hi> is obtained a liquor, or green tincture, which is the true Elixir of <hi>Luna,</hi> and the higheſt <hi>Arcanum</hi> to comfort the Brain.

<q>
                     <hi>We have moſt exactly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109423:11"/>
tried all things, and that by approved Reaſons, but we could never find anything permanent in Fire, except the viſcous Moiſture, the ſole radix of all Metals, when as all the other Moiſtures being not well united in homogeneity do eaſily flee from Fire, and the Elements are eaſily ſeparated from one another, but the viſcous Moiſture, to wit, Mercury is never conſumed with Fire, nor is the Water ſeparated from the Earth, but they either remain altogether, or go altogether away.</hi>

               <p>Concerning this Fire <hi>Johannes Pontanus</hi> in his Epiſtle ſaith, The Philoſophers Fire is not the Fire of <hi>Balneo,</hi> nor of Dung, nor of any thing of that kind, which the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have publiſhed in their Writings; it is mineral, it is equal, it is continual, it eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pourates not, unleſs it be too much incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; it participates of Sulphur; it is taken elſewhere than from the matter; it divide, diſſolves calcines and congeals all things; and it is a Fire with moderate burning; it is a compendium without any great charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole work is perfected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Study therefore therein: for if I had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109423:14"/>
found this at firſt, I had not erred two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times before I attained to practice: wherefore men do err, have erred, and will err, becauſe the Philoſophers have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a proper Agent in their Books, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one, namely <hi>Artephius.</hi> But he ſpeaks according to his judgment; and unleſs I had read <hi>Artephius,</hi> and perceived his ſcope, I had never attained to the Complement of the Work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do you conſult him, and ye ſhall know what our <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is.

                  </q>
And <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his fourth Book <hi>Archidox.</hi> of the Quinteſſence, a little after the beginning, ſaith thus: 
<q>
                     <hi>It is difficult, and ſcarce credible, to extract a Quinteſſence without a Corroſive out of Metals, but eſpecially out of Gold, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be overcome but by a Corroſive, by which the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109423:14"/>
Quinceſſence and Body are one ſeparated from the other; which Corroſive may again be taken from it.</hi> And Chap. 3. of Long Life, Tom. 6. Book 3. he thus ſpeaks: <hi>Reſolve Gold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the ſubſtance of Gold by a Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, &amp;c. and that ſo long till it be made the ſame with the Corroſive: nor be you diſmayed becauſe of this way of operation; for a Corroſive is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for Gold, if it be Gold, and without a Corroſive it is dead.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet you muſt know, that our <hi>Menſtruum</hi> being poured upon Gold, ought not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid to be corroſive, but rather fiery; the ſtrength and vertue of which <hi>Arcanum</hi> overcomes all Poiſons.

Take therefore (in the name of Him that ſaid, and all things were done) of this moſt pure matter a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity, put it into a fixing Veſſel, or Phial, or Philoſophical Egg, hermetically ſealed; place it in an <hi>Athanor,</hi> as you know, and proceed with a convenient, <hi>viz.</hi> a digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, continual, (for that failing it muſt needs dye, or become abortive) ſweet, ſubtile, altering, and not burning (that I may uſe the Counts own words) from the firſt conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, even to perfect ablution, government of the Fire, concerning which the anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Philalethes</hi> may be further conſulted, who by the government of every Planet cleerly deſcribes the diverſities of colours, coagulating and fixing it into the white or

               <p>The ſign of the Work perfected will be this: If the Stone being projected upon an hot plate of <hi>Venus,</hi> doth melt like Wax, and not ſmoke, but penetrate and tinge, then is the Oriental King born, ſitting in his Kingdom with greater power than all the Princes of the World.

may by the repeated inverſion of the <hi>Wheel</hi> (as the Philoſophers term it) know how to augment it; in which no ſmall myſtery of Art is contained, we may the ſame way and method augment it, whereby we made it; yet you muſt know that the oftner our Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, which is our Stone, is moiſtned or nouriſhed by its proper Milk, diſſolved in a moiſt <hi>Balneo,</hi> and again coagulated and fixed, as in the firſt work, the tinging vertue of it will be always greater; ſo that indeed after the firſt abſolute work, one part will tinge an hundred of purged Mercury, or any other imperfect Metal, in the ſecond ſolution by <hi>Lac Virginis,</hi> and the coagulation and fixati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, one part will tinge a thouſand. And thus time after time is our Medicine augmented and multiplied in quantity and quality, in vertue and weight.</p>
               <p>Take therefore one part of our Stone, and pour it upon two parts of <hi>Lac Virginis,</hi> or the Mercurial Oyl of Salt putrefied and alembi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; ſolve and coagulate as you did in the firſt work, and our Water which before was only a Mineral potentially, is actually made a Metal more precious than Gold. And thus is the Stone mortified by ſublimations, and revivified by imbibitions, which is the chief univerſal way. Theſe things being brought to a deſired end, Projections may at pleaſure
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109423:16"/>
be made upon this or that Metal prepared, and decently mundified and fuſed, as you have obtained the tincture either for white or red; the true uſe of this Art, and all the Philoſophers Books, (eſpecially out <hi>Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi>) will abundantly ſhew.</p>
