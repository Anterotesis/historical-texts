            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And beſides often preaching in London, &amp; at Paules Croſſe, and ſundry places in the country, and ſpecially in Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, he preached before K. Ed. the 6. in the Lent, the laſt yere of his reigne, vpon the 2. Pſalme; and there in one Sermon, ſhewing the tokens of Gods iudgement at hand, for the contempt of the Goſpel, as that certaine Gentlemen, vpon the Sabboth day, going in a whirry to Paris Garden, to the Bearebay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:19"/>
were drowned: &amp; that a dog was met at Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gáte, carying a piece of a dead child in his mouth: he with a mighty and propheticall ſpirit ſayd, I ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon you all, euen euery mothers child of you, to the iudgement of God, for it is at hand; as it folowed ſhortly after, in the death of K.

In which ſtate and labour of preaching he continued, till the cruelty of the papiſts cut him off, ſo as thou mayſt reade in the hiſtory of his life &amp; death, compiled by that faithful ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Lord Ieſus, M.

                  <p>In deed he had many pulbacks, but God ſtill hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forward his choſen ſeruant, in that trade of life, to the which he had called him: in which he ranne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo happily, that he did outrun me &amp; other his companions. For it pleaſed God, with great ſpeed to make him ready and ripe to Martyrdome; in which through Chriſt he hath nowe gayned the crowne of life. But in all ſtops and ſtayes he was much helped forward by a continuall meditation, &amp; practiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance &amp; faith in Chriſt; in which he was kept by Gods grace, notably exerciſed al the daies of his life. Euen in this meane time he heard a Sermon, which that notable preacher, M. Latimer, made before K. Edward the 6. in which he did earneſtly ſpeak of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be made of things falſly gotten: which did ſo ſtrike Bradford to the heart, for one daſh of a pen which he had made, without the knowledge of his maſter (as full often I haue heard him confeſſe with

plenty of teares) being Clarke to the Treaſurer of the Kings campe beyond the ſeas, and was to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the King, that he could neuer be quiet, til by the aduice of the ſame M. Latimer, a reſtitution was made. Which thing to bring to paſſe, he did willingly forbeare &amp; forgo all the priuate &amp; certaine patrimony which he had in earth. Let all bribers &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But beſides this, our Bradford had his daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and practiſes of repentance.

into the deteſtation of ſinne, and loue of obeying the good will of God. Which things doe require that inward entring into the ſecret parlour of our hearts, of which Chriſt ſpeaketh, and is that ſmiting of the breſt, which is noted in the Publican, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. &amp; is the ſame to the which the Pſalmiſt exhorteth thoſe men looſe in ſinne, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Tremble ye and ſinne not: ſpeak in your ſelues,</hi> that is, Enter into an accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with your ſelues, <hi>When you are on your couches,</hi> that is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye are ſolitary &amp; alone. <hi>And be quiet, or ſilent</hi>: that is, Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye haue thus ſecretly, &amp; deeply conſidered of your caſe and dealing, ye ſhal ceaſe to thinke, ſpeak, and do wickedly. Without ſuch an inward exerciſe of prayer, our Bradford did not pray to his ful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as appeared by this: He vſed in the morning to go to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon praier in the Colledge where he was, &amp; after that, he vſed to make ſome praier with his Pupils in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. But not content with this, he then repaired to his own ſecret praier, &amp; exerciſe in praier by himſelfe, as one that had not yet prayed to his own mind: for he was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſay to his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, I haue praied with my Pupils, but I haue not yet prayed with my ſelfe. Let thoſe ſecure me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marke this wel, which pray without touch of breſt, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee did; &amp; ſo that they haue ſaid an ordinary prayer, or heare a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon courſe of praier, they thinke they haue prayed wel, &amp; as the terme is, they haue ſerued God wel, thogh they neuer feele ſting for ſin, taſt of

groning, or broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heart, nor of the ſweet ſauing helth of Chriſt, thereby to be moued to offer the Sacrifice of thankſgiuing, nor cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge or renuing of mind, but as they came ſecure in ſin, &amp; ſenſeleſſe, ſo they doe depart without any cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, or affecting of the heart; which is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cradle, in which Sathan rocketh the ſinnes of this age aſleepe, who thinke they do ſerue God in theſe curſory praiers, made only of cuſtome, when their heart is as far from God, as was the heart of the Phariſe. Let vs learne by Bradfords exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, to pray better, that is, with the heart, &amp; not with the lips alone, <hi>Quia Deus non vocis, ſed cordis auditor eſt,</hi> as Cyprian ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, becauſe God is the hearer of the heart, &amp; not of the voice: that is to ſay, not of the voice alone, without the heart, for that is but lip la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of ſin, &amp; exerciſe in praier had Bradford, cleane contrary to that curſed cuſtome of thoſe graceleſſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which do ioy to make large and long accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of their leudnes, &amp; do glory therein; ſo feeding their delights with their liues paſſed, as the dog returneth to ſmell to his caſt gorge, &amp; the horſe to his dou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g; ſuch as the Prophet Eſay 39. ſaith, <hi>They declare their ſinnes as Sodom, they hide them not, wo be to their ſoules.</hi> It goeth with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Ieremy 3.3. ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt a vvhores forehead: thou vvouldeſt not be aſhamed.</hi> God giue theſe men better grace; elſe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly they ſhall finde woe, woe, to their very ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Another of his exerciſes was this: He vſed to make
<pb facs="tcp:12952:21"/>
vnto himſelfe an <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> or a <hi>Iournall,</hi> in which he vſed to write all ſuch notable things, as either he did ſee or heare, ech day that paſſed. But whatſoeuer he did heare or ſee, he did ſo pen it, that a man might ſee in that booke, the ſignes of his ſmitten heart. For if he did heare or ſee any good in any man, by that ſight he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and noted the want thereof in himſelf, and added a ſhort praier, crauing mercy &amp; grace to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. If he did heare or ſee any plague, or miſery, he noted it as a thing procured by his own ſins, &amp; ſtil added, <hi>Domine, miſerere mei,</hi> Lord, haue mercy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mee. He vſed in the ſame booke to note ſuch euill thoghts as did riſe in him; as of enuying the good of other men, thoghts of vnthankfulnes, of not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God in his works, of hardnes &amp; vnſenſibleneſſe of heart, when he did ſee other moued and affected.

                  <p>Beſides this, they which were familiar with him, might ſee how he, being in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, vſed to fall often into a ſudden &amp; deep meditation, in which he would ſit with fixed cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance &amp; ſpirit moued, yet ſpeaking nothing a good ſpace. And ſometimes in his ſilent ſitting, plenty of teares ſhuld trickle down his cheeks. Sometime he would ſit in it, &amp; come out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

of the Lord Ieſus, I meane M. Elſyng, when eyther by occaſion of talk had, or of ſome view of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits preſent, or ſome inward cogitation &amp; thought of his owne, he hath fallen into theſe deepe cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; he would tell me in the end ſuch diſcourſes of them, that I did perceiue, that ſomtimes his teares trickled out of his eyes, as well for ioy as for ſorrowe. Neyther was he onely ſuch a practiſer of repentance in himſelfe, but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall prouoker of others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, not only in publike preaching, but alſo in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conference &amp; company: for in all companies where he did come, he would freely reproue any ſin &amp; misbehauior which appeared in any perſon, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſwearers, filthy talkers, &amp; popiſh praters: ſuch neuer departed out of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany vnreproued; &amp; this he did with ſuch a diuine grace &amp; Chriſtian maieſty, that euer he ſtopped the mouthes of the gainſayers: for he ſpake with power; &amp; yet ſo ſweetly, that they might ſee their euil to be euil, &amp; hurtfull vnto them, and vnderſtand that it was good in deede, to the which he laboured to drawe them in God.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, as his life was, ſuch was his death: His life was a practiſe, an example, &amp; prouocation to repentance. At his death, as the foreſaid hiſtory wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, when he was burned in Smithfield, and the flames of fire did flye about his eares, his laſt ſpeach publikely noted &amp; heard, was this, <hi>Repent, England.</hi> Thus was our Bradford a preacher, &amp; an example
<pb facs="tcp:12952:22"/>
of that repentance which hee did preach. Ionas preached to Niniue repentance; and all Niniue, the King, Princes, people, olde and young re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented. To England Bradford did preach, and yet doeth preach repentance: and ſurely England hath nowe much more cauſe to repent, then it had when Bradford liued, and preached repentance: for all ſtates and ſorts of perſons in England, are now more corrupt, then they were then.</p>

Wherefore, we can not but be vanquiſhed of the world, the fleſh, and the deuill, and ſo will Sathans woorkes proſper, though not in all thinges to bleare our eyes, yet in that thing which hee moſt of all deſireth. Therefore, to Repentance, for our ſelues priuately, and for the Realme and Church publiquely, euerie one ſhall labour to ſtirre vp both ourſelues and others.

The which thing to graunt, as I could not (for I had not written it) ſo I tolde them, that had ſo earneſtly deſired it.</p>
                  <p>But when no nay would ſerue, but I muſt promiſe them to write it as I could: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their requeſt, that they ſhould haue it at my leiſure.

to occaſion men nowe to looke vpon all thinges, in ſuch ſort as might mooue them to godlineſſe, rather then to any curious queſtioning: I, for the ſatisfying of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and profiting of the ſimple, ignorant, and rude, haue now cauſed this Sermon to be printed: the which I beſeeche God for his Chriſtes ſake, to vſe as a meane, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of his mercie, it may pleaſe him to worke in me, and many others, true hearty repentance for our ſinnes, to the glory of his name.</p>

Therefore déerely beloued, if you regard the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, in that you cannot enter therein, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you repent: I beſeech you all of euery eſtate, as you would your owne weale, to repent and doe penaunce. The which thing that ye may doe, I will doe my beſt now, to helpe you by Gods grace.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, becauſe wee cannot well tell what repentance is, through ignoraunce, and for lacke of knowledge, and falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: I will (to begin with all) ſhew you what repentance is. Repentance, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is no Engliſh woorde, but wée bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it of the Latiniſts, to whom penance is a forethinking in Engliſh, in Greeke, a béeing wiſe afterwards, in Hebrew, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion or turning, the which conuerſion or turning, in that it cannot be true &amp; hearty, vnto God eſpecially, without ſome good hope or truſt of pardon, for that which is already done and paſt: I may well in this
<pb facs="tcp:12952:28"/>
ſort define it, namely, that penance is a ſorrowing or forethinking of our ſinnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſt, an earneſt purpoſe to amend, or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to God with a truſt of pardon.</p>
                  <p>This definition may bee deuided into three partes: Firſt, a ſorrowing for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>innes: Secondly, a truſt of pardon, which otherwiſe may bée called, a perſwaſion of Gods mercie by the merites of Chriſt, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes: And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a purpoſe to amend, or conuerſion to a new life. The which third or laſt part, can not be called properly a parte, for it is but an effect of penance, as towards the ende yee ſhall ſée by Gods grace. But leaſt ſuch as ſéeke for occaſion to ſpeake euill, ſhould haue any occaſion though they tary not out the end of this Sermon: I therefore deuide penance into the thrée foreſayde partes: of ſorrowing for our ſinne, of good hope or truſt of pardon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of a new life. Thus you now ſée<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what penance is: a ſorrowing for ſinne, a purpoſe to amend, with a good hope or truſt of pardon.</p>
                  <p>This penance not onely differeth from that which men commonly haue taken to bee penance, in ſaying and dooing our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned Lady Pſalters, ſeuen Pſalmes, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:29"/>
Pilgrimages, Almes déedes, and ſuch like thinges, but all from that which the more learned haue declared, to conſiſt of thrée parts, namely, Contrition, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and Satiſfaction.</p>
                  <p>Contrition, they call a iuſt and a ful ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their ſinne. For this word, iuſt and full, is one of the differences, betwéene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and attrition.</p>
                  <p>Confeſſion, they call a numbring of all their ſinnes in the eare of their ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for as (ſay they) a Iudge cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue without knowledge of the cauſe or matter, ſo cannot the Prieſt or ghoſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolue from other ſinnes, then thoſe which he doth heare.</p>
                  <p>Satiſfaction, they call amends making vnto God for their ſinnes, by their vndue workes, <hi>Opera indebita,</hi> Workes more then they néed to doe, as they tearme them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is their penaunce which they preach, write, and allow.

hell fire, and the puniſhment of the deuils, is a iuſt puniſhment for ſinne: In as much as in all ſinne, there is a contempt of God, which is all goodnes, and therefore there is a deſert of all ylneſſe: alas, who can beare or féele this iuſt ſorrow, this full ſorrow for our ſinnes, this their contrition, which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as I write, that penance is a hearty ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our ſinnes, a good hope or truſt of pardon through Chriſt, which is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an earneſt purpoſe to amend, or a new life. This penance is the thing, whereto all the Scripture calleth vs. This penance doe I now call you all vnto: this muſt bée continually in vs, and not for a Lent ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as we haue thought: this muſt increaſe dayly more and more in vs: without this we cannot be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>Search therefore your heartes all, all ſwearers, blaſphemers, lyers, flatterers, baudy, or idle talkers, ieſters, bribers, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous perſons, drunkardes, gluttons, whoremongers, théeues, murtherers, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, idle liuers, negligent in their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. All ſuch, and all other as lament not their ſinnes, as hope not in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie for pardon, and purpoſe not heartily to amend, to leaue their ſwearing, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whoredome, couetouſneſſe, idlenes, &amp;c. All ſuch, I ſay, ſhall not or cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods kingdome, but hell fire is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them, wéeping, and gnaſhing of téeth: whereunto, alas, I feare me, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will néeds goe, in that very many will be as they haue bin, let vs euen to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:12952:33"/>
of our tongue to the ſtumpes, preach and pray neuer ſo much to the contrary, and that euen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bowels of Ieſus Chriſt: as now I beſeech you all, all, all, and euery mothers child, to repent and lament your ſinne, to truſt in Gods mercie, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your liues.</p>
                  <p>Now me thinks, ye are ſomewhat aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: whereby I gather, that preſently you deſire this Repentance, that is: this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, good hope, and newneſſe of life. The which that you may the rather attaine, and get to your comforts, as I haue gone about to be a meane to ſtirre vp in you (by Gods grace) this deſire of Repentance, ſo through the ſame grace of God, will I goe about now to ſhew you, how you may haue your deſire in this behalfe.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, concerning this part, namely, ſorrow for your ſinnes, and hearty lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſame: For this, if you deſire the hauing of it, you muſt beware, that you thinke not, that of your ſelues, or of your owne frée will, by any means you can get it. You may eaſily deceiue your ſelues, and mocke your ſelues, thinking more of your ſelues then is ſéemely. All good things, and not péeces of good things, but all good

                  <p>Merciful Father of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe I haue ſinned &amp; done wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, and through thy goodneſſe haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued a deſire of Repentance, whereto this thy long ſufferance doth draw my hard heart, I beſéech thée for thy mercies ſake in Chriſt, to worke the ſame Repentance in me, and by thy ſpirite, power, and grace ſo to humble, mortifie, and feare my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="tcp:12952:34"/>
for my ſinnes to ſaluation, that in thy good time thou mayſt comfort and quicken me againe, through Ieſus Chriſt thy déere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued Sonne. Amen.</p>
                  <p>After this ſort, I ſay, or otherwiſe, as thou thinkeſt good, if thou wilt haue this firſt part, Contrition, or ſorrow for thy ſins, do thou beg it of God through Chriſt. And when thou haſt aſked it, as I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to driue thée fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truſting in thy ſelfe, ſo now I go about to moue thée from flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of thy ſelfe, from ſluggiſhnes &amp; negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to be diligent to vſe theſe meanes following. Vnto prayer, which I would thou ſhouldeſt firſt vſe as thou canſt: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, get thée Gods Law as a glaſſe to toot in: for in it, and by it, commeth the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſinne, without which knowledge, there can be no ſorrow. For how can a man ſorrow for his ſins, which knoweth not his ſinnes? As when a man is ſicke, the firſt ſtep to health, is to know his ſickneſſe: euen ſo to ſaluation, the firſt ſtep, is to know thy dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation due for thy ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>The Law of God therefore muſt be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and well tooted in: that is, we muſt looke in it ſpiritually, &amp; not corporally, or carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the outward word or letter dooth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb facs="tcp:12952:35"/>
and vtter: and ſo our Sauiour tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs in <hi>Matthew,</hi> expounding the ſixte and ſeuenth commandements, not onely after the outward déede, but alſo after the heart, making the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And this is one of the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene Gods Law and mans law, that of this (mans law I meane) I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnable, ſo long as I obſerue outwardly the ſame. But Gods Law goeth to the roof and to the heart, condemning mee for the inward motion, although outwardly I liue moſt holily. As for example: If I kill no man, though in my heart I hate, mans law condemneth mee not: but otherwiſe doth Gods law. And why? for it ſeeeth the fountaine whence the euil doth ſpring. If hatred were taken out of the heart, then loftineſſe in looks, detraction in tongue, and murther by hand, could neuer enſue. If luſting were out of the heart, curioſitie in countenance, wantonneſſe in words, bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy boldneſſe in body would not appeare.</p>

                     </gap>here is a tag tyed, that is, a penaltie, and that no ſmall one, but ſuch a one, as cannot but make vs to caſt our curriſh tayles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene our legs, if we beléeue it, for all is in vaine, if we be faithleſſe, not to beléeue before we féele.</p>
                  <p>This tag is Gods malediction or curſe. <hi>Maledictus omnis</hi> (ſayth it) <hi>qui non permanet in omnibus quae ſcripta ſunt in libro legis, vt faciat eam.</hi> Loe, accurſed (ſayth he) is all, no exception, all, ſayth God, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not in all things (for he that is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of one, is guiltie of the whole, ſayth S. <hi>Iames</hi>:) in all things therefore, (ſayth the holy Ghoſt) which are written in the booke

of the law to doe them. Hee ſayth not, to heare them, to talke of them, to diſpute of them, but, to doe them.</p>
                  <p>Who is he now that dooeth theſe? <hi>Rara anis,</hi> few ſuch Byrds, yea, none at all. For all are gone out of the way, though not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by word or déed, yet inwardly at the leaſt by default, and wanting of that which is required: ſo that a child of one nights age is not pure, but (by reaſon of birth-ſinne) in danger of Gods malediction: then much more wee, which alaſſe, haue drunken in iniquitie, as it were water, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſayth: But yet alas we quake not.</p>
                  <p>Tell me now, good brother, why do you ſo lightly conſider Gods curſe, that for your ſinnes paſt, you are ſo careleſſe, as though you had made a couenant with death and damnation, as the wicked did in <hi>Eſayes</hi> time? What is Gods curſe? At the Popes curſe with booke, bell, and candle, O, how trembled wee, which heard it, but onely though the ſame was not directed vnto vs, but vnto others? For this Gods curſe, which is incomparable, more ſell and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, and is directed to vs, yea, hanging ouer vs, all by reaſon of our ſinnes: alas, how careleſſe are wee? O faithleſſe hard

                  <p>Is not the anger of a King death? and is the anger of the King of all Kings, a matter to be ſo lightly regarded as wee doe regard it, which for our ſinnes are ſo retchleſſe, that we ſlugge and ſléepe it out? As waxe melteth away at the heate of the fire (ſayth <hi>Dauid</hi>) ſo doe the wicked pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh at the face or countenance of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>If, déerely beloued, his face bee ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and intolerable for ſinners, and the wicked: what trow wée his hand is? At the face and appearing of Gods anger, the earth trembleth: but we earth, earth, yea, ſtones, yron, flints, tremble nothing at all. If wee will not tremble in hearing, woe vnto vs, for then ſhall we bee craſhed in pieces in féeling. If a Lyon roare, the beaſtes quake: but wee are worſe then beaſts, which quake nothing at the roring of the Lyon, I meane y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord of hoſts. And why? becauſe the curſe of God, hardnes of heart, is already fallen vpon vs, or elſe we
<pb facs="tcp:12952:39"/>
could not but lament and tremble for our ſinnes: If not for the ſhame and foulenes thereof, yet at the leaſt, for the malediction and curſe of God, which hangeth ouer vs for our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Lorde bee mercifull vnto vs for thy Chriſts ſake, and ſpare vs, in thine anger remember thy mercies towards vs: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much for the third thing to the moouing of vs to ſorrow for our ſinnes, that is, for the tag tyed to Gods Law, I meane, for the malediction &amp; curſe of God.

much, I pray God we ſmell it not more freſh hereafter, I meane it forſooth (for I know you looke for it) in our déere late So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lord the Kings Maieſtie. You al know he was but a Child in yéeres, defiled he was not with notorious offences: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, quoth he? nay, rather adorned with ſo many good gifts, and wonderfull qualities, as neuer Prince was from the beginning of the world. Should I ſpeake of his wiſedome, of his ripeneſſe in iudgement, of his learning, of his godly zeale, heroical heart, fatherly care for his Commons, nurcely ſolicitude for Religion? &amp;c. Nay, ſo many things are to bee ſpoken in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Gods excéeding graces in this Child: that, as <hi>Saluſt</hi> writeth of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> I had rather ſpeake nothing, then too litle, in that, too much is too little. This gift God gaue vnto vs Engliſh men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Nations vnder the Sunne, and that of his excéeding loue towards vs. But alas, and welaway: for our vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſake, for our ſinnes ſake, for our carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and prophane liuing, Gods anger hath touched, not onely the body, but alſo the mind of our King, by a long ſickneſſe, and at length hath taken him away by death,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:42"/>
death, cruell death, fearefull death. O, if Gods iudgement be begun on him, which as he was the chiefeſt, ſo I thinke the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt, and godlyeſt in the Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (alas) what will it be on vs, whoſe ſinnes are ouergrowne ſo our heads, that they are climed vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? I pray yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, my good brethren, know that Gods anger for our ſin towards vs, cannot but be great, yea, too fell, in that we ſée it was ſo great, that our good King could not beare it. What followed to Iewrie, after the death of <hi>Ioſias</hi>? God ſaue England, and giue vs repentance: my heart will not ſuffer me to tarie longer héerein: I trow this will thruſt out ſome teares of repentance.</p>
                  <p>If therefore to prayer for Gods feare, the tooting in Gods glaſſe, and the tag thereto will not burſt open thy blockiſh heart, yet, I trow, the toſſing to and fro of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and ſpecially of our late King, and this troubleſome time, will tumble ſome teares out of thine heart, if thou ſtill pray for Gods ſpirit accordingly. For who art thou (thinke alwayes with thy ſelfe) that GOD ſhould ſpare thée, more then them whoſe examples thou haſt heard? What friends haſt thou? Were not of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:12952:42"/>
Kings, Prophets, Apoſtles, learned, and come of holy ſtocks? I deceiue my ſelfe, (thinke thou with thy ſelfe) if I beléeue that God, béeing the ſame God that he was, wil ſpare me, whoſe wickedneſſe is no leſſe, but much more then ſome of theirs. Hee hateth ſinne now, as much as euer hee did. The longer hee ſpareth, the greater vengeance will fall: the déeper hee draweth his Bow, the ſorer will the ſhaft pierce.</p>
                  <p>But if yet thy heart be ſo hardened, that all this geare will not mooue thée, ſurely thou art in a very euill eſtate, and remedie now I know none. What, ſaid I, none? Know I none? Yes, there is one, which is ſureſby, as they ſay, to ſerue, if any thing will ſerue. You looke to know what this is. Forſooth, the Paſſion and death of Ieſus Chriſt. You know, the cauſe why Chriſt became man, and ſuffered as he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, was the ſinnes of his people, that he might ſaue them from the ſame. Conſider the greatneſſe of the ſore, I meane ſinne, by the greatnes of the Surgion, and the ſalue. Who was the Surgion? No Angell, no Saint, no Archangell, no power, no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in heauen nor in earth: but onely hée, by whom all things were made, all things
<pb facs="tcp:12952:43"/>
are ruled alſo, euen Gods owne deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and onely beloued Sonne, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming man.</p>
                  <p>Oh what a great thing is this, that could not be done by the Angelles, Archangelles, Potentates, Powers, or all the creatures of God, without his owne Sonne? who yet muſt néeds be thruſt out of heauen, as a man would ſay, to take our nature, and become man. Heere haue yee the Surgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: great was the cure, that this mightie Lord tooke in hand.</p>
                  <p>Now, what was the ſalue? Forſooth, déere geare, and of many compoſitions: I cannot recite all, but rather muſt leaue it to your hearty conſiderations. Thrée and thirtie yéeres was he curing our ſore. Hée ſought it earneſtly by faſting, watching, praying &amp;c. The ſame night that hee was betrayed, I reade how buſie he was about a plaiſter in the garden, when he lying flat on the ground, praying with teares, and that of bloud not a few, but ſo many as did flow downe on the ground againe, crying on this ſort: <hi>Father,</hi> (ſayth hée) <hi>if it bee poſsible, let this cup depart from me.</hi> That is, If it be poſſible, that elſe the ſinnes of mankind can be taken away, graunt that it
<pb facs="tcp:12952:43"/>
may be ſo. Thou heardeſt <hi>Moſes</hi> crying for the Idolaters: Thou heardeſt <hi>Lot</hi> for the <hi>Zoarites: Samuel, Dauid,</hi> and many other for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>: And déere Father, I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am thine owne ſonne, as thou haſt ſaid, in whom thou art well pleaſed: wilt thou not heare me? I haue by the ſpace of three and thirtie yeeres, done alwayes thy will: I haue ſo humbled my ſelfe, that I would become an abiect amongſt men, to obey thée. Therefore (déere Father) if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, graunt my requeſt, ſaue mankind, now without any further labour, ſalues, or plaiſters. But yet (ſayth he) <hi>not as I wil, but as thou wilt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Sir, what heard hée? Though hée ſweat bloud &amp; water, in making his plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for our ſore of ſinne, yet it framed not. Twiſe hee cryed without comfort: yea, though to comfort him, God ſent an Angel, wee yet know, that this plaiſter was not allowed for ſufficient, vntill hereunto, Chriſt Ieſus was betrayed, forſaken of al his Diſciples, forſworne of his déerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, bound like a Théefe, belyed on, buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted, whipped, ſcourged, crowned with thornes, derided, crucified, racked, nayled, hanged vp betwéene two théeues, curſed
<pb facs="tcp:12952:44"/>
and rayled vpon, mocked in miſerie, and had giuen vp the ghoſt: then bowed downe the head of Chriſt, that is, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is the head of Chriſt: then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed he the plaiſter, to bée ſufficient and good for the healing of our ſore, which is ſinne. Now would God abide our breath, becauſe the ſtinke, that is, damnation or guiltineſſe, was taken away by the ſwéet ſauour of the breath of this Lambe, thus offered once for all.</p>
                  <p>So that héere, déerely beloued, wée as in a glaſſe may ſée, to the bruſing of our bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh hard hearts, Gods great iudgement and anger againſt ſin. The Lord of lords, the King of kings,<note place="margin">

Looke on this: toote in the very heart of Chriſt pearced with a ſpeare, wherein thou mayſt ſée, and reade Gods horrible anger for ſinne. Woe to thy hard heart that pierced it.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the firſt part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:44"/>
I meane, for the meanes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king contrition. Firſt, vſe prayer: then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From this and prayer ceaſe not, till thou féele ſome heartie ſorrow for thy ſinne. The which when thou féeleſt, then labour for the other part, that is, faith, on this ſort.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, in Contrition I willed thée not to truſt to thy frée will, for the attayning of it: ſo doe I will thée in this.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thou muſt firſt goe to God, whoſe gift it is: thou muſt, I ſay, get thée to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercie, whoſe worke it is, that as he hath brought thée downe by Contrition, and humbled thée, ſo hee would giue thée faith, rayſe thée vp, and exalt thée.</p>
                  <p>On this maner therefore, with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the poore man in the Goſpell, that cryed: <hi>Lord encreaſe our faith: Lord helpe my vnbeleefe,</hi> pray thou and ſay: O mercifull God and deare Father of our Lord &amp; Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, in whom as
<pb facs="tcp:12952:45"/>
thou art well pleaſed, ſo haſt thou comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to heare him, for as much as hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten biddeth vs to aſke of thée,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2</note> and thereto promiſeth that thou wilt heare vs, and graunt vs that which in his name we ſhall aſke of thée: loe, gracious Father, I am bold to begge of thy mercie, through thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, one ſparkle of true faith, and certaine perſwaſion of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; loue towards me in Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through I béeing aſſured of the pardon of all my ſinnes, by the mercies of Chriſt thy ſonne, may be thankefull to thée, loue thée, and ſerue thée in holineſſe and righteouſnes all the dayes of my life.</p>
                  <p>On this ſort I ſay, or otherwiſe as God ſhall mooue thée, pray thou firſt of all, and looke for thy requeſt at Gods hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any doubting, though foorthwith thou féeleſt not the ſame: for oftentimes wee haue things of GOD giuen vs, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we féele them as we would doe. Now vnto this prayer, vſe thou theſe meanes following.</p>
                  <p>After prayer for faith, which I would ſhould be firſt, ſecondly, becauſe the ſame ſpringeth out of the hearing, not of Maſſes, Mattins, Cannons, Councels, Doctours,

Decrées, but out of the hearing of Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>art which ſerueth, ſpecially to Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is the Law: but the other part, which ſerueth ſpecially to conſolation and certaine perſwaſion of Gods loue towards thée, that is, the Goſpell or publication of Gods mercie in Chriſt, I meane the frée promiſes.</p>
                  <p>But héere thou muſt know, that there are two kinds of promiſes: one, which is properly of the Lawe: another, which is properly of the Goſpel. In the promiſes of the Law, wee may indéed behold Gods mercie, but ſo, that it hangeth vpon the condition of our worthines, as, if thou loue the Lord with all thy heart, &amp;c. thou ſhalt find mercy. This kind of promiſes, though it declare vnto vs Gods loue, which promiſeth where he néedeth not: yet vnto him that féeleth not Chriſt, which is the end of the Law, they are ſo farre from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, that vtterly with the Law they bring man to great deſpaire: ſo greatly we are corrupt, for none ſo loueth God as hée ought to doe. From theſe therefore get thée to the other promiſes of the Goſpell, in which we may ſée ſuch plentie and francke
<pb facs="tcp:12952:46"/>
liberalitie of Gods goodneſſe, that wee can not but be much comforted, though we haue very déepely ſinned. For theſe promiſes of the Goſpell doe not hang on the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our worthineſſe, as the promiſes of the Law doe: but they depend and hang on Gods trueth, that as God is true, ſo they cannot but be performed to all them which lay holde on them by faith, I had almoſt ſaid, which caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not away by vnbeliefe.</p>
                  <p>Marke in them therefore two things, namely, that as wel they are frée promiſes, without any condition of our worthineſſe: as alſo, that they are vniuerſall, offered to all, all (I ſay) which are not ſo ſtubburne, as to kéepe ſtill their hands, whereby they ſhould receyue this almes in their boſoms, by vnbeliefe. As concerning Infants and children, you know I now ſpeake not, but concerning ſuch as be of yéeres of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And now you looke that I ſhould giue you a taſte of theſe promiſes, which are both frée and vniuerſall, except none but ſuch as except themſelues. Well, you ſhal haue one or two for a ſay.</p>

                     </hi> As from <hi>Adam</hi> al haue receiued ſinne to damnation: ſo by Chriſt all haue grace offered to ſaluation, if they reiect not the ſame. I ſpeake not now of Infants, I ſay: nor I néed not to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter of Predeſtination.

                  <p>Loe, now by mee the Lord calleth thée, thou man, thou woman, that art very farre off. The promiſe therefore pertayneth to thée: néeds muſt thou be ſaued, except thou with Sathan ſay, God is falſe: And yet if
<pb facs="tcp:12952:47"/>
thou doe ſo, God is faithfull, and can not denie himſelfe: as thou ſhalt féele by his plagues in hell, for ſo diſhonouring God, to thinke that hée is not true. Will hée bée found falſe now? The matter hangeth not on thy worthines, but it hangeth on Gods trueth. Clap hold on it, and I warrant thée, Chriſt is the propitiation for our ſins, yea, for the ſinnes of the whole world: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue this, man: I know thou beléeueſt it: ſay therefore in thy heart ſtill, <hi>Domine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage mihi fidem: <hi>Lord encreaſe my fayth: Lord helpe my vnbeleefe.</hi>

vniuerſall promiſes of the Goſpell: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſet before thée thoſe benefits which God hath to foregiuen thée, and preſently giueth thée. Conſider how hee hath made thée a man or a woman, which might haue made thée a Toade, or a Dog. And why did hée this? Verily, becauſe he loued thée. And troweſt thou, that if hee loued thée when thou waſt not, to make thée ſuch a one, as he moſt graciouſly hath made thée: will he not now loue thée, béeing his handy worke? Doth he hate any thing that he made? Is there vnableneſſe with him? Doth he loue for a day, and ſo farewell? No forſooth, he loueth to the end, his mercie endureth for euer. Say therefore with <hi>Iob: <hi>Operi manuum tuarum, porrige dexteram</hi>,</hi> that is: <hi>To the worke of thy hands, put thy helping hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, hath hée not made thée a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man or woman, where if hee would, hée might haue made thée a Turke or Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim? This thou knoweſt hee did of loue. And dooſt thou thinke his loue is leſſened, if thou lament thy ſinne? Is his hand ſhorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for helping thee? Can a woman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the child of her wombe? And though ſhee ſhould doe it, yet will not I forget thée,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:48"/>
ſayth the Lord. He hath giuen thée lyms, to ſée, heare, goe, &amp;c. He hath giuen thée wit, reaſon, diſcretion, &amp;c. Hee hath long ſpared thée, and borne with thée, when thou neuer purpoſedſt to repent: and now thou repenting, will hee not giue thee mercie? Wherefore doth hee graunt thée to liue at this preſent, to heare him to ſpeake this, and mee to ſpeake this: but of loue to vs all? Oh, therefore let vs pray him, that he would adde to this, that wee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue theſe loue tokens, that hee loueth vs, and indéed hee wil doe it. Lord, open our eyes, in thy gifts, to ſée thy gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Amen.</p>
                  <p>But to tarie in this I will not.

                  <p>I wil now go about to ſhew you a fourth meane to confirme your faith in this geare, euen by examples. Of theſe there are in the Scriptures very many, as alſo dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth diuerſly teach the ſame, if wee were diligent to obſerue things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly:

                  <p>The Théefe hanging on the Croſſe, ſayd but this: <hi>Lorde, when thou commeſt into thy Kingdome, remember mee:</hi> And what anſwere had hee? <hi>This day</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> What a comfort is this, in that he is now the ſame Chriſt to thée and mee, and to vs all, if wee will runne vnto him? for hee is the ſame Chriſt to day and to morrow, vntill hee come to iudgement.

<pb facs="tcp:12952:52"/>
namely, prayer, the free and vniuerſall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Gods graces, the recordation of the benefits of God, paſt and preſent, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Gods mercie. Which although they might ſuffice, yet will I put one more to them, which all onely of it ſelfe, is full ſufficient: I meane, the death of the Sonne of God, Ieſus Chriſt: which if thou ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of thy mind, it will confirme thy placcard: for it is the great Seale of England, as they ſay, yea, of all the world, for the confirmation of all patents and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuities of the euerlaſting life, whereunto we are all called.</p>
                  <p>If I thought theſe, which I haue before recited, were not ſufficient to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme your faith, of Gods loue towards ſuch as do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, I would tarie longer herein. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue béene both long, and alſo I truſt, you haue ſome exerciſe of conſcience in this daily (or els you are too blame) I wil but touch &amp; goe. Conſider with your ſelues what we are, miſers, wretches &amp; enemies to God. Conſider what God is, euen hée, which hath all power, maieſtie, might, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, riches, &amp;c. perfectly of himſelfe, &amp; needeth nothing, but hath all things. Conſider what Chriſt is: concerning his Godhead, coequal
<pb facs="tcp:12952:53"/>
with his Father, euen hee by whom all things were made, are ruled and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: concerning his manhood, the onely Dearling of his Father, in whom is all his ioy. Now Sir, what a loue is this? that this God which néedeth nothing, would giue wholy his owne ſelfe to thée his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, wreaking his wrath vpon him ſelfe, in this his Sonne: as a man may ſay, to ſpare thée, to ſaue thée, to winne thée, to buie thée, to haue thée, to enioy thée for euer. Becauſe thy ſinne hath ſeparated thée from him, to the end thou mighteſt come eftſoones into his company againe, and therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: hee himſelfe became, as a man would ſay, a ſinner, or rather ſinne it ſelfe, euen a malediction or curſe: that wée ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, wee accurſed by our ſinne, might by his oblation or offering for our ſinnes, by his curſe, be deliuered from ſinne, and from malediction. For by ſinne, hee deſtroyed ſinne, killing Death, Sathan, and Sinne, by their owne weapons, and that for thée and mee (man) if wee caſt it not away by vnbeleefe. Oh wonderfull loue of God. Who euer heard of ſuch a loue? the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Heauen for vs his enemies, to giue his owne deare Sonne, Ieſus Chriſt, and
<pb facs="tcp:12952:53"/>
that not onely to bee our Brother, to dwell among vs, but alſo, to the death of the Croſſe for vs? Oh wonderfull loue of Chriſt to vs all, that was content and willing to worke this feate for vs. Was there any loue like to this loue?</p>
                  <p>God in déede hath commended his chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and loue to vs heerein, that when wee were very enemies vnto him, hee would giue his owne Sonne for vs. That wee béeing men, might become, as you would ſay, Gods, God would become man. That wee beeing mortall, might become immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, the immortall God would become mortall man. That we earthly wretches might be Citizens of Heauen, the Lord of Heauen would become, as a man would ſay, earthly. That wee beeing accurſed, might be bleſſed, God would bee accurſed. That wee, by our father <hi>Adam,</hi> beeing brought out of Paradiſe, into the puddle of all paine, might be redeemed, and brought into Paradiſe againe, God would bee our Father, and an <hi>Adam</hi> thereunto. That we hauing nothing, might haue all things, God hauing all things, would haue no thing. That wee beeing vaſſailes, and ſlaues to all, euen to Sathan the Fiend.
<pb facs="tcp:12952:54"/>
might be Lords of all, and of Sathan: the Lord of all would become a vaſſaile, and a ſlaue to vs all, and in danger of Sathan. Oh loue incomprehenſible. Who can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe thinke now, but if the gracious good Lorde diſdayned not to giue his owne Sonne, his owne hearts ioy, for vs his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enemies, before wée thought to begge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing at his hands, yea, before we were? who, I ſay, can thinke otherwiſe, but that with him, hee will giue vs all good things? If when we hated him, and fled away from him, he ſent his Sonne to ſéeke vs: who can thinke otherwiſe, then that now wee louing him, and lamenting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we loue him no more, but that he wil for euer loue vs? He that giueth the more to his enemies, wil not hée giue the leſſe, trow you, to his friends? God hath giuen his owne Sonne, then which thing nothing is greater, to vs his enemies: and wee now béeing become his friends, will he deny vs faith, and pardon of our ſins? which though they bee great, yet in compariſon they are nothing at all. Chriſt Ieſus would giue his owne ſelfe for vs, when wee willed it not: and will he now deny vs faith, if we will it? This will is his earneſt, that hee
<pb facs="tcp:12952:54"/>
hath giuen vs truely to looke indéed, for the thing willed. And looke thou for it in déed: for as he hath giuen thee to will, ſo will he giue thée to doe.</p>
                  <p>Ieſus Chriſt gaue his life for our euils, and by his death he deliuered vs. O then, in that hee liueth now, and can not die, will he forſake vs? His heart bloud was not too deare for vs, when we aſked it not: what can then bee now too deare for vs, aſking it? Is he a changeling? Is he mutable as man is? Can hee repent him of his gifts? Did he not foreſée our falles? Payd not he therefore the price? Becauſe hee ſaw wee ſhould fall ſore, therefore would hee ſuffer ſore. Yea, if his ſuffering had not béene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, he would yet once more come again. God the Father, I am ſure, if the death of his Sonne incarnate, would not ſerue, would himſelfe and the holy Ghoſt alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come incarnate and die for vs.</p>
                  <p>This death of Chriſt therefore looke on, as the very pledge of Gods loue towards thée, whoſoeuer thou art, how deepe ſoeuer thou haſt ſinned. See, Gods hands are nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they cannot ſtrike thee: his feete alſo, he cannot runne from thee: his armes are wide open to embrace thee: his head hangs

                  <p>Anoint thy head with this oyle: let this oyntment enbaulme thy head, and waſh thy face.</p>
                  <p>Tarie thou heere, and cocke ſure thou art, I warrant thee. Say with <hi>Paul, What can ſeparate me from the loue of God?</hi> Can death, can pouertie, ſickeneſſe, hunger or any miſerie, perſwade thee now, that God loueth thee not? Nay, nothing can ſeparate thee from the loue wherewith God hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee in Chriſt Ieſus: whom he loueth, he loueth to the end. So that now where aboundance of ſinne hath beene in thee, the more is the aboundance of grace. But to what end? Forſooth, that as ſinne hath raigned to death, as thou ſéeeſt, to the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Gods Sonne: ſo now Grace muſt raigne to Life, to the honouring of Gods Sonne, who is now aliue, and can not die any more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:12952:56"/>So that they which by faith féele this, cannot any more die to God, but to ſinne, whereto they are dead and buried with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>As Chriſt therefore liueth, ſo doe they, and that to God, to righteouſneſſe and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The life which they liue, is <hi>In fide Filii Dei</hi>: In the faith of the Sonne of God. Whereby you ſée, that now I am ſlipt into that, which I made the third part of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, namely, newneſſe of life, which I could not ſo haue done, if that it were a part of it ſelfe indéed, as it is an effect or fruit of the ſecond part, that is, of faith, or truſt in Gods mercie. For he that beléeueth, that is, is certainely perſwaded, ſinne to be ſuch a thing, that it is the cauſe of all miſerie, and of it ſelfe ſo greatly angereth God, that in heauen nor in earth, nothing could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his wrath, ſaue alonely the death and precious bloodſhedding of the Sonne of GOD, in whom is all the delight and pleaſure of the Father: hee, I ſay, that is perſwaded thus of ſinne, the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but in heart abhorre and quake, to doe or ſay, yea, to thinke any thing willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which Gods Law teacheth him to bee ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:12952:57"/>Againe, hee that beléeueth, that is, is certainely perſwaded, Gods loue to bée ſo much towards him, that where through ſinne he was loſt, and made a firebrand of hell, the eternall father of mercy, which is the omni-ſufficient God, &amp; néedeth nothing to vs, or of any thing that we can doe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs out of hell, and to bring vs into heauen, did ſend euen his owne moſt déere Sonne out of his boſome, out of heauen into hell, as a man would ſay, to bring vs, as I ſaid, from thence into his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and mercie, wee béeing his very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: hee, I ſay, that is thus perſwaded of Gods loue towards him, and of the price of his redemption, by the deare bloud of the Lambe immaculate, Ieſus Chriſt, the ſame man cannot but loue God againe, and of loue doe that, and heartily deſire to doe better, the which might pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>Trow you, that ſuch a one, knowing this geare by faith, will willingly welter and wallow in his wilfull luſts, pleaſures and fantaſies? Will ſuch a one, as knoweth by faith, Chriſt Ieſus to haue giuen his bloud to waſh him from his ſinnes, play the Sow, to welter in his puddle of filthie ſinne and vice againe? Nay, rather then
<pb facs="tcp:12952:57"/>
he will be defiled againe by wilful ſinning, he will waſh often the féet of his affections, watching ouer the vice ſtill ſticking in him, which as a ſpring, continually ſendeth out poyſon enough, to drowne and defile him, if the ſwéete water of Chriſtes paſſion in Gods ſight, did not waſh it, and his bloud ſatiſfie the rigour of Gods iuſtice, due for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>This bloud of Chriſt ſhed for our ſinnes, is ſo deare in the ſight of him that beléeueth, that he will abhorre in his heart, to ſtampe it, and tread it vnder his féete. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth now by his beléefe, that it is too much, that hitherto he hath ſet too little by it, and is aſhamed thereof. Therefore, for the reſidue of his life, hée purpoſeth to take better héed to himſelfe, then before hee did. Becauſe hée ſéeeth by his faith, the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſneſſe of GODS anger, the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, the greatneſſe of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and of Chriſts loue towards him, hée will now bee héedie to pray to GOD to giue him his grace accordingly, that as with his eyes, tongue, hands, féet, &amp;c. hée hath diſpleaſed God, doing his owne will: euen ſo now with the ſame eyes, tongue, eares, hands, féete, &amp;c. hee may diſpleaſe
<pb facs="tcp:12952:58"/>
his owne ſelfe, and doe Gods will: Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly will he not doe that which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the death of the Sonne of God. Hée knoweth he hath too much ſinne, vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him, ſo that thereto hee will not adde willing offences.</p>
                  <p>This willing and witting offending and ſinning, whoſoeuer doth flatter himſelfe therein, doth euidently demonſtrate and ſhew, that hee neuer yet indéed taſted of Chriſt truely. Hee was neuer truely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, or beléeued, how foule a thing ſinne is, how grieuous a thing Gods anger is, how ioyfull and precious a thing, Gods mercie in Chriſt is, how excéeding broad, wide, hie and déepe, Chriſts loue is: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance he can write, prate, talke, and preach of this geare: but yet he in part by faith, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer felt this geare.</p>
                  <p>For if hee did once féele this geare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed, then would he bée ſo farre from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in ſinne, willingly and wittingly, that wholy and heartily hee would giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himſelfe to that which is contrary, I meane, anew to life, renewing his youth, euen as the Eagle doth.</p>
                  <p>For as we, béeing in the ſeruitude of ſin, demonſtrate our ſeruice, by giuing ouer our
<pb facs="tcp:12952:58"/>
members to the obeying of ſinne, from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie to iniquitie: euen ſo, we béeing made frée from ſinne, by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and endued with Gods ſpirit, a ſpirit of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, muſt néeds demonſtrate this frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and libertie, by giuing ouer our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the obedience of the ſpirit: by the which we are lead and guided from vertue to vertue, and all kind of holines. As the vnbeléeuers declare their vnbeléefe, by the woorking of the euill ſpirit in them, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the fruits of the fleſh: euen ſo the beléeuers declare their faith, by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gods good ſpirit in them outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fruits of the ſpirit. For as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill is not dead in thoſe which are his, but worketh ſtill to their damnation: ſo is not God dead in them which bee his, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſtill to their ſaluation. The which working is not the cauſe of the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther béeing in any, but onely a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſigne, a fruit of the ſame: As the Apple is not the cauſe of the Apple tree, but a fruit of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus then you ſée briefly, that newnes of life, is not in déed a part of penance, but a fruit of it, a demonſtration of the iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, a ſigne of Gods good ſpirit poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
<pb facs="tcp:12952:59"/>
the heart of the penitent: as the old life is a fruite of impenitencie, a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of a lip-faith, or vnbeliefe, a ſigne of Sathans ſpirit, poſſeſſing the heart of the impenitent, which all thoſe be, that bee not penitent.</p>
                  <p>For meane I know none: He that is not penitent, the ſame is impenitent: hee that is not gouerned by Gods ſpirit, the ſame is gouerned by Sathans ſpirit. For all that bée Chriſtians, are gouerned with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, which ſpirit hath his fruits. All other that bee not Chriſts, are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils. Hee that gathereth not with Chriſt, ſcattereth abroad.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, dearely beloued, I beſéech you to conſider this geare, and deceyue not your ſelues. If you bee not Chriſts, then pertayne you to the Deuill: of which thing the fruits of the fleſh doth aſſure you, as whoredome, adulterie, vncleanneſſe, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, Idolatry, witchcraft, enuy, ſtrife, contention, wrath, ſedition, murther, drunkenneſſe, gluttony, blaſphemy, ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, idleneſſe, bawdy talking, ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, &amp;c. If theſe Apples grow out of the Apple trées of your hearts, ſurely, ſurely, the Deuill is at Inne with you, you are his

birds: whom when he hath well fed, he wil broache you and eate you, chaw you and champe you, world without end, in eternall woe and miſerie. But I am otherwiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of you all. I truſt you bee all Chriſt Ieſus his people and children, yea, brethren, and by faith.</p>
                  <p>As ye ſee your ſinnes in Gods Law, and tremble, ſigh, ſorrow and ſob for the ſame: euen ſo you ſée his great mercies in his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and frée promiſes, and therefore are glad, merrie and ioyfull, for that you are accepted into Gods fauour, haue your ſins pardoned, and are endued with the good ſpirit of God, euen the ſeale and ſigne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel of your election in Chriſt before the beginning of the world.</p>

                  <p>But to come againe, of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I am purpoſed preſently to ſpeake, through the helpe of God, becauſe wee are aſſembled in Chriſt (I hope) to celebrate the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now, that the things which I ſhall ſpeake, may bee better obſerued, and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away of you, I will tell you how, and in what ſort I will ſpeake of it. Thrée things would I haue marked, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals and ſcopes, whereto I wil referre all that I ſhall at this time ſpeake thereof. They be theſe: Who, what, and wherefore. That is, (to make it more plaine) Who did inſtitute this thing which we are about to celebrate, this is the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, What the thing is, which is inſtituted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:12952:63"/>And the laſt is, Wherefore, and to what end it was inſtituted: whereby we ſhall be taught how to vſe it.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, Who did inſtitute this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and Supper. You all doe know,<note place="margin">Who did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that things are more eſtéemed ſometime for the dignitie and authoritie of the perſon, ſometime for the wiſedome of the perſon, ſometime for the power and magnificence of the perſon, and ſometime for the tender loue and kindneſſe of the perſon. If néed were, I could by examples ſet forth euery one of theſe, but I hope it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now then, how can the thing which wée bée about to celebrate, but bée eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of euery one highly, in that the Author of it doth want no dignitie, no authoritie, no wiſdome, no power, no magnificence, no holineſſe, no tender loue and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? but hath all dignitie, authoritie, wiſedome, power, magnificence, holines, tender loue, mercie, glory, and all that can be wiſhed abſolutely.</p>
                  <p>Hee is GOD eternall, coequall, and ſubſtantiall, with the Father, and with the holy Ghoſt, the Image of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of GOD, the wiſedome of the Father, the brightneſſe of his glorie,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:64"/>
by whome all things were made, are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and gouerned. He is the King of all Kings, and the Lord of all Lords. He is the <hi>Meſsias</hi> of the world, our moſt deare and louing brother, Sauiour, Mediatour, Aduocate, Interceſſour, Huſband, Prieſt. So that the thing which commeth from him, cannot but bee eſtéemed, loued, and embraced, if dignitie, authoritie, wiſdome, power, glory, goodnes, and mercie like vs. Yea, if any thing that can bee wiſhed, like vs, then cannot this which our Lord did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, but like vs, and that ſo much the more, by how much it is one of the laſt things which hee did inſtitute &amp; command. God open our eyes, to ſée theſe things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: ſo ſhall we come with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to this Table of the Lord: which thing hee graunt for his mercies ſake. Amen.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the firſt, who did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute this Sacrament.</p>

But concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, neyther the ſenſes ſée any other thing then bread, neyther is there any mention made of turning.

                  <p>And this doth ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirme, ſaying: None do eat Chriſts body, which is not in the body of Chriſt, that is, (as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it) in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt dwelleth not, &amp; he

in Chriſt. Which thing the wicked doe not, becauſe they want faith and the holy Spirite, which be the meanes whereby Chriſt is receiued.</p>
                  <p>To the things which I haue brought héerefoorth, to improue Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I could bring in the Fathers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame, which ſucceeded continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally many hundreth yéeres after Chriſt.

Alſo I could ſhewe, that euer hitherto, ſince it was eſtabliſhed, in all times it hath bene reſiſted and ſpoken againſt. Yea, before this doctrine, the Church was nothing ſo endowed with goods, landes, and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it hath béene ſince. It hath brought no ſmall gaine, no ſmall honour, no ſmall eaſe to the Cleargie: and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though they ſtriue and fight for it.</p>
                  <p>It is their <hi>Maozim,</hi> it is their <hi>Helena.</hi> GOD deſtroy it with the breath of his mouth, as ſhortly he will for his names ſake. Amen.</p>
                  <p>If time would ſerue, I could and would heere tell you of the abſurdities which
<pb facs="tcp:12952:71"/>
come by this doctrine: but for times ſake I muſt omit it. Onely for Gods ſake ſee this, that this their doctrine of Tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is an vntrueth, already I haue proued, and forget not, that it is the whole ſtay of all Poperie, and the pillar of their Prieſthood: whereby Chriſts Prieſthood, Sacrifice, Miniſterie, &amp; Trueth is letted, yea, peruerted, and vtterly ouerthrowne.</p>
                  <p>GOD our Father, in the blood of his Sonne Chriſt, open the eyes and minds of all our Magiſtrates, all other that beare the name of Chriſt, to ſée to it in time, to GODS glory, and their owne ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Amen.</p>
                  <p>Now to returne to the ſecond matter, what the Sacrament is, you ſée that to the ſenſes and reaſon of man, it is bread and wine: Which is moſt true, as by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and otherwiſe I haue already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and therefore away with Tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</p>
                  <p>But héere, leaſt wee ſhould make it no Sacrament, for a Sacrament conſiſteth of two things: and leaſt a man ſhould by this gather, that wee make it none other thing but bare bread, and a naked ſigne, and ſo rayle at their pleaſure on vs, ſaying, How
<pb facs="tcp:12952:71"/>
can a man be guiltie of the body and blood of Chriſt, by vnworthy receiuing of it, if it be but bare bread, &amp; ſo forth? For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I will now ſpeake a litle more héerea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, by GODS grace, to ſtoppe their mouthes, and to ſtirre vp your good hearts, more to the worthy eſtimation and percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this holy myſterie.</p>
                  <p>When a louing friend giueth to thée a thing, or ſendeth to thee a token (as for an example, a napkin, or ſuch like) I thinke thou doeſt not as thou ſhouldeſt do, if that with the thing thou conſidereſt not the mind of thy friend that ſendeth or giueth the thing, and according thereunto eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt and receyueſt it.</p>
                  <p>And ſo of this bread thinke I, that if thou doe not rather conſider the mind of thy louer Chriſt, then the thing which thou ſéeeſt: yea, if thou doe not altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Chriſts mind, thou dealeſt vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and ſtrumpetlike with him. For it is the propertie of ſtrumpets, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the things giuen and ſent them, rather then the loue and mind of the giue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> &amp; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: whereas the true louers doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in any poynt, the things giuen or ſent, but the mind of the partie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:12952:72"/>So wee, if we bee true louers of Chriſt, muſt not conſider barely the outwarde thing which we ſee, and our ſenſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, but rather altogether we muſt and ſhould ſée &amp; conſider the minde of Chriſt, and héereafter and accordingly to it to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeme the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhall we know the minde of Chriſt? Forſooth, as a mans minde is beſt knowen by his word: ſo by Chriſts worde ſhall we know his minde.</p>
                  <p>Now his words bee manifeſt, and moſt plaine: <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is my body:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accordingly ſhould we eſtéeme, take, and receiue it. If he had ſpoken nothing, or if he had ſpoken doubtfully, then might we haue béene in ſome doubt. But in that he ſpeaketh ſo plainely, ſaying, <hi>This is my body</hi>: who can, may, or dare be ſo bolde as to doubt of it? He is the trueth and can not lye, hee is omnipotent and can doe all things: therefore it is his body. This I beleeue, this I confeſſe, and pray you all heartily to beware of theſe and ſuch like wordes, that it is but a ſigne or a figure of his body: Except yee will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betwixt ſignes which ſignifie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſignes which alſo doe repreſent,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:72"/>
confirme and ſeale vp (or as a man may ſay) giue with their ſignification. As for an example: An Iuie buſh, is a ſigne of Wine to be ſold: the budding of <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, did ſignifie <hi>Aarons</hi> Prieſthood, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord: the reſeruation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Rod, did ſignifie the rebellion of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael: the ſtones taken out of <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane, Gedeons</hi> fléece of wooll, &amp;c. Such as theſe, be ſignes ſignificatiue, and ſhew no gift. But in the other ſignes, which ſome call exhibitiue, is there not onely a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the thing, but alſo a declaration of a gift, yea, in a certaine manner, a giuing alſo: As Baptiſme ſignifieth not onely the cleanſing of the conſcience from ſinne, by the merits of Chriſts blood, but alſo is a very cleanſing from ſinne. And therefore it was ſayd to <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould ariſe and waſh away his ſinnes, and not that hee ſhould ariſe and take onely a ſigne of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away his ſinnes. In the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the bread is called a partaking of the Lords body, and not onely a bare ſigne of the Lords body.</p>
                  <p>This I ſpeake not, as though the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe Sacraments (were Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiate) which I haue already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned
<pb facs="tcp:12952:73"/>
eyther, as though Chriſts body were in bread or wine, eyther were tyed to the elements, otherwiſe then Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, and ſpiritually, eyther that the bread and wine may not, and muſt not bee called Sacramentall, and externall ſignes: but that they might be diſcerned from ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificatiue and bare ſignes onely, and bee taken for ſignes exhibitiue, and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. By this meanes a Chriſtian conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will call and eſtéeme the bread of the Lord, as the body of Chriſt. For it will neuer eſtéeme the Sacraments of Chriſt after their exterior appearance, but after the words of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Whereof it commeth, that the Fathers, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and others doe ſpeake with ſo full a mouth, when they ſpeake of the Sacrament: for their reſpect was to Chriſts words. If the Schoolemen which followed, had the ſame ſpirit which they had, then would they neuer haue conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Tranſſubſtantiation. For with great admiration ſome of the Fathers doe ſay, that the bread is changed or turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body of Chriſt, and the wine into his blood: meaning it of a mutation or change,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:73"/>
not corporall, but ſpirituall, figuratiue, Sacramentall, or myſtical. For now it is no common bread, nor common wine, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordained to ſerue for the foode of the ſoule. The Schoolemen haue vnderſtood it, as the Papiſts now preach of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall changing, as though it were no great miracle, that common bread ſhould now bee aſſumed into that dignitie, that it ſhould be called Chriſts body, and ſerue for a celeſtiall foode, and be made a Sacrament of his body and blood.</p>

                  <p>Which Faith, though it bee of things hoped for, and ſo of things abſent to the corporall ſences, yet this abſence, is not an abſence in déede, but to reaſon, and the olde man, the nature of Faith beeing a poſſeſſion of things hoped for.

this our faith and doctrine of the Sacrament, wee granting in all things héerein vnto them, and they in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vnto vs. And therefore the lying lyppes, which both belye the Doctours, as though they graunted a carnall and reall preſence of Chriſtes body, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and corporally after the Papiſtes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and meaning: and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vs alſo, as though wee denied all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, and ſo made it but a bare ſigne.</p>
                  <p>Theſe lying lips the Lord will deſtroy, if they repent not, and with vs beléeue, and teach the trueth, that the Sacrament is the foode of the Soule a matter of faith, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpiritually and by faith, to be talked of and vnderſtanded: which faith they want, &amp; therefore they erre ſo groſely, in that they would haue ſuch a preſence of Chriſt, as is contrary to all the Scriptures, and to our Chriſtian Religion: whereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth no ſuch commoditie to the receiuer, as by the Spirituall preſence which wée teach, and according to GODS word do affirme.</p>
                  <p>For we teach theſe benefites to bee had
<pb facs="tcp:12952:77"/>
by the woorthy receiuing the Sacrament, namely, that wée abide in Chriſt, and Chriſt in vs. Againe, that wee attaine by it a celeſtiall life, or a life with GOD: moreouer, that by Faith and in Spirite, wée receiue not onely Chriſtes body and blood, but alſo whole Chriſt, GOD and man. Beſides theſe, wée graunt, that by the woorthy receiuing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we receiue remiſſion of our ſinnes, and confirmation of the new Teſtament. Laſt of all, by woorthy receiuing, wée get an increaſe of incorporation with Chriſt, and amongſt our ſelues which bée his members: then which things, what more can be deſired? Alas, that men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider nothing at all, howe that the coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Chriſtes body and blood to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is a ſpirituall thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there néedes no ſuch carnall preſence as the Papiſtes imagine. Who will deny a mans Wife, to be with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, one body and one fleſh, although he be at London, and ſhée at Yorke? But the Papiſtes are carnall men, guided by carnall reaſon onely, or elſe would they knowe howe that the holy Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:12952:77"/>
of our infirmitie, vſeth metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the wordes of abyding, dwelling, eating and drinking of Chriſt, that the vnſpeakeable coniunction of Chriſt with vs, might ſomething be knowen. GOD open their eyes to ſee it. And thus much for this.</p>
                  <p>Now to that part of the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ſayth, that wee teach Chriſt to bee none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe preſent in the Sacrament, then in his worde: I would that the obiectors would well conſider, what a preſence of Chriſt is in his worde. I remember that ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth, how that Chriſts body is receiued ſometime viſible, and ſometime inuiſible</p>
                  <p>The viſible receite, hee calleth that which is by the Sacrament: the inuiſible receite hee calleth that which by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our faith, with our ſelues, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. And ſaint <hi>Herome,</hi> in the third booke vpon <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> affirmeth that wee are fed with the body of Chriſt, and we drinke his blood, not onely in myſterie, but alſo in knowledge of holy Scripture. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee plainely ſheweth, that the ſame meate is offered in the words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:78"/>
which is offered in the Sacrament, ſo that no leſſe is Chriſtes body and blood offered by the Scriptures, then by the Sacramentes. Vpon the <hi>147. Pſalme,</hi> he writeth alſo, that though theſe wordes: <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood:</hi> may bee vnderſtoode in myſterie, yet he ſayth, it is more true to take Chriſts body and his blood, for the worde of the Scriptures, and the doctrine of God. Yea, vpon the ſame <hi>Pſalme</hi> hee ſayeth plainely, that Chriſtes fleſh and blood is powred into our eares, by hearing the worde, and therefore great is the perill, if we yeeld to other cogitations whylſte wee heare it. And therefore, I trow, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, that it is no leſſe perill to heare GODS word negligently, then ſo to vſe the Sacrament. But héere of may no man gather, that therefore it néedeth not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacrament, or to affirme that a man may as much by himſelfe, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the word in the fielde, receiue Chriſts body, as in the Church, in the right vſe of the Sacrament. For Chriſt ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing in vaine, or ſuperſtitiouſly, hee ordaineth nothing whereof wee haue
<pb facs="tcp:12952:78"/>
not néede: Although his authoritie is ſuch, that without any queſtioning, his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to be obeyed.</p>
                  <p>Againe, though in the field a man may receyue Chriſts body by faith, in the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word, yet deny I that a man doth ordinarily receiue Chriſts bodie, by the onely meditation of Chriſts death, or hearing of his word, with ſo much ſight, and by ſuch ſenſible aſſurance (whereof GOD knoweth our infirmitie hath no ſmall néed) as by the receite of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not that Chriſt is not ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his word preached, as hee is in, or with his Sacrament: but becauſe there are in the perception of the Sacrament, more windowes open for Chriſt to enter into vs, then by his woord preached or heard. For there, I meane in the word, he hath an entrance into our hearts, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the eares, through the voice and ſound of the words: but heere in the Sacrament, he hath an entrance by all our ſenſes, by our eies, by our noſe, by our taſte, and by our handling alſo.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the Sacrament full well may bee called, ſéeable, ſenſible,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:79"/>
taſteable, and touchable words. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when many windowes be opened in an houſe, the more light may come in then when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>here is but one opened: euen ſo, by the perception of the Sacraments, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian mans conſcience hath more helpe to receiue Chriſt, then ſimply by the woord preached, heard, or meditated.</p>
                  <p>And therefore mee thinketh, the Apoſtle full well calleth the Sacraments, obſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or ſealings of Gods promiſe. Read <hi>Rom.</hi> the <hi>4.</hi> of Circumciſion. And thus much for the anſwere to the obiection afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd.</p>
                  <p>Now to returne from whence wée came, namely, to the conſideration of the ſecond thing, what the Sacrament is: I haue told you, that it is not ſimply bread and wine, but rather Chriſts body, ſo called of Chriſt, and ſo to be called and eſtéemed of vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But héere let vs marke what body, and what blood Chriſt called it.</p>

Chriſt calleth it his body broken, and his blood ſhedde.

                  <p>For which end, Chriſt our Sauiour did ſpecially inſtitute this Supper, ſaying: <hi>Doe ye this in remembrance of mee</hi>: or as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth: <hi>Shew you the Lords death till hee come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Supper of the Lord then, is not ſimply Chriſts body and blood, but Chriſts body broken, and his bloud ſhed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore broken? Wherefore ſhedde? Forſooth,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:80"/>
that teacheth Chriſt himſelfe, ſaying: <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you, Shed for your ſinnes, and for the ſinnes of many.</hi> Héere now then wee haue occaſion in the vſe of the Sacrament, to call to mind the greatneſſe and grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, which could not be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by any other meanes, then by the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the moſt precious blood, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the moſt pure body, of the onely begotten ſonne of GOD, Ieſus Chriſt, by whom all things were made, all things are ruled and gouerned, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Who conſidering this geare, ſhall not bee touched to repent? Who in receite of this Sacrament, thinking that Chriſt ſaith to him: <hi>Take, eate, this is my body, which is broken for thee: This is my blood which is ſhedde for thy ſinnes</hi>: Can but tremble at the grieuouſneſſe of his ſinnes, for the which ſuch a price was payd? If there were no plague at all elſe, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh man of ſinne, how grieuous a thing it is in Gods ſight, ſurely that one were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. But alas, how are our hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched through Sathans ſubtilties, and the cuſtome of ſinne, that wee make ſinne, a thing of nothing? God open our eyes
<pb facs="tcp:12952:80"/>
in time, and giue vs repentance, which we ſée this Sacrament doth, as it were, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force vs vnto, in the reuerence and true vſe of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in hearing that this which wee take and eate, is Chriſts body broken for our ſinnes, and his bloud ſhedde for our iniquities, wée are occaſioned to call to mind the infinite greatnes of Gods mercie and trueth, and of Chriſts loue towards vs. For what a mercie is this, that God would for man, béeing loſt through his wilfull ſinnes, be content, yea, deſirous to giue his owne onely Sonne, <hi>The Image of his ſubſtance, the brightneſſe of his glorie,</hi> béeing in his owne boſome, to bée made man for vs, that wee men by him, might be, as it were, made Gods? What a mercie is this, that GOD the Father ſhould ſo tender vs, that hee would make this his Sonne, béeing equall with him in diuinitie, a mortall man for vs, that wée might be made immortall by him? What a kindneſſe is this, that the almightie Lord ſhould ſend to vs his enemies, his deare darling to bee made poore, that wee by him might be made rich? What bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb facs="tcp:12952:81"/>
was this, that the omnipotent Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of Heauen and earth, would deliuer his owne onely beloued Sonne for vs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be not onely fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bones, that wee might by him through the holy Ghoſt, be made one with him, and ſo with the Father, by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the merits of his fleſh, that is, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, holineſſe, innocencie, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie: but alſo to be a ſlaine Sacrifice for our ſinnes, to ſatiſfie his iuſtice, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert or turne death into life, our ſinne into righteouſneſſe, hell into Heauen, miſerie into felicitie for vs? What a mercie is this, that GOD will rayſe vp this his ſonne Chriſt, not onely to iuſtifie and regenerate vs? but alſo in his perſon, to demonſtrate vnto vs our ſtate, which we ſhall haue: for in his comming we ſhall be like vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Oh wonderfull mercie of God, which would aſſume this his Chriſt, euen in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, into the heauens, to take and keepe there poſſeſſion for vs, to leade our captiuitie captiue, to appeare before him alwaies praying for vs, to make the throne of Iuſtice a throne of mercy, the ſeat of glory a ſeat of grace, ſo that with boldneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:12952:81"/>
we may come and appeare before God, to aſke and find grace, in time conuenient. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what a veritie and conſtant trueth in God, is this, that he would, according to his promiſe made firſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and others in his time, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, by ſending his ſonne ſo graciouſly? Who would doubt hereafter, of any thing that he hath promiſed?</p>
                  <p>And as for Chriſts loue, oh, whoſe heart can bee able to thinke of it any thing as it deſerueth? He being God, would become man: hée being rich, would become poore: he being Lord of all the world, became a ſeruant to vs all: hée beeing immortall, would become mortall, miſerable, and taſte of all Gods curſes, yea, euen of hell it ſelfe for vs. His blood was nothing too deare, his life hee nothing conſidered, to bring vs from death to life.</p>
                  <p>But this his loue néedeth more heartie weighing, then many words ſpeaking: and therefore I omit and leaue it to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. So that in the receiuing of this Supper, as I would, you would tremble at Gods wrath for ſinne: ſo would I haue you to couple to that terrour and feare,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:82"/>
true faith, by which ye might be aſſuredly perſwaded of Gods mercie towards you, and Chriſts loue, though all things elſe preached the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Doe euery of you ſurely thinke, when you heare theſe words, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body, broken for your ſinnes: Drinke, this is my blood ſhedde for your ſinnes</hi>: That God the eternall Father embracing you, Chriſt calleth and cleppeth you moſt louingly, making himſelfe one with you, and you one with him, and one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongſt your ſelues.</p>
                  <p>You ought no leſſe to bee certaine now that God loueth you, pardoneth your ſins, and that Chriſt is all yours, then if you did heare an Angell out of heauen ſpeaking ſo vnto you. And therefore reioyce and bee glad, and make this Supper <hi>Eutharichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> a thankeſgiuing, as the Fathers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it. Be no leſſe certaine, that Chriſt and you now are all one, then you are certaine, the bread and wine is one with your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſubſtance, after you haue eaten and drunke it. Howbeit, in this it differeth, that you by faith are, as it were, changed into Chriſt, and not Chriſt into you, as
<pb facs="tcp:12952:82"/>
the bread is: for by faith he dwelleth in vs, and we in him. God giue vs faith in the vſe of this Sacrament, to receiue Chriſt, as hee giueth vs handes to receiue the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſimbole, and viſible Sacrament. God grant vs not to prepare our téeth and belly (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) but rather of his mercie, hee prepare and giue vs true and liuely faith, to vſe this and all other his ordinances to his glory and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. He ſweepe the houſes of our hearts, and make them cleane, that they may bée a worthy harborough and lodging for the Lord. Amen.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs come and looke on the third and laſt thing, namely,<note place="margin">Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted.</note> wherfore the Lord did inſtitute this Sacrament. Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is very obliuious of GOD, and of all his benefits. And againe, it is very full of dubitation and doubting of GODS loue, and of his kindneſſe. Therefore to the ende theſe two things might bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reformed and holpen in vs, the Lorde hath inſtituted this Sacrament: I meane, that wee might haue in memorie the principall benefite of all benefits, that is, Chriſtes death, and that wee might bee
<pb facs="tcp:12952:83"/>
on all parts aſſured of Communion with Chriſt, of all kindeneſſe, the greateſt that euer God did giue vnto man. The former to bée the ende, wherefore Chriſt did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute this Sacrament, hee himſelfe doeth teach vs, ſaying: <hi>Doe yee this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> The latter, the Apoſtle doeth no leſſe ſet foorth, in ſaying: <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the body of Chriſt? Is not the Cuppe of bleſsing, which wee bleſſe, the partaking or Communion of the blood of Chriſt?</hi> So that it appeareth, the ende wherefore this Sacrament was inſtituted, was and is, for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and help of our obliuion, of that which we ſhould neuer forget, and of our dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that whereof we ought to bee moſt certaine.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the former, namely, of the memorie of Chriſts death, what commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it bringeth with it, I will purpeſely for times ſake omit. Onely a little will I ſpeake of the commodities comming vnto vs, by the partaking and Communion wée haue with Chriſt. Firſt, it teacheth vs, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can communicate with Chriſt, but the ſame muſt néedes communicate
<pb facs="tcp:12952:83"/>
with Gods grace &amp; fauour, where through ſinnes are forgiuen. Therefore, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie commeth herethrough, namely, that we ſhould be certaine of the remiſſion and pardon of our ſinnes. The which thing we may alſo perceiue by the Cup, in that it is called the Cup of the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: to which Teſtament is properly attributed on God behalfe, obliuion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſinnes. Firſt, I ſay, therfore, the Supper is inſtituted to this end, that he which worthily receiueth, ſhould bee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the remiſſion and pardon of his ſinnes and iniquities, how many and great ſoeuer they be. Howe great a benefite this is, onely they knowe, which haue felt the burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinne, which of al heauy things, is the moſt heauy. Againe, no man can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with Chriſtes body and blood, but the ſame muſt communicate with his ſpirit, for Chriſts body is no dead carcaſe. Now he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth with Chriſts Spirite, communicateth as with holines, righteouſneſſe, innocencie, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and with all the merites of Chriſtes body: ſo doeth hee with GOD and all his glorie, and with the Church, and all
<pb facs="tcp:12952:84"/>
the good that euer it or any member of it had,<note n="*" place="margin">Note, though I apply this thus: yet I would not that any man ſhould thinke, that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munionem ſancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> in the Creed, is not ſet foorth there for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that which precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, namely, what the holy Catholique Church is.</note> hath, or ſhall haue: This is, <hi>The Communion of Saints,</hi> which we beleeue in our Creede, which hath wayting on it, Remiſſion of ſinnes, Reſurrection of the fleſh, and life euerlaſting.</p>
                  <p>To the ende that we ſhould be moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and certaine of all theſe, Chriſt our Sauiour did inſtitute this his Supper, and therefore would haue vs to vſe it. So that there is no man, I trowe, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not great cauſe of giuing thankes to God, for this holy Sacrament of the Lord, whereby if wée worthily receiue it, wée ought to bée certaine, that all our ſinnes whatſoeuer they bée, are pardoned cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: that wée are regenerate and borne againe into a liuely hope, into an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, immortall, vndefiled, and which can neuer wither away: that wee are in the fellowſhip of GOD the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt: that wée are Gods Temples, at one with God, &amp; God at one with vs: that wée are members of Chriſtes Church, and fellowes with the Saintes in all felicitie: that wee are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of immortalitie, in ſoule and body,
<pb facs="tcp:12952:84"/>
and ſo of eternall life: then which thing, what can bée more demaunded? Chriſt is ours, and we are Chriſtes, he dwelleth in vs, and wée in him. Oh happy eyes that ſée theſe things, and moſt happy heartes that feele them. My deare brethren, let vs pray vnto the Lord, to open our eyes to ſée theſe wonderfull things, to giue vs faith to féele them. Surely we ought no leſſe to bee aſſured of them, nowe in the worthy receiuing of this Sacrament: then wée are aſſured of the exteriour ſymboles and Sacraments. If an Angell from Heauen ſhould come and tell you theſe things, then would you reioyce and bée glad. And my deare hearts in the Lorde, I, euen nowe, though moſt vnworthy, am ſent of the Lorde to tell you no leſſe, but that you worthily receiuing this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall receiue remiſſion of all your ſinnes, or rather certainetie that they are remitted, and that you are euen now Gods darlings, Temples, and fellow inheritours of all the good that euer he hath. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſée that you giue thanks vnto the Lord for this his great goodneſſe, and prayſe his Name for euer.</p>

The Apoſtle willeth all men to prooue and examine themſelues, before they eate of the bread, and drinke of the Cup: for they that eate and drinke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthily, eate and drinke damnation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this probation and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſſarie. If men will try their golde and ſiluer, whether they bee copper or no: is it not more neceſſarie, that men ſhould trie their conſciences? Now, howe this ſhould bée, the Papiſts teach amiſſe, in ſending vs to their auricular Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is impoſſible. The true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and tryall of a Chriſtian conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, conſiſteth altogether in Faith and repentance. Faith hath reſpect to the
<pb facs="tcp:12952:85"/>
doctrine and Articles of our Beliefe: repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hath reſpect to maners and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Concerning the former, I meane of Faith, we may ſée the Apoſtle teacheth vs. <hi>2. Corinthians 11.</hi> Concerning the latter for our conuerſation, thoſe ſinnes which are commonly called mortall, or deadly, are to be remooued. Theſe ſinnes are diſcerned from other ſinnes, by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 6.</hi> in ſaying: <hi>Let not ſinne reigne and beare a ſwindge in you in your mortall bodies.</hi> For truely, then wée ſinne deadly, when wée giue ouer to ſinne, and let it haue the bridle at his libertie, when wée ſtriue not againſt it, but allowe it, and conſent to it. Howbeit, if we ſtriue againſt it, if it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe vs, then truely, though ſinne bée in vs (for we ought to obey GOD without al reſiſtance, or vnwillingneſſe) yet our ſinnes bee not of thoſe ſinnes, which ſeparate vs from God, but for Chriſts ſake ſhall not bée imputed vnto vs beléeuing.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, my dearely belooued, if that your ſinnes doe now diſpleaſe you, if you purpoſe vnfeinedly to bee enemies to ſinne in your ſelues and in others, as you may, during your whole life, if you
<pb facs="tcp:12952:86"/>
hope in Chriſt for pardon, if you beléeue according to the holy Scriptures and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian Faith, ſet foorth in your Creede: if I ſay, you now truſt in GODS mercy through Chriſts merits, if you repent, and earneſtly purpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to amend your life, and to giue ouer your ſelues to ſerue the Lorde in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of your life, although before this preſent, you haue moſt grieuouſly ſinned; I publiſh vnto you, that you are woorthy gheſts for this Table, you ſhall be welcome to Chriſt, your ſinnes ſhall be pardoned, you ſhall be endued with his ſpirit, and ſo with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him and the Father, and the whole Church of God, Chriſt will dwell in you, and you ſhall dwell in him for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, behaue your ſelues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, with ioyfulnes and thankeſgiuing. Doe you nowe appeare before the Lorde: make cleane your houſes, &amp; open the doores of your hearts by repentance &amp; faith, that the Lord of Hoſtes, the King of glory, may enter in: and for euer héereafter beware of all ſuch things, as might diſpleaſe the
<pb facs="tcp:12952:86"/>
eyes of his Maieſtie. Flie from ſinne, as from a Toade, come away from Poperie, and all Antichriſtian Religion, be diligent in your vocations, be diligent and earneſt in prayer, harken to the voyce of God in his word with reuerence, liue worthy your profeſſion. Let your light in your life ſo ſhine, that men may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. As you haue béene darkeneſſe, and followed the works of darkeneſſe, ſo now hence forth bee light in the Lord, and haue ſocietie with the woorks of light. Now hath God renewed his couenant with you, in Gods ſight now are you as cleane, and healed from all your ſores of ſinnes. Goe your wayes, ſinne no more, leaſt a worſe thing happen vnto you.

                  <p>God our Father, for the tender mercie and merits of his ſonne, bee mercifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, forgiue vs all our ſinnes, and giue

vs his holy ſpirit, to purge, cleanſe, and ſanctifie vs, that wee may bee holy in his ſight through Chriſt, and that we now may be made ready, and worthie to receyue this holy Sacrament, with the fruits of the ſame, to the full reioycing &amp; ſtrengthening of our hearts in the Lord. To whom be all honour and glory, world without ende. Amen.</p>
