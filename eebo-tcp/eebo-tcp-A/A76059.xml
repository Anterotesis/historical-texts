            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

eaſily underſtand.</p>
            <p>Theſe words of the Apoſtle, being part of the
cloſe of his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> are his <hi>Valedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or <hi>Parewel</hi> to them: It is not unknown to you,
that I muſt now be parted from you; and I have
pitched on this <hi>Scripture,</hi> to be the Cloſe of my
Twenty Years Miniſtry among you.</p>
            <p>God hath ſent me among you to be a <hi>Builder;</hi> and
I have choſen this Text, to be an <hi>Hammer</hi> to faſten,

enter into you.</p>
            <p>God hath ſent me among you, as a <hi>Fiſher-man;</hi>
and I have choſen theſe words to be as the <hi>cloſing of
the Net.</hi> Behold! once more the Net is ſpread,
and I am now making my laſt Draught; and oh that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151516:5"/>
it might have the ſame good ſpeed, as <hi>Peter</hi>'s laſt
had, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 6. It would then pay the Charges,
though the Net break.</p>
            <p>God hath ſent me among you as an <hi>Husband-man,</hi>
to plough, and to ſow; and I am now come <hi>to cover</hi>
what hath been ſown.</p>
            <p>What is my aim in Preaching, let be yours in
Hearing: Oh that both <hi>Preacher</hi> and <hi>Hearers</hi> might

1. <hi>Be ye Followers of me, as I am of Chriſt;</hi> that is,
either, I have been a Follower of Chriſt, be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Followers of me; or elſe, Be ye Followers of
me, as far forth as I have been a Follower of Chriſt.
Thoſe Miniſters may go off the Stage with Honour
and Comfort, who have left behind them the <hi>good
Seed</hi> of ſound Doctrine, and the <hi>good ſavour</hi> of an
Holy Example.</p>
            <p>For mine own part, what my Doctrine and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life hath been among you, you are Witneſſes,
and God alſo. And however, I have great reaſon to
judge and condemn my ſelf before the Lord, and to
bewail it, that my Converſation hath been leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
and uſeful, than, oh that it had been! yet I
go off from you, with this Teſtimony upon my
heart, that I have not been of thoſe who bind heavy
Burthens, and lay them on other mens ſhoulders, but
will not touch them with one of their fingers; but
my endeavour hath been, to preſs on mine own Soul,
and to hold out in my own practice, that Word of
Life which I have preached to you; and therefore
am bold, in this ſence, to exhort you, in the words of
the Apoſtle, <hi>Be ye Followers of me, as far forth as you
have ſeen me a Follower of Chriſt.</hi>

               <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Godly Miniſters, when they are part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from their People, would fain leave God behind
them. Though it be not unuſual, when the Lord ſends
them away, he goes with them; God and his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151516:6"/>
do not ſeldom take their farewel of People
together; yet their earneſt deſire is, that though they
muſt away, yet the Lord would ſtay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Faithful Miniſters would be <hi>Meſſengers
of Peace,</hi> going, as well as coming.</p>
            <p>As the Apoſtles firſt words were to be, <hi>Peace be
unto you,</hi> Matth. 10. ſo ſome of this Apoſtles laſt
words were, <hi>The God of Peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. When ever Miniſters part with their
People, if they can but leave Godlyneſs in them,
they ſhall certainly leave God with them. Or,</p>
            <p>Thoſe that obey the Goſpel, whatſoever, or whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they want, ſhall ever be in a peaceful, and
bleſſed condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe things do,</hi> that is, live in the practice and
power of that Doctrine of Godlineſs, <hi>which you have
received, and heard;</hi> and then fear not, the God of
Peace ſhall be with you.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine, I ſhall fully prove to you, after I
have premiſed,</p>
            <p>That the Doctrine which I have preached to you,
is the <hi>Doctrine of Godlineſs;</hi> the ſumme whereof take
in theſe four particulars:</p>
            <p>1. That Jeſus Chriſt, who came into the World
to ſave ſinners, came alſo to ſanctifie and purge them
from their ſins.</p>
            <p>2. That thoſe that believe in Jeſus, muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to maintain good Works, or to live a Godly
Life.</p>
            <p>3. That this Godlineſs is not ſuch a ſlight and
eaſie, and empty thing, as the miſtaken World ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
but ſtands in an exact Conformity of the
whole Man, Heart, and Life, to the whole Will of
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:151516:6"/>
4. That as whoſoever believes not in Jeſus, ſo
whoſoever is ſhort of this true, ſincere Godlineſs,
cannot be ſaved.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumme of that Doctrine, which I have
preached unto you; which being the Eternal Truth
of God, I herein imbarque my own Soul and Life,
deſiring to be found in that ſame Jeſus, and to be
found walking in that ſame way of Righteouſneſs,
which I have declared unto you.</p>
            <p>2. That my Deſign and Aim, in preaching this
Doctrine to you, hath been, to beget in you, and
through the influence and aſſiſtance of the Eternal
Spirit, to bring you to, this true Godlineſs. I have
travailed in Birth with you, that Chriſt might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in you; that I might leave you poſſeſſors and
partakers of that Grace, which accompanies Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that your Faith might ſtand not in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Men but in the power of God; That your
Repentance might be Repentance unto Life, not to
be repented of; that you might obey from the heart,
that Form of Doctrine that hath been deliver'd unto
you; that you might ſtand compleat in all the Will
of God; that you might be holy, and harmleſs, the
Children of God without rebuke, in the midſt of a
crooked Generation, amongſt whom you muſt ſhine
as Lights in the World, holding forth the Word of
Life; that being rooted, and grounded in love, you
might comprehend with all Saints, what is the height,
and depth, and length, and breadth, and might know
the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledg, and be
filled with all the fulneſs of God: To this end, have
I taught every one, and warned every one, that I
might preſent you perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:151516:7"/>
3. That as far forth, as the ſucceſs hath anſwered
my Deſign, and aim, upon any of your Souls, ſo far
forth ſtand you intitled, to this glorious promiſe in
the Text, <hi>the God of Peace ſhall be with you.</hi> Look how
many Souls there are amongſt you, that live in the
power and obedience of thoſe truths you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
to ſo many can I with confidence, give this
farewell of the Apoſtle, without Ifs, or Ands; the
God of Peace ſhall be with you. To whomſoever
the Lord hath been a God of <hi>Grace,</hi> to them will he
be a God of <hi>Peace.</hi> Whoever amongſt you, have
this God of Grace, dwelling and ruling in you, ſhall
certainly find this God of Peace, dwelling and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with you: As for all others, though I can hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
make this, my parting Prayer, the Lord be with
you, the God of Peace be with you; yet I cannot
turn this Prayer into a Promiſe, nor give you any
aſſurance, that the God of Peace will be with you.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, I ſhall now give you the
full proof of the Doctrine, in the following Reaſons.
The Doctrine you remember is, thoſe that obey the
Goſpel, whatſoever, or whomſoever they want, ſhall
ever be in a peacefull, and bleſſed Condition.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons are,

                  <item>1. The God of Peace ſhall be with them.</item>

            <p>

theſe things do, live in the obedience of the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which you have received, and the God of
Peace ſhall be with you. This glorious Promiſe is
pregnant with all the bleſſings, that Heaven and
Earth can afford.</p>
            <p>If you ask, why, what is there in it? I demanded
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151516:7"/>
of you, What is there in God? God is in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
all that is in God, is here aſſured to the Godly.
The <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> of old, attained to ſome glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

wayes.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Per viam Negationis,</hi> conceiving of him as a
Being, removed from all things, ſignifying imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
as ignorance, impotence, iniquity, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility,
compoſition, alteration, or any limits or
bounds of this Eſſence, Power and Glory.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Per viam ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſalitatis,</hi> conceiving of him, as
the Fountain of all other Beings; and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding,
that whatſoever Excellencies, or perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are ſcattered up and down, in the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are all united in him, from whom they had
their Original.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Per viam eminentiae,</hi> by way of Excellency; ſo
that whatever perfections, whatever goodneſs is to
be found in any Creature, though it be not to be
found in God, <hi>formaliter,</hi> yet there is that in him (he
being the firſt cauſe of all) that doth infinitely, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundantly
anſwer them all. Though there be not
the ſame Specifick Excellencies in him, nor thoſe
very pleaſures and delights iſſuing from him, which
the creatures yield; yet there are ſuch Excellencies,
ſuch perfections, as tranſcend and ſurpaſſe them all.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures tell us more poſitively, and
plainly; that God is Almighty, Omniſcient, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent,
Infinite, Eternal, Unchangeable, All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
Holy, Righteous, Gracious; the Portion, the
Protection, the Rewarder, yea the exceeding great
Reward of them that diligently ſeek him. And this
is he, that is in the promiſe. God is in the promiſe.
I muſt not inlarge in this ſpatious Field; I ſhall
keep nearer the Text, and ſhall confine my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151516:8"/>
ſelf to theſe four particulars.</p>
            <p>1. God is in the Promiſe, as the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> as
the Authour and beſtower of Peace. The greateſt of
Bleſſings, is the Bleſſing of Peace, Peace hath all
bleſſings included in it. It hath poſſeſſion, fruition,
and ſecurity; it hath plenty, pleaſure and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fety: where
there's no peace, there's no ſecurity for the holding,
nor opportunity of enjoying what we have. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
have, we have it as if we had it not. Peace is
the greateſt of Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Peace with God is the moſt glorious of Peace.
What is there that's excellent, what is there that's
deſirable, that is not comprehended in this Peace
with God? Where there's Peace, there's <hi>Pardon;</hi>
guilt cannot conſiſt with this Peace; <hi>being juſtified by
Faith, we have peace with God.</hi> Where there's <hi>Peace,</hi>
there's <hi>Grace,</hi> and holineſs; <hi>there's no Peace ſaith
my God, to the wicked.</hi> Where there's Peace, there's
<hi>Love,</hi> and good will. As love, ſo peace is the union
of hearts. The God of Peace is with you, ſignifies
no leſs then this; the Almighty God beares you
good will. Theſe two, peace and good will, are
Twins: <hi>On Earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> Where
there's peace, there's <hi>life</hi> everlaſting life; Internall,
is the ſeed of eternall, peace.</p>
            <p>This peace is a <hi>Portion;</hi> peace with God is our
poſſeſſion of the God of Peace: This peace is a
<hi>Sanctuary;</hi> if the God of Peace be with us, the
Peace of God will keep our hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld you muſt have trouble;
ſuppoſe you have, yet in him you ſhall have peace,
who hath overcome the World. Iſa. 26. 3. <hi>Thou
wilt keep him in perfect peace,</hi> (in peace, peace 'tis
in the Originall) <hi>whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee,</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151516:8"/>
85. 8. <hi>I will hear what the Lord God will ſpeak, he
will ſpeak peace to the People, and to his Saints.</hi> What
a clattering is there in the World? what tumults,
and commotions, are raiſed about the followers of
Chriſt; as if the World were falling about their
ears? The Devill ſpeaks wrath; evill men ſpeak
death, and bonds to them; breathing out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
reproaches, perſecutions againſt them. In
the midſt of all this fearful noyſe, Ile hearken, ſaith
the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> what the Lord God will ſpeak, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
men or Devils ſpeak, Ile hearken, if the Lord
God ſpeak at the ſame rate. Oh no, he will ſpeak
peace to his Saints: Let the Sons of contention do
what they can, the Sons of God ſhall be Sons of
Peace; they ſhall live in peace, they ſhall dye in
peace, they ſhall dwell in peace for ever. Iſa. 32. 17.
18. <hi>The work of Righteouſneſs ſhall be Peace, and the
effect of Righteouſneſs ſhall be quietneſs, and aſſurance
for ever. And my people ſhall dwell in a peaceable Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
and in ſure dwellings, and in quiet reſting pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi>
Oh how <hi>great is the peace that they have, who love
thy Law.</hi> Chriſtians fear not to follow God; let
not that ſad word, nor the fulfilling of it, ſcare you
out of your duty. <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt
Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi> What if they do?
wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leſt you are able to ſay, I am perſecuted, but I
have peace; I am poor, but I have peace; in a
Priſon, but I have peace; in a Wilderneſs, but I
have peace; though all the World be againſt me,
God is at peace, my Soul is in peace; what diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
ſhould all that be to you!</p>
            <p>2. He that is the God of peace, is the <hi>God of
power.</hi> He promiſes peace, and he promiſes no more
then he can perform. He can create peace, he can
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151516:9"/>
make their enemies to be at peace with them. He
can make a league for them, with the Beaſts of the
field; with the Lions, with the Wolves, with the
moſt brutiſh among the people. He can ſay to the
proud Winds and Waves, peace, be ſtill, and they
obey him. He can give them reſt [from] the dayes
of adverſity; he can give them reſt [in] the dayes
of adverſity; he can give his Beloved ſleep, upon
the points of Swords and Spears.</p>
            <p>3. He that is the God of peace, is the <hi>God of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi>
This is my great fear, that though God g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ves,
yet I ſhall break my peace; The God of peace with
me? oh! this is he whom I diſhonour, and diſoblige
daily; by my diſtruſts, diſcontents, impatiencies,
murmerings; and what peace to ſuch an heart? what
peace, ſo long as ſuch unbelief; ſo much iniquity, as
I find daily within me, remains upon me? Will he,
with whom no iniquity can dwell, dwell in that
heart, where there is ſo much iniquity, by which he
is provoked every day! but he that is the God of
peace, is alſo the God of patience; who though he
will not bear the iniquities of his adverſaries, yet he
will bear much with the infirmities of his People.
Pſal 89. 30. &amp;c. <hi>If his Children forſake my Law, and
walk not in my Judgments; if they break my Statutes, and
keep not my Commandements; then will I viſit their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
with a Rod, and their iniquities with ſtripes.
Nevertheleſs, my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take
from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. He that is the God of peace, is the <hi>God of
hope.</hi> I have no peace in poſſeſſion, whatever there
be in the promiſe. I live in the fire, am born a man
of contention. What likelyhood is there, that I
ſhould ever live to ſee a good day? my comforts
are broken, my Eſtate is loſt, my liberty is gone;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151516:9"/>
friends I have none, enemies I have many, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I dwell in <hi>Meſech,</hi> I have my habitation in the
Tents of <hi>Kedar;</hi> I am for peace, they are for War:
whither ever I look, round about me, before me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
me, on the right hand, or on the left, all ſpeaks
trouble and errour to me. I have no peace; What,
nor no hope of peace neither? where is thy God
man? haſt thou a God in thee, and yet no hope in
thee? the God of peace, and yet no peace! <hi>the
God of hope, and yet no hope! the God of hope will yet
fill thee with joy and peace in believing.</hi> Rom. 15. 13.
<hi>Why art th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

diſquieted within me? hope in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe
him, who is the health of my countenance and my God.</hi>
Pſal. 43. 11. The God of hope will open a <hi>Window
of hope</hi> in the darkeſt times, a <hi>door of hope</hi> in the moſt
deſperate caſes. The God of hope will bear up the
ſpirits of his Saints, in hope againſt hope; and this
hope will never diſappoint them. It ſhall never be
ſaid, there is no peace, there is no hope, till it can
be ſaid, there is no God in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how, or in what ſence, is it to be underſtood,
that this God of peace will be with us.</p>
            <p>I anſwer in 3. particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>heart of God</hi> will be with you. <hi>Joſephs</hi>
bleſſing, <hi>the good will of him that dwelt in the Buſh,</hi> will
be thy portion. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. what was that Buſh? the
Church, or <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. What caſe was the Buſh
in? 'twas all on a light fire; 'twas all in a flame.
Who was it that dwelt in the Buſh? God was in the
Buſh; And that kept it from conſuming, though not
from burning. The good will of this God ſhall be
with thee: his love, his favour, his care. <hi>I love
them that love me,</hi> Prov. 8. 17. <hi>The Lord loveth the

Righteous,</hi> Pſal. 146. 8. The love of God, is the
womb of all good. Hence ſprang <hi>the morning Star,</hi>
from the love of God came the Son of God; hence
came that <hi>womb of the morning,</hi> the bleſſed Goſpel;
which is ſo big with glorious grace; with light,
life, pardon, peace, glory, immortality; from the
love of God came the glorious Goſpel of God. <hi>The
upper Springs,</hi> all ſpiritual and heavenly bleſſings;
the <hi>nether Springs,</hi> all earthly and outward bleſſings
do all riſe, and bubble up out of this Fountain, <hi>the
love of God. The pretious things of Heaven, the pretious
Fruits brought forth by the Sun; the pretious Fruits
put forth by the Moon; the chief things of the antient
Mountains, the pretious things of the laſting Hills; the
pretious things of the Earth, and the fulneſs thereof;</hi>
All theſe flow in with the <hi>good will of him that dwelt
in the Buſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Love is all; the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. our
love to God, is <hi>the fulfilling of the Law;</hi> that is,
it will bring forth all that to God, all that duty, and
obedience, which the Law requires. I may tell you,
that Gods love to us, is <hi>the fulfilling of the Goſpel,</hi> that
is, it will powre down all that upon us, it will do all
that for us, which the Goſpel promiſes. Look over
the whole Goſpel; read, and ſtudy every pretious
leaf, and line of that bleſſed Book; and if there be
enough in all that, to make thee bleſſed, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
thee on in thy holy courſe, all this is thine.
Thou haſt that love of God with thee, which will
fulfill the Goſpel; there ſhall not one jot or tittle
fail thee, of all that the Goſpel promiſes. <hi>The zeal
of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this.</hi> Iſa. 9. 7.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>help of God</hi> will be with you, the Lord
will be your helper in the day of your diſtreſs.

            <p>There's no man, whoſe Caſe may not be ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
as to be above all humane help. If he ſhould
cry out, as the Woman to the King of <hi>Iſrael; Help

            <p>Fooliſh men count their caſe deſperate, when

to ſet forth the extremity and helpleſneſs of
any mans caſe. When we ſee men even loſt in any
miſery, and their caſe even utterly hopeleſs; then
to ſignifie our ſenſe of ſuch mens loſt condition, we
cry out, God help that man, God help that woman,
they are loſt Creatures. I, but if men did underſtand
and conſider what the help of the Lord is; they
would ſee there could be no caſe ſo deſperate, but
an Help Lord, might recover all: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6.
when <hi>David</hi> was greatly diſtreſſed, and all was gone,
<hi>he encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:151516:11"/>
Conſider here two things.</p>
            <p>1. What his Caſe then was; he was in great
diſtreſs; he had loſt all that ever he had; his ſpoils
that he had taken were all gone, his Corn, and his
Cattell, his Wives, and his City were all loſt; he
had not an habitation in all the World; he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left him but a poor Army, and theſe were
worſe than loſt, they were even ready to fall upon
him. <hi>The people ſpake of ſtoning him,</hi> but <hi>he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>What the event hereupon was; why God
help'd him to all he had again: verſ.</hi> 19. There was
nothing lacking to them, neither ſmall nor great, neither
ſons, nor daughters; neither ſpoil, nor any thing they had
taken, David recovered all.</p>
            <p>Hence note,</p>
            <p>1. That a Chriſtian when he hath loſt all, hath
yet a God to go to at laſt.</p>
            <p>2. Whileſt a Chriſtian hath a God to go to, his
caſe is never deſperate; let him but encourage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his God, and all will be recovered.</p>
            <p>Sinners, triumph not over the poor people of
God; when they are at their worſt, when they are
brought as low as your Pride and Malice can lay
them; though they ſhould be ſtript naked, and left
deſtitute of all their comforts, though all the World
ſhould ride on their backs, and tread on their necks,
yet rejoyce not againſt them: though they fall, they
ſhall ariſe; when they are at their worſt, there's
ſtill help for them in their God.</p>

they ſhall be <hi>Led</hi> in their way; and they ſhall be

            <p>1. Conduction; <hi>the Lord will be with them, to
lead them and guide them in the way that they
ſhould go.</hi> Pſal. 25. 9, 12. The Meek will he guide

O Lord, in thy righteouſneſs, becauſe of mine Enemies,
make thy way ſtrait before my face.</p>
            <p>The Lord leads his people in their way, chiefly
<hi>by his Word,</hi> which is a light to their feet, and a
lanthorn to their paths: And ſometimes alſo <hi>by his
Providences,</hi> hedging up all by-wayes, and leaving
but one way open to them, that hath the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the way of God. So ordering the matter,
that any other way that is before them, look; with
too foul a face, to leave any doubt upon them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that be the way of God or not.</p>
            <p>It's never uncomfortable to the people of God,
while they ſee their way before them: <hi>Doubts</hi> about
their way, are more perplexing, than <hi>dangers</hi> in
their way. When they know what God would have
them do, they can chearfully truſt him for any
thing they are like to ſuffer. Doſt thou meet with
Wolves or Lions in thy way? thou mayſt bleſs
God 'tis there thou meeteſt them, 'twould be ill

               </gap>l. 32. 7. [In the ſecret of thy preſence] the
Saints hiding place is a ſecret: Such, where neither
the pride of men can find them, nor can they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

perſecutions ſhall not find them, whoſe Souls are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151516:12"/>
hid in God: they are not found, when they are
found; they are hid when they ſeem to lye moſt
open, and moſt expoſed to mens will, and luſt.
Sinners do not underſtand what refuge the Saints
have in God. It is a great ſecret, a myſtery to them:
as the joy of the Saints, the comforts of the Saints,
are a ſecret; <hi>A ſtranger ſhall not meddle with his
joy:</hi> So is their ſafety or ſecurity; they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what kind, nor how great ſecurity; what
ſure, nor what ſweet repoſe, the Saints find in God.
The ſecret of God's preſence is a ſure, and a ſweet
reſting place, for all his Saints; but how ſure, and
how ſweet, no man knows, but they that enjoy it.
The <hi>ſecret intimations,</hi> of the care of God for them;
of his everlaſting kindneſs to them; of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hand, in all that befalls them, working it to their
greater good; the <hi>ſecret ſupports</hi> and refreſhings
darted in, as the beams of his Countenance; their
<hi>ſecret ſence,</hi> that their head, their main, is in ſafety,
though they have bruiſes in their heel, will yield
ſuch reſt in the day of greateſt adverſity, as men can
neither ſee, nor take from them. The Pillar of the
Cloud interpoſed, did both hinder the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
purſuit, and hide from their eyes, the comfort of
that light which ſhined upon the Camp of <hi>Iſrael.
Moſes</hi> knew what the comfort of God's preſence
meant, when he ſaid, <hi>Exod. 33. 15. If thy preſence
go not with us, carry us not hence.</hi> 'Tis (if conſidered)
a great word: <hi>Iſrael</hi> was then in a Wilderneſs;
among wild beaſts, among briars, and thorns, in a
weary pilgrimage; but they had God among them:
The Lord was carrying them to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land

<hi>Moſes</hi> prayes, <hi>If thy preſence go not with us, carry us
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151516:13"/>
not hence.</hi> We had rather be where we are, in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
with God, than go to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and leave our
God behind us. If thy preſence go with us, we are
willing to go; when thou wilt, whither thou wilt,
which way thou wilt; though by the Tents of <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
Iſhmaelites, Moabites, Hagarens;</hi> though
through the Armies of <hi>Anakims, Zamzummims:</hi>
wee'l go any whither, ſo God go with us. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God makes a <hi>Canaan</hi> worſe than a <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
the preſence of God makes a <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> better
than a <hi>Canaan:</hi> And this preſence of God, ſhall be
the Lott of all his Saints.</p>

you: All Providential Occurrences, and Events
whatſoever; all Difficulties, Straits, Diſaſters, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments,
whatſoever, that may come upon
you, ſhall make for your good. <hi>Rom. 8. 31. If God
be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> Who can be againſt
us! that is, None can be againſt us: Or if any be,
yet thoſe that are againſt you ſhall be for you. <hi>Gen.
42. 36. Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not</hi> (ſaid old <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob)</hi>
and muſt <hi>Benjamin</hi> away too! <hi>all theſe things are

all making for him. <hi>Rom. 8. 26. We know all things
ſhall work together for good to thoſe that love God.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. What thoſe things are, which are eſpecially
intended, in that comprehenſive term <hi>[All things.]</hi>
Some there are, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> with others, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it <hi>univerſally,</hi> of all things whatſoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good or evill, extending it even to the <hi>Sins of
the Saints.</hi> It's true, God doth often bring good our
of theſe evils; making uſe of former ſins, to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
againſt future: as the thorn, that did hurt in the
Garden, will be of uſe in the hedg; ſin often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
its own death, which was intended to be
the death of the Soul: There's nothing that doth
make the Sinner more weary, and wary of ſin, than
Sin it ſelf; the review of what we have done, doth
ofteneſt fright us from doing ſo any more. When
you look back on ſin, and ſee its face, (for ſin carries
its face in its back) you'l fear it the more, when ever
you meet it again. There's no argument doth more
effectually humble, and break the heart, and make
it more fearful, and watchful againſt ſin, than the
ſhame, and the ſmart of thoſe ſins we have fallen by:
he that hath felt the wound, will take heed how he
playes with edge-tools. This is true, God doth
often make this uſe of ſin, to be its own cure: and
therefore 'tis not ſeldom ſeen, that the <hi>chief of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
have come to be the <hi>chief of Saints.</hi> Yet, beſides,
that this is not the ſubject matter that the Apoſtle is
here treating of; let thoſe that bring ſin within the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151516:14"/>
compaſs of this promiſe, and make this to run into
the ſence of it; that even all the ſins of the Saints
ſhall work for their good, let ſuch tell us, how, or
in what way it's imaginable, that the <hi>ſinful decayes</hi> of
ſuch who backſlide from God, and never recover to
their former life, and vigour, but live and die in a
languiſhing ſtate of Soul; let them tell us, how ſuch
ſins can be imagined to work for their good: till
then, we muſt enter our diſſent from this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>This then is not the ſence of the promiſe, that all
ſins ſhall work together for good.</p>
            <p>And yet if it were, it would be but a poor argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to take the more liberty to ſin, becauſe God
will turn it to good; this would be even as rational,
as for a man to tear his fleſh, break his bones, pluck
out his eyes, burn his houſe, &amp;c. becauſe God will
turn all his ſuffering to good: he is little better than
mad, that would not conclude ſuch a man out of his
Wits.</p>
            <p>Others reſtrain it to the <hi>evill things</hi> that befall
the Saints; not the <hi>turpia,</hi> but the <hi>triſtia,</hi> their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and afflications; to that vanity, and thoſe vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they are in bondage under, and under which,
with the whole Creation, they groan and travail in
pain, waiting for their redemption; of which, the
Apoſtle had been treating in the former part of the
Chapter. And yet while they pitch the ſence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
on ſuch things as theſe; they grant it may be
extended to all other things, ſin only excepted; <hi>ad
omnes res, creaturas, eventus, tum ſecundos, tum adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos:</hi>
To all things and events, whether proſperous
or afflicting. So <hi>Paraeus,</hi> with others.</p>
            <p>And theſe I take to have hit the right. All heavy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151516:14"/>
things, all the ſufferings and afflictions of the Saints;
and not only theſe, but all things elſe whatſoever,
that in the whole courſe of Providence be their lot
or portion: all the dealings of God with them, all
the diſpenſations of Providence towards them, ſhall
all work for their good.</p>
            <p>2. What is that good, which theſe things work
to the Saints; or in what ſence all things may be
ſaid to work good to them. The ſence in generall
is this; They ſhall all work to their welfare; they
ſhall all happen to them for the better: there ſhall
nothing befall them, but one time or other, they ſhall
have reaſon to ſay; 'Twas well for me, that it was
thus with me. The wiſdom and goodneſs of God,
did cut out ſuce portions continually for me, did
lead me thorow ſuch a <hi>ſeries</hi> and ſucceſſion of caſes
and events, which though I could not underſtand,
yet now I ſee that every condition, every contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
and occurrence of my life, through which
Providence led me, was uſeful, and could not well
have been wanted, but it would have been the worſe
for me. Thus in the generall.</p>
            <p>Particularly, for the fuller underſtanding what
good it is that all things to, conſider, That there is
a Twofold good of the Saints; Such as they obtain
and enjoy, whileſt they are <hi>in via,</hi> in their way or
Courſe; or ſuch as they ſhall obtain, when they are
<hi>in termino:</hi> when they are gotten to the end of their
way, when they are come to their place. Or thus;
There is a Three-fold good of the Saints,

                  <item>Temporall.</item>
                  <item>Spirituall.</item>

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Temporall good,</hi> or our <hi>bona corporis,</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151516:15"/>
good things of this life, which may ſerve,
and pleaſe, and delight us in theſe dayes of our pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage;
which may abide with us, and attend us
to our graves, but there will take their leave of
us.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Spirituall good,</hi> or our <hi>bona animae,</hi> and thoſe
are either, 1. External, as the Ordinances of God;
the Light, Liberties, and priviledges of the Goſpel;
the Society, and Communion of Saints, and our
peaceful and plentiful enjoying of them. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
as ſpiritual Grace, Faith, Love, Hope, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Eternal good,</hi> or that glory and joy, that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
reſt and peace, the poſſeſſion of that Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
incorruptible, and undefiled, that is reſerved
in Heaven for us.</p>
            <p>Now here note theſe things.</p>
            <p>1. That our <hi>bona corporis,</hi> our outward good
things, are only good <hi>for us,</hi> as they are conducible
<hi>ad bonum ſpirituale,</hi> to the good of our Souls. The
<hi>bona viae,</hi> are only good in the event, when they tend
to the <hi>bonum Patriae.</hi> This World is but a Nurſery
for Eternity; we are planted in this, in order to
our tranſplanting into the other World; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we have here, is either good, or evill, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the reſpect that it bears to hereafter: As far
forth as our immortal part is improved by theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
things, ſo far forth onely are they good for
us. He that hath this Worlds goods, and is not
hereby made more rich towards God; he who
proſpers in this World, and yet his Soul doth not
proſper; much more, he whoſe worldly fulneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the emptineſs, and leanneſs of his Soul:
Are theſe good things good for him? Is he in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151516:15"/>
upon a true account, whoſe Soul proſpers
not? It is not ever good to proſper in the World;
it cannot be univerſally ſaid, It's good to be rich,
it's good to be in health, it's good to be in honour,
it's good to be at liberty; the contrary may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be true; it's good to be poor, to be ſick, to
be in diſgrace, to be in bonds; the neceſſity of our
Souls doth not ſeldom require it: Then alone is it
good to be full, and to abound, when our outward
abundance farthers our ſpiritual welfare.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, could we receive this truth, That our
outward good things are only good for us, as far
forth as they conduce to our ſpiritual good; could
we receive this truth, and live under the power of
it; what a different judgment ſhould we then
have of all theſe worldly matters, from what we
have? and how ſtrangely would the courſe of this
world be then changed? Would there then be ſuch
violent and eager purſuing theſe carnal things?
Would there then be ſuch whining, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and murmuring at every croſs providence?
We would then ſay, This may be good for me; good
for my Soul, how ſad ſoever it looks.</p>
            <p>2. That external ſpiritual good things, the Miniſtry,
and Ordinances of the Goſpel, &amp;c. are ſo far good to
us, as they conduce to our internal ſpiritual good:
and they being ordinarily ſo, it muſt be concluded,
That ordinarily it is good for us, that we enjoy them,
and be not deprived of them. God may ſee the
cutting Chriſtians ſhort of thoſe priviledges, and
Liberties, to be ſometimes needful for them; and
then even this alſo makes for their good: Whereof
more anon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:151516:16"/>
3. That our inward ſpiritual good, is good for
us, ſo far forth as it tends to our eternal good: and
therefore grace is ever good for us. It's ever true;
It's good to be holy, good to be humble, to be in
the fear of God, and to flouriſh in his grace. We
may have too much Money, too much Credit, but
we can never have too much grace. Our greateſt
flouriſhing and fruitfulneſs in grace, will certainly
abound to our more full reward.</p>
            <p>4. Note, That this is the plain ſence, and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the promiſe, <hi>All things ſhall work [for good,]</hi>
that is, Whatſoever befalls, ſhall certainly promote
our internal, and eternal welfare; And as far forth
as the outward Priviledges of the Goſpel, yea, and
the good things of this life, conduce towards this,
all ſhall work for theſe alſo. If it be good for us to
rich, if it be good for us to be in honour, good for
us to be at liberty; good for our Souls, good in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to our eternal ſtate; if it be good for us that
we enjoy the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; there ſhall
nothing befall us, that ſhall hinder; there ſhall be
nothing wanting to us, that might further this our
good.</p>
            <p>The Summe is, That all providential diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhall be ſo ordered, that we ſhall want nothing
but what it's better want than have: We ſhall uffer
nothing but what we cannot well be without, but
what the good of our Souls requires; and that
which we do poſſeſs, and that which we do ſuffer,
ſhall not fail of bringing about its end, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
our eternal good.</p>
            <p>And if this be the meaning, what a glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is this? What can any rational man deſire
more? nothing ſhall befall him but ſhall be for his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151516:16"/>
good: He ſhall be deprived or kept ſhort of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what he had better be without than have.
He that is unſatisfied with this Promiſe, it is either
from <hi>Luſt</hi> or <hi>Unbelief;</hi> Either he doth not believe,
that God is true, and will perform this Word: or
elſe 'tis becauſe his Luſt muſt be ſatisfied, though
with the denyal of his Reaſon and Intereſt; he that
deſires an Eſtate in the World, Eaſe, Pleaſure, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
or any thing elſe upon any other terms, but as
they may be for his reall good, hath as much loſt his
Wits as his Faith: and he that will take upon him
to know what's good for him, better than God, may
as well take upon him to govern the World. You
may with as good reaſon, deſire a Feaver, or a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
that you may have the pleaſure of your drink;
as for the pleaſures that carnal things would bring
you in, to deſire them, when they would be a ſnare
to your Souls.</p>
            <p>3. To whom theſe things ſhall work for good;
<hi>To them that love God,</hi> to them that are <hi>called accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his purpoſe:</hi> To the people of God; who,
you ſee, are here deſcribed by their <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
[the <hi>called according to his purpoſe</hi>] and their
<hi>Sanctification,</hi> [they <hi>that love God,</hi>] <hi>Love is,</hi> as I
told you before, <hi>the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Love God,
and you will live in the obedience of his whole
Will: Theſe are the people, to whom this Promiſe
is made; prove your Calling and Election, prove
your Sanctification, and you may write your names
in this glorious Promiſe; <hi>All things ſhall work for
your good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To thoſe that are Rebels, and Reprobates from
God, all things ſhall work together for evil. Whil'ſt
things hurtful work together for good to the Saints;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151516:17"/>
all good things work together for the hurt of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
their Peace hurts them, their plenty hurts
them, their pleaſure hurts them; yea, both their
proſperity, and adverſity; their plenty, and their
poverty; their pleaſure, and their trouble; their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and diſgrace, every thing that befalls them,
turns to their prejudice. Their proſperity deſtroy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them; their Table is their ſnare; their pleaſures are
their plagues; and their very puniſhments are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into ſin: every thing that befalls them, heightens
and hardens them in their wickedneſs, and ripens
them for vengeance. God is not with them, and
therefore nothing proſpers with them. God is with
his Saints, and therefore nothing comes amiſs to
them, but all for their greater advantage: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
this is your <hi>portion,</hi> and your <hi>peculiar,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the men of this World ſhall neither partake with
you, nor be ever able to deprive you of it.</p>
            <p>4. How all things ſhall work for their good; in
ſpecial, how ſhall the <hi>evill things,</hi> the Sufferings of
this life be for their good: How can this be? Muſt
we disbelieve our Senſes, lay down our Reaſons,
ere we can believe the Scriptures? Muſt we call
evil, good; and good, evil? Muſt we count dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
light, and light darkneſs? Is pleaſure pain, and
pain pleaſure? Is loſs gain, and gain loſs? Is eaſe
torment, and torment eaſe? Doth Religion make
things ceaſe to be what they are, and to be what
they are not? or at leaſt, Muſt we believe, that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is the <hi>Mother</hi> of light, that good is the <hi>daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of evil? Can we gather grapes of thorns, or figs
of thiſtles? Can darkneſs give light, or death it ſelf
bring forth life? Muſt we ſay, that contraries no
longer deſtroy, but produce each other, and that the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151516:17"/>
womb brings forth its own deſtruction? How can
theſe things be?</p>
            <p>But muſt God give a Reaſon of his actions, or
elſe they are not! though evil cannot bring forth
good, darkneſs cannot bring forth light; yet, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
God bring forth good out of evill, light out of
darkneſs? Though darkneſs cannot bring forth light;
evil cannot bring forth good, by a natural cauſation;
yet, Cannot God make evil an occaſion of good?
Though it do not work <hi>efficiently,</hi> yet can it not work
<hi>objectively</hi> neither to it? Though the torment the
Medicine puts men to, be not eaſe yet, May it not
work towards eaſe? May not the ſtorm, though it
help not, yet haſten the Labourer on his work, the
Traveller on his way? May not the darkneſs of the
night, make more diligent in the day? May not
ſickneſs teach men more temperance, and poverty
more frugality?</p>
            <p>But to proceed more diſtinctly; How can the
Saints evil things work to their good? That they
do ſo, cannot be denyed, unleſs we will deny, not
only Scripture, but common Senſe, and Experience;
but how comes it to paſs?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, in 4. Particulars:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Afflictions and Tribulations of the Saints
are</hi> the way <hi>that leads them on to the poſſeſſion of
that good, which God hath intended to them; affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are the way of the Kingdom; the Croſs is
the way to the Crown.</hi> Acts 14. 22. Through many
Tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 11, 12. Thou broughteſt us into the net, thou
haſt laid affliction upon our loyns, thou haſt cauſed men
to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water,
thou broughteſt us into a wealthy place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:151516:18"/>
Obſerve it; Their Troubles are their way to their
Triumph; their very falling into the net, their way
to eſcape. Their Enemies boaſt; Eſcape! Ariſe!
yes, let them free themſelves with ſuch hopes while
they will, we have them ſure enough, we have them
under foot, we have them in the net: If this be their
way, wee'l keep them in their way long enough;
now we have them down, they ſhall not be able to
riſe. I, but yet it appears, through all this the Lord
led them forth into a wealthy place. The High-way
of the proud is not their more ready way to the
duſt, than the duſt of Saints is their ſure way to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
When <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to go to <hi>Canaan,</hi> they
muſt take the Brick-Kilnes, the Red Sea, the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<hi>Jordan,</hi> in their way: Could any one have
imagined, that the bondage, the ſtraits they were
under, the doubling their Tasks, the cruelty of their
Task-Maſters, their encloſure at the Red Sea, did
mean any good to them? yet, How fell it out at laſt?
their darkeſt diſpenſations had light in their latter
end; Their greateſt bondage leads on to their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
liberty.</p>
            <p>Every croſs Providence, is a ſtep to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of the Promiſe; the Wheel is ever mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on to its end; it moves ſtill forwards, even
when it ſeems to go quite backwards: As the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
by its many turnings and windings, forwards and
backwards, is ſtill in motion to the Sea, when it
ſeems to be running quite contrary.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, if ever the Salvation of God ſeems to
be removed farther off from you; if the work of
God ſhould at any time ſeem to go backwards; if
croſs Winds ſhould turn the whole courſe, ſo that
you appear rather to be marching back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> than
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151516:18"/>
on to <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet be not diſcouraged; though your
way be an unlikely, and unpromiſing way, though
you be led about forwards, and backwards, yet ſtill
you are making on: though the leſſer Wheels be
never ſo croſs and contrary in their motions, yet
the great Wheel is ſtill moving Right on to your
bleſſed and hoped end. God intends your good,
your ſpiritual good here, your eternal good here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
and believe it now, for he will let you ſee it
hereafter, that thoſe very things which moſt threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
your miſcarriage, and a total abortion of your
hopes, are made all to concur to the bringing them
about, and to your more full and ſpeedy poſſeſſion
of them.</p>
            <p>Note farther here two Things.</p>
            <p>1. All things work; not they ſhall work, <hi>de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo,</hi>
but <hi>de preſenti,</hi> they do work; as the Apoſtle
ſays, <hi>The Myſtery of Iniquity;</hi> ſo we may ſay, <hi>The
Myſtery of the Saints Redemption doth already work;</hi>
the work is already on the wheel, and every wheel is
in its motion for you: not onely your <hi>Brethren;</hi> the
<hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> who all are praying for your
peace, and ſeeking your good, but your <hi>Enemies</hi> alſo,
the <hi>Dragon,</hi> with all his Armies, are at work for you;
all <hi>the Councils</hi> of this World, are already ſitting upon
the very <hi>matter:</hi> God hath call'd them together for
this purpoſe, the <hi>Pope,</hi> with all his <hi>Conclave;</hi> the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
Prieſts, Monks,</hi> and <hi>Friars,</hi> with all their <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents;</hi>
yea, the <hi>Devil,</hi> with all his <hi>Conclave</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi>
are all at work for the good of <hi>Saints.</hi> It's true, they

are againſt you; they count, they are working for

are all united in their End; they jointly contribute
to the Weal of the <hi>Saints.</hi> Though, if I miſtake not,
this latter be the more ſence of the two: Yet I know
no reaſon, why both may not be underſtood. In the
hand, and under the conduction of <hi>Providence,</hi> all
theſe lower Things concur and co-operate in the
good of the Church.</p>
            <p>By the way, obſerve, what an Harmony there is, in
all the Works of <hi>Providence:</hi> The moſt croſs and
thwarting <hi>Occurrences,</hi> do all conſpire, and go hand in
hand, to bring about the ſame End. As the differing
Vertues of various Drugs, do all concur to make up
the Medicine: As the differing ſounds of ſeveral
ſtrings or Inſtruments, do altogether make up the
Melody: As the differing Colours in a Picture, the
dark as well as the brighter, do jointly contribute to
the Beauty of the Piece; no leſs do the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and contradictory Actions and Events, both
make up the Beauty of <hi>Providence,</hi> and jointly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that one End, to which, by an unſeen Hand,
and an all-ſeeing Eye, they are directed, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>evill things</hi> that befall the <hi>Saints,</hi> come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them <hi>to keep out worſe things.</hi> Where ever the croſs
comes, if it had not come, ſomething worſe might?
The <hi>Croſs</hi> may be a means to ſecure from the <hi>Curſe:</hi>
The <hi>Curſe</hi> was ſlain on the <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and our
Croſs alſo hath its uſe, to the delivering us from
it.</p>
            <p>1 Cor. 11. 32. <hi>We are chaſtened of the Lord, that
we ſhould not be condemned with the World; Periiſsem
niſi periiſſem:</hi> I had died, if I had not ſuffer'd: 'Tis
more mens caſes, beſides his that ſpake it; 'tis no

3. The <hi>evill things</hi> of the <hi>Saints, prepare them for
better things;</hi> That they may work good for them, they
are working them to good; working out their ſinne
and iniquity, wearying them of ſin, <hi>Hoſea 2. 6. I will
hedge up her way with Thorns, then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will
return:</hi> Sin brought in Afflictions into the World,
and Afflictions help to carry ſin out; the Croſs, to
which Sin was once nail'd, is now nail'd to Sin: The
<hi>Saints</hi> can ſeldom be medling with Sin, but they find
it too heavy for them; The Croſs, that is nail'd at
the farther end of it, makes it a Burthen which they
cannot bear. In ſome ſence, not onely the Bloud
of the Lamb, but the Bloud of the Sheep may purge
away Sin; though onely the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
may have their place, in purging away the filth of
ſin: <hi>By this ſhall the Iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, and
this is all the fruit to take away his ſinne.</hi> Our Lord
beats the Devil with his own Weapons, by thoſe
very means, <hi>purging</hi> his <hi>Saints,</hi> by which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to <hi>pollute</hi> them; making thoſe very <hi>Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
by which he labours to <hi>force</hi> them from <hi>Holineſs,</hi>
to <hi>fix</hi> them in it: A <hi>fawning World</hi> does them more

               </gap>chief, than a <hi>fuming Devil,</hi> By that the Devil
hath caſt up his Cards, he will find himſelf a Loſer
by all his Rage.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, comfort your hearts; thoſe Flouds

            <p>Oh Chriſtians! what a comfort would it be, if
your <hi>Experiences</hi> might come in, and ſeal to this
Truth: If you could ſay, Thus it hath been with me;

the <hi>Saints,</hi> never think to debauch them by it; if that
be your aim, you miſtake your courſe; the living
Spark which God hath kindled in them, will not be
blown out, but be blown up, by your puffing at it; the
Dirt you caſt upon them, doth but ſcour them the
brighter: You take the beſt courſe you can, to keep
them cloſer to the Lord, and his way: The warm
Sun, will more hazard the loſs of their Garments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of the Lord within them, will be too hard for Hell,
with all its black Regiments; and will not onely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them, but advance them yet higher, by all their
Aſſaults. Theſe Stars ſhine the brighteſt, when the
Night is darkeſt: When you have done your worſt,
'twill be the better with them; though they will not
thank you, yet they will thank God, for what they
have ſuffer'd by you. If this be your aim, to make
them like your ſelves, you may ſet your hearts at
reſt, and give over ſuch a vain attempt: Your fury is
like to do as little to force them, as your vertues are
to invite them to a compliance with you. Your Faces
are too <hi>foul</hi> to draw them into your love, and yet not
<hi>fierce</hi> enough to drive them into your fear. <hi>Sathan,</hi>

Conſcience, and their Integrity, and Faithfulneſs to

            <p>By this time Chriſtians, you ſee what Glory there
is in this good Word: <hi>All things ſhall work together
for good to them that love God.</hi> And that none may
have the Face to ſay all this is but conceit; I ſhall, in
the next place, bring in clear, and undeniable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that it is certainly, and unqueſtionably, ſo as
hath been ſaid: And therefore know,</p>
            <p>5. That all things do, and ſhall certainly work,
<hi>for good to them that love God.</hi> This (beſides the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of this Scripture) I ſhall make evident,
from theſe three Propoſitions:</p>
            <p>1. There is a <hi>Divine Providence</hi> that governs the
World.</p>
            <p>2. The Deſign of <hi>Providence,</hi> is the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the good purpoſe and promiſe of God.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Providence</hi> of God ſhall never fail of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
its End.</p>
            <p>1. There is a <hi>Divine Providence</hi> which governs
the World; the <hi>Epicur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and leave all on <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> may as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that there is a God, which yet they are aſham'd
to ſtand to. Of <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf it was ſaid, <hi>Quem
nihil pudendum pudet, pudet tamen Deum negare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It can be no way reconcileable to the infinite
Wiſdom of God, who made this Glorious Fabrick,
with the various Creatures therein, either not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
them to their Ends, or elſe to take no care
for their accompliſhing thoſe Ends they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to. The whole Current of Scripture is ſo

plain in theſe matters, that he that runs may read:

and his Dominion ſhall be even unto the End:
He delivereth and reſcueth, and he worketh Signs and
Wonders in Heaven, and Earth; who hath delivered
<hi>Daniel</hi> from the power of the Lions.</p>
            <p>But more diſtinctly, the Lord governs <hi>all inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

He giveth Snow like Wooll, and ſcattereth

duſt of he Earth, are all at his beck.</p>
            <p>More eſpecially, he rules an governs <hi>the men of
this World.</hi> He ſits in all the <hi>Counſels of men,</hi> though
they ſee him nor; he orders all <hi>their Decrees;</hi> there's
no Decree can paſſe, unleſs God gives his Vote. He
rules in all the <hi>actions of men;</hi> even thoſe things that
are acted through our improvidence, come not to
paſſe without the Providence of God. He rules in
all the <hi>changes that are in the World;</hi> he changes the
times, and the ſeaſons; he changes Kingdoms, and
Governments; he removeth Kings, and ſetteth up
Kings; he make War, and creates Peace; he bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Bow, and he breaketh the Bow, and cutteth
the Speare in ſunder, and burneth the Chariots in the
fire: Peace, and War, Health and Sickneſs, Plenty
and Famine, Life and Death, are all the diſpoſures
of his hand. He orders all <hi>the events and cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of the World; even from the greateſt to the
ſmalleſt. Without him, not a Sparrow ſhall fall, nor
a hair of the head ſhall periſh: though there be to
men, yet to the Lord there are no cauſalities, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies.
But all things come to paſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as his Hand and Counſel had before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:151516:23"/>
2. The deſign of Providence (as it reſpects the
Elect) is the accompliſhment of Gods good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and promiſe. Providence governs the World,
and the purpoſe and promiſe governs Providence.
All the works of Providence have <hi>rationem mediorum
ad finem.</hi> God doth nothing in vain; it is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with the wiſdom of God, to do any thing for
nothing. God would have his People look farther
than to the things that are before them, becauſe all
thoſe things have a farther aſpect themſelve. All
the works of Providence have a double aſpect; they
look <hi>backward,</hi> to the purpoſe and promiſe; and they
look <hi>forward,</hi> to the end for which they are; as they
look backward, ſo they have <hi>truth</hi> in them, exactly
anſwering the purpoſe and promiſe from which they
have their birth. As they look forwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, to their end,
ſo they have <hi>good</hi> in them; and that good (their
ſubſervience to their end) is the reaſon of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Here note 2. things.</p>
            <p>1. That the ſubſerviency of things to their end,
is the goodneſs of them; if the end be good, the
means muſt (as ſuch) be good alſo; If what <hi>God</hi> hath
purpoſed and promiſed be good, then all things that
fall in between, having the reſpect of means to their
accompliſhment, muſt upon that account be good.
If our croſſes and afflictions, do ſubſerve the bringing
about of Gods good will, and good word, we muſt
ſay concerning them, <hi>Good are the Works of the Lord.</hi>
It is not, how any thing looks, or feels at preſent, but
what it meanes, and to what it tends. If the potion
be bitter, and yet it tends to health; if the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
be ill-looked, and ill-favoured, and yet comes
upon a good errand, you may bid them welcom. And
thus all the Providences of God are good. If you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:151516:24"/>
ſhould ask of any Providence, wherefore art thou
come? <hi>comeſt thou peaceably?</hi> comeſt thou for good?
they muſt all anſwer, <hi>yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peaceably,</hi> for good and no
hurr. 'Tis but to help all that good into thy hand,
which hath been in the heart, and hath proceeded
out of the mouth, of thy God that loves thee. There
is not a <hi>Meſſenger of Sathan,</hi> that comes to buffet
thee, but is alſo a <hi>Meſſenger from-God,</hi> that comes to
thee for good. They very thorns in thy fleſh ſhall
ſerve thee for Playſters, thine eye-ſores ſhall be
thine eye-ſalve, and thy very maladies thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
            <p>2. That this relative goodneſs of all the works of
Providence, is the reaſon of their being. Therefore
God doth what he doth, that hereby he may do what
he hath ſaid and intended. I do not ſay that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Gods taking this or that me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns, is alwayes
from any thing in it ſelf, or for its natural tendency
to ſuch an end above any thing elſe; God hath his
choice of means, he can chuſe here or there at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
can make uſe of what he will to ſerve his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
but the reaſon why things are, is this, God
in his Wiſdom, ſaw their <hi>ordinability</hi> to this good
end, and thereupon in his Providence, he <hi>orders</hi> and
brings them to paſſe.</p>
            <p>So that now, what ever befalls a Chriſtian, he
hath this to allay and take off the grievouſneſs and
ſharpneſs of it; This had never been, but for the
good will, and good word of the Lord to me. The
Lord God hath ſaid he will bleſs me, and do me
good; he will heal me, and ſanctifie, and ſave me,
and now he is about it; by this, he is working that
Salvation for me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:151516:24"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> you have no reaſon to ſay, If the Lord
be with me, why am I thus? why ſo poor, why ſo
pained, why ſo perſecuted, ſo ſcorned and trampled
upon? ſure, if the Lord had meant my good, it
would have been better then 'tis with me: No, no,
'tis becauſe the Lord is with thee, and means thee
well, that he deals in this manner with thee. The
Deſign of his Providence towards thee, is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of his Promiſe.</p>
            <p>3. The Providence of God ſhall never fail of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
its end. There is nothing wanting that
might give us the fulleſt aſſurance hereof. For,</p>
            <p>1. The Providence of God hath <hi>power</hi> with it.
He is the Almighty that hath promiſed; he that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in the Earth, dwelleth in the Heaven, and doth
whatſoever he will. <hi>Our God is in Heaven, and doth
whatſoever he will. I will work, and who ſhall let it?
Iſ.</hi> 43. Who can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What
doeſt thou? were it not for our unbelief, our caſe
would be ſtill the ſame, in greateſt difficulties, as
when the Coaſts are moſt clear. We might ſay of
difficulties, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> of darkneſs; <hi>there is no
darkneſs with thee, to the the day and night are both
alike.</hi> Difficulties are no difficulties with thee, nor
is there difference betwixt hard and eaſie. He can
ſave with many, or with few; and with none, is as
well as with ſome. We once read he had too many,
but never that he had too few, to bring about his
work. Oh how do we diſparage the power of God,
when our difficulties make us doubt? Is he God,
and nor man? Is he ſpirit and not fleſh? Wherefore
then doſt thou doubt? Whatever God hath ſaid he
can do: Believe he is a God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thou wilt never
ſay, How can theſe things be?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:151516:25"/>
2. The Providence of God hath <hi>Wiſdom</hi> with it;
he is the onely wiſe, he is the all wiſe God; <hi>He
knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.
2 Pet.</hi> 2. 9. He knoweth what is good for his Saints,
and when 'twill be in ſeaſon; he underſtandeth what
is proper, and pertinent to every caſe. What's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to every purpoſe, to every people, to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and for every ſeaſon; he knowes when 'tis a
ſeaſon to abate, and when to exalt; when to afflict,
and when to deliver; when to put on the yoak, and
when to take off the yoak; When to pull down, and
when to build up; every thing is beautiful in its
ſeaſon. If mercies come <hi>out of ſeaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> mercies would
be no mercies; and if troubles come <hi>in their ſeaſon,</hi>
troubles ſhould be no troubles; He knowes the beſt
method, and means to his end; the fineſt means; he
ſees ſometimes, the unfitteſt to be the fitteſt; the
moſt unlikely unpromiſing means, do often beſt ſerve
Gods end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if you would receive every diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as coming from the hands of the wiſe God; you
would never quarrel with your lot, nor ſay of any

thou haſt afflicted me.</hi> Pſal. 119. Not onely in thy
faithfulneſs thou haſt ſaved me, in thy faithfulneſs
thou haſt comforted me, in thy faithfulneſs thou haſt
ſuccoured me; but in thy faithfulneſs thou haſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
me; in thy faithfulneſs thou haſt humbled,
and broken me, and caſt me down. The promiſe of
God is, that we ſhall want nothing; we ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
want his Staffe, nor his Rod; neither comforts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151516:26"/>
nor croſſes; neither joys nor ſorrows; we cannot
well want either, and we ſhall want neither, becauſe
God is faithful. You may not onely write down
with the Apoſtle, <hi>God is faithfull, and will not ſuffer
you to be tempted above that which you are able to bear;</hi>
but you may write alſo, God is faithful, and will not
ſuffer you to want a temptation. When 'tis ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,

for a ſeaſon you ſhall be in heavineſs. God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
he will ever be true to himſelf, and therefore to
you. 2 Tim. 2. 9. <hi>He abideth faithfull, he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
himſelf.</hi> Should he be falſe to his People he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be true to himſelf, to his purpoſe and promiſe;
his Word is not yea and nay. God is not as a man,
that he ſhould lye, or the Son of man, that he ſhould
repent; that he ſhould ſay, and unſay; that he
ſhould ſay, and not do; you may write Gods name
upon every word he hath ſpoken, you may write his
Name [I Am] upon all that he hath ſaid: It
ſhall be.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſtians, put theſe three Particulars to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and if you cannot ſpell out the concluſion
out of them, <hi>the Providence of God will certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
his good Purpoſe and Promiſe concerning you:</hi>
You are of little Underſtanding as well as of little
Faith.</p>
            <p>If God governs the World, and nothing comes to
paſs but by his Providence; if Providence governs
according to Gods Purpoſe and Promiſe; if Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
cannot fail of accompliſhing both;</p>
            <p>If God be <hi>Almighty</hi> and can, if God be <hi>Wiſe</hi> and
knowes how, if God be <hi>Faithfull</hi> and true, let the
Devil if he can, with all his Sophiſtry, evade the
Concluſion, <hi>That he will certainly do all that good
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:151516:26"/>
for you, which he hath purpoſed and promiſed:</hi> If God
be not able to perform, he is not good; if he miſtake
his way, if he uſe impertinent, improper means, he
is not the All-wiſe God. If he do not actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what he is able, and knows how to do, when
he hath ſaid it, he ceaſes to be the true God: So that
the matter is brought plainly to this Iſſue; If God
be God, if God be the All-wiſe God, if God be the
true and faithful God, this Word which he hath
ſpoken, <hi>[All things ſhall work together for good to
thoſe that love God,]</hi> ſhall not fail of its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in its ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Having thus proved the Doctrine, I ſhall, after
I have added a few words by way of Caution, and

            <p>1. By way of Caution.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Limit not the Lord to your time and way;</hi> God
will make good his Word, but you muſt give him
leave to take his own ſeaſon. <hi>He that believeth ſhall
not make haſte;</hi> believe God, but do not prejudge
nor precipitate, leſt you fall into temptation. Put no
more into the promiſe, neither for matter nor cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
than God hath put in it: put not that
into the Promiſe, which God hath not put in it, leſt
you miſs and come ſhort of that which God hath put
in it. Let others miſtakes and miſcarriages be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to you: till God hath manifeſtly ſaid, do not
you ſay, <hi>This is the time;</hi> build not your confidence
on conjectures, your Faith on the ſtrongeſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions;
left your Faith prove but a fancy, and
your confidence your confuſion: make not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

of God of none effect, by looking for its effect
out of ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Believe not your ſelves into Infidelity: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

the ſeaſons, which God hath put in his own Power.</hi> Study
the Word, and it Commentary, the Works of God,
but be ſober in your Concluſions.</p>
            <p>This you may ſafely depend upon, and this will
be enough, if you have no more: God will make

But know, That till the Rod hath done its

            <p>Againſt this bleſſed Truth, there are ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;
as,</p>
            <p>Object. 1. Can it ever be ſaid, That the removall
of the Goſpel, and the Preaching of it, can be for
good?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> This is an hard Truth; but yet a Truth;
That even this ſhall work for good to thoſe that
love God.</p>
            <p>1. It's true, That the removal of the Goſpel,
and the Miniſtry of it, <hi>is a moſt grievous Judgment;</hi>
and that which carries with it a greater evidence of
wrath, and Divine diſpleaſure, againſt a People, than
any thing that ever befalls them in this World. How
great a Judgment it is, we may gueſs, if we obſerve
thoſe Scripture-expreſſions by which it's ſet forth:
It's called the <hi>famine of the Word,</hi> Amos 8. 11. <hi>The
glory departed,</hi> 1 Sam. 4. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:151516:28"/>
taken away,</hi> Matth. 6. 41. <hi>The Salvation of God ſent
away,</hi> Acts 28. and can there be any thing worſe
befall a People? a Soul-famine, an Eclipſe of their
ſpiritual glory, the ſhutting up of the Kingdom of
Heaven, the carrying away of the Salvation of God:
What worſe thing can come unto them? It's a
great wonder there ſhould be no deeper Senſe of
this moſt dreadful of evils, than is moſtly found:
Men little underſtand what they <hi>do,</hi> who either in

what they herein <hi>ſuffer;</hi> to be an <hi>inſtrument</hi> in
this helliſh work, is <hi>an office for a Devill;</hi> and the
<hi>ſuffering</hi> of ſuch a plague, (to them that underſtand
it) is <hi>an hell above ground.</hi> This darkneſs is the very
ſame for kind, with the darkneſs of Hell; as the
light of the Goſpel is the ſame in kind, with the
everlaſting ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: as glory under age; ſo is this
thick darkneſs, <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> and <hi>in ſemine,</hi> the darkneſs
of the pit. Oh, what an hell of wickedneſs doth
this World then become! the Devil is then in his
Region; is let looſe, rules the World at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
deceives, devours, deſtroyes Souls, without
contradiction; takes them captive at his will, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
them down by whole ſhoals to deſtruction:
Thoſe that obſerve what a World there is, where
the Goſpel is not; what oaths, curſes, blaſphemies,
belluine luſts then abound; what Lions, Tygers,
wild Bulls, wild Boars, Men then become one to
another, need not be to ſeek for an Argument, to
prove there is an Hell; they ſee an Hell above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground.</p>
            <p>Theſe dark and diſmal ſeaſons, are the Devill's
<hi>Marts,</hi> where he may vent his Helliſh Wares, his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:151516:28"/>
ſnares, and temptations, his deceits and deluſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
and every abominable thing, <hi>by whole ſale:</hi> there's
nothing ſo falſe, ſo vile, and abominable, but he can
put it off at pleaſure; Adultery, Drunkenneſs,
Witchcraft, Sodomy, Buggery, Blaſphemy Idolatry,
Atheiſm, any thing that Sathan hath offer, hee'l
find Cuſtomers enough to receive: and the truth is,
the <hi>Devil</hi> may ſpare his pains; men then need not a
<hi>Devil</hi> to damn them, they'l do it faſt enough of their
own accords.</p>
            <p>Oh 'twere happy, if <hi>Saints</hi> were ſo buſie in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
their Light, to haſten them Heaven-wards,
as Sinners do their Darkneſs, to hurry them to Hell.
Oh the ſad proofs, that the World affords of this
Dreadful Truth: Look into all the dark Corners of
the Earth, eſpecially there where there hath been
Light, and ſee, if you find not all this fully proved
to your hand. Can he then be accounted a Chriſtian,
whoſe heart doth not tremble at the Thoughts and
the Fears of ſuch a ſore Judgment? He is both dark
and dead indeed. to whom ſuch a Miſt is not as the
firſt-born of Death, or the King of Terrours.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, if ever this ſhould be your caſe, make
not light of it; and take heed, how ſad ſoever it may
ſeem in its firſt appro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch, that no Tract of Time do
wear off the ſence of it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are weary of the Goſpel, that cry out
of too much Preaching, that are ſick of the Light
that ſhines unto them, you may know by what hath
been ſaid, what Judgment to have of them.</p>
            <p>But is it not ſtrange, that there ſhould be any
ſuch? That thoſe that have lived in the Light, and
ſeen ſomthing, what difference there is between
Light and Darkneſs, ſhould yet love Darkneſs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:151516:29"/>
than Light? Is it not yet more ſtrange, that

Some there are, that are not aſhamed to tell us,
that hence come all our miſchiefs and miſeries; to

            <p>No need of <hi>Preaching?</hi> Why? <hi>Is the end</hi> of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
accompliſh'd? Till <hi>the end</hi> be attained, there's

was the end of <hi>Preaching?</hi> Was it men's <hi>Inſtruction</hi>
onely, to bring them to the knowledg of Chriſt, to
turn them from Darkneſs to Light? Was it not for
their <hi>Converſion</hi> alſo, to turn them from the power of
<hi>Sathan</hi> unto God? Yea, and their <hi>Edification</hi> and
Building up in Holineſs to Salvation? Let theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Scriptures be conſulted, <hi>Act. 26. 18. Eph. 4.
11,</hi> 12, 13. the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13. told
thoſe Chriſtians to whom he wrote, that he would,
and he thought it meet ſo to do, to <hi>put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi>
as long as he lived, and to <hi>stir them up</hi> to their
Duty; though, ſays he, <hi>You know and be eſtabliſhed in

the <hi>Preacher</hi> can tell you no more than you know
already; and might not theſe have better ſaid it,
when the Apoſtle acknowledgeth of them, that they
did know; and more than that, were eſtabliſh'd in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:151516:29"/>
thoſe very Truths, he meant, to continue Preaching
to them? And yet he tells them, it's meet they be

weighs not ſo much with theſe men, as his,
that pretends to ſit in <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Chair:</hi> But hath the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
indeed done its Work, and reached its End?
Witneſs the Objectors own caſes. Let not onely
their Lewdneſs and Impenitency, but their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Unbelief, come in and teſtifie, whether it
hath or no. They that have moſt need themſelves, are
they that ſay, <hi>There's no more need of Preaching.</hi> There
needs no more Argument, to ſtop ſuch Mouthes, but
the ſhewing them themſelves: Or if it ſhould have
done its work upon you, yet hath it done its work
upon all? Are there no Unbelievers left? Have all
men Faith? <hi>Faith comes by Hearing; and how ſhall
they hear without a Preacher?</hi> If you ſay, they have
<hi>Bibles</hi> to inſtruct them, and their own <hi>Conſciences</hi> to
preach to them, I anſwer;</p>
            <p>Firſt, for their Bibles, two Things:</p>
            <p>1. Thoſe that are no Friends to the Pulpit, are
none of the beſt Friends to the Bible: Thoſe that
would not that the people ſhould hear, care not how
little they read the Scriptures: And be ſure, when
ever Preaching is let fall, the Bible will in a little
while be laid aſide.</p>
            <p>2. Underſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt? How
canſt thou without a Guide? He knows but little of
the Scriptures, that doth not underſtand, that they are

till then, let it be granted as neceſſary, that the

            <p>Secondly, Hath the <hi>Devil</hi> yet given over Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Well, by what hath been ſaid, notwithſtanding all
that can be ſaid againſt it, it appears, that the removal
of the Goſpel, and the preaching of it, is a grievous
Judgment.</p>
            <p>2. This grievous Judgment ſhall yet work to the
good of <hi>Saints:</hi> That which comes in Wrath on
ſome, may be in Mercy to others: 'Tis the ignorant,
the unconverted, the unbelieving part of men, on
whom the Vengeance of this Judgment falls: 'Tis
thoſe that are weary of the Word, that can worſe
it. Sinners, you that ſay to the <hi>Seers,</hi> ſee not; to the
<hi>Prophets,</hi> prophecie no more to us; let us alone, we

they never again hear the joyful Sound from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
they ſhall have it within. The Word which they
have receiv'd, ſhall be in them a Well of Water,
ſpringing up unto Eternal Life: If the Showers and

ſhould not be the caſe of any particular Church, if
they ſhould return no more; yet,</p>
            <p>2. Their want of means ſhall ſupply their want
of means; their want of means ſhall be their means:
When they have no <hi>Preacher,</hi> their empty Pulpits
ſhall preach to them; this moſt ſmarting of Rods
will have its voice. If they have no longer the Light
with them, their Darkneſs ſhall inſtruct them; if they
want their <hi>[burning]</hi> Lights, the very Cold ſhall
preſerve and increaſe their inward vigour; the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
of others, ſhall make them more holy; the
violence of evil men upon ſin, ſhall enkindle their
zeal for God; the darkneſs that's here below, ſhall
make them to live more above, and all this ſhall
make to their fuller Reward. 'Tis a greater Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to keep up the Heart, to keep on our way, where
there is a want, than where there are abundance of
means and helps; and an higher Vertue ſhall have a
greater Reward.</p>
            <p>3. The failing of the Word, will bring back to
their Memories, and upon their own Hearts, that
which they have receiv'd; and as the emptineſs of
the Stomach, will cauſe a ſecond and better Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

               </gap>ve; their preſent want,
will be a rebuke of their former wantonneſs: their
want of Remembrancers, will help their Mercies, and

whet their Appetites. Every old truth, that hath been
too much laid by, will then be pretious.</p>
            <p>4. Whenever ordinary means fail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſure, it will yield us an Argument, that will reach
the preſent caſe. If God will provide for their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſes,
much more for their Souls. If God will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them with leſs neceſſaries, then doubtleſs he will

and ſo on, throughout the Pſalm. <hi>Surely goodneſs and

ſhall dwell in the Houſe of the Lord for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> concluſion, and it's
foundation; or his confidence, and it's ground;
his foundation, or ground is, the Lord is my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
his concluſion and confidence is, I ſhall not
want; that is, neither for Body, nor Soul; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the following part of the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
Logick, and his Faith too, does not fail him,
the concluſion is firm; let the Lord be his Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
and he ſhall not know Famine or want.</p>
            <p>Gods relation to his people, is their ſecurity,
for a ſufficient proviſion in all times. If the Lord be
their Shepheard, he muſt ſee them fed; he muſt
either find them thoſe that ſhall, or do it himſelf.
He muſt either find them Paſtors, or be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor;
He muſt either provide them, or be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.
If ordinary means fail, he muſt find extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151516:32"/>
if both fail, he muſt be inſtead of means to
them.</p>
            <p>Here two things.</p>
            <p>1. That God ſtands engaged, as the Shepheard
of his people, where ordinary means fail, either to
provide them extraordinary, or to feed them more
immediately from himſelf.</p>
            <p>2. That extraordinary means, or no means, when
God brings his People to it, will be better than
their ordinary means,</p>
            <p>1. That God ſtands engaged, as the Shepheard
of his People, where ordinary means fail, either
to provide them extraordinary, or to feed them more
immediately, from himſelf. Feed them he muſt, or
he cannot be faithful; and if means fail, he muſt
ſupply that want one way or other. Now God is
faithful, and will not ſee his Sheep to ſtarve. <hi>Iſa. 41.
17, 18. When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there
is none, and their Tongue faileth for thirſt, I the Lord
will hear them, I the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not forſake
them. I will open Rivers in high places, and Fountains
in the midſt of the Vallies, I will make the Wilderneſs a
Poor of Water, and the dry Land, Springs of Water.</hi>
Oh what a good World is here, for the poor Saints
to live upon, in hard times. It is interpreted, to have
an immediate reference to the outward, and yet a
ſpecial reſpect alſo, to the ſpiritual wants and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes.
And it will appear, if we compare it, with
the like expreſſions. Chap. 44. 3. <hi>I will poure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry
ground, I will poure my Spirit on thy Seed, and my Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon thine off-ſpring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the former Scriptures note,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:151516:33"/>
1. That the poor People of God, may ſometimes
be (as to the viſible Soul-proviſions) but in a poor
caſe. Needy, and hungry, and thirſty, their hearts
fainting, their tongues failing for thirſt, and their
waters dryed up. [If they ſeek water, and there be
none.]</p>
            <p>2. All the wants and ſtraits of the Saints, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord. [I the Lord will hear.] Chriſtians,
though thoſe that ſhould, will not, yet he that can,
will hear the cryes of your Souls; all your faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and pantings, and longings for the water of
life, are before your e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d of Sabbath.</p>
            <p>3. God hath more wayes than one, to relieve the
wants, and refreſh the bowels of his hungry ones.
He hath extraordinary means for extraordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es.
If they can find no common Rivers, he will
open, or make new Rivers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

commands it.</p>
            <p>4. Gods extraordinary Proviſions ſhall not be

               </gap>, and penurious, but rich and plentifull. 'Tis
not <hi>ſome drops,</hi> or now and then <hi>a draught,</hi> a little
to ſtay the longing, or barely enough to keep them
alive; he prepares them Rivers, Fountains, Pools,
Springs of water, [I will open Rivers in the high
places, Fountains in the Vallies, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> Whereever
they be caſt, in the high places, in the Vallies, in the
Wilderneſs, in the dry Lands, whereever they be
caſt, I will cauſe Proviſion enough to meet them;
though they have neither Bag nor Bottle, nor any
thing to carry with them, they ſhall not want; the
River ſhall meet them, Springs ſhall ariſe and break
forth to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:151516:33"/>
5. They are not the wanting, but the thirſting, the
ſeeking Souls, whom God will ſupply. When the
poor and needy [ſeek] water, and there is none.
Oh <hi>Chriſtians!</hi> how many poor are there, that ſit
down by their poverty; who if they ſtarve, yet will
not beg, their emptineſs hath taken away their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.
Theſe are ſad Souls; 'tis a ſad ſight, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a company of hunger-bitten Souls, ſit weeping,
and ſighing, ſeeking after the Bread, and Water of
life, and finding none; but to ſee empty, and yet
not hungry; fainting, and yet not panting Souls; to
ſee Souls even dying away for want, and yet not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
or craving a ſupply, this is a much ſore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſpectacle. <hi>A ſtarveling thirſtleſs Soul, is next to a
Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, if ever ſuch Souls find, who never ſeek
water, 'tis more than God hath promiſed them. 'Tis
they that ſeek water, to whom God will open a
River.</p>
            <p>6. What ever difficulty there be, to furniſh the
hungry Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, with a ſufficiency of Proviſion, yet
one way or other, it ſhall be done. I [the Lord] will
hear. I [the God] of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> will not forſaken them.
Upon me be all their wants. I am [God] and can,
I am [their God] the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and will, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for them. They muſt and ſhall be provided for;
whatever courſe I be put to take, I muſt not ſee
them ſtarve.</p>
            <p>The Lord will not be wanting to them, if his
Word be not heard, his Works ſhall ſpeak; if
Preachers cannot, Providence ſhall preach to them;
if their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iends cannot, their enemies, their ſtripes,
their wounds, their rods, ſhall inſtruct them. <hi>Thy
Rod and thy Staffe comfort me.</hi> If they have no
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151516:34"/>
other, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Fouls of the
Air, the Beaſts of the Field, ſhall be their Prophets,
and Apoſtles. If all ſhould fail, yet the Spirit of the
Lord ſhall not fail, to be their Teacher and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</p>
            <p>2. Extraordinary means have more in them, than
ordinary, and no means more than means.</p>
            <p>1. Extraordinary me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns, when ordinary cannot
be had, are ſweeter, and better feeding for the Saints,
then ordinary would be. The l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs of the Creature,
the more of God; the leſs of common Providence,
the more of ſpecial Grace. Water out of the Rock,
was more pretious than out of the River; the Manna
of the Wilderneſs, was (to them that underſtood it)
better than the Milk of <hi>Canaan. Elijah</hi> never made
better meals, than what he got out of the Ravens
mouth. I have heard of Woman, in great diſtreſs
of Soul, who received comfort, when the <hi>Word</hi> was
brought her by the mouth of a child, which ſhe had
failed of receiving from the mouths of many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Miniſters.</p>
            <p>2. No means, often prove better than means;
when I ſay, no means, I do not underſtand ſimply
none, means they ſhall have, of one kind or other;
their underſtandings, their memories, their ſecret
duties, Prayer, Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by no means,
I underſtand nothing from without, no Ordinances,
Friends, Societies, Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gods feeding of a
Soul, more immediately, is much ſweeter, then
when he ſends Proviſion by the hand of another; the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> hearing Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Words, from his own
mouth, was much more to them, than the ſame words
reported by the Woman. <hi>Dulcius ex ipſo fonte.</hi> Water
is the purer, the nearer the Fountain; the Bread
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151516:34"/>
that comes down from Heaven, is better Bread, than
that which grows up out of the Earth, though that be
originally from Heaven alſo. By how much the more
immediately our comforts come from He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ven, by ſo
much the more they have of Heaven in them. If up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the failing of publick Communion, it be made
up ſo much the more in ſecret, ſure the Saints have
no reaſon to complain. And whether this be not ſo,
let the Priſons, into which the Saints have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
caſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Wilderneſs into which they have been
ſometimes baniſhed; let <hi>Elihu's</hi> Songs in the night,
<hi>Peters, Pauls, Silaghs</hi> Songs in the Priſon, in the
Stocks, ſtand forth and teſtifie. If Priſon joyes, and
exile comforts, have not been often both fuller and
ſweeter to them, than when they have rolled in
<hi>Manna,</hi> and lived in the fulneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and freedom of all
helps and means; then not a few Chriſtians, have
either miſtaken, or miſ-reported their experiences.
To pretend to live above Ordinances, whileſt God
affords them, is a wickedneſs that ſome men have to
repent of; but where God denies them, he doth, he
will provide a better ſubſiſtence without them.</p>
            <p>Now lay all this together, and then you will ſee,
that even this alſo, this moſt grievous of Judgments,
the famine of the Word, when ever it befalls, ſhall
work for good to thoſe that love God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> chear up your hearts; whatever
drought, or dearth, may fall upon the World, you
are provided for, you ſhall have enough. If the
ſhoures fail without, you have within you, that which
ſhall ſpring up to eternall life. If your ſtreams
ſhould be dryed up, if your Paſtures ſhould be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
down, you have a God, that will be both your

            <p>2. There is another Objection, that ſeems to have
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore difficulty in it. Suppoſe a Saint to fall into <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,</hi>
and thereby to be deprived utterly of the
uſe of his Reaſon, and ſo to live and die.</p>
            <p>How can it be imagined, that this can work for his
good, either in this World, or the World to come?
Can any good ariſe, out of an incapacity of any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
doing, or receiving good, or patiently ſuffering
Evil? Can either his Grace here, or his Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
be increaſed or advanced, by a man's being
converted into a mere Bruit?</p>
            <p>1. There's no doubt at all, but this may make for
the <hi>Churches good:</hi> Is there nothing that others may
learn out of ſuch a ſad <hi>Providence?</hi> If others may
reap good by my evil, is it nothing to me? May it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:151516:35"/>
not be ſaid to be good for any particular Saint, to
bear the ſoreſt Affliction, by which the Church may
have benefit? He hath not much of a Saint, to whom,
if it were afore-hand propoſed, whether for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Church, he would be content, if God ſee
it good, to fall into ſuch a calamity: He hath little
of a Saint, that would deliberately refuſe it. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
a ſincere Chriſtian, who would count his uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the good of the whole Body, to be his good,
would ſay even concerning ſuch a <hi>Meſſage,</hi> were it
brought to him, <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord:</hi> And
that which afore-hand, he would judge to be good
for him to ſubmit to, may it not be good for him to
be under?</p>
            <p>2. It may alſo be more directly for his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>perſonal good.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>1. It may do him the ſame good, which <hi>Death</hi>
will do for him: Concerning which, the Apoſtle ſays
it is yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. that is, it is for your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
It may <hi>take him from the evil to come;</hi> from
thoſe Sorrows, and that Trouble of Heart, which
God might fore-ſee falling upon him, by any cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
coming either on the Church in general, or
himſelf, or Family in particular: which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of his Reaſon, and power to reflect on, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
feel, or in the leaſt be afflicted by. If you Reply,
<hi>But the Remedy is worſe than the Diſeaſe:</hi> To be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and unſerviceable is leſs eligible, than to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
and afflicted: Will any man chuſe to fall into

from the Torment of a <hi>Feaver?</hi> If there be any

2. Who knows, <hi>what Sins and Temptations</hi> he
might have fallen into, and fallen by, had not the
Lord by this means prevented it; he might poſſibly
have been a Back-ſlider, have fallen into groſs ſin,
by which he might have been a Terrour to himſelf,
and a Scandal to the Goſpel; and is it not good for
him, that this is prevented? Is not that <hi>Affliction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
Mercy,</hi> which ſecures from ſuch <hi>Iniquity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who can ſay it is not thus? that the Lord fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
he would have fallen into ſin, and for preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
brought him into this Affliction: Who can ſay,
it is not thus? If none can, then this is no Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If you Reply, you ſay <hi>[it may be]</hi> this is the
caſe; and I may as well ſay, <hi>[it may be not];</hi> there
might be no ſuch thing, that God fore-ſaw, as the
Reaſon of this <hi>Providence.</hi> 'Tis but a <hi>Conjecture,</hi> and
an <hi>Uncertainty,</hi> when you have made the moſt of it:
Be it ſo; yet it will fully anſwer my end: I am not
now proving, <hi>that all things work for good to the Saints,</hi>
that's ſufficiently done already: But you are obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
againſt it; and till you prove your Objection,
which you can never do, unleſs you prove, that this

you, your Objection comes to nothing.</p>

over whatever hath any Shadow of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to it.</p>
            <p>By the way, learn hence two Things:</p>
            <p>1. Rejoyce in this <hi>Promiſe of God:</hi> Hath the <hi>Lord</hi>
put in thy name here, let thine Heart ſay, <hi>It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</hi>
Be more joyful in this, that God hath thus
undertaken the Care of thee, than if God had whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:151516:36"/>
put thee to thine own hand; giving thee power
to help, and liberty to chuſe for thy ſelf. In what
wilt thou rejoyce, if not in this, that the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are ingaged to do thee a kindneſs, to help thee
into the poſſeſſion of thy God? Thou mayſt now
not onely ſubmit to, but thankfully embrace every
<hi>Providence,</hi> knowing upon what Errand it comes to
thee; for good, and not for hurt. Thou mayſt now
triumph, not onely in the <hi>Conſternations,</hi> but in the
<hi>Triumphs</hi> of thine enemies. Whether they ride
over thy back, or thou tread on their neck, 'tis all
one, the iſſue will be the ſame. Thy Troubles and
thy Conſolations differ only in their Countenance;
with what ever grim face thy afflictions look, there
are ſmiles under; learn to ſee through them, and
thou mayſt ſee light on the further ſide. Believe
this Word, thou mayſt read it written upon every
thing that befalls thee: there's no Meſſenger that
comes, but brings this promiſe in his hand, <hi>Even
this ſhall work for good.</hi> Read it, and rejoyce.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Lay thy ſelf down quietly under it.</hi> No more
perplexing or diſtracting cares, what ſhall become
of thee; no more unwarrantable ſhifting for thy
ſelf: Let God alone. Shift not for thy ſelf, leſt
God leave thee to thine own ſhifts. Let not the
violence of evil men diſturb thy <hi>Peace,</hi> or provoke
thee to <hi>unpeaceableneſs.</hi> What ever provocations
thou mayſt have, avenge not thy ſelf, neither give
place unto wrath, murmuring, or fears. In thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
poſſeſs thy Soul, thy God, and his good
Word: Thy ſtrength is to ſit ſtill. Stand ſtill and
ſee the Salvation of God; thou haſt nothing to do
but to be <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly</hi> let that be thine only care; thy God
will ſee to it thou ſhalt be <hi>happy:</hi> he is faithful that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:151516:37"/>
hath promiſed. Love God, and leave thy ſelf and
thy whole Intereſt in this bleſſed Word, <hi>All things
ſhall work to thee for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time you ſee ſomething of the Riches of
this Promiſe: God is in the promiſe; the God of
Peace, the God of Power, the God of Patience, the
God of Hope; the heart of God, the help of God,
the preſence of God; by vertue whereof, all that
ever befalls them ſhall work for their good. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks

ſet your Souls, and all that is within you a crying
out, Oh that this were my portion! Where ever my
Lott do fall, as to outward things, though in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
though in a deſert, though on a dung-hill; let

you.</p>
            <p>Oh what fooliſh Creatures are we, that ever we
ſhould be afraid of Religion, afraid of Holineſs,
afraid to own, obey, and follow God and his holy
wayes. What unreaſonable fears are theſe, to thoſe
that believe the Scriptures? If the Scriptures be
true, this is the only way, this following God in
holineſs, to put your ſelves out of all danger, to put
your ſelves into the heart, arms, preſence, protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of the Almighty God of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>Oh that I could perſwade you in thither, and
there leave you; if you are once in the Lords Arms,
you are ſafe enough, into what ever hands you fall.</p>

blind, have had all their dayes ſuch a miſt of thick
darkneſs abiding upon them, that they are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,

to them, as one of a ſtrange Language, they know
not what you ſay; if you ſhould ſpeak <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
to them, they would underſtand it as well, as the
plaineſt truths of the Goſpel: A poor Miniſter of
Chriſt may break his heart, and rend his bowells, in
mourning over them; may draw forth his Soul in
the moſt melting expreſſions of his compaſſions to
them, may break his brains, in ſtudying how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
a little light into them, and yet cannot help
them, cannot make them to underſtand ſo much, as
that they underſtand nothing. Their Minds are ſo
wholly blinded by the god of this World, that the
light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, though it
ſhine round about them, cannot find ſo much as a
cranie into their hearts; but being alienated from

them, they give up themſelves to laſciviouſneſs to
work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs; walking in

you, that after all the warnings you have received
from the Lord, and after ſome workings of them,
ſometimes upon your Conſciences, are yet going
after your Luſts, proſtituting your ſelves to your bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luine
and ſenſual pleaſures, filling up daily the
meaſure of your iniquities. Oh tremble, and conſider
ſadly, whether this be not likely to be your caſe; that
the Goſpel hath even done with you, and given you
over unto an impenitent heart, and reprobate mind.
In hope, that how near ſoever you are to this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſtate, you may be yet one ſtep at leaſt ſhort of it,
I ſhall this once more adventure a few words upon
you, together with them that I have already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
And firſt let me reaſon a little with you.</p>
            <p>1. Art thou one of them that obey the Goſpel, or
not? Art thou one of them that love God, one of the
called, according to his purpoſe, or not? Art thou
not an Alien, an Adverſary againſt God, and a Rebel
againſt his Word? Let thy Conſcience ſpeak, let
thy ways ſpeak, let thine Oaths, and thy Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and thine Adulteries, thy ſcoffing at God, and
his holy ways, thy hating his Inſtructions, and kicking
at his Reproofs, thy hardnings againſt his Calls, thy
treacherous dealings in his Covenant, and the Vows
of God that are upon thee; let theſe ſpeak what thou
art: Is this that which God hath choſen and called
thee to? Are theſe the Things thou haſt learned, and
received, and heard of him? Did he ever ſay, <hi>Theſe
things do and the God of Peace ſhall be with you?</hi> Thou
needeſt no other Conviction, than that of <hi>Iſraels,
Jer. 2. 23. How canſt thou ſay, I am not polluted? See
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y way in the Valley, and know what thou haſt done.</hi> How
canſt thou ſay, that thou art not a Wretch? With
what Face canſt thou deny, but thou art an Enemy
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:151516:39"/>
of God, and of all Righteouſneſs? See thy way in
the Valley, trace the Footſteps of tby Life; behold
thy practices and thy courſe: Sure thou art very
blind, if thou behold thy ſelf in this Glaſs, and doeſt
not ſee thy Face, as the Face of a Devil.</p>
            <p>There are ſome, whom it may be harder work to
convince, who have the Face of a Chriſtian, the
Tongue of a Saint, but within, the Heart of a Beaſt.
Hypocrites are as hard to be convinced, as Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
is hard to be detected.</p>
            <p>But thou who carryeſt thy wicked Heart in thy
Forehead, upon thy Tongue, upon the Palms of thine
Hands, and in the very prints of thy Feet, whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
againſt God and his Holineſs, may be read in
every look, in every word, in every Line of thy Life;
needeſt thou any further proof, that thou art not of
God? Thou mayſt as well put me to prove, that <hi>Hell</hi>
is not <hi>Heaven,</hi> that the <hi>Devil</hi> is no <hi>Saint,</hi> as that thou
att no Chriſtian. Doſt <hi>[thou]</hi> love God, art thou
under the hope of the Promiſe? Ask thy Wayes
man, and let theſe tell thee.</p>
            <p>2. Doeſt thou mean to keep at this diſtance from
God to the Death? Doeſt thou in earneſt? Is there
nothing in thoſe rich Promiſes, that have been laid
before thee, which thou canſt wiſh 'twere thine? Is
there no ſuch word in thine heart, <hi>Oh that my Lot
were here!</hi> Art thou content thy name ſhould be left
out for ever? Is there ſo little in the peace of God,
that thou canſt ſell it for the pleaſures of ſin? Art
thou content that nothing ſhould proſper with thee,
but that every thing ſhould be a Gin, and a Snare,
and a Curſe to thee? Art thou content, that the Pit
ſhould be thy place, Eternal Wrath thy portion, and
that every Creature, every Comfort, every Croſs that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151516:40"/>
comes, ſhould give thee a pluck down from <hi>Heaven,</hi>
and a kick towards <hi>Hell?</hi> Canſt thou think they mean
thee any thing elſe, when all does but harden thee in
thy ſin, and make thee kick againſt thy God? Art
thou ſo unwilling to leave thy ſins, for the hope of
the Promiſe of God, that thou art content to give up
thy hopes, for the love of thy ſins? Dareſt thou ſay,
<hi>Let me have my part in the pleaſures and contentments
of this life, and I am cnntent to relinquiſh my part in
Chriſt? Let God let me alone in my ſins, and let him
damn my Soul? Let me live at my eaſe, and my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and let my name be blotted out of the Book of Life:
I am content to take my ylace, and my lot, among the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in another World, ſo I may have my pleaſure with
them in this World?</hi> And doeſt thou ſay leſs, or other
than this, whileſt thou refuſeſt, or reſolveſt againſt
following thy God? He that refuſes to accept of
the Redemption of Chriſt, upon the holy Terms, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which 'tis offer'd, ſays, in effect, I am loſt, I am ſold
for a Captive to the Devil; my firſt Father ſold me
for an Apple, Chriſt would now buy me back again
to my ſelf; but, for my part, I am content that the
firſt Bargain ſtand: As to my intereſt, I confirm the
Bargain: As for my Soul being ſold to the Devil, to
the Devil let it go. This is the voice of every wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Refuſer of the Terms of the Goſpel. Oh Wretch!
does not thy heart tremble? does not thy hair ſtand
on end? do not thy knees ſhake? and are not the
Joints of thy Loins loſed, to conſider, what thou haſt
done, and art ſtill a doing?</p>
            <p>Sinners, I have but little more to ſpeak to you;
but ſhall that little be nothing? Hitherto you have
ſtood it out, and will not be perſwaded, by ought that
God hath ſpoken by me: But oh! muſt I leave you
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151516:40"/>
thus? Why may not a word at parting, do more than
all that hath been ſpoken? Oh that it might! Shall
neither my firſt, nor laſt words prevail with you?
What if [my] laſt, ſhould be [your] laſt? If the

               </gap>ſt that I muſt preach, be the laſt that you muſt
muſt hear? There is a day ſet, that will be your laſt
day: There is a Sabbath, that will be your laſt Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;
There is a Sermon, that will be your laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
There is a Warning, that will be your laſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
Oh what if this ſhould be it? If the Lord
ſhould take your <hi>this days deniall,</hi> for your <hi>final An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi>
and never ask your conſent again for ever? But
whether it be your laſt, or no, I muſt be henceforth
ſilent to you? And oh will you ſend me away with
ſo ſad an Heart, with the ſorrow and ſhame of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed?
Will you break my Heart, by perſiſting
to harden yours? Is this all that I ſhall have, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Lord, that ſent me unto you? I have
declared thy Name un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o them, but they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it: I have invited them to come to thee, but
they would not follow me: I have warned them to
return from their ſins, but they would not hearken?
Are you willing that I ſhall give in this Anſwer,
and bear this Witneſs againſt you at the Great Day?
Sinners hearken; Is there not one blind perſon among
you, that is yet willing to have his Eyes open'd? Is
there not one Captive to Luſt and Vanity, that's wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be ſet free from his Bondage? Is there not
one more that will be perſwaded to be wiſe, and to
prefer an immortal Soul, God, Glory, Eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his bruitiſh periſhing pleaſures? Is there not
one Drunkard more, that will yet be perſwaded to
be ſober? Not one vain perſon that will be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be ſerious? Am I making my laſt Draught
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:151516:41"/>
among you, and ſhall I take nothing? Not one Soul
more? If you will not yet be prevailed with, then
hear the Word of the Lord, <hi>Ezek. 3. 19. If thou warn
the Wicked, and he turn not from his wickedneſs, he ſhall
die in his iniquity, but thou haſt delivered thy Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if there be any few relenting Hearts among
you, who are brought but thus far, to cry out, <hi>Why
what must I do?</hi> I would leave with ſuch, theſe few
words of counſel, and oh that my counſel might be
accepted by them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Get a deep ſenſe of thy dreadful ſtate: What
art thou ſinner? What is thy ſtate? at eaſe? in peace?
out of fear? in pleaſure? What, and yet a ſinner? in
the Bond of Iniquity? Captive to the Devil? without
Chriſt? without the Promiſe? under the Curſe? Study
theſe Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 8. 34. He that committeth ſin, is
the ſervant of ſinne. <hi>ver.</hi> 44. Ye are of your Father the
Devil. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. Held Captive by him at his will.

<hi>1 Joh.</hi> 5. 19. The World lyeth in wickedneſs. <hi>Pſal.

in the Grave, Death ſhall feed upon them.</p>
            <p>Riſe <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the <hi>Philistims</hi> are upon thee; awake
ſleeper, the Devil is upon thee; Death is at thy back,
the Grin is at thy heel, the Curſe is over thy head,
thy very next ſtep may be Hell; Thou lyeſt in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
to day, and mayſt be in fire and brimſtone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to morrow: Sure thou art in a dead ſleep, that
canſt take thine eaſe in ſuch a Lodging. Is this the
ſtate thou art ſo loath to change? Is this the ſtate
thou ſo boaſteſt of, and bleſſeſt thy ſelf in? When
thine heart is merry with thy Wine, ſwell'd with thy
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:151516:41"/>
pride, jolly amongſt thy Companions; put in ſuch a
ſerious Queſtion: <hi>But what am I all this while?</hi> Let
this Thought, ſawce thy ſweet Morcel, ſpice thy
pleaſant Cups, and be the Burthen of thy merry Songs:
After this, Hell, Snares, Fire and Brimſtone, the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of Eternal Fire. Oh an Heaven, a Paradice,
oh my dear pleaſures, oh my ſweet Daughter, oh my
merry days, what Mortal can part with you? I but
what comes after? What is there at the bottom?
Look a little before thee, and if that ſight turn not
thy ſtomach, ſure thou art ſufficiently hardy.</p>
            <p>Study thy caſe, and tremble; and when thou trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt,
there's hope thou wilt turn. Think not of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
or eſcaping from thy ſinful ſtate, till thou
ſee and fear it. We read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 7. that Chriſt was
ſent, <hi>to open the blind eyes, and to bring out the priſoners
out of Priſon.</hi> If the priſoners eyes be ſhut, 'tis to little
purpoſe, that the Priſon doors be open: Their Eyes
muſt be firſt open'd, not onely that they may ſee their
way [out,] but that they may ſee themſelves [in]
Priſon. Open thine Eyes ſinner, if ever thou wilt
eſcape; open thine Eyes, and ſee where thou art?
Thy Fools Paradice, wherein thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf, is
thy Souls Priſon, where thou art like to be held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Eternal Bondage.</p>
            <p>2. Give a preſent Bill of Divorce to every ſinne;
hug not Death one minute longer in thy Boſom: If
thou loveſt thy Life, ſay not of any one ſinne, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Death ſhall part thee and me:</hi> No, nor ſo
much as this, <hi>Yet a little while, and I will let thee go.
To day, to day, if you will hear his voice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hearden not your
hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Dread it as Hell, that thy hope in Chriſt,
ſhould leſſen thy fear of ſin. Let not the hope of a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:151516:42"/>
Saviour be thy damnation. Make not Chriſt the
<hi>Pandor of ſin;</hi> continue not in ſin becauſe Grace
hath abounded.</p>
            <p>4. Break off from thy Companions in ſin; wilt
thou love them to the death? Chriſt and thy Soul
can never be married, till thy Soul and Sinners be
parted. Eſcape for thy life, get thee up from the
Tents of theſe men; linger not. Thou art held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the power of the Devil, by <hi>cords,</hi> and by <hi>knotts;</hi>
by the cords of thy <hi>ſins,</hi> and by the knots of thy
<hi>Companions.</hi> There's no hope that the cords of ſin
will be broken, till the knots of evil Companions
be looſed. Sinner, theſe <hi>binding Cords</hi> will, if thou
look not to it, become <hi>whip-cords</hi> to torment thee.
Oh take heed thou never come to be laſhed with
ſuch knotted cords!</p>
            <p>Thy Companions in ſin, as they now heighten
thy pleaſures, ſo will they hereafter ſharpen thy
plagues. Sinners comfort their hearts with this
thought, That if they be damned, they ſhall have
ſtore of company: but let them know, That the fire
of Hell will burn juſt ſo much the cooler, for the
multitudes that are there: as the fire of their Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
does, for the ſtore of fewell. When thou art
charmed with the roaring of thy Companions in the
Ale-houſe, think what muſick their roaring with
thee will make, when you ſhall all meet in your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Priſon. Away from evil company; you will
remember hereafter, when 'tis too late, how much,
and with how little ſucceſs, I have laboured with
you in this thing.</p>
            <p>5. Bafflle not Conſcience once more. Awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Sinner, charm not thy Conſcience into ſilence,
nor daſh it out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> countenance. Thy Conſcience is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151516:42"/>
the only Friend that God or thy Soul hath left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thee. Thy will, and thy affections, and thine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
are all gone; the Devil hath ſtoln them away,
and hired them all againſt thee, thou haſt nothing
but poor Conſcience left.</p>
            <p>Thy Conſcience hath been often upon thee; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with thee for God, and for pity to thy Soul: It
hath warned thee, reproved thee, and often whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
thee in thine Ear; What doſt thou mean?
whither art thou going? when wilt thou return?
Away with thy ſins, have done with thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
no more of this drunkenneſs, this riot, this
covetouſneſs; Thou art a loſt man, thy Soul is loſt,
if thou go on. Thus Conſcience hath warned thee,
and thou haſt ſometimes hearkned to it; and ſpoken
it fair. The throbs, and the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gs, and the wounds
thou haſt felt and received from it, have wrung
from thee, now and then, a promiſe: Well, through
the Grace of God, I'le hearken to Conſcience, I'le
be a new man: Away from me ye Sinners, I will
keep the Commandments of my God. And yet
ſhortly after, when thy Temptations return, thy
Companion; come, all's forgot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en; and along thou
goeſt, as a fool to the Stocks, or an Ox to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and this hath been thy way and thy manner,
from time to time: Now and then Conſcience draws
a ſigh, or a tear from thee; and by and by receives a
kick or a ſtab.</p>
            <p>Beware Sinner; Conſcience will not alwayes be
thus us'd. If ever it ſpeak again, ſay it not Nay. Its
next word may be its laſt; if ever thou wearieſt it
into perpetual ſilence, then farewell all for ever.
Conſcience is the only Friend thou haſt left.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:151516:43"/>
Convinced Soul! How wilt thou bear the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of an awakened abuſed Conſcience? all thy
bafflings of it here will be repeated over in eternity:
How will all this look when it ſhall meet thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy Judge? Save thy ſelf from that hour: Baffle
not Conſcience once more.</p>
            <p>6. Let not the greatneſs of thy ſins, nor the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Chriſt's terms, hinder, or diſcourage thee,
from making a preſent cloſe with Chriſt. Say not,
his Yoke is too heavy his Croſs is too grievous for me
to bear; or my ſins are too great for him to bear.
Set the Throne againſt the Yoak, the Crown againſt
the Croſs, infinite Merit and Mercy, againſt mighty
ſins; and go unto Jeſus, caſt thy ſelf on his blood,
and bowells, and put thy ſelf under his Yoke and
Scepter. If he will give Life to thee, be content
that he give Laws to thee: and as ever thou expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to live by him, be reſolved to live to him, and no
longer to thy ſelf. Go to Jeſus, and when thou
goeſt, take with theſe two Scriptures,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Matth. 11.
28. Come unto me, all ye that are weary, and heavy
laden, and I will give you reſt; Take my yoke upon
you, and learn of me, and you ſhall find reſt unto your
Souls.</hi> Joh. 6. 37. <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will
in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Fall cloſe to Duties, and keep cloſe to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
            <p>1. Let ſecret, and Family Prayer be thy <hi>daily
exerciſe.</hi> Count not thy ſelf a Chriſtian, till thou give
thy ſelf to prayer.</p>
            <p>2. Let not reading the Word, Catechiſing, &amp;c. be
ſtrangers in thy houſe.</p>
            <p>3. Prize, improve, and ſanctifie Sabbaths; The
Lord on thoſe dayes comes down upon eis Mount,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:151516:43"/>
to meet thy Soul, to commune with thee, to bleſs
thee, to feed thee, and fill thee with whatſoever thy
Soul deſireth or wanteth. Get thee up to meet thy
God: But remember when thou goeſt, leave thy
ſtuff behind thee.</p>
            <p>4. View often, and take an account of thy ſelf,
of the in-come and ſucceſs of all thy Duties: What
is all my praying, reading, hearing, &amp;c. come to?
What is brought forth? Is the work done for which
all theſe are? Are my Sins and my Soul parted?
Are my Companions in ſin abandoned? Is Chriſt
and my Soul united? Beware you never make Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Hearing, to ſerve you [inſtead] of Believing,
and Repenting. But to help you on to it.</p>
            <p>Remember theſe Seven Words when I am
gone:
<list>
                  <item>1. Get a deep Senſe of thy dreadful ſtate.</item>
                  <item>2. Abandon preſently every ſin.</item>
                  <item>3. Let not thy hope in Chriſt leſſen thy fear of

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things do, and the God of Peace ſhall be
with you: But remember, <hi>There's no peace, ſaith my
God, to the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There are others that are <hi>near the Kingdome of

There are ſome that are like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſea 7. 8.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:151516:44"/>
of Chriſtianity. They are come to the threſhold
of ſaving Faith; within a ſtep of ſincere godlineſs.
They have been profeſſing, and praying, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and wiſhing themſelves in, and yet are ſhort
of it. They have been enlightened, in the knowledg
of Chriſt; have taſted of the heavenly gift; have
felt ſomething of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt; have been
made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, of many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and uſeful gifts; have taſted of the good Word
of God, and the powers of the World to come. They
have ſet out after Chriſt, have left the blind and
prophane World, much behind them; have eſcaped
much of the pollutions of this world; left many
ſins, taken up with many duties, have a name among
the Saints, have ſuffered many things for the Name
of Chriſt; and notwithſtanding all this, here they
ſtick, they cannot give up themſelves fully to Chriſt;
ſomething or other, either the World, or their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
or their pleaſures, or their eaſe, or their
ſloth, hath ſuch hold on them, that they cannot, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſervedly,
reſolvedly,</hi> give themſelves up to the
dominion of Jeſus Chriſt; nay, it may be, they
cannot tell w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, yet they cannot do it. Though
they can ſay, I would be, yet they cannot ſay, I will
be, the Lord's. theſe are near the Kingdom of God;
but yet ſhort of it. He that cannot ſay, <hi>I will be,</hi> can
leſs ſay, <hi>I am, the Lord's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here I muſt diſtinguiſh of two ſorts, of <hi>almoſt
Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. There are ſome that have reached to <hi>almoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and are ſtill reaching forwards; the ſtate of ſuch is
hope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul, though it be not ſafe. Oh that we could ſee
more ſuch <hi>almoſt Chriſtians!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:151516:44"/>
2. There are others that have reached to, and <hi>reſt
in almoſt;</hi> who miſtaking <hi>almoſt,</hi> for <hi>altogether,</hi> do
there take up their ſtand. Theſe are far from the
Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi> I much fear, that among the number of
Profeſſors, there are more of theſe <hi>almoſt</hi> Chriſtians,
than we are aware of: Oh it would make our hearts
ſhake to conſider, how far many go, to what degree,
of reſignation, reſolution, affection, action, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſufferings, they attain; and yet fall off at
laſt, and thereby ſhew they were ſtill ſhort of
Chriſt; <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not
of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I particularly pity many of the more ſober Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who have a good will to Religion, and a fair
reſpect for the Profeſſors of it; countenancing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
doing many worthy things for the Name and
Servants of God; refraining from the vitiouſneſs,
and vanity, of many of their Rank and Quality;
who yet dwelling in Temptations, being entangled
in carnal correſpondencies, entertained with an
affluence of carnal delights and pleaſures; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereby a ſtrict ſelf-denying and mortified life,
to be of greater difficulty to them, than to men of
lower rank, are apt to think it not of ſuch neceſſity;
who may poſſibly upon a narrow enquiry diſcern,
after all their good hopes of themſelves, and the
great opinions of others concerning them, that they
are yet ſhort of that ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity,
which alone will prove them Chriſtians indeed.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, there are amongſt us ſuch, thoſe
who have broken through all temptations; have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
upon the diſobliging all the World; have
hid down their honours, pleaſures, friends, and all
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151516:45"/>
their carnall intereſts whatſoever, at the feet of
Chriſt; and preferring a cloſe Communion with
God, the peace of a good Conſcience, the joyes of
Religion, yea the very reproach of Chriſt: above
all their worldly Honours, and fleſhly pleaſures,
have given themſelves up to the power of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
and an exemplary Spiritual and Heavenly life.
But it is to be feared, leaſt there be alſo ſuch, who
have deſervedly gain'd great reſpect among the
Saints, and gone far along with them, who yet are
come but to the threſhold of Chriſtianity; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afraid to put in, there they are in danger to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
everlaſtingly. <hi>Quod fere fit non fit.</hi> He that is,
but almoſt ſaved, is damned for altogether.</p>
            <p>Oh Friends, what do ye mean? Will you looſe all
the ground you have gotten, all the things you have
wrought? ſhall all your ſufferings for the name of
Chriſt be loſt, and in vain? after you have taſted the
bitterneſs of the Croſs, will you not go one ſtep far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and take the joys of the Croſs? Is the work of
Regeneration brought to the Birth, and ſhall it at
laſt miſcarry, and prove an abortion? would one ſtep
more land your Souls in the Kingdom of God, are
you gotten ſo near a ſhore, and will you periſh in
the Harbour? are you gotten off from the Tents of
the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and gotten even to the Borders of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
and will you not enter? Are you gotten to
<hi>Piſgah,</hi> and have a view of the Land of Promiſe, and
ſee that it is a good Land? are you come ſo near, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to ſee, that true holineſs is ſuch a beautiful State, ſuch
a bleſſed State, and do you wiſh your ſelves in, and
will you yet die on the other ſide <hi>Jordan?</hi> you have
prayed, put on; a little more prayer may do it: you
have laboured, and reaſoned with, and perſwaded
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:151516:45"/>
your hearts, give not over, a little more labour may
prevail. Oh that I knew what to ſay more, that
might bring you on. Oh that the Lord would yet
put one word or other in my mouth, that might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
you! that I might ſhoot one Arrow more,
that might ſtrike home, uſe one Argument more,
that might be cogent, and gain your full conſent to
Chriſt; that I might ſee you ſafely landed ere I be
parted from you. Oh think, think what a dreadful
diſappointment this will be for you, that are come
ſo near to godlineſs, as that you verily think you
have attained it; if after all the joys, pleaſures and
hopes, the little Religion you have had, hath fed you
withall; you ſhould at laſt have a TEKEL written

            <p>1. Looſe not both Worlds, this World thou haſt
loſt already, by leaving them ſo much behind thee;
looſe not that which is before, for want of coming
on a little farther: think not of hanging always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Heaven and Hell; In the other World there's
no middle, either go back, or come on, turn thee to
the right hand or to the left.</p>
            <p>2. Miſtake not <hi>all moſt,</hi> for <hi>alltogether,</hi> ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
may be mortall. Do not too eaſily conclude,
thou haſt already attained; if thou takeſt ſomething

of Chriſt ſpeaking in me, which to you ward is not weak,
but is mighty in you. Though he was crucified through
weakneſs, yet he liveth by the power of God; for we alſo
are weak in him, but we ſhall live with him by the power
of God.</hi> (Ye ſeek a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in me,)
ye put me to prove that I am a Miniſter of Chriſt;
why, here's the proof of it, My preaching hath not
been weak, but mighty in you; It hath been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and atteſted, by the power of Chriſt, which
hath wrought mightily in you; as weak as we are,
yet the power of Chriſt hath been manifeſted and
magnified in us. Doeſt thou ſeek a proof of thy
Chriſtianity? why, here muſt be the proof, that
though thou art weak of thy ſelf, yet thou liveſt in
the power of God, which is mighty in thee. Though
thou canſt do nothing of thy ſelf, yet thou art
<hi>able to do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthens
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou ſayſt thou art <hi>willing,</hi> but thou art <hi>weak;</hi>
thou deſireſt to be, and to do, what God would have
thee, but thou canſt not perform.</p>
            <p>This may comfort and ſupport thee much, under
thy failings and miſcarriages in ſome particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but if this be thy caſe <hi>in ordinary,</hi> in the main
of thy life; that <hi>to will is all thou haſt,</hi> thou art not
a Chriſtian. <hi>He that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, is
none of his.</hi> And he that hath the Spirit of Chriſt,
it is in him as the living power of God, actually car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
him on in an holy life. Ezek. 36. 27. <hi>I will
put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my
Statutes; and ye ſhall keep my judgments, and do
them.</hi>

are not according to thy mind; thy Soul, thy Soul

And is the disſatisfaction of thy vain mind or appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite

of ſpirit, whereby a Chriſtian, from Goſpel grounds,
is born up under all his Troubles, and born throug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
all his Duties.</p>
            <p>Betwixt <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Contentedneſs,</hi> there is this
difference; <hi>Contentedneſs</hi> is the quiet of the heart,
and its ſatisfaction with its <hi>ſmalleſt portion of good
things. Patience</hi> is the quiet of the heart under the
<hi>greatest preſſure of evill things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>patient ſpirit</hi> is a <hi>ſubmitting ſpirit;</hi> It's heartily
content that God ſhould have his Will. With what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
God is pleaſed, it will not be diſpleaſed. <hi>It's
the Lord, let him do whatſoever ſeems good in his Eyes.</hi>
What ſeems good in God's eyes, ſhall not ſeem evil
in mine.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>a Calm and quiet ſpirit:</hi> It will not ſtrive nor
cry, nor lift up its voice in the ſtreet; it can <hi>mourn,</hi>
but it does not <hi>murmur;</hi> it can <hi>feel,</hi> but it will not
<hi>fret</hi> at the hand of God. A patient perſon is ever
<hi>composmentis;</hi> has the command and government of
his ſpirit; keeps it ſober, and in due order; doth
not rave, and rage. Impatience is a kind of frenzy;
ſuch perſons are <hi>beſides themſelves.</hi> In our patience
we poſſeſs, and by our impatience we loſe our Souls:
we loſe the rule and government of them, the peace
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:151516:51"/>
and the uſe of them. An impatient man is beſides
himſelf, both as a Man and as a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>1. He is beſides himſelf <hi>as a Man:</hi> Impatience
turns Reaſon out of doors; and for the Affections,
they are all in an uproar, and will know no command
or government.</p>
            <p>2. He is beſides himſelf <hi>as a Chriſtian;</hi> turned
quite out of courſe: Duties, Comforts, Experiences,
Hopes, all are laid aſide. Keep you quiet, keep the
peace in your heart, and you keep your heart.</p>
            <p>In this calmneſs and quietneſs, <hi>it bears up under
troubles.</hi> Patience hath Fortitude in it, it neither
frets, nor faints, under all its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hens. Chriſtians
[muſt] bear, and patient Chriſtians [can] bear any
thing that comes on them. The proper exerciſe of
patience, is <hi>enduring:</hi> he endures not that ſuffers
only, but that can bear what he ſuffers.</p>
            <p>It <hi>bears through its Duties:</hi> The paſſion of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
perſon doth not hinder his action. He holds
his courſe, keeps on his way, whatever load he hath
in his back. He (runs) with patience, the race which
is ſet before him; he is not diſcouraged nor divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his holy courſe by any ſuffering it coſts
him.</p>
            <p>And indeed, Chriſtian Patience ſtands not in a
bare forced quiet, in a biting in, or keeping down,
our fretting aeſtuations, from venting themſelves
in word or carriage, or in a ſullen ſilence or ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;
but in the maintaining ſuch a tranquillity of
ſpirit, under all we ſuffer, as that we can ſtill, both
enjoy and ſerve the Lord. He is a patient Chriſtian,
that is as much a Chriſtian in a ſtorm, as in a calm;
that can pray, believe, love, bleſs God, follow God,
and keep his way, when he ſmites, as when he ſmiles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:151516:52"/>
Laſtly, in all this, a Chriſtian is upheld and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on, <hi>from Goſpel grounds.</hi> 'Tis not a naturall
hardineſs apathy, 'tis not the ſpirit of a man
that does ſuſtain his infirmities; 'tis upon the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Goſpel that he ſtands.</p>
            <p>There are three Things eſpecially, that bear him
through. His viewing,

            </p>
            <p>1. He ſees <hi>the Hand of the Lord</hi> in all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
him: Whence was <hi>Davids</hi> patience? <hi>Pſal.
39. 9. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe
thou Lord didſt it.</hi> Whence was <hi>Elie's</hi> patience?
<hi>1 Sam. 3. It is the Lord, let him do what ſeems him
good.</hi> Whence was <hi>Job</hi>'s patience? <hi>Job 1. 21. The
Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be
the Name of the Lord.</hi> By the way Note, That a
godly man is not only patient under his afflictions,
but thankful. He is not only thankful for Mercies,
but for Chaſtiſements. 'Tis not only, <hi>the Lord hath
given,</hi> bleſſed be his Name; the Lord hath built
me up, the Lord hath filled me, the Lord hath hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, bleſſed be his Name: but alſo, <hi>the Lord hath
taken away,</hi> the Lord hath humbled me, broken me,
undone me, left me naked, left me nothing, bleſſed
be the Name of the Lord. This by the way.</p>
            <p>2. He ſees <hi>the End of the Lord;</hi> that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
his good by all that comes upon him. He
knowes that all things, and therefore this which is
upon him, whatever it be, ſhall work to him for
good.</p>

3. He feels <hi>the Help of the Lord.</hi> When the
hand of the Lord is upon him, he feels alſo the hand
of the Lord under him: <hi>underneath the everlaſting
arms,</hi> Deut. 32. 27.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel, as it hath allotted him many Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
ſo it hath allowed him mighty Supports. <hi>A
mighty God,</hi> who is the rock of <hi>ages, Iſa. 26. a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
high Prieſt,</hi> who being tempted himſelf, is able
alſo to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted, <hi>Heb. 2. 18.
pretious Promiſes,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. <hi>gracious experiences,</hi> Rom.
5. 4. <hi>patience worketh experience.</hi> This laſt ſupport,
[experience] hath all the reſt in it. Experience is
the whole Goſpel proved. A patient, experienced
Chriſtian, hath proved all things, what they are; hath
proved the World, and what it is, and the worſt it
can do: hath proved the Word, and what there is
in it: hath proved what God is, what Chriſt is,
what grace, and peace, and a good Conſcience are:
Tribulation often takes away God, and his Goſpel;
and we never ſo well prove what God is, as when
we have him <hi>alone;</hi> what grace is, what a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is, as when we have nothing elſe left us. Our
Religion never ſhews ſo much what is in it, as when
it's moſt put to it. When the Adverſary hath gotten
the greateſt advantage of us; of the Sun, of the
Wind, of the Ground; when he preſſeth with moſt
violence, with moſt fury upon us, then we beſt know,
what the weapons of our Warfare are. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and ſupports of Religion are not known, either
of what ſtrength, or of what ſweetneſs they are, till
they are thus proved. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had never ſuch a
taſte of his integrity, as when he received the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of death. <hi>Stephen</hi> had never ſuch a ſight of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as through a ſtorm of ſtones, Chriſt is never ſo
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:151516:53"/>
ſweet in a Priſon. When God meets his Saints
in a Wilderneſs, then he ſpeaks comfortably to
them. A patient Chriſtian hath more or leſs experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of all this; and hence is he ſupported, keps quiet
under all his ſufferings, and carried with courage on
his way.</p>
            <p>Be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of
the Lord. You have need of patience, and no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for your impatience. The ſufferings of the
Goſpel call for patience; and the ſupports of the
Goſpel will condemn your impatience. If you will
be godly, count upon it that you have a great fight
of afflictions to endure. Venture not into the fight
without your armour: An impatient Creature is a
naked Souldier; How eaſily will Sathan deſtroy,
whom he hath once diſarmed. The more you [can]
the leſs you [ſhall] ſuffer. Secure your ſpirit, and
you ſave your ſelf from harm. There's no Dart ſhall
hurt you, that does not hit your heart. Keep your
heart whole, and the Devil loſes all his ſhot. Be
patient, and you poſſeſs your Souls; keep your Souls,
and the Enemy loſes the day.</p>

               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> 'tis of great conſequence to you, to be

get your ſpirits furniſhed with the love of Chriſt,

Honour, Immortality, be the portion of your Souls,

Exerciſe of, thy patience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if you will be patient, you muſt be
painful: give diligence; be diligent in making
your Calling and Election ſure: be diligent in duty,
be vigilant againſt iniquity: If you will be patient,
be impatient of ſin, and you will be patient of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
make ſin ſure; get it ſlain by the croſs, and
buried in the grave of your Lord, ſealing the ſtone,
and ſetting a watch: have nothing to conflict with,

of carrying guilt with you up upon the Croſs;
Let<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the gall of guilt be mingled with the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar

all our pain, and a pure Conſcience will bear all our
burthens.</p>
            <p>Till this be done, I muſt tell you, you will find
ſuffering to be hard ſervice. 'Tis an eaſie matter to
talk of the ſufferings of the Goſpel, and to boaſt
great things afore-hand; as you know who did once,
and what came of it; <hi>Though I die with thee, I will never
deny thee.</hi> But when it comes to the pinch, when
Troubles come upon us, when the hand of the Lord
touches us, and touches where it's moſt tender;
brings thoſe calamities on us, which are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to us, ſtrips us of thoſe comforts which are
moſt dear to us, takes away all from us, and leaves
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:151516:54"/>
us naked; when we feel the <hi>ſmart</hi> of the rod, when
every ſtroke fetches blood; when the feet are hurt
in the Stocks, and the Iron enters into the Soul;
when the vinegar and the gall comes, when the
thorns and the nails of the Croſs are ſtruck in; when
ſhame and reproach, when ſcorn and contempt,
when hunger and thirſt, when cold and nakedneſs,
when bodily torment and pain, are all meaſured to
you for your portion, and mingled in your cup: If

more, he that ſuffereth in Faith, hath ſet to his Seal
that God is true. In the Faith and patience of the

of God. God hath ſaid, He will uphold, he will not
forſake them: and their patience ſhews, he doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
he hath not forſaken them. 2. <hi>That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
is a Glorious Goſpel:</hi> That God is a good Maſter,
that it's good being with Chriſt any where; That
they are no Loſers by their Religion, but that it's
Wages are above it's Work, and its pay above its
pain.</p>
            <p>It were not poſſible, when they prove how much
the Goſpel coſts them, but they ſhould be weary of
it, and repent of their Faith, and renounce their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,

            <p>The Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. that Chriſtians are

Whatever is ſaid in honour of the Goſpel, what
a bleſſedneſs, what an ineffable advantage 'tis, to all

even as much as nothing, by that all the coſts and
charges of it are caſt up: The Comforts of it will
never ballance them; ſet one againſt any other, the

Set one againſt another, and I have made but a bad
Bargain, by becoming a Chriſtian. This is the Voice
of Impatience. Chriſtian, Thou paſſeſt over thy
Murmuring, as a light Evil; as if thy pain might

next to Repenting that ever thou wert a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
            <p>Brethren, <hi>Let us do the Lord this Right, by the
patience of our Spirits, to confeſs before the
World,</hi> That all the ſufferings of this Life, are not
worthy to be compared to the Glory that ſhall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<hi>And</hi> looking unto Jeſus, the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſher
of our Faith; Let us learn of him, for the Joy
that is ſet before us, to indure the Croſs, and deſpiſe
the Shame: <hi>That we may ſit down at his, as he
is ſet down at the Right Hand of the Throne of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Your patient ſuffering, will be <hi>God's
Witneſs to your Adoption,</hi> Heb. 12. 7. <hi>If ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
chaſtening, God dealeth with you as with Sons:</hi>
The LORD doth not uſe to deal ſo with
ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:151516:57"/>
Afflictions are Gods <hi>Family Diſcipline.</hi> Yet mark,
'tis not, if the ſuffering alone will not prove our
Son-ſhip, (the Rod is for the fools back, as well as
the childs;) but patient ſuffering will, for</p>
            <p>1. Patient ſuffering is it ſelf, an evidence of our
adoption: it is the mark of the Lord Jeſus upon us.
If thou haſt both the ſame lot, and the ſame ſpirit,
that was upon Chriſt, there's thy Lords mark upon
thee, whereby he marks thee out for one of his own.
Men had need of other marks to prove them Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
than what the Rod hath made on their backs; 'tis
our quiet ſubmitting to it, and that upon Goſpel
grounds, as hath been before ſhewed, that muſt do
it, and this will be evidence enough. None but a
Son will thus ſubmit.</p>
            <p>2. The ſuffering ſtate of Chriſtians, is ordinarily
attended with other evidences. Sufferings will ſet
patience on work, and patience will ſet every other
grace on work. Whatſoever it be, that findes work
for patience, will therein find work for faith, and
love, and hope, and ſelf-denyal. Chriſtians never
appear ſo much believers, ſo humble, ſo mortified, as
under the Croſs. If there be any faith, or love, or
hope in the heart, 'twill appear in the day of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
If there be any fire under the aſhes, throw on
water, and then you ſhall hear it, when, it may be
before, you could ſee none there. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes,
<hi>folly,</hi> ſo we may ſay, <hi>wiſdom,</hi> grace is bound up in the
heart of a child, but the rod of correction will fetch
it out. We ſeldom know, either how bad, or how
good our hearts are, till they are thus proved; <hi>This
I did to prove thee, and to know what was in thine
heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:151516:57"/>
Beſides, this is the ſeaſon, when ordinarily there
are moſt plentiful illapſes, and incoms from above.
God ſeldom ſends ſuch Tokens of his love, as to his
Children in priſon. The light of his Countenance
he often reſerves for their darkeſt eſtate, he ſets to
his Seal, when the Wax is on fire. There have been
Chriſtians, that would never believe that they were
ſuch, till God hath told it them at the ſtake; the
higheſt joyes, the fulleſt ſence of everlaſting kindneſs,
have been moſt ordinarily the portion of Gods Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.
When Hell is let looſe upon them, then Heaven
is moſt open. Many Chriſtians have met with ſuch
refreſhings in their bonds, that their enlargement
hath been their Priſon.</p>
            <p>If this be ſo Chriſtians, who would fear ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
who would not be patient? would it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you, to know that God is your Father? Be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and you ſhall know it. What would you not
bear, ſo you might be ſure you are the Lords? It
may be you have been held under doubt and fears,
and ſad uncertainties, hitherto all your dayes; you
have gone about from <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>duty,</hi> from <hi>Ordinance</hi>
to <hi>Ordinance,</hi> from <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> enquiring,
and mourning, and complaining, and crying out. Oh
if I were ſure that Chriſt were mine; that my faith,
and my love, and my hope, and my obedience were
ſound, and ſincere, ſuch as would prove my adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then I could be quiet: Why, if ever GOD
calls thee to Sufferings, follow him chearfully: He
calls thee out, to prove to thee, that thou lov'ſt him:
Fear not to go up with him on the Croſs, Aſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance
is a Fruit, that moſt ordinarily grows on that
Tree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:151516:58"/>
Let hypocrites only fear ſufferings, 'twill be ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to them; there's many a ſelf-deceiving Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
that never ſuſpected himſelf to be an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
till perſecution made him an Apoſtate: that's
a woful caſe, to have Sufferings come upon him for
the Goſpel's ſake, only to tell him, That he hath no
part in Chriſt nor his Goſpel. Let hypocrites be
afraid and unquiet, but let Saints be patient. The
ſame trialls which will prove them baſtards, will
prove you ſons.</p>
            <p>3. Your patient ſuffering is <hi>the cure of your Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
Sufferings are our medicine for corruption,
and patience our cure: To what degree of patience
a Chriſtian hath attain'd; that degree of power hath
he gotten over iniquity. Till luſt be conquered,
there's no patience: If there be but one unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
corruption remaining, and an affliction comes
and grates upon that, this will provoke; there's no
bearing it. Whence is impatience, but from this,
for the moſt part, that we cannot bear any violence
that's offered to luſt? What is Patience, but this,
that we can bear that pain, that Luſt, when pinch'd,
will put us to? quietly to ſuffer, our pride, our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
our paſſion, our ſenſual appetities, to be cut ſhort
of what would gratifie them; and freely to leave
them under that which comes to kill and crucifie
them; to be able to want that fuell that feeds, and
endure that water that doth quench theſe fires; This
is Patience. When our Pride is ſtrip'd of its orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
our appetites depriv'd of their delicates,
our covetouſneſs of its ſubſtance, our fleſh of its
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe; and we either feel no ſmart, or can bear the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:151516:58"/>
ſmart of it, then we are Patient. And when we
can thus leave our <hi>Corruptions,</hi> to whatever ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
come upon them, without taking part with
them in their ſufferings; then luſt is conquered.
Luſt no longer lives nor maintains its power and
intereſt in us, than whileſt, in all its afflictions, we
are afflicted; when we feel its ſufferings as our
ſufferings, its diſappointments and diſſatisfactions
as our own, and fly out againſt whatſoever falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, as if it fell upon our Souls. When we can
ſay, 'tis my paſſion that ſuffers, but not I; 'tis my
Covetouſneſs that ſuffers, my Pride that ſuffers,
but not I; and let them ſuffer (for me), let them
be pinch'd, and pain'd, and ſtarved, and die; none
of all this ſhall move me: nay, herein I do and I
will rejoyce: There's patience. Patience is Luſt
conquered.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, you complain of Corruption, you
tell one another ſad ſtories, what a Burden, what
a bondage 'tis you are under, whileſt Luſt hath
ſuch power in you; what Briars and Thornes,
what plagues and ſtings they are in your hearts!
You pray, and you mourn, and groan, and ſigh in
your ſelves, waiting for your redemption from this
bondage and miſery. Oh for an humble heart;
oh for a broken mortified ſpirit! oh this earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

            </p>
            <p>5. Your <hi>patient ſuffering,</hi> will be <hi>the improvement
of your Sanctification,</hi> Heb. 12. 9, 10. <hi>We have had
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:151516:59"/>
Fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave
them Reverence: Shall we not much rather be in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Father of Spirits and live? For they verily,
for a few days, chaſten'd us after their pleaſure; but he,

The Fathers of our fleſh correct us, and ſo doth the
Father of Spirits; they, at their pleaſure; he, for our

profit is there in our Blood? in our Bonds, in
our Poverty? Why, there is this profit; we are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
made partakers of his Holineſs. There's ſeldom

God's <hi>School of Affliction,</hi> is a <hi>Nurſery</hi> for <hi>Heaven:</hi>
Were it not for his <hi>Houſe of Correction, Sion</hi> would
quickly become as <hi>Sodom.</hi> Seldom does any come
out thence, but their Complexion ſhews where they
have been. 'Tis with them that feel the Hand of the
Lord, as 'twas with him that ſaw his Face; his Face
did ſhine; his very ſpitting in their Faces; doth
waſh them the cleaner. Of all Saints, there are none
raiſed ſo high towards the Third Heaven, as thoſe
that have been in the Deep: No Providences give
ſuch a lift to the Soul, as thoſe that moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, What ever pains you travail under,
believe it, the Births may be ſuch, as will make you
forget your Sorrow.</p>
            <p>I have heard of an Holy Woman, who uſed to

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:151516:60"/>
               <hi>Heb. 12. 11. No chaſtning for the preſent is
joyous, but grievous; but afterwards it yieldeth the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Fruit of Righteouſneſs, to them that are exerciſed
thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh when you ſee the Fruit, where then will your
Sorrow be?</hi> Joh. 16. 21. A Woman when ſhe is in
Travail hath Sorrow, becauſe her hour is come; bue as
ſoon as ſhe is deliver'd of the Child, ſhe remembreth no
more the anguiſh, for joy that a Man-child is born into
the World.</p>

Will you expect an Harveſt, and yet muſt God let

be more holy than you are, more fruitful than you

and love an holy, and fruitful life, that you are hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
content, that God ſhould take his own courſe
with you, ſhould take any courſe that's needful, to
bring you on to it? Can you freely ſay, Oh Lord, I

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:151516:60"/>
me in this thing, I freely put it into thy hand, to
take thine own way, and uſe thine own means. Uſe
the Word, or the Rod. Command me, or chaſtiſe
me, ſpare not this fleſh for all its crying, ſtrip me of
what thou wilt, inflict on me what thon wilt, throw
me whither thou pleaſeſt, let me not want the moſt
bitter Pill that's needful, any thing, any thing Lord;
I hope I can be poor, if thou wilt have me ſo; I can
be in pain, in diſgrace, if thou wilt have me: But
I cannot be unholy, I cannot bear it to be ſuch a
ſtarveling in the ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

holineſs, Lord for more life, and care, and zeal, and
fruit, let me have it, upon what terms thou pleaſeſt;
onely let me have it. Can you ſay thus to the Lord?
I hope you can; what, and yet be diſpleaſed, if he
take you at your word? can you pray thus, and yet
repine and murmur that the Lord hears your Prayers?
Chriſtian, when the Lord comes to deal roughly
with thee, entertain his chaſtiſements, whatever
they be, with this thought. Now the Lord is about
to give me my hearts deſire; now is my day of
hope. This diſtreſs, this ſorrow and anguiſh, the
Lord hath brought upon me, may be come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that work which I have long'd to ſee: What the
Word hath been ſo long a doing, and yet is not
done. What Sacraments, Prayers, Mercies, have
been ſo long a doing, and yet is not done. Now is
the time, this may be the means to bring it about.
This bitter Cup hath health in the bottom; this
Plough, and theſe deep furrows it makes, look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
an Harveſt. The work is doing that I have
been ſo long a begging. This froward, this ſenſeleſs,
this ſloathful, this earthly, barren heart, which I feel
to day, I hope now, in a little time, I ſhall be rid of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:151516:61"/>
for ever. If this be the meaning of my troubles, I
hope it is, I will wait, I will wait for this fruit, and
if this be the fruit, oh welcome, welcome this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Providence.</p>
            <p>6. Your patient ſuffering ſhall be <hi>the advance of
your glory.</hi> Remember what I have told you already,
Your ſuffering ſhall go into your reward; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your deep poverty, ſo ſhall your riches be:
As 'twas ſaid concerning <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 18. 7. <hi>How
much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo
much ſorrow and torment give her.</hi> So ſhall it be ſaid
concerning you; How much they have been abaſed,
and afflicted for me, ſo much Joy and Glory give
them. As ſure as the perſecutings of the ungodly
ſhall meet them in hell; ſo certainly ſhall the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecutions
of the Righteous, meet them before the
Throne of God. This ſhall be written on their
everlaſting Crowns, <hi>Here is the Patience of the
Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time you ſee <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that a ſuffering
ſtate is not ſo formidable, nor patience under it ſo
impoſſible, nor your impatience ſo excuſable, as
your hearts are apt to tell you. Suffering you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoid, but you may abide them; your carnal
hearts will cry out, I can't endure, and therefore
whatever ſhift I make, I muſt avoid them. The

be Chriſtians) you can't avoid them. <hi>All that will
live godly in Christ Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi>
Well, ſince it's thus, Gird up the loins of your
Minds, and follow your Lord. Conſider him that
endured ſuch contradictions of Sinners, and be not
weary, nor faint in your Minds: The Captain of
your Salvation was made perfect through ſufferings;

quiet, there's the glory of patience, though extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of torment make thy fleſh to roar; nay the
more the fleſh roars, and the Soul yet keeps ſilence,
the more patience.</p>
            <p>If your fears affright you, and prophecy to you
before hand, oh I ſhall never be patient; if the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
be ſo dreadful, what will the encounter be? yet
be not diſcouraged. You ſay you could be content
to ſuffer, if you were ſure you could be patient; that

Tribulation worketh patience, where it findeth
none; when you are in the fight, you'l find your
Weapons; your very ſufferings will learn you to

be quieter. Be jealous of your ſelves while you will;

and lean on the Rock of Ages; and when
you are put hardeſt to it, let your Soul take Sanctuary
here, <hi>When my fleſh and my heart faileth me, God is

to Ankle deep, or Knee deep, get thee on, ſtay not,
till thy Spring become a River; let every Day, every
Duty, every Experience, yea every Affliction, adde
to thy ſtreams; that as the acceſſion of every little
Brook to the main Channel, raiſes the Water as it
paſſes along, ſo it may be with thy Soul; that the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou goeſt on, the fuller thy Banks may be, till

thee up in great Afflictions; that which thou may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>3. That a little Grace will be ſadly put to it, if
ever thou come to have but little means of Grace.</p>
            <p>4. That he that hath but little Grace, is like to
have no Aſſurance that he hath any at all. If thou
would'ſt have power over Corruption, if thou
would'ſt ſtand in the Day of Temptation, if thou
would'ſt not ſtarve in the day of Famine, if thou
would'ſt have the comfort of the Grace thou haſt, let
it grow up to its fuller ſtature; Grace, when it is
come to Age, will ſpeak for it ſelf, and ſhift for it ſelf
the better; which whil'ſt it is in its Infancy, neither
knows, nor can help it ſelf.</p>

any thing) will coſt you pains and labour: and how
can you count your ſelves Chriſtians, if you refuſe
to be at the neceſſary coſt of Chriſtianity? If you
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:151516:68"/>
think to be Chriſtians without labour, or if you wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
ſtand out from Chriſtianity, to ſave your labour, you
are alike wiſe in both. Either come to a Reſolution
to fall upon an induſtrious painful life, or 'twill be
in vain to give you counſel.</p>
            <p>2. Practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Directions I ſhall give you in
purſuance of your Covenant with God; wherein
you have engaged to take the ſtricteſt ſevereſt Laws
of Chriſt, for the Rule of your Life. What I am
preſſing on you, for the matter of it, is no more than
you have bound your ſelves to, as Chriſtians. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your Bonds, and let this holy practice be
followed on by you, as the paying your Vows. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
daily, the Vows of God are upon you, and
there is not any material thing here preſcribed to
you, which falls not under your vows. Your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
if your eye be much upon it, will be a cord to
hold you to your work.</p>
            <p>3. Preſs hard for ſenſible Communion with God
in all your Duties.</p>
            <p>4. Keep up a ſpiritual and holy Frame from Duty
to Duty. Remember what I have elſewhere ſpoken
to you more at large, on theſe two Particulars. See
that there be Religion in your Duties, and confine
not your Religion to your Duties.</p>
            <p>5. Be Watchful. The Life of all Religion lies
much here; whatever you reſolve upon, will come
to nothing without it. Watchfulneſs is the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
of your Will. Let your eye be upon your
Rule, and your Work. Eſpecially watch againſt
your <hi>prevailing ſins.</hi> There's no Chriſtian that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
himſelf, but may find ſome one ſin or more,
that in regard of their power over him, are taller by
the head and ſhoulders than all the reſt. In ſome
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:151516:68"/>
               <hi>Pride,</hi> in others <hi>Worldlineſs,</hi> in others <hi>Paſſion,</hi> in
others <hi>Slothfulneſs.</hi> It may be, if thou ſearcheſt, ſome
one of theſe four, or poſſibly ſome other, may be it,
that by a Specialty thou may'ſt call <hi>[thine Iniquity.]</hi>
Find out what it is, and know, that there thy main
Work lyes. In vain wilt thou ſtrive in other duties,
till that which hinders be removed out of the way.
<hi>Fight neither againſt ſmall nor great, but againſt the
King of Iſrael.</hi> Where the Enemy moſt ordinarily
makes his breach upon thee, ſet the ſtronger Guard.
Let thy daily conflicts be here, and obſerve dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
with what ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>6. Walk on thy courſe in the Name and ſtrength
of the Lord Jeſus. Live by Faith. Depend on Chriſt
for the aſſiſtance of his mighty Spirit. Forget not
this, for otherwiſe thou wilt go but lamely on.</p>

thrive in Grace, if you do not live in Peace. The
decayes of Chriſtianity lye much upon the ſcore of
the diviſions of Chriſtian. The Devil hath alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up that Maxim, <hi>Divide et Impera,</hi> Rent them
and Ruine them. The reaſon why our love is ſo
cold, is becauſe our differences are ſo hot. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſo little zeal againſt ſin, hath been the great
ſtrife among Brethren. The Combinations of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
have not ſo much prejudiced the power of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as the Contentions of Saints. There are not a
few who go under the name of Saints, that have
maintained diſputes about Religion ſo long, till they
have diſputed themſelves out of all Religion; their
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:151516:73"/>
ſearching for Truth, hath been the loſs of both love
and life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if ever you would be any thing, be
one; be of one heart, of one mind, <hi>holding the unity
of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi> It were greatly to be
deſired, that the people of God were both of <hi>one
heart,</hi> and <hi>of one way:</hi> But if this may not yet be, if
there cannot be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> yet let there be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi>
betwixt all that fear the Lord in truth.</p>
               <p>A few words I ſhall leave with you for your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
herein:</p>
               <p>1. Divide not from the Head, to unite with any
pretended Members; hold not with them, that hold
not with the Head. Sell not Truth, clear, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Truth, to buy Peace.</p>
               <p>2. Divide not from real Members, leſt you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
prove your diviſion from the Head. Chriſt hath
but one body, if you be not in union with the body,
you are divided from the head.</p>
               <p>3. See the head in every member; ſee Chriſt in
every Saint.</p>
               <p>4. Prize Chriſt where ever you ſee him. Love
Chriſt, and love his Image; if you will not ſlight
Chriſt, ſlight not any Saint. See'ſt thou an humble,
meek, patient, broken-hearted, ſelf-denying, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
Chriſtian; in whatſoever unpleaſing form (as
to matters circumſtantiall) he appears, deſpiſe him
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, reject him not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:151516:74"/>
5. Prize Peace and Union, as the ſtrength and
honour of the Body.</p>
               <p>6. Purſue Peace and Union, with the utmoſt
ſtrength of thy Soul. And that you may obtain it,</p>
               <p>1. Let all parties that are named of Chriſt, <hi>be
humbled</hi> under former Diviſions. What Peace ſo
long as God is angry? Oh how have we provoked
the Lord, by provoking one another! Let him only
who hath been without ſin in this matter, be without
ſorrow and ſhame.</p>
               <p>Sure they are hard hearts, who are not broken
under ſuch breaches. Let us not miſtake our ſelves,
nor miſ-call that Zeal for God, which God will call
Pride, and peeviſhneſs.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not againſt our being offended, either
with errour or iniquity; we may not call evil, good;
or darkneſs light, for peace ſake; but at our unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
paſſions, againſt whom we ſuppoſe erring
Brethren.</p>
               <p>If the Reproach of the Goſpel, the hardning of
the perverſe, the ſtumbling of the weak, if the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ication, the promoting of Confuſion, and
every evil work, which have been the ſad <hi>Effects</hi> of
our Diviſions; if Pride and Haughtineſs, if Vanity
and Wantonneſs, if Envy and Uncharitableneſs,
which have been the <hi>Womb</hi> from which our Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have ſprung, be matter of Humiliation, then
ſure we had need be brought upon our knees: We
muſt be melted, e're we can be moulded up into
one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:151516:74"/>
2. Let all parties unite ſincerely in <hi>their ends:</hi> Let
the honour of Chriſt, the advancement of practical
Godlineſs, the deſtruction of the intereſt of the fleſh,
the edification of the whole body, in Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
be look'd at with a ſingle Eye, and purſued
with a plain and honeſt heart; Let not the intereſt of
a party, the affection of Superiority and Dominion,
the carrying on of ſelfiſh or fleſhly Deſigns, let <hi>the
God,</hi> or <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> you are driving for, unbyaſs your
Spirits, take the right mark, and let your motions be
ſincerely level'd at it. If we were once ſet right in
our ends<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, an accommodation of all our differences,
about, the means, would be more facile and feiſable,
<hi>Prov. 11. 3, 5. The integrity of the upright ſhall guide
him, the Righteouſneſs of the perfect ſhall direct his way.</hi>
Humble, ſingle, honeſt hearts, are moſt like to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the good and honeſt way: if we had nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
do, but to pleaſe the Lord, we ſhould not have much
to do to pleaſe one another.</p>
               <p>3. Let all parties unite in this Rule, <hi>Do as you
would be done by;</hi> that is, as being well informed, and
adviſed, and freed from evil, and diſcompoſed Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
(for ſo the Rule is to be underſtood) you
would that Men ſhould do unto you: Allow to
others, what you challenge to your ſelves; or would,
if you were in their Circumſtances: Deny not what
you would demand: The ſame Liberty, the ſame
Charity that you would expect from other Chriſtians,
allow to them.</p>
               <p>4. No longer tie up Chriſt <hi>to a party.</hi> Say not,
<hi>Loe here is Chriſt, and not there:</hi> Say of all <hi>Believers,</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:151516:75"/>
though of different Forms, <hi>As we are Chriſts, ſo they
are Chriſts.</hi> Of all the Subdiviſions of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that
are conſiderable amongſt us, there's no party, the
union with which makes us, or the ſeperation from
which únmakes us, Chriſtians. We had need to have
more to ſhew for our Chriſtianity, than that we are
<hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Epiſcopal,</hi> or
<hi>Eraſtians;</hi> and the Devil muſt have more to prove
us no Chriſtians, than this, that we are in union with
either of theſe, or in ſeparation from them.</p>
               <p>5. In matters circumſtantial, be not over-haſty in
ſtamping a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> on Things diſputable and
doubtful: Put no more weight, nor a greater neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
on any thing, than God hath evidently put on it;
and ſpend no more of your zeal about it, than is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to its weight and evidence.</p>
               <p>6. Allow for the imperfect ſtate the Church is in,
we know but in part; and till that which is perfect
is come, and that which is imperfect is done away,
we muſt bear with one another, if in any things we
be otherwiſe minded.</p>
               <p>7. Stretch not your Authority <hi>beyond your Line,</hi>
take not too much upon you: Think not to bring all
others, in every thing, to your Standard; impoſe
not your Conſciences, as a Law upon others.</p>
               <p>8. Put not Conſcience to the ill office of being a
meer <hi>Make-bate,</hi> catch not up every Notion, and
preſently charge it upon Conſcience, as that which
muſt be maintained, though to the greateſt prejudice
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:151516:75"/>
of the whole Intereſt of Religion, and ſo rent and run
away from all thoſe that agree not with you. Be not
raſh, be not heady; be tender, but be wary; be well
inſtructed, if you will be truly tender: firſt carefully
inform thy Conſcience, and then peaceably follow
it.</p>
               <p>Of what is that Conſcience tender, that is not ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of making Wounds and Rents, in the Body of
Chriſt?</p>
               <p>9. Beware of <hi>Cenſurings</hi> and <hi>Judgings,</hi> of biting
and devouring one another. <hi>If ye bite, and devour one
another, ye ſhall be conſumed one of another.</hi> Let him
that is without fault, caſt the firſt ſtone at his <hi>Erring
Brother.</hi> Be not bitter againſt the bitterneſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
if others ſowerneſs <hi>offend thee,</hi> yet let it not
<hi>leaven thee:</hi> Be not reviled into a Reviler, ſcoffed
into a Scoffer; overcome Evil with Goodneſs: 'Tis
not ſeldom that our Invectives againſt others Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
are more keen and cutting, than what we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of: Juſtifie not what thou judgeſt; Practiſe
not thy ſelf, what in the ſame Breath thou condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
in thy <hi>Brethren:</hi> Throw not back thy <hi>Brother's</hi>
Fire-balls in his face, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t in cenſuring him, thou be
alſo thine own Judge: Purſue not matters in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
over hotly, but learn modeſtly and meekly to
differ, where you cannot agree.</p>
               <p>10. Let your Converſation be ſo holy, humble,
and heavenly, carry your ſelves in ſuch ſimplicity,
and godly ſincerity, towards God, towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and towards all men, that you may command
each other to believe, that however you agree not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:151516:76"/>
about your <hi>Mother,</hi> yet you are all the Children of
the ſame <hi>Father;</hi> that you are of God, and that the
Spirit of the Living God dwelleth in you.</p>
               <p>11. Hold <hi>Communion</hi> in the Things wherein you
agree, and <hi>Charity</hi> where you differ: May you not
pray, and faſt, and hear, and hold <hi>Chriſtian Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
together? Sure there is not overmuch of Goſpel
Spirit, where this will not be granted?</p>
               <p>12. Impoſe not on each other any hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſity
<hi>Conditions</hi> of your communion. Suppoſe,
upon your differing Judgments, there be in ſome
things different practices, which ſome of you iudge
leſs warrantable, whil'ſt the Conſciences of others
allow and uſe; preſs not the relinquiſhing ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable
practices, as the condition of your commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
eſpecially, if they be not mingled with the
Daties wherein you joyn, but are uſed by any of you,
at other times, or in other Aſſemblies. Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
not them from you, excommunicate not your
ſelves from them, with whom Chriſt holds Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Judge not that Chriſt withdraws, from all
thoſe, who are not in every thing, of your Mind and
Way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deſtroy not all communion, by ſeeking after a
purer, than in this out imperfect ſtate, we ſhall ever
attain. According to this principle, (No Communion
at all, if not in all) where ſhall we reſt? In all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſomething will offend.</p>
               <p>13. And laſtly, in your communion receive not
one another <hi>to doubtful Diſputations:</hi> Let your <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Conferences,</hi> and all Holy <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> be ſtudiouſly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151516:76"/>
ſo managed, that there may be a ſweet Accord of
your Spirits therein: Come not together to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Parties, or propagate Opinions: Let all matters
of Controverſie be waved; and hereof let there be
ſuch mutual Aſſurance given aforehand, that you may
be together, without fear of becoming Thorns or
Snares one to another: Which, if it be not unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſented to, and inviolably obſerved, your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
will be impoſſible, or dangerous.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, Are the clear and fundamental Truths
of the Goſpel, and the more neceſſary and weighty
Duties of Religion, ſufficiently underſtood and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed?
Are your Souls ſafe? Is your Calling and
Election ſure? Is the Love, and Life, and Zeal of
God, grown up to that maturity, that you need not
mutual help this way? Have you any ſpare time from
theſe things, to ſpend in perplexing Controverſies?
Build up one another in your moſt Holy Faith, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
one another to Love, and to good Works, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage,
eſtabliſh, and ſtrengthen one another in
the known ways of Holineſs, and if you find not this
both better work, and work enough for you, then take
your Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe things do live in peace, and love, and the God of
Peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hear, oh all ye Friends of Chriſt, by what oblique
Names ſoever unhappily diſtinguiſhed! will you
come and be Friends one with another? Are you
for peace? Your God is the <hi>God of Peace:</hi> Your
Jeſus is the <hi>Prince of Peace:</hi> Your Goſpel is the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:151516:77"/>
of Peace;</hi> and will you not be perſwaded to be
<hi>Sons of Peace?</hi> Your God is one, your Mediator is
one, your Faith one, your Baptiſm one, your Hope
one; you are one Body, one Spirit, and will you not
yet be one Soul?</p>
               <p>Oh how hopeful would our Condition be, were
our Hearts generally ſet upon peace! We ſhould
certainly obtain, did we more reſolvedly purſue it:
and what ſhould hinder? Have you not yet enough
of your Contentions, and Quarrellings? Have not
your Souls been ſufficiently neglected, your Luſts
ſtrengthned, your Faith weakned, your Love wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
your Comforts waſted, your Names blemiſh'd,
your Holy Profeſſion blamed? Hath not your God
been ſufficiently provoked, and the Devil ſufficiently
gratified? Are your Bellies ſo filled with Gall, and
your Mouths with Gravel, and have you not yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of your Contentions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Slight not theſe Counſells and Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
As you would prove your ſelves the Friends
of Chriſt, be ye followers of peace. Study, oh ſtudy
theſe things that make for peace. <hi>Follow peace with
all men, as much as in you is,</hi> but eſpecially with the
houſhold of Faith. <hi>Let there be no longer ſtrife betwixt
us, for we are brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet alwaies remember, I am preſſing you to an
<hi>holy</hi> Union; whil'ſt I perſwade you to follow peace,
I muſt ſtill add <hi>[and holineſs:]</hi> I perſwade you not to
purſue <hi>peace,</hi> upon tearms diſhonourable or prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to <hi>Truth;</hi> They muſt have both together, that
will be bleſſed in either: Truth without Peace, is
as a Jewel without its Cabinet; Peace without
Truth, is as a Cabinet with nothing in it. Peace
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:151516:77"/>
without holineſs, is as a fair and promiſing ſhell,
with a rotten, or worm-eaten kernell; holineſſe
without peace, is as a pretious kernel, under a crack'd
and broken ſhell.</p>
               <p>They that have peace without truth, have nothing
worth the ſecuring; they that have truth without
peace, have little ſecurity for what they have. Peace
without truth, is beauty without worth; Truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
peace, is worth with its beauty marred. Let both
go together, and then they will be, both the <hi>Columna
Eccleſiae,</hi> the Pillar of the Church, rendring it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
within it ſelf; and the <hi>Corona Eccleſiae,</hi> its
Crown, rendring it comely and glorious before the

               <p>Be it thus with us, and then Sathan look to thy

to ſecure it. It holds up <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a Shield; it holds
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:151516:79"/>
up the <hi>Promiſes</hi> for a Shield: the very <hi>Commands,</hi>

to the Soul.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the <hi>ſenſe of guilt</hi> aſſails and weakens
the heart: It is not ſo much any thing without us,
as ſomething within us, that raiſes our fears. How
ſmall a matter will fright a guilty Soul? Guilt will
make every ſtroke a ſtab. It's the barb of the arrow,
the venome on the dart, or the ſore of the heart, that
makes every ſtroke formidable and terrible. 'Tis the
guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leſs Soul that hath courage, and boldneſs. <hi>Hic
murus ahaeneus esto—</hi> Now againſt this dreadfull
Dart, Faith holds up a Buckler, with a <hi>Crucified Jeſus</hi>
upon it; and ſo that's quenched.</p>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>darkneſs</hi> and uncertainties, about the
way that we are in raiſes our fear. A Chriſtian that
knowes himſelf in his duty, in his way, is out of fear.
Clearneſs gives boldneſs. Whil'ſt we queſtion the
warrantableneſs of the way we are in every ſhadow
of danger will ſhake us: Againſt ſuch fears, Faith
holds up a buckler, with this Inſcription, <hi>Have not I
Commanded thee?</hi> It ſhews the Command, and in
that, our warrant, and in our warrant our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>When we queſtion whether our <hi>Worſhip,</hi> for which
we are like to ſuffer, be right or no, Faith holds up
<hi>an Institution</hi> for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hield.</p>
               <p>If this Fear (oh I ſhall not hold out, I ſhall deny
my Lord, and his Faith, if put to it) aſſails the Soul;
here Faith holds up <hi>the Promiſe</hi> for a Buckler: <hi>He
hath ſaid, I will not fail thee, nor forſake thee: ſo that
we may boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:151516:79"/>
2. Formally; Faith not only lifts up a Shield,
but is our Shield; The very believing in a crucified
Jeſus; the very believing the Command, the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
the promiſe, ſtayes and ſupports the heart,
againſt whatſoever may befall it; <hi>I had fainted but
that I believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whatever your duties, difficulties,
deſpondencies, ſtraits, temptations, afflictions, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
are; believe, and you ſhall be carried through;
believe, and you ſhall be eſtabliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Believe in
Chriſt, and you ſhall dare to follow Chriſt; believe
in Chriſt, and you ſhall go through with Chriſt, and
hold out to the end. Believe, and you ſhall neither
fear, faint, nor fall. Your Faith will both keep you
<hi>faultleſs,</hi> and ſave you <hi>harmleſs,</hi> and thereby ſecure
you from ſinking, and fainting, in your minds.</p>
               <p>If this be not enough, let me add, That Faith will
yet farther ſcatter all your fears, by this double
Act:

               <p>1. It will put your reward into your hand; it will
ſet the Crown on your head, even whil'ſt the Croſs
is on your back. Faith makes things to come, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. It is the ſubſiſtence, or being, of
things hoped for; it gives being to the good things
promiſed, before they are. Hope carries the eye to
the object; looks on things to come, as to come:
Faith brings the object to the eye, looks on things to
come, as come; it looks on diſtance of time, as God
looks on it; on a thouſand years but as one day. It
looks on God's <hi>ſaying</hi> and <hi>doing,</hi> on God's promiſing,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151516:80"/>
and performing, as all one. It a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

8. (In) all theſe things we are more than Conquerours:</hi>
In <hi>Tribulation,</hi> in <hi>Perſecution,</hi> in <hi>Famine,</hi> in <hi>Nakedneſs;
[In] all theſe things we are more than Conquerours:</hi>
Not onely afterwards we ſhall be, but in all theſe
things, even whil'ſt we are under them, <hi>we are more
than Conquerours:</hi> The Conqueſt is obtained in the
very entrance of the Combat. <hi>This is the Victory that
over cometh the World even our Faith.</hi> Believe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
and thy <hi>Faith</hi> will be thy <hi>Victory,</hi> thy <hi>Shield</hi>
will be thy <hi>Palm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It will put all our Troubles to a <hi>preſent end:</hi>
Faith looks on things to come as preſent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
on things preſent as paſt: It looks on all things,
according as they will be in their iſſue and end: It
looks on things to come, according to what they will
be, when they are come. It looks on things preſent,
according to what they will be, when they are paſt. It
ſees all paſſing, and conſiders it as paſt already. It
ſees all paſſing, the World upon its Wing, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of it paſſeth away. It ſees the <hi>Riches</hi> of the
World upon their Wings; the Pride, and the Pomp,
and the Gallantry, and the Glory of the World, upon
their Wings: And it ſees the <hi>Poverty</hi> of the World,
the <hi>Troubles</hi> of the World, all upon the Wing. It
look; on the <hi>blackeſt Clouds,</hi> as <hi>flying Clouds,</hi> and it
conſiders all, as gone already. It looks on the clear,
that is, beyond the Clouds; it ſays, as God ſays, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
is fallen, is fallen:</hi> Not onely it ſhall fall, but it
is fallen, and ſhall not be able to riſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:151516:80"/>
And what place can there then be left for fear or
fainting? Was the Red Sea a <hi>Terrour</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
when they ſaw themſelves gotten to the other ſide?
Did <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s [dead] Lion fright him? Will the
Remembrance of what you [have] ſuffer'd be a
Terrour to you, when you have gotten through, and
are come out of Tribulation? Why, open the Eye
of your Faith, and ſee the Coaſt already clear? You
will ſee the Red Sea behind you, the Wilderneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
you, <hi>Jordan</hi> behind you, and your ſelves gotten
ſafe on the Banks of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come on Soul, what ſhould hinder thee? May
be, thou ſuppoſeſt, thou haſt a great Fight of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

things [thou ſhalt] ſuffer, till thou canſt fear thoſe
things thou [haſt] ſuffer'd. Though thou be now
putting on thy Armour, believe, and thou may'ſt boaſt
as if thou hadſt put it off: <hi>Death where is thy ſting?

                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Cheriſh, improve, increaſe your Faith,
and this will clear your way of all your fears. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>4. Be peaceable; your <hi>Preces &amp; lachrymae,</hi> will

them againſt all thoſe <hi>mighty hindrances</hi> that lie in the

by every thing that came upon us, than we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of, or could have imagined. It's true, the
<hi>Shimeis</hi> have been curſing, the <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> have been
mocking, the <hi>Rabſhakes</hi> have been railing, the
Ploughers have been ploughing, the Hunters have
been purſuing, and had almoſt overtaken, overcome,
and ſwallowed us up quick; but bleſſed be our
God, that hath not turned our captivity, and ſaved
us by a mighty Salvation; but hath done us good,
by all their mocking, and curſing, and raging againſt
us: Now we ſee, there was ſuch light ſowing in our
dark dayes; ſuch a Peace, a ſowing in thoſe deep
furrowes; ſuch an Harveſt of joy ſowing in the days
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:151516:84"/>
of our tears, as hath now ſprung up unto this glory,
and bleſſedneſs. We are beholding to the Devil,
and his Inſtruments; our enemies have befriended
us, though much againſt their Wills: We could
never have ſhined with ſuch beauty on earth, had
we not been ſcoured with ſuch unclean wiſpes; we
could never have laid up ſuch Treaſure in Heaven,
as by their curſings, and cruel perſecutions, our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
have laid up for us. So our Lord hath told us,
<hi>Great is your reward in heaven,</hi> Matth. 5. 12. Bleſſed
are you that are perſecuted, bleſſed are you that are
reviled for my ſake, for righteouſneſs ſake; for great
is your reward in heaven. It had not been ſo great,
had it not been for our great tribulations: Hell hath
given us a lift nearer the Throne of Glory. Comfort
and encourage your hearts with theſe words.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>If God be with you, you ſhall ſhortly be with
God;</hi> Father I will, that thoſe whom thou haſt given
me, be with me where I am: And if I go and prepare a
place for you, I will come again, and receive you to my
ſelf, that where I am, ye may be alſo. If we ſuffer with
him, we ſhall alſo reign with him. Come ye bleſſed of my
Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the
foundation of the World. So ſhall we be ever with the
Lord.</p>
               <p>Brethren, you that lie among the potts, 'tis but a
little time, and you ſhall hear that Word, <hi>Come up
hither,</hi> into the Kingdom, the Inheritance, prepared
for you. There are two <hi>Comes,</hi> or Calls of our Lord;
the firſt come, is, <hi>Come and work with me,</hi> come and
watch with me, come and follow me. The ſecond
is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

watch is over, your race is run, come and enter into
my reſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt Come is, <hi>Come down with me,</hi> from the
pride, from the pomps and jollities, of this preſent
World; come with me into the wilderneſs, into the
valley of tears, come and ſuffer with me, come and
die with me.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Come is, <hi>Come up with me,</hi> up out of
the wilderneſs, up out of your Priſons, up from your
bonds: your <hi>Jubilee</hi> is come; come up with me:
Come, put off your priſon-garments, and put on your
robes; ſhake off your fetters, and take up your
palms; lay down your Croſs; and take up your Crown:
from your priſons, to your Palace; from the ſtocks,
to the Throne: You that have deſcended with me,
are the ſame who ſhall now aſcend with me, to my
Father and your Father, to my God and your God.</p>
               <p>The firſt Come, is the <hi>come of a Suitor;</hi> Come
grant me your love; give me your hearts, and accept
of mine: This is the Errand, upon which his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
are diſpatched; As <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſervant,
to take you as a Wife for your Lord. This is the
meaning of all thoſe Jewels, and Bracelets, they
bring in their hands; the Lord ſends Servant upon
Servant, Epiſtle upon Epiſtle, Token upon Token,
and all ſpeak the ſame word, Come, come, come
away and accept of your Lord, and be married to
him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Come is, the <hi>Come of the Bridegroom,</hi>
Come home with me, into my holy City, into my
Royal Manſion; come into my Chamber, come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Boſome; come and lodg between my Breaſts,
live in my preſence, and reſt in my love for ever.</p>

                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> my buſineſs whil'ſt I have been with
you, hath been, to bring you to God, to eſpouſe you
10 Chriſt; and you that have already, or will yet at
laſt be perſwaded to give your conſent, and will give
me leave to make up the Match, I can give you aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
That he will ſhortly come and make up the
Marriage; and muſt ſay to you, as <hi>Naomi</hi> to <hi>Ruth,

you ſee how matters will fall; and however they
fall, know, your Lord will not be in reſt, till he have
finiſhed this thing, and brought you home, to be

               <p>I am now parting from you in this confidence,
that however, after a few dayes I ſhall ſee your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
no more in this World, yet I ſhall ſhortly meet
you in the Bride-Chamber of Glory, where we ſhall
ever be with the Lord.</p>
               <p>Beloved in the Lord, I muſt now leave you, but
give me leave e're I go, to deal freely with you, and
yet a little further, in the cloſe of my day, this once
more to open my heart to you; and to tell you,
<list>
                     <item>1. What my parting Fears,</item>
                     <item>2. What my parting Wiſhes for you are, which
I carry upon my ſpirit.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. My parting Fears, I go off from you with,
are eſpecially theſe:</p>
               <p>1. I am afraid, that there are many of you, upon
whom I have beſtowed my Labour in vain; I am
afraid that I have Inſtructed you in vain, exhorted,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:151516:86"/>
perſwaded, beſeeched, and reproved you in vain:
'Twas the Apoſtle's caſe, and his fear, concerning
the <hi>Galatians, Chap.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
               <p>It is my grief, that when I would have no more to
ſpeak, but an healing word, a comforting word; I
muſt yet drop down a bitter word on ſome of you;
That when I would ſpeak onely from <hi>Mount Geri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi>
I muſt yet again ſpeak to ſome from <hi>Mount
Ebal;</hi> That when I would leave a Bleſſing behind
me upon you all, I am like to leave ſome bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Curſe. It's grievous to me thus to ſpeak; yet
for the diſcharge of my Duty, and for your own Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
bear with me: I am afraid, that whil'ſt I
have been preaching to you, of an incorruptible
Crown, of an Everlaſting Reſt, a Kingdom of Joy
and Glory: I am afraid there are many of you, <hi>That
have no part nor lot in this matter, but are ſtill in the Gall
of Bitterneſs, and Bond of Iniquity; If the Goſpel be hid,
it is hid to them that are lost:</hi> And are there none
among you, from whom this Goſpel is hid? hid as to
the Light of it, hid as to the ſaving power, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of it? I am afraid there are too many; I am
afraid there's many a blind Eye, many an hard Heart,
many a Spirit ſtill in Priſon, under the power of their
Luſts, and Bruitiſh Senſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lity: I am afraid there are
many ſuch among you; and are not you afraid ſo to?
Oh that you were!</p>
               <p>2. I have a greater fear than this; I am afraid of
ſome of you, that not onely all my paſt Labours, but
this laſt will be loſt alſo. Thoſe that ſtand it out to
their laſt day, do uſually ſtand it out in their laſt day.
Bleſſed be God, that there are amongſt you thoſe,
over whom my Soul is comforted: To whom I can
ſpeak in the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 6. 16. God
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:151516:86"/>
be thanked, that ye were the Servants of ſin; but ye have
obeyed from the heart, that form of Doctrine that hath
been delivered unto you; and being now made free from
ſin, you are become the Servants of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Oh
that I could thus ſpeak! Oh that I could thus rejoyce
over you all! But as the Apoſtle ſaid to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
2 Cor. 12. 20. <hi>I fear, leſt when I (come) I ſhall
(find) you ſuch as I would not.</hi> So muſt I ſay, with a
grieved heart, I fear that now I am going I ſhall leave
you ſuch as I would not. I would not leave one blind
perſon, one vain perſon, one looſe liver, not one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer,
or impenitent, amongſt you all. Oh what a
good day, would this day of my departure be; what
Light would there be in this dark Evening, were it
thus with you: If I might ſee you all recovered out
of the Snares of the Devil, every man's Eyes open'd,
every man's Fetters off, every man's Priſon broken,
and his Soul eſcaped from that deadly bondage: if
every poor deadly Creature among you, who yet
lies bound hand and foot, in his Grave Clothes, might
now at laſt ſtand up from the Dead, and live the Life
of God, this would be mine and your great rejoycing.
But oh I fear with this Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 21. My
God will humble me,</hi> and grieve me, and afflict me, to
ſee in what an woful plight, I muſt leave divers of
you.</p>

your Darkneſs comprehendeth it not: Oh you poor,
obſtinate, and hardned Souls, upon whom I have been
ploughing, as upon Rocks, and hewing as upon Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants,
who ſtill remain under as great hardneſs, as
if no Dew nor Rain had ever fallen on you. Oh you
poor, half-bak'd, almoſt Chriſtians, that have taken

up your <hi>ſtand</hi> in your preſent Attainments; my Soul
is under great fears, and muſt weep in ſecret for
you, whil'ſt my Tongue muſt be henceforth ſilent:
Oh every Soul, that is without fear of himſelf, my

               <p>Sinners, let my fears be your fears: What, is there
ſuch aſtoniſhing guilt upon you, and yet not afraid?

and from houſe to houſe, to bring you under
a due fear and jealouſie of your ſelves; but hitherto
your hearts have been too hard for me: Oh yet for

               <p>2. My parting Wiſhes, and Deſires for you, are,</p>
               <p>1. That the good Seed which hath been ſown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you, were well rooted in every heart: I wiſh
that my Twenty Yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you a man, that may teach you in Wiſdom, gain
you in Love, lead you on to Life, by an Holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
and if the Lord grant you this mercy, I wiſh
that ſuch an one may be deatly priz'd and chearfully
accepted by you. God keep this Flock from a Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wolf, and a deceitful Shepheard.</p>
               <p>3. I wiſh that there may be no Root of Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſpringing up amongſt you; that there be no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
or Contentions, but that you may live in
peace and love, that the God of peace and love may
be with you.</p>
               <p>4. I wiſh that this place, where ſo much good
Seed hath been ſown, may become a <hi>fruitful Field,</hi>
that the Fruits of Faith and Repentance, the Fruits
of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, may be in you, and
abound; that you may be neither barren, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful;
that Religion, in the power and practice of
it, may ſo viſibly flouriſh, in the ſeveral perſons, in
the ſeveral Families, of this Congregation, that they

               <p>5. I wiſh, that whatever Clouds may at any time
gather over you, may not fall down in a withering
Storm, or a ſweeping Floud, but may paſs away in a

or <hi>Temptations,</hi> may ever carry you down the
Stream with evil men, nor blight any hopeful begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
that are budding forth in any of your Souls: If
<hi>Tribulation</hi> ſhould be any of your Lots, I wiſh it may

Hermon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. I wiſh you a joyful Harveſt, that you may reap
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:151516:88"/>
in Eternity, what hath been ſown in Time; may you
now ſow in Righteouſneſs, and hereafter reap in
Mercy: May every one that is now ſowing in
Tears, for ever reap in joy: May you that go on your
way weeping, bearing pretious Seed, return with
joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bring your Sheavs with you: May the Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of this day, be the watering of your Seed, that it

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi> My hearts deſire for you all is, that you
may be ſaved; and if there be any perſons, that bear
evil will to me, my particular wiſh for them, is, The
Good-will of him that dwelt in the Buſh be thoſe
Men's Portions for ever.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of my Wiſhes for you; will you
joyn your Wiſhes with mine: Will you turn your

<hi>The Lord grant thee thine hearts deſire, and fulfill all
thy Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi> Do I wiſh you any harm in all this? If
not, if it be to wiſhed, that the Word of Chriſt were
rooted in your Hearts, and your Souls thereby root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Grace of God; if it be to be wiſhed, That
your Luſts were rooted out, your ſins dead and dried
up, your foot gotten out of the Snare, your Souls
brought into the Fold, your Fruits of Righteouſneſs
and Holineſs abounding, and growing up unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life: If all this to be to be wiſhed, then give in
your Votes with mine; wiſh and pray, pray and preſs
on, preſs on and wait for the accompliſhment of this
Grace in you all. I tell you again, I wiſh you well;
and not onely I, but the Lord God that hath ſent me
to you: The Lord Jeſus wiſhes you well; he wiſhes
and wooes, wooes and weeps, weeps and dies, that
your Souls might live, and be belſſed for ever: He
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:151516:88"/>
hath once more ſent me to you, even to the <hi>worst
amongſt you,</hi> to tell you from him, that he's unwilling
you ſhould periſh; that he hath a kindneſs for you
in his heart, if you will accept it: He hath <hi>Bloud</hi> and
<hi>Bowels</hi> for you; <hi>Bloud</hi> to expiate your guilt, to waſh
away your filth; and <hi>Bowels</hi> to offer you the benefit
of his <hi>Bloud;</hi> with this Wiſh, <hi>Oh that it were theirs!
Oh that they would hearken and accept!</hi> Onely I muſt
add, That the Lord hath two ſorts of Wiſhes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſinners: The firſt is, <hi>Oh that they would hearken!</hi>
Oh that they would come in, be healed, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. This Wiſh is an <hi>Olive Branch,</hi> that
brings good Tidings, and gives great hopes of Peace
and Mercy.</p>
               <p>His laſt Wiſh is, <hi>Oh that they had hearkned,</hi> that
they had accepted, <hi>Pſal. 81. 13. Oh that my people had
hearkned to me.</hi> Luk. 19. 42. <hi>Oh that thou hadſt known
in this thy day, the things that concern thy peace.</hi> This
Wiſh hath nothing but Dread and Death in it: it is
the <hi>Black Flagg</hi> hung out, that proclaims <hi>Eternall
Wars.</hi> The ſence is, <hi>Iſrael</hi> had once a fair time of it;
a time of <hi>Love,</hi> a time of <hi>Grace,</hi> a time of <hi>Peace:</hi> Oh
that they had hearkned then, that they had known
the Things that concern their peace! But woe, woe
to them, 'tis now too late, the Door is ſhut, the Seaſon
is over, the Day is paſt; <hi>But now they are hid from
thine Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three deadly darts in this Wiſh [oh
that thou hadſt] it includes in it theſe three cutting
words,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Thou haſt not.</item>
                  <item>Thou mighteſt.</item>
                  <item>Thou ſhalt not for ever.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:151516:89"/>
1. There is this in it, [Thou haſt not.] What
have I not? why, thou haſt not known the things
that belong to thy peace. Thou haſt had the door of
Glory, the Gate of Heaven open to thee, and haſt
been call'd for, and invited in, but thou haſt loſt the
opportunity. Thou kneweſt not when thou wert well
offered, nor would'ſt take notice what a day was
before thee, what a price was in thine hand; thy
peace, the Goſpel of peace, the Prince of peace, a
Kingdom of peace was ſet open, offered, and
brought home to thy doors, but thou hadſt ſo many
other matters to look after, that thou tookeſt no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, but haſt let it ſlip. There's one Dart. [Thou
haſt not known.] There's a Goſpel gone, there's
a Chriſt gone, there's a Soul, a Kingdom loſt.</p>
               <p>2. There is this in it, [Thou mighteſt.] Oh
that thou hadſt? why, Might I? yes thou might'ſt,
if thou wouldſt thou mightſt. Thy God did not mock
thee, when he preach'd peace to thee; he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and wiſh'd it thine; if thou wouldſt, thou
mightſt have made it thine own; but whileſt he
would, thou wouldeſt not.</p>
               <p>There's another Dart [I might have known] I
have none to thank but my ſelf for the loſs, mine
undoing was mine own doing. There are no ſuch
torments, as when the Soul flies upon it ſelf, and
takes revenge on it ſelf; oh the gaſhes that ſuch
ſelf-refluctions make, Soul, how cameſt thou in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
into all this miſery? oh 'tis of my ſelf, my
ſelf, that my deſtruction is. The door was open, and
I was told of it, and was bid come in, but I would
not. That I am loſt and undone, was not my <hi>Fate,</hi>
which I could not avoid, but my <hi>Fault</hi> and my folly.
It ſeems to give ſome eaſe of our <hi>torment,</hi> when we
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:151516:89"/>
can ſhift off the <hi>fault.</hi> It was not I, but the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
ſaid <hi>Adam,</hi> It was not I, but the Serpent, ſaid
the Woman; if that had been true, it would have
given eaſe, as well as ſerv for an excuſe. This <hi>thought</hi>
['Twas mine own doing] tears the very caul of the
heart. Oh I have none to blame but my ſelf, mine
own fooliſh and froward heart. This is my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
this is my unbelief, this is my wilfulneſs, my
luſts, and my pleaſures, and my Idols, that I was run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
after that, have brought me under this dreadful
loſs. 'Twas my own doing.</p>
               <p>3. There is this in it, [Thou ſhalt not for ever.]
Oh that thou hadſt! why, may I not [yet?] Is there
no hope of recovering the opportunity? not one
word more, not one hour more, may not the Sun go
[one] degree backward? No, no, 'tis too late, too
late; thou haſt had thy day; from henceforth no
more for ever. There's the laſt Dart, [Times paſt]
there's the death, the Hell, the anguiſh, the Worm
that ſhall gnaw to eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This one word [Time's paſt] ſets all Hell a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and when its once ſpoken to a ſinner on Earth,
there's Hell begun. Go thy way wretch, fill up thy
meaſure, and fall into thy place. The Goſpel hath
no more to ſay to thee, but this one word,</hi> Becauſe
I have called, and thou refuſedſt, I have ſtretched out
my hand, and thou regardedſt not, but haſt ſet at nought all
my Counſels, and wouldeſt none of my reproofs; I alſo
will laugh at thy calamities, and mock when thy fear
cometh; when thy fear cometh as deſolation, and thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
cometh as a Whirle-wind, when diſtreſs and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
cometh upon thee; then ſhalt thou call, but I will
not anſwer, thou ſhalt ſeek me early, but ſhalt not find
me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:151516:90"/>
Beloved, my hopes are, and I am not able to ſay,
but that you are yet under the firſt wiſh; Oh that
they would. Chriſt is yet preaching you <hi>to faith,</hi> and
ſends his Wiſh along with his Word, <hi>Oh that they
would believe.</hi> Chriſt is yet preaching <hi>Repentance</hi>
and Converſion to you, and wiſhes, <hi>O that they
would repent,</hi> that they would be converted; and to
this wiſh of my Lord, my Soul, and all that is within
me, ſayes Amen.</p>
               <p>Brethren, will you yet again ſay your Lord nay?
ſhall Chriſt have his wiſh? ſhall your Servant for
Jeſus ſake ſhall I have my wiſh? will you now at
laſt conſent to be ſanctified, and to be ſaved? let me
have this wiſh, and I dare promiſe you from the
Lord, you ſhall have yours, even whatever your Soul

               <p>I heartily thank you, for your good wiſhes, and
good will towards me; for your willing and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
entertainment of my perſon, and attendance on
my Miniſtry. And particularly, for your paſſionate
deſire of my longer ſtay among you. Which deſire
if God had not, my Soul could not have denyed you.
Though the Almighty, to whoſe pleaſure it's meet
that we all ſubmit, hath ſaid Nay to that wiſh of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:151516:90"/>
yours; yet let your Souls ſay Amen, to this laſt of
mine, that the Lord God would dwell among you,
and in you, both now and for ever.</p>
               <p>And having thus finiſhed my Labours among
you, I ſhall now cloſe up with this double account.</p>
               <p>1. Of my diſcharge of my Miniſtry in this
place.</p>
               <p>2. Of my deprivall. And ſhall ſo commit you
to God, and to the word of his Grace, which is able
to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all them that are ſanctified.</p>
               <p>1. Of my diſcharge of my Miniſtry; what my
Doctrine and manner of life hath been, is known to
you; and what my aim and intent hath been; is
known to God. The ſearcher of hearts, knowes, that
'tis the ſalvation of Souls, that hath been the mark at
which I have levelled. My way hath been to uſe all
plainneſs, that I might be made manifeſt in your
Conſciences: Weakneſſes, and infirmities, both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and ſinful, (the Lord pardon it) I have had
many. I am ſenſible, that much more might have
been done, both in publick and in private, had it not
been for a weakly body, and a ſloathful heart.</p>
               <p>I repent that I have had no more zeal for God, no
more compaſſion to Souls; I repent that I have been
no more conſtant, and importunate with you, about
the matters of Eternity. Oh <hi>Eternity, Eternity,</hi> that
thou wert no more in the heart, and Lips of the
Preacher in the hearts, and eares of the hearers. But
while I thus judge my ſelf for my failings. Bleſſed
be God for any ſincerity to his name, and good will
to your Souls, that he hath ſeen in me. Bleſſed be
God, I have a witneſs in my Conſcience, and I hope
in yours alſo, that I have not ſhunned to declare
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:151516:91"/>
to you, the whole Counſel of God. Brethren, I call
Heaven and Earth to witneſs this day, that <hi>I</hi> have ſet
before you life and death, good and evil, and have
not ceaſed from day to day, to warn you to chooſe
life, and that good way, that leads to it; and to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
for your lives, from the way of ſin and death.
Oh remember the many inſtructions <hi>I</hi> have given
you, the many Arguments whereby <hi>I</hi> have ſtriven
with you, the many Prayers that have been offered
up, for the guiding and gaining your Souls, into the
path of life, and the turning your feet out of the way
of deſtruction. Oh might <hi>I</hi> be able to give this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
concerning you all, at my departure, <hi>they
have troden in the right path, they have choſen the good
part that ſhall not be taken from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren, Beloved, with whom <hi>I</hi> have travelled
in birth, that Chriſt might be formed in you; <hi>I</hi> muſt
ſhortly give up my account in a more ſolemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
will you help me to give it up with joy, by
ſhewing your Souls before the Lord, as the Seal of
my Miniſtrie. Every ſincere Convert among you,
will be a Crown of rejoycing to me in that day. So
let me rejoyce, and let my joy be the joy of you
all.</p>
               <p>What ſhall <hi>I</hi> ſay more? If there be any conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, any bowels
and mercies; if the Glorie of the Eternal God, the
Honour of the everlaſting Goſpel, the ſafety of your
immortal Souls, the incorruptible Crown, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
eternal weight of glory, weigh any thing
with you, then once more let me be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eech you, by all
this, to hearken to that word of the Goſpel, which
God hath ſpoken to you by me.</p>
               <p>2. Of my deprivall. The moſt glorious morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:151516:91"/>
hath its Evening; the hour is come wherein the
Sun is ſetting, upon not a few of the Prophets; the
ſhadows of the Evening are ſtretched forth upon us;
our day drawes, our work ſeems to be at an end. Our
Pulpits, and our places muſt know us no more.</p>
               <p>This is the Lords doing, let all the Earth keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
before him.</p>
               <p>It is not a light thing for me, Brethren, to be laid
aſide from the work, and caſt out of the Vineyard of
the Lord; and it muſt be ſomething of weight, that
muſt ſupport under ſo ſevere a doom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> know there are not a few, that will add to the
affliction of the afflicted, by telling the World, 'tis
their own fault, they might prevent it if they would;
whether this be ſo or no, God knoweth, and let the
Lord be Judge. Bleſſed be God, whatever be, this
is not laid to our charge, as the reaſon of our ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

               <p>You are not ignorant, what things there are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on us, as the condition of our continuing our
Miniſtration; which how lawful and expedient ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they ſeem in the Judgment of many, yet have
the moſt ſpecious Arguments that plead for them,
left me utterly diſſatisfied in my Conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them.</p>
               <p>I muſt profeſs before God, Angels, and men, that
my non-ſubmiſſion, is not from any diſloyalty to
Authority, nor from pride, humour, or any factious
diſpoſition, or deſign; but, becauſe I dare not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
my light, nor do any thing concerning which
my heart tells me, the Lord ſayes, do it not.</p>

After all my moſt impartial Enquiries, after all

and conſulting with men of all perſwaſions,
about theſe <hi>Matters,</hi> I find my ſelf ſo far ſhort of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
that I am plainly put to this choice, to
part with my <hi>Ministry,</hi> or my <hi>Conſcience.</hi> I dare not
lie before God and the World; nor come and tell
you, I approve, I allow, I heartily conſent, to what I
neither do, nor can; but muſt chooſe rather, that my

out by a <hi>Lie:</hi> Through the Grace of God, though
men do, yet my heart ſhall not reproach me while I
