         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sacred SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE Your Majeſties moſt Faithful and Obedient
Subjects, of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
have long, with the greateſt and ſincereſt joy, beheld,
what we hope is in ſome meaſure an effect of our own
Prayers; the generous Emulation of our fellow-Subjects
contending who ſhould firſt and beſt expreſs their
Duty and Gratitude to their Sovereign at this time
eſpecially, when the ſeditious Endeavours of unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Men have made it neceſſary to aſſert the
antient Loyalty of the Engliſh Nation, and make the
World ſenſible, that we do not degenerate from thoſe
prime Glories of our Anceſtors, Love and Allegiance
to our Prince.</p>
            <p>That we were not ſeen in thoſe <hi>Loyal</hi> Crowds, but
choſe rather to ſtand by and applaud their Honeſt and
Religious Zeal; we humbly preſume will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the want to it in our ſelves, either by Your
Majeſty or your People. For, <hi>SIR,</hi> it is (at preſent)
the great Honour of this your Univerſity, not only to
be ſteadfaſt and conſtant in our Duty, but to be
eminently ſo, and to ſuffer for it, as much as the
Calumnies and Reproaches of Factious and Malicious
Men can inflict upon us: And that they have been
hitherto able to do no more then vent the venom of
their Tongues; that they have not proceeded to
Plunder and Sequeſtration; to violate our Chappels,
rifle our Liberaries, and empty our <hi>Colledges,</hi> as
once they did; Next to the over-ruling Providence
of Almighty God, is only due to the Royal Care and
Prudence of your moſt Sacred <hi>Majeſty,</hi> who gave ſo
ſeaſonable a check to the Aabitrary and Inſolent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.</p>
            <p>But no earthly Power we hope, no <hi>Menacies</hi> or
<hi>Miſery</hi> ſhal ever be able to make us renounce, or forget
our Duty. We will ſtill believe and maintain, That
our Kings derive not their Titles from the People,
but from God; that to him only they are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
that it belongs not to Subjects, either to Create
or Cenſure, but to Honour and Obey their Sovereign,
who comes to be ſo, by a Fundamental Hereditary
Right of Succeſſion, which no Religion, no Law, no
Fault or Forfeiture can alter or diminiſh.</p>
            <p>Nor will we ever abate of our well-inſtructed Zeal
for our moſt Holy Religion, as it is profeſſed, and
by Law eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that
Church which hath ſo long ſtood, and ſtill is the
Envy and Terror of her Adverſaries, as well as the
Beauty and Strength of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>It is thus, Dread <hi>SIR,</hi> That we have Learned
our own, and thus we teach others their Duty to G<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="2 letters">
