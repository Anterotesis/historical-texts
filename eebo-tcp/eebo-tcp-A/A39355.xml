            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <byline>By <hi>Edmund Elys,</hi> a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt.</byline>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Conſider that the Controverſie that you and I are ingaged in, is of infinitely greater concern to all Men than all the Conteſts of all the Kings, and other Potentates in the World about Temporal Power and Dominion: For <hi>the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as a drop of a Bucket, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109233:2"/>
are counted as the ſmall Dust of the Balance</hi>: But THE TRUE LIGHT, concerning whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Souls of Men, we are now to Diſpute, is, <hi>The High, and Lofty One that inhabiteth Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi> I beſeech you therefore to conſider that you muſt give account at the Day of Judgment of every word you ſhall return in Anſwer, to what I ſhall here ſay in vindication of the Truth concerning <hi>The Light within,</hi> Aſſerted by <hi>W. P.</hi> in his ſmall Treatiſe, Entituled, <hi>The Key,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 12.
<q>Never was any Nation, or any Generation, or any one Man inſtructed by <hi>that</hi> Light that is in the Conſcience of every Man, that there ever was ſuch a one as Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> much leſs, that he was the <hi>Lord,</hi> and leaſt of all what he required of his Servants and Attendants: Therefore no light within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Mankind, can be the Rule of the Chriſtian Religion. So that the notorious Experience of all Men confutes the pretence of the Quakers, ſince it was never poſſible for any Man to learn, the leaſt part of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Light within that is in every Man's Conſcience.</q>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whoever did not <hi>Rebel againſt the Light,</hi> which is in the Conſcience of every Man, did believe that there was <hi>ſuch a one as Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> as ſoon as this Truth was <hi>Declar'd</hi> unto him by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>His Apoſtles,</hi> or any other that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <hi>Authority</hi> from CHRIST to <hi>Preach the Goſpel.</hi> In a ſincere Conformity to the Law of GOD <hi>written in the Heart,</hi> is implyed a <hi>Virtual</hi> Aſſent to all Truth. You ſay, (<hi>p.</hi> 26.) That,
<q>Our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is an inward Senſe perceiving immediately nothing but our own Thoughts, which thoughts are therefore its Notices; and the Minds perceptive, Power preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe in it ſelf, is the Light in the Conſcience of every Man.</q>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> CONSCIENCE is the KNOWLEDGE <hi>of the Law of God in</hi> Conjunction with the KNOWLEDGE of the <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or Difformity of</hi> our own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Omiſſions thereunto: By <hi>Knowledge</hi> here I mean the <hi>Inward Man,</hi> or <hi>the Heart</hi> conſider'd, as <hi>Knowing the Law of God,</hi> &amp;c. The Truth of what I ſay is evident from theſe Texts of <hi>Scripture, Rom.</hi> 2.15. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20, 21. This is a groſs Falſhood that <hi>Conſcience perceives nothing immediately but our own Thoughts:</hi> For it immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <hi>the Law of God,</hi> viz. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf</hi>; after that it perceives the Conformity, or Difformity of our own Actions, or Omiſſions thereunto. In the <hi>Law of God written in the Heart,</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly imployed the <hi>Idea of God</hi>; for we cannot have any Perception of the Law of God without ſome Perception, Notion, or <hi>Idea</hi> of His Exiſtence. This <hi>Innate Idea,</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Perception of the Divine Being, the one being abſolutely infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, is that peculiar Participation of <hi>Eternal</hi> REASON, The WORD, <hi>which was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with God, and which was God,</hi> with which our Bleſſed Creator, the Fountain of all Goodneſs has endued all Rational Souls. This I ſuppoſe is that which <hi>W. P.</hi> means
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109233:2"/>
by <hi>His own Light,</hi> viz. the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Emanation of the WORD, or REASON ESSENTIAL upon <hi>All Rational Souls.</hi> 'Tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently obſerv'd by <hi>W. P. Key. p.</hi> 2. that, <hi>This Light is ſomething elſe than the bare <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding Man hath as a Rational Creature: For as ſuch, Man cannot be a Light to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but has only a capacity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by means of the Light, with which Chriſt, the Word, enlighteneth him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Humane Intellect, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> is called <hi>Reaſon,</hi> becauſe it is the power or faculty of perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emanations of the <hi>Eſſential Reaſon,</hi> the Fountain of all Truth, and Goodneſs. You tell us that
<q>The Mind's perceptive Power preſenting theſe (our Thoughts) in it ſelf is the Light in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of every Man.</q>
I ſuppoſe upon ſecond thoughts you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this: What! is the Power, or Faculty perceptive of <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> it ſelf? I'le grant that the Humane Underſtanding, or Intellectual preceptive Faculty, being the Eye of the Soul, may be called the Light that is in us; not becauſe we are conſcious of our Thoughts, but becauſe we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of perceiving the TRUE LIGHT in our own Souls.</p>
            <p>You ſay,
<q>This light is the Deity it ſelf, and then the Soul of every Man will be Deified thereby.</q>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo but the Soul of every Man that <hi>Walks in this Light,</hi> that adheres to it, as the <hi>Principle</hi> of all his Actions, may truly be ſaid to be made <hi>Partaker of the Divine Nature,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.. It is a moſt horrid Error (if not plain <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi>) to ſay as you do, that
<q>It was never poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to learn the leaſt part of the Chriſtian Religion by the Light within, that is in every Man's Conſcience:</q>
For by the Light within we underſtand CHRIST himſelf, and that Light which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Flows from Him, the Fountain of Light, the <hi>Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> which we are called to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect</hi> upon, and Conform our <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> thereunto, by all the Notices that GOD gives of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by any of his WORDS, or WORKS. Whatever knowledge a Man can have of the ſenſe or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of any Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> without this <hi>Reflexion or immediate Application</hi> of the <hi>Will and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to Chriſt himſelf,</hi> the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Light</hi> in his own Soul, ſuch Knowledge is rather the <hi>Picture, Form, or Image of Knowledge, than True Divine Knowledge: 'Tis that Knowledge which puffeth up,</hi> and renders Men more like the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Father of Lies.</hi> 'Tis only by obeying the Light <hi>within,</hi> or by our adherence to the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> in our own Hearts, that we can ever attain to the knowledge of the <hi>Truth, as it is in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi>; that is, as it ſaves thoſe that have any apprehenſion of it, <hi>from their Sins. p.</hi> 21. you have theſe words:
<q>God is Light, and God is within other things, as well as Men; is then God a Light within to every Tree, or Beaſt, or Star?</q>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> GOD, being the ONE abſolutely infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, is in every Creature; but He is a Light only to thoſe Creatures, which he has endued with a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of having ſome ſight, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivance of Him. I deſire you wou'd Peruſe all thoſe Papers which
