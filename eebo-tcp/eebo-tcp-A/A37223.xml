            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thou art my portion O Lord; I have said that I

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have an Account of <hi>David</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
and Choice: His Choice
is expressed in the former clause,

said</hi> (or I have promised) <hi>that I

            </p>
            <p>From the former we may observe, That it is
a special part of Wisdom to have ones <hi>choice</hi> well
and throughly fixed; and particularly to have it
fixed upon God, so <hi>as to</hi> make him our portion.</p>
            <p>First it is a matter of great importance, and a
special part of wisdom, to have ones Choice well

tend, and all his other ends be subordinate. For
as the Moralists truly tell us, it is impossible for
him to govern his Actions well, who has not in
the main, directed his life to one <hi>certain end.</hi> 'Tis
the Observation of a great and wise man; Saith
he, Consider mankind, consule your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
or your reading, you shall find but a very
few persons, who have directed their life to one
certain and assured course, which is the truest
drift of Wisdom: and therefore it is, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is generally so defective.</p>
            <p>For the avoiding of which unsettledness and
want of <hi>design</hi> in mens actions, the Advice of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
is very material;<note place="margin">Epist. 71.</note> As often as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
what thou shouldest do, or what thou shouldest
avoid; be sure to look for direction to that which
thou hast made thy <hi>chief End;</hi> for to that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou doest, ought to agree: But then be
sure that thou have first settled that. For 'tis an
errour, that we pretend to advise about particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Ends, when we have not resolv'd upon, nor
settled the <hi>general End,</hi> without which no man
can arrive at any certainty or Uniformity of
Living.</p>
            <p>That thus to have settled one's End, and the
scope and design of one's Life, is a matter of
great importance, may be confirmed from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42793:3"/>
Observation and Experience. 'Tis so in
all the Affairs and Undertakings of Men. He
who <hi>addicts</hi> himself to the War, and resolv's up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that kind of life, is much more likely to do
great things in the <hi>Martial way,</hi> than he who
only <hi>happens</hi> to be a Souldier, or is driven to it by
Necessity. Or, he who intends for Merchandize,
if he resolves to make it his business, and bends
his Mind and Thoughts that way, is more likely
to thrive and grow rich, than he who is not yet
resolv'd what Profession to follow.</p>
            <p>He who is thus loose and undetermined in his
choice, is like to do but little good in any thing
he sets about, till he be better resolv'd.</p>
            <p>Even so it is in our Christian Profession;
He who hopes to attain to the <hi>Ends</hi> of Religion,
must make it his business: he must remember
above all things whither he is design'd. There
are many things that will interpose and require
some of his time and thoughts, but that which
is <hi>Chief</hi> in his heart must be, that he may gain that
<hi>Pearl of great price,</hi> and arrive at that happiness
which he has made his choice.</p>
            <p>As Merchants in their Voyage touch at divers
Ports to cleanse and victual, and perhaps trade
for some small matters: But their chief care and
drift is, that they may get with safety to the Port
whither they are bound: So 'tis with every dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> which is above; and his principal
Care and Endeavour is that he may get with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thither.</p>
            <p>Now by the Consent of the Wise Men of all
Ages, the great and <hi>last End</hi> of Man is <hi>Happiness.</hi>
And amongst us Christians, there is no Question,
but <hi>that</hi> happiness consists in the Favour and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of God: such an enjoyment of him in
this life as this life is capable of, and a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and immediate fruition of him in Heaven.
<hi>This</hi> therefore is our <hi>main End. This</hi> we ought to
fix upon as the Principal Object of our Choice, and
to look upon it as our great business in this World,
That God may be our Portion.</p>
            <p>This is the Second Branch of the Proposition,
That 'tis the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of every Man and Woman
to make God their Choice and Portion.</p>
            <p>What it is to make God our Portion, is plain
enough from the common notion of the Word
<hi>Portion,</hi> which signifies a shame in the division of
any thing; specially of Estates and Inheritances;
such a share as Parents use to give their Children,
which being the necessary foundation of their


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42793:4"/>
subsistence in the World, they look upon it as
their main <hi>Dependence.</hi> So ought God to be the
<hi>Portion</hi> of every faithful Soul, that is, He ought to
be the <hi>Comfort,</hi> the <hi>Treasure,</hi> the main <hi>Dependence</hi>
of every faithful person.</p>
            <p>But how can the infinite incomprehensible
God be said to be the Portion of a Creature?</p>
            <p>We must know, that the Expression is not to be
understood of God Personally or Essentially. For
so, no Creature can comprehend, contain or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
him. But it is spoken according to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Style of Scripture, and may be explained by
other places of the like nature. As where God
calls <hi>Abraham</hi> his <hi>Friend,</hi> and tells him, <hi>I am thy
shield, and thy exceeding great reward,</hi> Gen. 15. 1.
And where <hi>David</hi> calls God his <hi>comfort</hi> and his
<hi>joy,</hi> his <hi>hope,</hi> his <hi>rock,</hi> his <hi>fortress,</hi> and the like;
which Expressions are not to be understood in a
strict and literal, but in an Analogical sence.</p>
            <p>So that the Particle <hi>Thou,</hi> must be understood
either Exclusively, or Causally.</p>
            <p>First, Exclusively, <hi>Thou,</hi> and <hi>none other</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of <hi>thee;</hi> As if the holy Psalmist had said,
I value my Interest in <hi>Thee</hi> far above all other
things.</p>
            <p>All other things, as they are infinitely <hi>below</hi>
thee, so I do not think they deserve to be named
in Comparison with thee. The same thing is


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42793:5"/>
most fully and affectionately exprest, Psal. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.
where <hi>David</hi> seems at first to have admired <hi>Riches</hi>
and Prosperity, to have thought them a Valuable
<hi>Portion,</hi> and therefore to have envied the Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the wicked; but when he better consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and saw the Vanity and Uncertainty of their
condition, being destitute of the fear and favour
of God; he retracted his opinion, and altered his
Choice. Then he preferr'd God before <hi>all,</hi> vers.
25, 26. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is
none upon Earth that I desire in comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength if
my heart, and my portion</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>If we thus explain the Psalmist's words, by way
of <hi>Comparison,</hi> the Wisdom of his <hi>Choice</hi> is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that it needs not to be proved. For what
is any creature in comparison of the Creator?
What is outward splendor or felicity, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the Favour of God, which is better than
life it self? What are the goods of this world, to
that Immortal Kingdom which is above? What
are the poor low gratifications of our <hi>Senses</hi> and
vain <hi>Affections</hi> for the present, in comparison of
those Purer Delights, and more Excellent Glories
of the Kingdom of God? Indeed there is no <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison</hi>
betwixt <hi>these,</hi> and therefore it were very
needless to insist on this sence any farther.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou</hi> art <hi>my Portion,</hi> to wit, <hi>Causally;


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42793:5"/>
Thou,</hi> that is, the <hi>Emanations</hi> of thy <hi>Goodness</hi> are my
Portion.</p>
            <p>God is to be loved and chosen in regard of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<hi>Perfections:</hi> In regard of his Power, whereby
he does whatsoever he pleases in all the World; In
regard of his <hi>All-sufficiency,</hi> because he alone is able
to make us perfectly happy; In regard of his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> whereby he knowes the Exigencies
of our Condition, and what is fittest to be done for
us: But specially, in regard of his <hi>Goodness,</hi> and the
<hi>Effects and Emanations</hi> of it, whereby he is inclined to
concern his Wisdom and Power and Providence,
for the good of them that love him. So that to
speak <hi>explicitly,</hi> it is as much as if <hi>David</hi> had said,
Oh Lord! the <hi>Participations</hi> of thy <hi>Goodness</hi> are my
Portion. Thy Word and thy Blessing, thy Favour
and Protection, the assistance of thy Grace, and the
sense of thy Love, thy Gracious and Comfortable
Presence now, and the hope of enjoying thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Presence hereafter; these are my Choice, my
Portion, and my onely Treasure.</p>
            <p>Let us take a short view of each of these, and we
shall find that they amount together to a vast Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Thy <hi>Word,</hi> and the Gracious manifestations
of <hi>thy Self</hi> and of thy <hi>Will</hi> therein, is to me a great
Portion and Treasure. Nothing will be more plain
to us, than that <hi>David</hi> esteemed it so; if we read
over this Psalm, and observe, how often he


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42793:6"/>
mentions and celebrates the Word of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
the great Love and Esteem that he had for his
Statutes and Commandments. We may see it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in every other Verse of the Psalm throughout.
What Interjections of Love and Delight does he
breath out upon this Occasion! v. 97. <hi>Oh how I love
thy Law! all the day long is my study in it.</hi> And in the
beginning of the Psalm, vers. 14. <hi>I have rejoyced in the
way of thy Testimonies, as much as in all Riches.</hi> And
vers. 111. he professes that they were his Portion,
and his Joy. <hi>Thy Testimonies have I claimed as my heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for ever, and why? they are the very joy of my heart.</hi>
Certainly, howsoever we value it, 'tis a singular
Favour of God, that he vouchsafes us his Word for
our guidance and direction; and that he ha's been
pleased therein, to discover to us somewhat of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and of our duty and happiness.</p>
            <p>Neither of <hi>these</hi> could be known any otherwise,
with any measure of Certainty; and without the
knowledg of them, how sad and uncomfortable
would our condition be? To find in our selves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
after <hi>Happiness,</hi> and yet not to know what that
Happiness is, nor where to find it; to feel our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
calamitous and unhappy, and not to know to
whom to address our selves for help, nor upon what
considerations to <hi>stay</hi> our minds; to have a stormy
and troublesome <hi>Journey</hi> to go, and at the End of it,
no other repose than that of the <hi>Cold Grave</hi> and the
<hi>Chambers</hi> of Death; the Uncertainty it self, and much


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42793:6"/>
more such Expectations, would be sad and amazing.
Yet such would our condition be, were it not for
the Light of God's Holy Word; which alone ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us with the Gracious <hi>Purposes</hi> of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, and the provision which he hath made for
our everlasting Happiness after death; whereby we
are armed with courage and good Hope, and inabled
to bear all things cheerfully, in a joyful apprehension
and assured expectation of the Glory, that shall be
revealed.</p>
            <p>Without Divine Revelation, we could be at no
Certainty in matters of Religion; which would
reduce us wholly to a life of <hi>Sense,</hi> and render our
condition no better that of the Beasts that perish.
Nay, it would be much worse than that of the
Beasts. For though perhaps their Pleasures and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
are not so <hi>refined</hi> as those of <hi>Voluptuous</hi>
men; yet neither are they so Interrupted with the
Conscience of death, which as oft as it occurs, even
in the midst of Laughter, is enough to make the
Heart Sorrowful. And from this, nothing can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us, but that which upon possible Conditions
gives us hope of the Comforts and Joyes of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Life.</p>
            <p>Briefly, What Light is to the World, that the
Word of God is to the Soul. Take away the Light,
and what do all the Works of Art and Nature signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie?
The World it self seems to be vanish't, when
the Light is gone; and if it should so continue, the


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42793:7"/>
World would be a Chaos, and a Dungeon, not worth
the Inhabiting. So truly without this <hi>Divine Light,</hi>
we should be <hi>lost</hi> as to our spiritual and rational;
that is, to our best Capacities; which ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to indear unto us the presence, and possession of
this Sacred Treasure, and ingage us to <hi>walk in the
Light</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> As the Knowledg, so much more the
Grace of God, is a great Portion.</p>
            <p>Under this may be comprehended, both the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Acts of the Divine Providence, and also the
Comforts and Assistances of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>First, in respect of the Divine <hi>Protection</hi> and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
so <hi>David</hi> esteemed God his Portion. As if he
had said; Oh Lord! by thy Providence I live, and
by thy Goodness I am maintain'd and preserv'd, and
deliver'd out of all danger and distress; and not
only so, but I have a comfortable life, and a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
subsistence, (as we know God rais'd him from
the Sheepfold to the Throne,) and what more can a
man have to his Portion? We might truly say the
same, if we had thankful hearts as he had, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from whence our Blessings come. Our Houses,
our Lands, our Wealth, our Friends, our Children,
and whatsoever else we value, or account dear to us
in this World, proceed all from the Bounty and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Providence of God. And therefore in reason,
these <hi>later,</hi> as being the <hi>Causes</hi> of the former, ought
to be esteemed our Portion, rather than the things
themselves. The things themselves may be lost, or


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42793:7"/>
taken from us; but the <hi>Causes</hi> of them are a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that cannot fail. <hi>The goodness of the Lord endures
for ever, and ever, upon them that fear him, and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
upon Childrens Children.</hi> Psal. 103. 17.</p>
            <p>Again, in respect of the <hi>Aids</hi> of God's grace, and
the assistances of his Holy Spirit; so <hi>David</hi> accounted
the <hi>Lord</hi> to be <hi>his Portion.</hi> As if he had faid; When
I consider the greatness of my sins already commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the weakness and proneness of my Nature
to fall into the same or the like again, and thereby
to provoke thy wrath, and expose my self to the
dreadful <hi>Effects</hi> of it: when notwithstanding all
this, I consider that there is <hi>forgiveness with thee,</hi> to
pardon my sins, and remit my deserved punishment;
and not only so, but that thou art pleased to give me
grace, and strength, and tenderness of heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I am preserv'd and restrain'd from running head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into ruine: when I consider all this, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
do I find my self bound to thy Grace, how
deservedly ought I to esteem it my Portion and
Treasure? I should be a miserable Creature without
it, and therefore I cannot but think my self happy, in
that thou art pleased to make me a partaker of it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Thou art my Portion,</hi> that is, thy Presence,
and the hope of Enjoying thee, is my Portion. As
if it had been said; This is that which I mainly aim
at and long after; this is that which I esteem my
great and last Happiness: That after the enjoyment
of thy gracious Presence here, I shall enjoy thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42793:8"/>
Presence hereafter. This is indeed the great
Portion and Inheritance of the Sons of God, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
and hope, and expectation of every faithful
person. Every thing besides this, is too little and
mean, to be the Portion of an Immortal Creature.</p>
            <p>The place we now converse in, and the things
that are before us, are indeed fit accommodations for
our <hi>Journey,</hi> but these we must leave behind us to the
next Travellers that come after. We may not abide
by these, but hasten towards <hi>another Countrey,</hi> that is
an <hi>heavenly,</hi> where our Portion and Inheritance is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for us. On this Portion, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi>
and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Holy Men of God, have ever
depended. And we find that it was the <hi>result</hi> of
<hi>David</hi>'s dependence in an eminent manner, <hi>Ps.</hi> 17.
14, 15. Where <hi>David</hi> distinguisheth himself from
the men of the World, who have their portion in
this life; and declares what his portion was; <hi>As for me,</hi>
(saith he) <hi>I will behold thy face in Righteousness, and when
I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it;</hi>
which is generally interpreted of the Presence of
God in that blessed Estate after the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>This is the first Argument to prove the Wisdom
of this choice, because of the Excellent things that
are contained in this Portion; the Knowledg of
God, the Light and Comfort of his word, the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of his grace, the protection of his providence,
the sense of his favour and gracious presence here,
and the hope of the Vision and fruition of him in


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42793:8"/>
glory: To these may be added, (as an inforcement to
this first Argument,) the excellent <hi>properties</hi> of this
portion, and the things contained in it; to wit, the
<hi>sufficiency,</hi> and <hi>durableness</hi> of them; as also their <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness</hi>
to the Nature, and necessities of our Souls.</p>
            <p>First, One excellent property of this portion, is its
<hi>sufficiency.</hi> It is able of it self alone to make us
happy. This property the Philosophers required
in their <hi>Supreme God.</hi> But they knew not well,
where, nor in what object, to look for it: because
they knew not God. They turned themselves first
to one Object, and then to another; to health, and
wealth, and honour, and pleasure, and wisdome,
and whatsoever else they could devise. They found
some worth and <hi>Convenience</hi> in many of these things;
but as for that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or self sufficiency, which
they required to the constitution of true happiness,
in vain did they seek for that in any Creature. Every
thing under the Sun, in this respect, is no better than
<hi>Vanity and vexation of Spirit.</hi> The likeliest thing they
could think on, wherein to place Happiness, was the
Operation of Virtue; which indeed is a Lovely and
Venerable thing: but far enough (in many cases)
from making the possessor happy, were it not for
that God, who is the gracious <hi>Incourager</hi> and Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it. He alone hath that Fulness and All
sufficiency in himself, which can fill all our Souls,
and answer all our Wants, and satisfie our utmost.
Capacities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42793:9"/>
So <hi>David</hi> resolves in another place, where he seems
to put this Question, concerning the happiness of
Man, <hi>Ps. 4. 6. Who will shew us any good?</hi> he resolv's
it thus, <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon
us.</hi> And in the following Verse, he declares; <hi>Thou
hast put gladness in my heart, more than</hi> ever Worldly
men had <hi>in the time, that their Corn and Wine and Oyt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.</hi>
And so again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 144. after he had
reckoned up the Blessings of this life, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
thus; <hi>Happy are the people that are in such a
case, yea blessed are the people, who have the Lord for their
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Second Property of this Portion, is, that 'tis
<hi>certain,</hi> and <hi>durable.</hi> It is the great disparagement
of all the things of this World, that they are all
finite and transitory. The Psalmist therefore justly
reproves the folly of those Worldly great men, who
persuaded themselves, that <hi>their houses should continue
for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations, and
called their Lands after their own names;</hi> whereas <hi>Man
being in honour abideth not, but</hi> (in respect of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>mortal</hi> condition) <hi>is like the Beasts that perish,</hi>
Ps. 4. 11, 12. Honour, and Wealth are <hi>slippery</hi>
things, that can hardly be ensured to any man for
the little time of this life, but 'tis certain they can
be kept no longer. <hi>No man can carry away any thing
with him when he dies, neither shall his Pomp follow
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Daily Observation and Experience proves the


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42793:9"/>
same in all other Examples. The best things we
have of this World are here to day and gone to
morrow. A few daies, or perhaps a few hours,
shall change the most Vigorous health into sickness,
and languishing. He who now lives delicately,
and at ease, will within a short time be arrested, if
not with want, yet with pains and infirmities, that
will make his good things tastless and unsavoury,
and bring him down to the Worms and Dust. He
who is happy in his friends or relations, must expect
e're long to part with them, and to have nothing
left of them, but the bare remembrance. The same
is equally true of all other Worldly enjoyments.
We may possibly out-live all our share of them. It
has happen'd so to many, the greatest men in their
times; such as <hi>Croesus, Darius, Perseus,</hi> and many
more; who from great and high estates, as it were
from the <hi>top</hi> of Worldly felicity, were <hi>tumbled down</hi>
as in a moment into bonds and poverty, and all the
extremities of an unprosperous condition. But
what need we examples of that, when we see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the World but Change and Uncertainty, of
which every one is or shall be an Example <hi>himself,</hi>
even thou who readest, as well as he who has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
The World <hi>must</hi> fail every one who depends
on it, for two certain causes; because <hi>that</hi> is muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and <hi>we</hi> are mortal. God hath made every thing
here mutable by the standing Laws of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and he hath made our condition here as well


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42793:10"/>
by the <hi>Laws and Constitutions</hi> of our Nature, as by his
positive Sentence and Appointment; so that in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respect we can have here no durable certain
portion.</p>
            <p>But what a weakness or rather madness is it, to
chuse that for ones portion, which he is <hi>sure</hi> to lose?
how extremely miserable must his condition be,
when he comes to have his Portion taken from him?
When a man who has made this World, and his own
will and pleasure in it, his only end and portion,
shall be strip't of these, and have nothing left to
carry with him when he goes out of it, but an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
Conscience! nothing of good, not so much
as good hope lest, to nourish and satisfie his Soul in
its endless duration!</p>
            <p>How much a wiser and happier course shall we
take, to secure to our selves that <hi>other Portion</hi> which
is certain and perpetual? God is Eternal, and his
Favour is Endless, 'tis not subject (in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
to diminution or decay. It lasts as long as we
live; and when we die, it accompanies us into the
other World, and gives us comfort and confidence in
his presence and the holy Angels, and puts us into
the possession of never-ceasing joyes. To this Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therefore does our Blessed Saviour direct his
Disciples, <hi>Matth. 6. 19, 20. Lay not up for your selves
treasures upon Earth, where rust and moth corrupt, and where
thieves break through and steal: but lay up for your selves
Treasures in Heaven, where neither rust nor moth do cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42793:10"/>
and where Thieves do not break through, nor steal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, This is such a Portion as provides for the
necessities of the <hi>Soul.</hi> The comforts of it are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and internal, and so more suitable to the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and better part of Man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Soul</hi> is a Principle distinct from the Body, as
appears by <hi>this</hi> amongst other Arguments, that 'tis
not to be satisfied with bodily Objects or Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
In the midst of <hi>these,</hi> a man's mind may be
ill at ease. It may be wounded with guilt, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with sorrow, or amazed with fear of the
Divine Vengeance. It may be disturbed as <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
was in the midst of his Beasting and Jollity. It
often happens, that in the midst of this kind of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>the Heart is sad, and the end of that mirth is heaviness.</hi>
The Soul is so far from being <hi>satisfied</hi> with <hi>these
things,</hi> that the abundance of them is rather apt to
cloud and debase and darken it, and to make its
condition worse than it would be in the absence of
such abundance. So that <hi>these</hi> are no suitable Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the Soul. We might as well expect to satisfie
a hungry stomach with good words, as to satisfie the
Soul with sensual Enjoyments. <hi>These</hi> are as much
too gross for the Soul, as the <hi>other</hi> are too thin and
meagre for the Body.</p>
            <p>But the Portion here mentioned is abundantly
sufficient to inrich and satisfie the Soul.</p>
            <p>The devout <hi>Contemplation</hi> of God, and of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Power, Glory and Goodness, do mightily raise


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42793:11"/>
and refine and delight the Soul; how much more
the enjoyment of him? As he is the Author, so he
is the proper <hi>Object</hi> of our spirits; which never seem
to be at <hi>home,</hi> but when they are conversant with
him. And therefore it was absurdly affirm'd by <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi>
(as <hi>Plutarch</hi> well Observes, and
largely proves,)<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> That the disbelief of
a God, and of all future recompence,
tends to the quiet and happiness of
mens lives; whereas there is nothing more true than
the contrary. The very <hi>thoughts</hi> of God are better
able to stay our Minds, and calm our Passions,
and ease our troubles, than any other consideration
whatsoever. And the comforts of his Word, and
assistances of his Grace, and other Emanations of his
Goodness, (such as have been mentioned,) have that
force upon our spirits; that when we can attain to
some <hi>sence</hi> of these, and keep our selves in some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<hi>possession</hi> of them, we cannot but think our
selves happy in this <hi>imperfect</hi> state. <hi>We joy in God
through our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
11. and Vers. 2. <hi>We rejoyce in hope of the glory of God.</hi>
And <hi>Vers.</hi> 165. of this Psalm, <hi>Great peace have they
who love</hi> thy Law. Now Peace, and Joy, and good
Hope, are the proper Entertainments of the Soul.
And these issue naturally from a Religious applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our selves to God, and from the sence of his
favour, by which our Minds are refreshed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
for the present, until they can be restored to


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42793:11"/>
that Immense Fountain of Goodness, and be made
to drink of those Rivers of Pleasure for ever.</p>
            <p>Thus much concerning the great things contained
<hi>in this Portion,</hi> and the excellent Properties of it.</p>
            <p>A Second Head of Arguments to prove the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of this choice, may be taken from the <hi>Effects,</hi>
and <hi>Benefits</hi> that are consequent to it.</p>
            <p>Particularly, 1. The fixing of our hearts firmly
upon God as our Portion, is a good help to make us
<hi>steady and constant</hi> in that which is good, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the contrary evil of Inconstancy. We know of
how great moment <hi>Constancy</hi> is in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
It is a property that cannot be separated from
it, without frustrating the whole design of it. It is
the great Condition our Saviour requires of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<hi>If ye continue in my Word, then shall ye be my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
indeed,</hi> Joh. 8. 31. and Chap. 15. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Abide
in me and I in you. He that abideth in me, the same bringeth
forth much fruit. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth
as a branch cut off from the Tree.</hi> Therefore <hi>Vers. 9. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ye in my Love.</hi> There is scarcely any man so bad,
so utterly void of all sence of Religion or Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but that at one time or other he may do <hi>some</hi>
worthy things. <hi>Nero</hi> himself, whose name is so in-famous
for Cruelty and Bloodshed, is said once in
his life to have wept, when the Sentence of a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
was brought to him to be signed, and to wish
that he could never have written.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42793:12"/>
It is only <hi>Order, Moderation, and Constancy,</hi> that
shews a wise Man and a good Christian. All other
things may be found in an indifferent and defective
man. Now what likelier means can there be to
establish the heart, and make a man constant, than
fixed and deliberate Choice? When the Mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
upon <hi>one</hi> Object, and so not at liberty to rove
and wander after others? Whereas <hi>a double-minded
man</hi> (that is, one who is undetermined in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Choice) <hi>is unstable in all his waies,</hi> Jam.
1. 8.</p>
            <p>Such a one lives, like a man that walks without
any design, who is indifferent, what hast he makes,
or what path he takes. Sometimes he goes forward,
and sometimes he stands still, and looks about him,
and by and by he turns aside to the next Object that
invites his Eye: whereas he that is to run for the
<hi>Goal,</hi> makes all the hast that's possible. He listeth
not to loyter nor to gaze; but he bestirs himself with
all his <hi>might,</hi> because the Goal is in his eye, and the
honour and reward of overcoming are in his
thoughts. So 'tis likewise in this case; he who hath
not settled this in his heart, That <hi>Religion</hi> is his <hi>busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and that God alone is the Portion of his Soul,
and that all other things are but vain, or at the best
but <hi>indifferent;</hi> will be apt to turn aside to those Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
which he has not yet learn'd to disesteem. But
on the other hand, he who is thus persuaded, is not


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42793:12"/>
so like to go astray; but having fixed his End, and
that so wisely, will be apt to proceed more <hi>Evenly
and Regularly</hi> toward the attainment of it. If any
thing happens to come in his way to tempt or divert
him, he presently remembers that this is contrary to
<hi>his measures,</hi> and to the choice he has made. And
therefore he turns away from the Temptation, and
his heart <hi>turns</hi> towards God, and minds him that
<hi>He</hi> is his portion, which it would be a madness to
deprive himself of, for any of the foolish momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
enjoyments of Sin. No doubt they, who have
seriously made such a Choice, will find themselves to
be thus engaged; and there is scarcely any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which such a posture of mind will not ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a good man to resist and overcome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the benefit of making God our Choice
and Portion, appears, by the <hi>Ease and Comfort</hi> of it in
every Condition. First as for Ease; 'tis an uneasie
thing to have ones mind <hi>unsetled,</hi> and much worse to
have it setled on a wrong Object, which is the case
of all vitious and ungodly men. For either such
men do not prefix to themselves any certain End,
but live at <hi>Large,</hi> like the irrational Creatures, that
eat and drink and enjoy what's before them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
considering any farther end of their being; or
else they addict themselves to some <hi>particular Vice</hi> or
<hi>Vanity,</hi> which instead of easing and comforting the
mind, afflicts and confounds it, when a man comes
to reflect on the <hi>miserable</hi> Choice he has made. On the


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42793:13"/>
other hand, nothing can contribute more to a state
of rest and inward satisfaction, than to have one's
Choice <hi>settled,</hi> and to have it fixt so happily as upon
God. This sets the <hi>whole</hi> business of a man's life at
a stay, and frees him from the solicitude of his
thoughts, and from the trouble of farther consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It answers his mind, as to the great <hi>Question</hi> of
happiness; and so settles his spirit, and puts him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a condition, that 'tis not an easie matter to
disturb the repose, and happiness of his life. 'Tis
likewise highly beneficial in respect of the <hi>Comfort</hi> of
it in every condition. If the Lord be our portion,
it cannot be imagined that we can want any thing
that is good for us. For whatsoever is wanting in
other kinds, is abundantly made up in <hi>him.</hi> His love
and favour, and blessing, and assistance, the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his gracious providence, and the hopes of
his glorious promises, are sufficient to make us happy,
whatsoever our outward condition be. There will
be Concussions in the World, and Troubles in mens
particular affairs. Sad casualties, sicknesses, disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
losses, calumnies, defamations, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and violence; these are the common Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
with which the World treats its guests at
one time or other. All which, tho they be grievous
to flesh and blood, yet they have not that powerful,
nor <hi>malignant influence</hi> upon those who trust in God,
that they have upon others who live on <hi>themselves.</hi>
If <hi>they</hi> happen to be surprized at the first approaches


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42793:13"/>
of trouble, they soon recal and recover themselves.
They know they have a <hi>friend,</hi> and they look up to
him, and that (like our Saviour's presence with his
Disciples on the Sea) calms, and stills the rage of
their troubles, and furnishes them with such conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
as these. What tho my Friends are taken
from me? yet God is with me, who took me out of
my Mother's Womb, and hath susteined me ever
since I was born. What tho my health be impair'd,
and my body grown feeble, so that I cannot enjoy
my self as formerly? Alas! this is not the thing on
which I depend, this weakness may bring me nearer
to that which is my <hi>main End,</hi> of which if I secure my
duty, I am sure, neither pain, nor age, nor any other
Accident can deprive me. What though my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the World be small? yet I have the Creator
and Disposer of it. Tho I am <hi>low,</hi> he is <hi>high</hi> above
all; and I am sure his Providence takes a care of me.
I am rich enough, if I can but keep Patience and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
Lord thou art my Portion, Oh! make me
happy in a faithful adherence to thee, and in the
communications of thy Love and Goodness to me,
and I have enough.</p>
            <p>This has alwayes been the Refuge and Comfort
of the People of God, to retire to Him, and there to
hide and shelter themselves from the storms of this
present evil World. This bore up <hi>Iob</hi>'s spirit, and
helpt him to <hi>get above</hi> the miseries of his Condition;
<hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iob.</hi> 19. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42793:14"/>
The same was <hi>David</hi>'s constant refuge, who in the
midst of the greatest dangers and distresses, when he
had nothing left to secure him, but <hi>God's</hi> protection;
thought himself safer in <hi>that,</hi> than in the security of
Castles and fenced Cities. And therefore he so often
calls God his Refuge, and strong hold, his Castle,
and deliverer: Not only because he trusted that He
would <hi>deliver him out</hi> of his troubles, but because he
found that he <hi>supported</hi> him <hi>under</hi> them; and gave him
such Comfort, as made his Condition happy, when
in outward appearance it seemed to be desperate.</p>
            <p>Of this we have many Instances in the story of
his Life, particularly after the sacking of <hi>Ziklag, 1 Sam.</hi> 30. 6. Where the text saith of him, that he
was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning
him; (but 'tis added in the close of the verse) but
<hi>David</hi> encouraged himself in the Lord his God. The
like he declareth of himself, <hi>Ps. 142. 4, 5. I looked
on my right hand, and beheld; but there was no man that
would know me.</hi> Refuge failed me, no man cared for
my Soul. <hi>I cryed unto the O Lord;</hi> I said, thou art my
Refuge and my <hi>Portion</hi> in the Land of the living.
The same was the comfort of the <hi>three Children,</hi> when
they had no other prospect, but that of Death, and
a burning fiery Furnace. <hi>Our God whom we serve is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to deliver us,</hi> Dan. 3. 17.</p>
            <p>To these we may add the Examples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and First believers; whose lives were a continual
warfare, yet they were <hi>more than Conquerors.</hi> They


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42793:14"/>
were compassed about with Evils on every side: but
they were so far from being distressed or cast down
at it, that they joyed in God, <hi>and rejoyced in</hi> their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.
They had nothing, yet <hi>having him for their
Portion,</hi> they were as though they had <hi>possessed all
things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now he who has thus setled his Affairs, that he
is or may be happy, in despight of the World, and
the worst things he can meet with in it, cannot but
be granted to have taken a very wise course, and
to have made a very wise and beneficial Choice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Benefit of it is seen in this, that 'tis
an infallible means to mortify us to this World; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it engages us not to make any <hi>other thing</hi> our
Portion. But this will fall in most fitly with the
last particular, which shall be, to Enquire, by <hi>what
means</hi> we may compass this great End and business
of our Lives, To have God for our Portion.</p>
            <p>The best direction in this case will be,</p>
            <p>First, that we <hi>chuse</hi> him for our Portion. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that we <hi>do</hi> as <hi>David</hi> resolves in the close of
the verse, <hi>I have said that I will keep thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, to <hi>chuse</hi> him for our portion, is the way to
make him so. If this seem a small or easie matter,
we must know that there is a great deal compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in this Choice. It implyes that we prefer
God in our Judgment, and Esteem, above all other
things; and that we prefer his Love and Service,


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42793:15"/>
before all the delights, and present advantages of
Sin. It amounts in effect to what was mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
That we make not any <hi>other thing</hi> our portion.
Other things we may have, and esteem, and enjoy
them two, in their just measure and degree: but
we must not overvalue them, nor dote on them, we
must not bestow our hearts on them, nor repose our
trust and happiness in them. God must be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in our love and esteem, (as <hi>Solomon chose</hi> Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
before Riches and Honour) otherwise he will
not be our Portion.</p>
            <p>To this purpose our Saviour hath told us in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
That we cannot have our <hi>Treasure</hi> on Earth, and
in Heaven, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. 19. He hath told us, That we
cannot <hi>serve two Masters, God</hi> and <hi>Mammon;</hi> if the
one be our Portion, the other cannot, will not be.</p>
            <p>But since we are allowed to love other things,
how shall we know whether we make them our
Portion or not? We may know it by the room and
place those things have in our hearts. If they have
the preheminence, they are our Portion; for two
Chiefs or Principals cannot consist together in our
choice. If God be our Portion, all other things
will be chosen, and loved, and used in subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to him, and his love and Service.</p>
            <p>It will not be difficult for us, if we observe the
motions of our own hearts, to make a Judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our selves. In the Course of business and
Temptation, we may sometimes observe a kind of


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42793:15"/>
               <hi>Competition</hi> betwixt God and our selves; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our duty, and our corrupt Inclination and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests.
Now when 'tis come to a <hi>struggle and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
in</hi> the Will, observe which side usually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails,
and we shall soon know how the case is with
us.</p>
            <p>If the awe and love of God, and a Religious sense
of our duty, prevail; we may conclude we are
right so far. But if vain and corrupt inclinations
prevail; we may so far conclude, that God is not
our Portion. For that is every mans Portion, which
he prefers, and values, and seeks after most: Indeed
it is in effect his God, and his being carried out after
it with love and delight, is that <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the heart,
of which the Scripture speaks. For Instance, He
who sets his heart on the World, and hunts after
riches unreasonably, and sticks not to violate his
Duty and his Conscience for the gaining and keeping
of them, and prefers them before the true Riches;
such a man <hi>has his portion in this World,</hi> and is guilty
of that <hi>Covetousness,</hi> which the Scripture calls <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
The <hi>ambitious</hi> man likewise, who will do any
thing to be great, and climbs up to it by base com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainces
and unworthy Actions, he has made choice
of his Object, <hi>Vanity</hi> is his Portion: And so for those
who make their Belly and their pleasure their God,
meat and drink and other base sensual Liberties are
their Portion. So likewise the Envious and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
who <hi>will</hi> contrive and repay evil, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42793:16"/>
revenge (contrary to the express will and Law
of God,) <hi>mischief</hi> is their darling and their Portion.
The thing is as true in all other Instances, where
'tis plain that our duty lyes on one hand, and Sin
on the other. If we see the sin before us, and accept
of the Temptation to it, we do by just Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
prefer it before God, and the rewards of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and take it for our Portion. That which
sways a mans <hi>will,</hi> and bears rule within him, and
disposes of him and his Actions, is in very truth his
<hi>Idol;</hi> howsoever he may flatter himself to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
or persuade himself, through his partiality,
that God will interpret it otherwise. Consequent
to this first means of making God our Portion, is,
that holy and happy temper of being <hi>Indifferent</hi> to
the things of this Life. If we can be moderate, and
Indifferent about <hi>these,</hi> 'tis an evidence that our
hearts do not cleave to them, and that we do not
look on them as our Portion. This indifferency
consists in an eveness of mind towards temporal
good and evil: not to value, or love, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the one, as though our Happiness depended
on it; nor to dread the other, so as to think our
selves miserable and undone, when any temporal
evil befals us; but to look upon both with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and submission to the will of God, always
esteeming him as our main refuge and dependence.
For the maintaining and preserving of which good
indifferency, we must take heed of eager and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42793:16"/>
desires on the one hand, and of excessive fears
and solicitude on the other. For people to be <hi>sick</hi>
for any thing they desire, as <hi>Ahab</hi> was for <hi>Naboth</hi>'s
Vineyard, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 21. Or to be clamorous, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate,
as <hi>Rachel</hi> was, saying, <hi>give me Children or else
I dye,</hi> Gen. 30. 1. Or to be distressed at any cross ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
as <hi>Rebecca</hi> was, only on <hi>supposition</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s
marrying one of the Daughters of <hi>Heth,</hi> saying,
<hi>What good shall my Life do me?</hi> Gen. 27. 46. Or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as <hi>David</hi> was for his ungracious Son <hi>Absalom,</hi>
when God had but newly delivered him out of his
hand, so as to wish, <hi>would God I had died for thee,</hi> 2 Sam.
18. 33. It is too much for good people to be thus
<hi>Violently</hi> concerned for any of these things. When we
fear things, or grieve for them, with so much dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and distress of mind; 'tis a sign we lov'd them
too well, and that we do not depend upon God so
entirely as we ought: and so on the other hand,
when we long for any thing with so great Ardour,
and Intensness of desire; 'tis a sign we place our
happiness in it, and that we could be willing to quit
all else, and to make it our Portion. It argues that
we look not much unto God, nor regard what his
Will and Pleasure is, if we can but accomplish our
own desires on any Terms. Such eagerness and
impetuousness of affection shews, that our minds are
not <hi>stayed</hi> upon God, but that we look after other
things besides him as Principal Ingredients of our
happiness. It shews that we are not <hi>rooted and


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42793:17"/>
grounded</hi> in his Love, and that our Wills are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
subdued to his Holy Will and just Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It is a matter of great consequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to have this indifferency firmly settled in our
minds, as that which will minister greatly to the
ease and happiness of our lives; and without which,
in some good measure, we cannot be said in any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
sence to have God for our Portion.</p>
            <p>Lastly, If we would have God for our Portion,
we must do as <hi>David</hi> here resolves and promiseth, <hi>I
said</hi> (or I have promised) <hi>that I would keep thy Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To keep God's word, is the same, as to do his
Commandments; which the Psalmist subjoyns as
the <hi>condition</hi> of that high priviledge of having God
for his Portion.</p>
            <p>He is not to be had on any other Terms; neither
are we to expect that he will make us happy in his
favour, when we provoke him with our Sins. These
intercept the Influences of his Grace, and obscure
the light of his Countenance. They displease, and
provoke our Heavenly Father, and make us unmeet
for the Portion and Inheritance of his Children. If
we would have him for our God, we must be his
<hi>People;</hi> and how can that be made appear, but by
being <hi>governed</hi> by his Laws? This is the constant
Tenour of the Covenant; and there is no pretence,
nor priviledge whatsoever, that can entitle us to the
blessings of it, unless we walk as the People of God.
'Tis not enough that we call our selves his People,


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42793:17"/>
neither is it enough to do as those spoken of in the
Prophet <hi>Ezech. 33. 31. They sit before thee as my people,
and hear thy words, but they will not do them, for with their
mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their
Covetousness.</hi> God is not to be imposed upon by such
Pretences, neither will he be <hi>flattered,</hi> where he is not
truly loved and obeyed. The truth of which is to
be tryed by that rule of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16.
<hi>Whom ye yield your selves Servants to obey, his Servants ye
are to whom ye obey, whether of Sin unto death, or of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
unto Righteousness.</hi> It is not enough that we
wear his <hi>Livery,</hi> or bear the <hi>badge</hi> of his Servants; but
we must do him actual service, otherwise we cannot
expect to receive <hi>wages</hi> from him.</p>
            <p>God was in a peculiar manner the God of <hi>Israel,</hi>
and he calls himself a <hi>Husband to Israel;</hi> but when
they deserted his service, and committed abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he retracted that Relation; and commanded
the Prophet to use the name <hi>Lo-ammi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for ye are not
my people, and I will not be your God.</hi> Hos. 1. 9. and
Chapter 2. 2. <hi>she is not my wife, neither am I her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi>
God will not be <hi>ours,</hi> unless we be <hi>His,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will it avail us to be his in Name only, but we
must be so in deed and in truth.</p>
            <p>After all this it must be acknowledged, that we
are frail sinful Creatures, and that our great security
and confidence lyes in the Infinite Mercies of God,
and the merits of our Saviour. But 'tis a Religious
care over our selves and over our ways, that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42793:18"/>
and makes us fit for the mercy of God: that he
may pardon that, wherein through weakness we
come short of our duty. This was the Course that
<hi>David</hi> took, whom we find begging of God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
vers. 2. <hi>be merciful unto me according to thy word;</hi> but
withal he resolves in this verse, <hi>to keep God's Law,</hi> and
vers. 3. he is said to have performed what he promised,
<hi>I turned my Feet to thy Testimonies.</hi> And so <hi>Iob,</hi> tho his
great Confidence was in God, yet the sence of his
own Integrity made his confidence more rational,
and satisfied him that it was not only a vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
And therefore he thought it fit to make
protestation of his Innocency and Integrity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chapter
31. To this purpose our Saviour plainly tells that
young man, Mat. 19. 17. <hi>if thou wilt enter into life,
keep the Commandments.</hi> Where he makes the <hi>one</hi> of
these the necessary <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>other,</hi> and implies,
that no man can obtain Eternal life without keeping
the Commandments.</p>
            <p>One thing more may be observ'd from the <hi>form</hi> of
the words, I have <hi>said,</hi> or I have <hi>promised,</hi> that I would
keep thy words; the Psalmist seems here to call to
mind, and renew some former resolution and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
whereby he had more solemnly devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Service of God.</p>
            <p>Herein we shall do well to follow his Example.
Doubtless good Resolutions (not to speak now of
Vowes) are of great use to help to keep us close to
our duty. For when a man finds himself, bound


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42793:18"/>
(as it were) by his own <hi>act</hi> and <hi>deed,</hi> and engag'd by
a Covenant which he has made with himself, upon
the best and most important Reasons; this cannot
but strengthen him in the performance of his duty.
<hi>David</hi> bound himself in the strictest bonds of this
kind, as is more fully exprest, verse, 106. <hi>I have
sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy Righteous
Iudgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, as this is useful to our selves, so 'tis avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with God, for the obtaining of his favour. For
when we thus dedicate and devote our selves and
our lives to his service, it will move him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<hi>himself more</hi> freely to <hi>us,</hi> and to become our
Portion.</p>
            <p>The design of all that has been said, is first to
move every considerate person, to enter into Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with himself, and see what Choice he has
made. Let him ask himself what has been, and is
his main business, and design in the World, and see
what answer his Conscience will make him.</p>
            <p>If he have yet made no settled Choice, he has
done very unwisely in spending so much time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
design. If he have made <hi>a wrong Choice,</hi> it is high
time to inquire into it, to the end he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of his Error, and amend it.</p>
            <p>Let him know then that every one who lives in
any vice or custom of Sin, is justly interpreted to
have made <hi>that</hi> his Choice; although perhaps he
have not chosen it with the Circumstances of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42793:19"/>
Deliberation and Election. Now for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of such a one, 'tis necessary for him to make an
Estimate of the quality and true Value of that which
he has accepted of for his Portion. And indeed in
this respect a vitious person may be said to have
some <hi>advantage</hi> by his folly; because he is, or may
be convinc't out of his own <hi>experience,</hi> of the Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
vexation, and dissatisfaction of the wayes of
Sin. If such a one would but hearken to his own
reason, and conscience, or if he would but diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consult his <hi>Memory,</hi> I believe it might be left to
himself to make his own Choice without any farther
direction. Let him turn back, and see of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
those things are, about which he has been busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all this while. Let him ask his Soul, whether he
has found comfort, or satisfaction, in any of those
things which he has hunted after with the neglect,
or gross Violation of his duty; what <hi>good</hi> any of his
Sins ever did him; and whether he has any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
hopes that they will do him good in the End?
Whether he can think that any of those things which
he has <hi>seen,</hi> or <hi>enjoyed,</hi> or <hi>addicted</hi> himself to in the
World, are a fit Portion for an immortal Creature?
whether he has met with any Object, that is able to
make him substantially happy, and to secure him in
that happy <hi>State?</hi> He must be more than an Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>wretch,</hi> that will pretend to affirm any such thing;
and if there be no such Object here to be found, he
may be sure he has been wrong all this while, and


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42793:19"/>
it concerns him now to make a wise and a better
Choice.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if we do but duly attend to them, our
own <hi>minds</hi> will point and direct us to God. They
naturally <hi>incline</hi> towards him, as things do towards
their <hi>center</hi> and place of <hi>rest.</hi> He is the <hi>Supreme good</hi>
of our Souls, and therefore he alone is to be chosen,
and all other things to be <hi>neglected,</hi> and despised, in
Comparison of him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if we are conscious to our selves, that
we have made this choice, it should engage us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
great degrees of Patience and Contentment;
and help to moderate our fears and sorrows for other
things. For why? if God be our Portion, is it not
enough? is not he Alsufficient? cannot he make
us happy, unless the World also smile upon us?
Indeed we are too apt to think so, but 'tis for want of
Faith, and an holy dependance upon God. If we
could live up to the <hi>Effects</hi> of having God for our Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it would mightily raise and inable our Spirits,
and set us much above the reach of worldly Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Events. Too great concernment about these
is a disparaging of our Choice, and discovers World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
Irresolution, and Folly. 'Tis to imitate the
folly of that <hi>Miser,</hi> who pin'd for the loss of
his <hi>smoak,</hi> when his Coffers were full, and his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
over-flowed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, as we ought to chuse God for our Portion,
so ought we to live continually in the View and


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42793:20"/>
               <hi>sense</hi> of the choice we have made; that so we may
neither forget our engagements, nor contradict what
we have done, nor frustrate our selves of our main
End, by any contrary intermediate Actions. Every
way of Wickedness makes it appear, that our Choice
in this kind is but dissembled, &amp; that there is nothing
of truth or reality in it. For how can any one say,
that God is his Portion, when he prefer's <hi>other things?</hi>
How can'st thou, without blushing and confusion,
say to God, <hi>Thou art my Portion,</hi> when thy heart goes
another way; and thou followest thy own will and
ways and Inclinations, which are contrary to <hi>his will,</hi>
and the rules and Laws which he has prescribed?
Thou mayest not think that he will be thy Portion
ever the more for such a nominal, pretended, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Choice.</p>
            <p>What therefore must we do? We must keep close
to our Choice, and see that our behaviour may be
agreeable to it. We must often call it to mind, and
keep it, as it were alwaies in our <hi>Eye;</hi> and by the
View of that (as of our <hi>Port</hi>) we shall be directed
the better to steer our <hi>Course.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We should likewise often recollect, and call to
mind, our <hi>setled Religious Principles.</hi> We should thus
commune with our hearts, I have determined long
ago, that nothing in this World is to be depended
on for happiness. I will therefore use and enjoy eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing here as tho <hi>I did it not.</hi> I believe, and by
Experience find, that God alone is able to satisfie my


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42793:20"/>
Soul; my business therefore shall be to serve him,
and seek his Favour. I am satisfied, that the great
business and concernment of every one, is, so to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their lives, that they may dye well, and live
with God for ever, when this Minute of life is expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And being thus convinced, and persuaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know
I ought not to go against my own sentiments, but to
live according to my Principles, and according to
my aims and expectations. I have chosen God for
my Portion, which is the highest priviledge any
Creature is capable of. I am therefore bound to
walk worthy of this <hi>high calling</hi> as far as I am able;
and so to exercise, and accustom my self, that I may
be the better fitted for the holy Presence and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God. Such principles imprinted on the
Heart, and often <hi>resorted</hi> to, will be apt to infer and
produce such good effects.</p>
            <p>The good God give every one of us the Wisdom
to chuse the <hi>better part,</hi> and the Grace so to apply
our selves to the obtaining of it, that <hi>it may not be taken
away from us.</hi> Amen.</p>
