            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and Sea, being forced to abuses (most incorrigible flagitions) not
onely so, but bereast of Christian Religion, and meanes of grace
and repentance. How many thousand of the <hi>Nazarian</hi> nations
have beene and are continually lost by that monster, what rationall
creature can be ignornnt of? But farre worse is their condition
from whom these peeces had their extraction, in whom their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
parents once delighted themselves, with hope they might
prove souldiers in the <hi>Lords battles.</hi> To which intent they fed
them with their sweate, nourisht them with their blood, and
made their sole joyes; what affliction is like theirs? that such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
peeces of their bodies should bee extorted from them.
And by whom? buriby a people unknowne, <hi>monsters</hi> more like

changed, and are made their Corrasive: but they do wilfully prove
their countries greatest enemy. Who can but religiously condole
their misfortunes, whose so prepellent hopes should bee turned
to despaires? Who would not wish his loynes dry rather then
fruitfull in such wickednesse: these are not onely the greatest <hi>Cax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators</hi>

meane in the slightings of many poore soules, that in their agony
despaired, and with <hi>Noah</hi> in a fit of their folly discovers these
secrets that were hid 600. yeares before. Thus madly doe many
of them cast themselves upon the point of those dangers, whereby
they have seene so many miscarry: But being forced to that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
which they cannot redeeme, expiate all shame. I doe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
lament the shipwracke of some of them who were of my
acquaintance. To whose denyalls I have beene an occular wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Lord how facile doe these professe the new Religion, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselves in Turkish ceremonies, and in a faith once exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
unto them; whereto, not confidence but vice invokes
them. Had they but the grace of a common woman, who with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loosing
her Pettycoate looseth shame, but recovering it takes it up
againe: there might be hopes of them, that at the hearing of the


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8545:5"/>
Cocke crow they might with <hi>Peter</hi> remember their sinnes, get out
of them and weepe bitterly. There is hony to be taken out of the
Lyon, and such a plague is opportunitie, that many aregular man
is forced to sollicite their friends, and dearely to esteeme of their
acquaintance, as well as to the perill; I will ascribe to the Jeat
stone his due. The obligation I owe to some of them I have a just
propension to requite them for, but I am not oblieged to duske
their vices nor contrarily will maliciously professe calumnies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, but condoling their destinies with them grace. I
was two yeares and fix moneths a slave to one of them: in which
terminie I knew not what sufferings was only aflicted by being an
occular testator of the calamities of others, I was not imployed
in the least servility. His presence did not disturbe me, but I was
most a <hi>Allegerie</hi> in his company, and sure then to fare best; none of
my actions but was to his content, and none so acceptable to him
as my selfe. My affabilitie, freenesse of speech, and boldnesse had
so obliged his affections to mee as almost the world could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate.
And indeede, he was an honest morall man.</p>
               <p>Opportunitie gave me occasion sufficient to register the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of those times happening in that Citie.</p>
               <p>The first accident famous for memory in this terminie was in the
yeare 1634. on <hi>Friday</hi> the 20. of <hi>Iune,</hi> in blowing up the <hi>Cassaba</hi>
or house of <hi>Councell,</hi> and <hi>chiefe foretresse</hi> of that <hi>Citty.</hi> Nature if it
once degenerates growes more monstrous and extreame then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
borne to cruelties; many yeares past the <hi>Turkes</hi> upon
surmises of Treason plotted against them by the <hi>Collolies,</hi> their
owne children, for so are they by them called, banished all such
of them as were of the Councell, as by denomination <hi>Bulla Bashees</hi>
and <hi>Odds Bashees,</hi> and performed it with no little subtletie. No
word passed in the Citie of these suppositions, nor had the <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes</hi>
any thought that their so secret plots had beene the <hi>Turkes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences,
who knowing the danger neglected, no time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
so great a threatned mischiefe; all rested private, untill the
first <hi>Duanna</hi> day, or day of great councell; when 60. of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
of them were banished; strange that the <hi>Colloly</hi> should not
know his guilt, and more strange it is that the <hi>Turkes</hi> should ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
a faction more powerful then themselves in number, in friends,


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8545:6"/>
and in estates, and equall dignities, all speaking one language;
yet the banished departed at the <hi>Turkes</hi> pleasure, without deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the cause and knowledge of their offence.</p>
               <p>The pollitique <hi>Turke</hi> ordained the place no further then <hi>Bugea</hi>
the next port towne to the Orient, but with two Commissions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Captaines, to whose charge they were committed, and
appointed to open one after the other. Wherein they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to transport them to <hi>Tunnis,</hi> a City absolute. Vntill the
next Councell day, all rested without clamour, and now 200.
more of them are banished. The <hi>Bellages,</hi> Citizens and Natives
Murmured, but dare not make complaints of their griefes. They
neglected their accustomary course of trade. The <hi>Turkes</hi> by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
commanded all men to open their shoppes, buy and sell,
and not to have any missupposition of their intente or doings, past
or to come, betwixt them and their children as being differences
among themselves, also giving hopes to the banished in short time
to be recalled to <hi>Argiere,</hi> and raise them to their former dignities.
The third great <hi>Duanna</hi> or Councell day was banished 500. more
of them, without any insurrection or stirre made by the <hi>Collolyes;</hi>
and in fine on the fift day all the rest, consisting of 1574. men,
chiefest in the Citie for esteeme; in that they were descended from
the ancient <hi>Turkes,</hi> which conquered that country, and in substance
the richest hope is of that noble and couragions facultie that it
commonly brings more then it carries away. No advertisement
all this time came to <hi>Argiere</hi> of the banished transportation from
one port to another, nor their friends any way suspecting them
to be so farre banished as <hi>Tunnis.</hi> But time the mother of all truth
untaught the <hi>Collolyes</hi> errour, and now by the experience of many
yeares see themselves frustrate of all hopes to returne in a faire
way to that terrene paradise. They now combinde with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to possesse themselves of that citie, which once they being
possessed of, might facily make retention. 60. of them, of a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then the rest vowed to surprise the <hi>Cassaba,</hi> prime
fortresse of the Citie; the stratagem to affect it was thus: They
went thither in womens apparell, wearing long Mantles to the
ground, and their faces covered as is the fashion of that country,
and having Cemitaries, coyertly entered the <hi>Cassaba,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8545:6"/>
                  <hi>Sherillah</hi> or demanding Justice; the day was <hi>Friday,</hi> and the time
the morning. A great advantage to the <hi>Collolyes:</hi> for it being the
<hi>Turkes</hi> Sunday, most of them that kept the sald <hi>Cassaba</hi> were in the
Citie visiting their friends; in briefe, some one way, and some
another: besides it was the 15. day when the <hi>Bashaw</hi> makes a feast
to the whole <hi>Duanna.</hi> In this manner 23. of the <hi>Collolyes</hi> enters
this <hi>Cassaba,</hi> the other 37. of the confederacy not present; the
<hi>Turkish Bulla bassawes</hi> which carelesly kept the gate, not thinking
them to be other then women, the <hi>Collolyes</hi> now to imbrace their
opportunitie, draw their Curlesses, kills all they finde in the
<hi>Cassaba,</hi> shuts the gate, and for a while are masters of this sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Fortresse, and now displayes their Banners upon the walls:
which suddaine revolt comming to be the intelligence of the <hi>Aga,</hi>
Generall of the Souldiers, and <hi>Bashaw,</hi> vice King under the great
<hi>Turke;</hi> Yet not informed who they were that had surprised their
<hi>Cassaba,</hi> some conjectured them to be the <hi>Cookoose,</hi> whose mother
and sonne to that King was then prisoner in that <hi>Cassaba.</hi> The
jealous <hi>Turke</hi> makes Proclamation upon paine of death every <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye</hi>
to keepe his house, nor any more <hi>Allarbyes</hi> or <hi>Tagarens,</hi> subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
people, to take Armes or weare a knife; so poasted to the <hi>Cassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>
and found them to be <hi>Collolyes,</hi> men polliticke in warre, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in faction, as being thousands of them unbanished, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had borne office, having also the <hi>Allarbyes</hi> and <hi>Tagarens</hi> to
their devotion, all supposed enemies to the <hi>Turke,</hi> who now give
the assault. The <hi>Collolyes</hi> defended from six of the clocke in the
morning to ten, at which time usually on all their Churches on
Sundayes is hoysted up that ragge of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a <hi>geene Flagge.</hi>
The <hi>Turkes</hi> offered them pardon, and the restauration of their
goods detained from them, they deny all composition, and
resolve not onely to defend what they had gotten, as their
owne <hi>patria,</hi> but to get more if they could. The <hi>Turke</hi> now impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and well knowing the ensuing danger, if they made not
some speedy way before night; assuring themselves, that all that
were weary of their governement, malecontents and others, then
would stirre; and themselves doubtfull of one anothers Loyalties,
resolved to make <hi>Otote, Obote;</hi> something or nothing: They bring
Scales to the walls and enter. The defendants seeing themselves

the Skie was darkened with smoak &amp; dust, and nothing heard
but clamours in the streets (as if the day of generall account had
beene then) Had those ignoble spirits, that lived in worse Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

have extirpated the glory of the <hi>Turke</hi> there, and honoured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the Lordly command of the most flourishing City of
<hi>Africa,</hi> 6000. soules perished by that blow, but of the <hi>Collolyes</hi> hee
onely that fired the powder, 22. of them being taken alive were most
cruelly tortured, some were crucified, others having their bones
broken, were drawled along the streets at horse tailes, others had
their shoulders stab'd with knives, and burning Torches set in
them dropping downe into their wounds; The <hi>Turkes</hi> biting of
their flesh alive, so dyed, and some of them being walled in were
starved to death. A guiltie conscience projects terrible things.
What perplexitie the other <hi>Collolyes</hi> of the Citie were in I neede
not recount. All censured them dead persons, but the councell
disagreeing in themselves, their fortunes were better then their
deserts. The <hi>Turkes</hi> now will not permit the Souldiers marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and by that meanes extinct so monstrous a Liniage: some of
the counsell in detestation of that Race offered to kill their owne
children, upon condition all others to doe the like, but others in
the surplassage of their loves, countermanded that bloody Decree
and unnaturall <hi>Acts;</hi> onely inqiusition was made for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
women which had given entertainement to those <hi>Collolyes</hi>
and were condemned to be all throwne into the Sea; but being
packed from one place to another and not to bee found, at last
was published a revocation of the sentence of their deaths, and they
escaped and enjoyed their ancient priviledges.</p>
               <p>These combustions, soone came Solicitours to the King
of <hi>Cokoose,</hi> who takes present occasion to lay siege to a Castle
which the <hi>Algiers</hi> kept to his great annoyance in that countrey,

as speedily came newes to the <hi>Algiers</hi> of the Castles besieging, who
were then studious to fetch off 200. of their Souldiers in Garison
there, and also ceremonions to conserve their honour, sent for
both a <hi>Hamper</hi> or generall Army, consisting of 5000. foot <hi>Turks,</hi>

continued the siege, contayning his Forces within the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
whereon is situated the Castle, the <hi>Turkes</hi> then according
to their old custome trusted more to policie than valour. They
knew well the danger to assault the enemy at such an advantage,
and therefore propounded termes of peace, and fortune hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
them, the <hi>Turkes</hi> were licenced to depart the Castle
with honour, and the Army returned to <hi>Argiere</hi> in peace, and
were received joyfully. In <hi>August</hi> next they enlarged the Prince
of that countrey, giving him amongst other presents, a <hi>Spanish</hi>
Christian woman, whom according to the custome of that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he tooke to wife, and the Queene, mother of that King, and
Grandam to the Prince, which also was a runagate of the <hi>Spanish</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Iuly</hi> 1635. there arrived <hi>Mounsieur de Sampson, French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
in a <hi>Polacta</hi> of <hi>Mercellis,</hi> with his Kings Flagge aloft
bravely. This gallant comes ashore, with his retinue consisting

stately, The <hi>Agga</hi> or Generall called a Counsell, sends a Chewse
or Sergeant for the Embassadour, who came before them, they
demanded his Embassage; he answered he was sent by his King to
demand his Majesties Subjects, by vertue of that interchangeable
league mutually conserved betwixt his Majesty and their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
they answered they knew none to command them in their
governement. And if his King had sent him to treate for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement

               <p>347. Free <hi>French</hi> men were then in <hi>Argiere,</hi> being all taken

but offered Mounsieur the slaves for the price they were sold for
in the Market, referring the freemen to the dispose of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shawes.</hi>
Mounsieur now treats with the <hi>Bashawe;</hi> Hee demands
ten peeces of eight <hi>per</hi> head for them, Mounsieur stormes (as I
thinke he had good cause to doe) having promised his King mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
in the accommodation of the <hi>French</hi> affaires. He demands
a second conference, and it is granted him, the slaves are offerd
him for the monies they cost in the Market, but the freemen raised
to 20. peeces of eight <hi>per</hi> head; Mounsieur according to the <hi>French</hi>
fury boyles and illustrates the puissance of his King, Fire and
Towe meets together, the <hi>Turkes</hi> furie is as much as the <hi>French</hi>
chollor, and he is now more affronted; the Slaves are now become
importunate, vexing Mounsieur as the poore widdow did the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
Judge, but his answer to them was Imperiall, hee had
brought no moneys for them. The freemen doe now sollicite his
propence affection, and implored his Christian care of their estats,
they offer to pay the said 20. peeces of eight <hi>per</hi> head with interest,
and the principallest of them, to come in band for satisfaction and
securitie; and in summe, every person to give perticular band
to those which had so oblieged themselves. Sure it was most pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
to see how many sufficient men of that Nation were put to
most vile services, where at if they had beene sold, many had
meanes to have given for their infranchisment, which upon these
differences were detained, and most of them unable to comport
with such barbarous indurances, miserably perished. Mounsieur
demands a third conference, and is admitted, he demands an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
answer, for that he meant in all hast to bee gone; the Slaves
are offered him upon the former termes, but the freemen now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
to 30. peeces of eight <hi>per</hi> head, Mounsieur departs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further treatie: the Counsell sends to him to take in his
Flag; hee bids them doe it; they take his Sailes from the Yard,
and Ruther, all which they carry into their <hi>Magazine,</hi> and with a
<hi>Branos anissetim</hi> leaves him his Flag. Mounsieur demanded li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to depart, they denie him, and having detained him foure
moneths after, and cost him some peeces of eight, he is licenced
and departs: the poore <hi>French</hi> having made songs of freedome, and

the custome is after the booke was made, we lanched from <hi>Argiere,</hi>
the 16. <hi>dicto</hi> neare <hi>Colla;</hi> The <hi>Turke</hi> having eight Gallies, met
with six of the great Duke of <hi>Tuscans</hi> Gallies, who at first made
an <hi>Italian</hi> bravada, but in fine, with Saylers and Oars ran away.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turke</hi> now proud that the <hi>Argiere</hi> Gallies, had chased away
the best Gallies of all the Christians, in the height of their spirits,
they rounded both Ilands of <hi>Sardena,</hi> and <hi>Corceoa,</hi> taking many
Towers upon each of them, burning and taking <hi>Pollaceas, Saitease,</hi>
and other Navigation: and now the second time met with the
Dukes Galleyes, who would not indure the sight of them; the
<hi>Turke</hi> pursuing his resolution 19. dayes after our departure from
<hi>Argiere,</hi> tooke a Towne in the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> where besides rich
spoyles they brought from thence 365. persons, and in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
burned a <hi>Flushener,</hi> being a brave new shippe, having 18.
peeces of Ordnance, loaden with <hi>Challery</hi> Cheese: and being now
in their returne, met the third time with those <hi>Legorne</hi> Gallies,
and chased them, but could not fetch them. In fine this voyage
ended in 28. dayes, when they returned in safetie to <hi>Argiere</hi>
with no little riches, glory and applause of the people: and now
is come a new <hi>Bashaw</hi> to that City, and as custome is, the old
must packe and be gone. Hee put off all his <hi>English, French,</hi> and
<hi>Dutch</hi> to <hi>Ally Pichellin</hi> generall of <hi>Argiere,</hi> a great man in substance,
having besides his Lands and other riches 800. Christians slaves;
and a great Tirant. He respected no man above another, and in
truth we were all exquisitely miserable that were his slaves. The
23. of <hi>August, Anno</hi> 1637. we were re-inbarked on the Galley of
<hi>Norilla bay:</hi> And the first of <hi>September</hi> they tooke <hi>Colpe</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi>

when first Aurora gave her light, and continued the fight till one
or two of the clocke in the afternoone, besides the spoiles, they
brought from thence 315. Christians; the women and children the
next day they sent upon a Galley for <hi>Argiere,</hi> but put all the men
to the Oare; the third <hi>dicto</hi> they tooke the towne of <hi>Cape Paul,</hi>
which resisted from morning till foure a clocke in the afternoone;
in all which time neither there nor at <hi>Cape</hi> appeared one man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for resistance, or intelligence: they harrowed the Castle, tooke
all the Towers to the Castle of <hi>Guardell mare,</hi> and so westward, till
they came to <hi>Titewone</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> where the generall tooke in
sixty thousand peeces of eight for his accompt proper. And after
they returned for the cost of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as a terrour, and had done
much more damage to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but they were twice preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>English</hi> Shippes, they returned for <hi>Calpe,</hi> and gave <hi>Scala
Franca</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who visits their forlorne friends, and
the unhappy men made spectators of that place where they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their disaster. In summe, good quarter was performed to
them, when at the fine of 30. dayes returned to <hi>Argiere</hi> with accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of joy of the inhabatants, all the house tops being cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with women crying <hi>Allaluah, Allaluah,</hi> with salutation of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and generall rejoycing of the people: it was now <hi>October,</hi>
and we hoped that yeares toyle was past, for so hath beene their
custome to repose the winter; I meane from Galley navigations,
&amp; to the slaves advantage, for although they worke hard all day on
land yet they rest at night, and injoy their fills of water (which is
precious in the Gallies) but what is not too little for the unsatiable
gulfe fo unhumaine desires. <hi>Ally</hi> the Generall would ingrosse the
whole world to himselfe, <hi>plus habeo, plus careo.</hi> Another voyage
must be made this yeare, and was with six Gallies, but ended in
the expence, of what they had formerly gotten, their best for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was, they safely returned to their homes: two Gallies were
detained in the port to cary Souldiers to the orient garisons, and
my lot fell to goe upon one of them; and now preferd, began the
worst condition of Gally Slaves: our furthest port was but 100.
Leagues, to <hi>Boma;</hi> a goodly <hi>Moores</hi> Citie, and famous countrey,
I meane for its fertilitie as aboundant in all necessaries for the life

which went thither of my acquaintance, but my escape

both bound for <hi>Alexandrea</hi> in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> and well knowne to
<hi>Forans</hi> Purcer; two such shippes never went out before from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giere,</hi>
for besides the excessive Riches of their loading, and passin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of greatest wealth of that Citie, bound in pilgrimage to the
solemnities of the <hi>Meco,</hi> one shippe of them had knowne in her
above three hundred thousand <hi>Soltanies</hi> in Gold, each <hi>Soltanie</hi>
worth their seven shilling <hi>English,</hi> the Purcer returnes to his
shippes, who were both riding without Command, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
sends the <hi>Trugman</hi> to have them come in, or depart their
Road, to which they presently obeyed; nor can I give them any
terme of better grace; they stand to the West, and within an hower
after weighes the <hi>Turkes,</hi> who since have ended their voyage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8545:11"/>
and returned to <hi>Argiere</hi> with great riches. Three dayes
after being the 11. of <hi>October</hi> arrived that noble Captaine, and glory
of the <hi>French</hi> nation, Mounsieur de <hi>Mautie</hi> in a goodly shippe of
58. peeces of Brasse Ordnance alone, and anchored with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
command. The <hi>Duana</hi> or Councell sends to know what
he came for, hee answered to demand his Kings subjects, which
they dislegally detained; with answer returned, the <hi>Turkes</hi> resends
their <hi>Trugman,</hi> commanding Mounsieur presently to depart, or
come under command, other wayes hee should know more from
them. Captaines were convocated, and the <hi>Duana</hi> determined
<hi>Abdera Manrine,</hi> of the <hi>Moores</hi> nation, a right valiant, and expert
Seaman, should be presently armed to goe forth and fetch him in:
but Monnsieur weighed, put out his bloody Flagge and departed.
The 13. <hi>dicto</hi> came in another of the same Fleete, and put out a
white Flagge, using many other signes to parlie, but in the night
went out two Gallies, whereupon the <hi>French</hi> distrusting the worst,
let slip her Cable and Anchor; and was the next day weighed by
the <hi>Turke,</hi> &amp; carried to their <hi>Magazine,</hi> which saved them a labour.</p>
               <p>Ill newes hath wings, its now the 18. <hi>dicto,</hi> when advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
comes to <hi>Argiere</hi> of the taking <hi>Asatiea</hi> of <hi>Ally</hi> the Generals,
and they make it the common cause, alledging the <hi>French</hi> met
with her upon the coast of <hi>Barbary.</hi> A goodly prize she had beene,
for in her, besides rich loading, was in ready Cashe 70000. peeces
of Eight. The whole inhabitants now boyles, the <hi>French</hi> Councell
is sent for, and without any litigation of his cause is by the great
<hi>Duana</hi> or Councell adjudged to be burnt at <hi>Babelwach</hi> gate. Also
<hi>Iacus Santo,</hi> that paid the rents of the <hi>Bastione</hi> condemned to bee
hanged at <hi>Babashon,</hi> usuall places of Christians martirdome;
18. thousand peeces of Eight a yeare payd the sayd <hi>Sancto</hi> to them;
A man which formerly had swayed, a person of great experience
in the Countrey, and well studied in the Art <hi>Machivell,</hi> and much
hated by the poore <hi>French</hi> Captives as a perturber to their infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisments.

for the saving of their soules. <hi>Ally</hi> the Generall, for so is this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
called, powerfull in the City, and the <hi>Turkes</hi> glory, interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for them, giving many pertinent, and powerfull reasons for
their remission. The damage sayd he that is done is to me, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sole owner of the said vessell, and her essentialls, for which I
desire no revenge for my owne perticular: but as I am yours, and
all I have obliged to this City, if your honours thinke it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to revenge the affront done us, by this late Generall which
with one onely shippe outbraved us in our most happy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceable
Port, famous for vertue, and Ianezaries, whose valour
hath shaken, and beene a terrour unto the mes-beleevers of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine
Nations, more then 100. yeares. I have a just propenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and am most prompt to adventure my life and substance in
this most noble Cities quarrell, and that the time of the yeare is
now improper to invade any of the <hi>French</hi> territories. I esteeme
it most convenient there be presently armed six Saile of Gallies, for
the surprising of the <hi>Bastione,</hi> to make a spoyle of what they finde
there, as well of people as others, which will be sufficient satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to us for the present, and a reall demonstration to that <hi>Traleuian</hi>
nation, how little we esteemed them. This oration highly esteemed
was received as an Oracle, &amp; the <hi>Duana</hi> commands the expedition
of the Gallies, who in two dayes were provided, and the 19. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
at noone, without making booke, thy rowed from <hi>Argiere,</hi>
and in three dayes arived at the <hi>Bastwin;</hi> no sooner Anchored, but
Mounsieur the Governour with other <hi>Messuers</hi> comes aboard to
kisse the hand of <hi>Ally</hi> the Generall: in fine many <hi>Madmoyssells,</hi> and
the people there were curious to see so great a man; the visit and
complement ended, the Governour began to take leave of the
Generall, who now demands entertainement in the <hi>Bastione:</hi>
Mounsieur promises no man more welcommer, they goe on land
together; but instantly followed such a crew of <hi>Turkes</hi> as they
presently became masters of the <hi>Bastione.</hi> Mounsieur that had
<hi>Ciceroes</hi> eares, diffident of the event, of so unusuall a change,
shifts himselfe from the Generall, takes Horse, and happily reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to <hi>Barko,</hi> a Castle of the <hi>Ienewayes,</hi> and escaped captivitie,
312. were then captivated with 120. thousand peeces of eight in

redowning to the <hi>French</hi> more then 100. thousand pounds sterling
besides the benefit which they made by the Scale of 100. thousand
Ductets a yeare declared, and so much for the <hi>French</hi> affaires with
<hi>Argiere.</hi> Servility and bondage to an ingenious spirit is worse
then death, which is common to all, this to the miserable. The
danger of the Seas now keepes the <hi>Turkes</hi> at home, and wee Gally
slaves not to be idle, are set to hayling the Cart in lew of Horses,
some to sell water, to chop the Vineyard, and others to builde
houses: in the interim I am devising some course of way to effect
my libertie: five of us combines together to take a Boate some
two miles from the Towne which frequently loaded Ballast;
there having constantly but one <hi>Turke</hi> and two Christians Roars
in her; more Oares must be gotten, a Mast and Sayle, otherwise it
had beene madnesse, and to plunge our selves into more mischiefe:
in fine, foure Oares, a Mast and Saile, <hi>Boraches</hi> for water, Bread and
Compasse was provided, but all the difficultie was to get them
out. For a peece of Eight and halfe I got a <hi>French</hi> man native of
Saint <hi>Mallo,</hi> who had a good Mule to carry all, hee and I loaded
it, our act was just, but none of the wisest; and the <hi>French</hi> man
fit for the purpose, we went in company to the towne gate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
question, but the ward overthrew the carriage, as too suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and layd hands of the <hi>French</hi> man, who doubting nothing
of the sufficiency of my warrant, having told him they were to
be carried to my patrons Garden: in sum, I seeming all desperate
whiles the <hi>French</hi> man was looking about for me to make answer,
I left him, who could not accuse me, as neither knowing my name,
my patron, nor where I dwelt. The poore man afterward with
his partner, and a Roague mearely maintained to prevent the
escape of Christians, sought me, but I kept house till the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was over, and was truly grieved for the detriment the poore
man suffered by blowes, not any wayes worthy blame in me, as seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my libertie; the poore man afterwards divers times met mee,
drew his knife and would have kil'd me, to which hee ever made
deepe protestations with a great deale of <hi>French</hi> fury, which my
<hi>English</hi> resolution cared not for; its not the ill event of an action
that can disanimate a good Spirit, the weake faint with every
succeeding trouble, but the good heart recollects a double cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8545:12"/>
In affliction we were afterwards more jolly company, being
13. and all <hi>English,</hi> who did joyne and make a Purse of 60. peeces
of eight; our desire was to build a Boate, my selfe the man elected
to provide all necessaries, and made sole treasurer. My first inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
was for a convenient Garden, and such a one as was manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by <hi>English</hi> men; a very commodious one was found, 27. Deale
boards I bought, and had them sawed and carried forth, our Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
flowred, pitched and chalked; when within two nights wee
should have beene all ready to depart, unfortunately one of our
Carpenters discovered himselfe by carrying his Rule open in his
hand, when comming without the gate, he thrust it up under his
Doublet, was espyed by a <hi>Moore,</hi> who gave advice to <hi>Dell Ishaw</hi>
the Spie, who with his company tracked him into the Garden,
the subtle Roague taking his best advantage hid himselfe untill the
evening, and then came upon us naked, hee and his crew came ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
tooke six of us, and carried us to the <hi>Bashawes</hi> prison, where
our patrons redeemed us paying 5. peeces of eight <hi>per</hi> head, three of
my poore Countrey men were cruelly beaten, whereof one dyed,
my patron then being <hi>Armenie Mahamet Agga</hi> bid me welcome
without giving me one blow, but if it had beene <hi>Ally</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
I had lost my eares, and nose which is his custome. I was
conscious to the calamities of my poore Countrey men, not that
we could impute blame to one another, for I account every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
oblieged to use all possible attempts for the effecting his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie;
for a man doth not onely discover a pusilanimous heart,
and indocible disposition in neglecting the least opportunitie, but
also commit a sinne against God, who hath not given us wings
to outflie our enemies, but reason to devise stratagems and hands
to execute them.</p>
               <p>It is many yeares since <hi>Charles,</hi> the first Roman Emperour of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
memory assaulted that city where he received the losse of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Gallies, and his Army dissipated, and its now the 27. of
<hi>March</hi> 1638. when by a Diver was discovered much of the ruines
of that <hi>Armado,</hi> and watched by the <hi>Algiers,</hi> the whole side of a
Galley entire, and the Timber as new, besides three peeces of Brasse
Ordnance, and five peeces of Place, all without hurt or bruise,
to which I was an oculer witnesse. Ambition is ever in trouble,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8545:13"/>
and findes no intermission of painefull throwes, untill it hath
brought forth its abortive desires: my patron and master of 800.
Christian slaves is devising more then usuall imployments, and
such as caused great admiration amongst the people, and to adde
to his greater fame; he sends for the most esteemed and best
Architects of those countries, and commences most rare and
sumptuous architectures, or edifices for the lodging of Souldiers,
the thought of which caused a languishing dejection in all of us
his slaves, as none of us exempted from those toyles which was
to us an interminable vexation, (onely the divine goodnesse
that might prevent it) neither was this our sole <hi>Mulct,</hi> but grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was our castigation in being subject to so many Masters; as
Builders, Gardiners, all spectators were our Commanders, and
we oblieged to obey. Lord what passions were in us miserable
wretches, what with the impertinencie of our detectores, and
our assidious labours, as is no marvell that all things seeme
offensive to a crased body: Maledictions wanted not to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaund
the period of those Fabrickes; its time and truth
that conquers, what the future of it may bee, is beyond my
thoughts to determine: in a vast and confused manner wee left it
when we were imbarqued on the Gallies, the ninth of <hi>May,</hi>
1638. and the eleventh, lanched from <hi>Argiere</hi> for that presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
golden voyage, for that now <hi>Ally</hi> had promised to doe
wonders.</p>
               <p>Prosperitie begets pride, and pride goes before destruction;
combination was timely made the last winter with the <hi>Algiers,</hi>
and <hi>Tunessians</hi> for the uniting of their Sea Forts, and for what
end, but for the performance of some great exploit, eight Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the one, and as many more of the others were prepared,
and armed. Who should bee Generall Commander was not
questioned; as who would oppose <hi>Ally</hi> of <hi>Argiere,</hi> for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
renowned in all <hi>Africa:</hi> not onely <hi>Turkes</hi> presumed to doe
wonders, but also the Christians feared it; the one presuming
on their strength, proudly boasted, they feared not all the Gallies
of the <hi>Messen</hi> nations: In summe, Iewes and all made account
the whole Orient of the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> Castle of Christendome
should by this Fleete be destroyed, and the common Merchants


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8545:13"/>
of Christian slaves, prepared monies to buy, as if so many
Slaves had beene ready then in the Markets to be sold. But to the
purpose, <hi>Tunnis</hi> being in the way, the <hi>Algiers</hi> consent to goe
thither and so much the timelier, because <hi>Ally</hi> would show
himselfe in every Port by the way; the <hi>Alerbes</hi> flocke from all parts
to him and hee being ambitious takes no little pride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and glory in
it. On the fourth of <hi>Iune</hi> wee came to <hi>Besert,</hi> but the <hi>Tunnis</hi>
Gallies were gone from thence three dayes before with Ordnance
and other munition to fortefie <hi>Susea. Alley,</hi> too great to enter the
gates of this inferior Towne, was welcomed by the Senators or
Councell without the wall, where he tooke Horse and poasted
for <hi>Tunnis,</hi> whose King and whole <hi>Duana</hi> meets him upon the
way, which was a great addition to his arrogance, and received
him into <hi>Tunnis</hi> a goodly Citie, and was smmptuously entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and feasted; the inhabitants thought themselves honored
that might have the sight of his person and to raise his glory to
the height he is made by the Councell Generall of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,
and authorised to goe whether he pleased. The <hi>Tunnis</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
all oblieged to his command none mollopolised against
him; <hi>Ally</hi> sent for his Fleete to <hi>Tunnis</hi> or the Galletta otherwise
the ruines of Carthage: we must not be seene there but in the
morning, and that with Flagges, Standards and Streamers wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
command was given to the Slaves to row proudly, which
is with a long stroake one in halfe a quarter of an houre; the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
their heads bowed to the Oares Geroone, their fall with a
caper, a princely sport to the spectators, and most royall of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigations,
but the most vile of all slaveries to the subjected; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
came from the Citie to the Gallies, white bread was not
valued, there came such abundance that it fell to the Slaves Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,
wee having beene there seven dayes most welcome to the
<hi>Tunnessians.</hi> The <hi>Tunnies</hi> Gallies were arived, who were no
sooner discryed, but the <hi>Algiers</hi> waighes to use the complement of
meeting; and then he was the bravest Gallant that could show
most Silke: And certainly their standards were (for their worth
and curiositie of rare verses written in them in Letters of Gold
in the <hi>Turkish</hi> language) to bee admired. They gave each other
their valleyes of small shot and their Ordnance, and so ended their
salutation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:8545:14"/>
Their thoughts travelled within them as a woman-in labour,
who findes no rest till she be delivered. And they to hasten their
designes went to <hi>Porta ferinea</hi> to tallow, and with all celeritie
set forward for the Christian shore. The first ship we met withall
was the Love of <hi>London,</hi> neare the Ile of <hi>Pautallereia,</hi> shee was a
goodly shippe and the weather faire, but the <hi>Turke</hi> had nothing
to say to her, wee were next in chase of five Christian Gallies
who nimbly got from us: In the morning we arrived at <hi>Strombello,</hi>
where we put ashore a Frigat of <hi>Naples,</hi> the men all ranashore, three
of them whether wilfully or otherwise I know not, but were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by those afrighting fiers perpetually burning, able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
remorse in the most Flagitious and obdurate hearts, the
noyse being like the roarings of Hell. The others advised the
<hi>Turkes</hi> that those Gallies which they had chased were of the Citie
of <hi>Naples:</hi> and not onely so, but which is most to be lamented to
see how voluntary Christians are to discover the greatest secrets
though to the ruine of their owne countries, for what places hath
the <hi>Turke</hi> taken but by the information of spies, natives of those
places, who casting off grace, after their information receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and turne <hi>Turke,</hi> and are instruments to ruinate their whole
posteritie. I have knowne three that have Pilated the <hi>Turke</hi> to the
place where they were borne, and beene instruments in the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
of their owne fathers and mothers and all their Lineage, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their parts of the price for which their Parents were sold for
in the Market, which served them for spending money, on whores,
in Tavernes, and for worse vices. These Neapolitanes advised the
<hi>Turkes</hi> of two Gallies of that Citie, loaden with Silkes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whose Cargassoones were of excessive value, and bound for <hi>Iene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may,</hi>
and must passe that way and that within three dayes,
but God turned that counsell to foolishnesse, for had they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

115. persons, one whereof was the Bishop of that place, and 15.
Nunnes, the chiefe of which was Cosen German to the Prince
of <hi>Rochella,</hi> the other were impotent and aged people: then
was the whole Coast in an uproare, and as we were passing by,
they let flye their Ordnance at randome, but the Turke to ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

through the vally of <hi>Messena,</hi> that City thundered but to
little purpose, onely to shew the Turke what they could doe if
they were neerer; the bold Turke landed upon the maine, and
set on fire their houses, burnt fisher boates, passage boates, horses,
and travellers, provision, without feare, haryed all the Coasts,
killing beeves, and other Cattle, and setting whole fields of corne
on fire and committing many other outrages, to the great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of the Country: insomuch, as it was disliked by some Turkes
themselves, and being now come to <hi>Rochella,</hi> they met with a
<hi>Neapolitane</hi> ship of 20 gunnes, and having discharged 3. of
them, they took his, and afterward set fire on her, and then being
insolent were ready to attempt any thing, their prosperity made
them mad. <hi>Mallapane</hi> a Renegado of the Greeke Nation, who
runne away with a Gally of the great Turkes, which he sould in
<hi>Tunnis,</hi> for 26000. peeces of eight, informed them of a Citie
lately sunke: wherein of many thousand Soules which perished
by that disaster, there onely remained about 400 persons posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
great riches, living in cottages errected for their present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities;
his information was most joyfully received, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector
not a little proud to be the Instrument of so great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
The attempt was prosecuted, and at midnight 1500 Turkes
Landed to captivate and spoyle those imagined more than distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and forlorne people: <hi>Malapane</hi> was generall conductour and
he brought them to the Citie, which the day shewed them to be
standing, and sumptuous, who sent them such Orators, as made
them use more haste backe than good speede. This City was well

that Island there were at least 300. Christians; beside rich pillage
and no difficultie in taking it, as being unfortified, yet others
contrary opinioned, opposed, alleaged the danger of the sea,
which for a time caused a demurre in some of them; yet concluded
that when that should faile, they would fall upon some Greeke
Towne, which lived under the Great Turkes obedience, and let

for the Arming his Navie; in a day and a night they are
provided and ready, and Saturday morning, <hi>Iune</hi> 8. arrives in that
Port with his whole Armatha: the Turkish Gallies then at skale,
their powers upon the Land; this <hi>Vollonia</hi> is a great Bay of 5
Leagues deepe or long, Land lockt on both sides, it hath in the
plaine a great Castle and well fortified, and in it a great number
of excellent brasse Ordnance; upon the hill or mountaine of


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8545:16"/>
exceeding great height is another Castle over-seeing a great part
of the Country, and farre discovering at Sea; which Castle disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the <hi>Venetian</hi> Navie, shot a warning peece, the word now
<hi>forratendo,</hi> for we had then our tents up to keepe us from the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which then rained, thundred, and lightned in most terrible
manner, it is now time the Turke looke about himselfe, they let
slip their Cables, and roade under the great Castle, there being
in sight those that before they cared not for now feares them: it is
too much to be a speaker and a dooer, the deepest waters are the
least heard, whereas the shallowest makes the greatest noyse; the
Turke is now consulting for best order of defence, and by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
consent brings their poopes to the shoare, and their prowes to
the Sea, their Gallies lashed one to another, only leaving distance
for the slaves to use their Oares, for the Gallies order; the fowle
weather and abundance of raine made the <hi>Venetian</hi> all improper
to give an assault that day. Sunday morning after the performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and rites of Christianity, they put abroad their flagges, and
standard, and with drummes and trumpets, advances in the front
where the two Gallyasses thundering with their Artillerie, before
the smaller Gallies Ordnance could doe execution. <hi>Allie</hi> the
Generall now solicits the verteous <hi>Mustapha</hi> Captaine of the
Castell to defend his Navie and people from the violence of the
<hi>Naizerian</hi> misbeleevers, which with store of peeces of eight hee
effected, as the French Proverbe sayes, silver answers to all; it is
so powerfull a prevailer with that Nation of the Turke, that
giving them money with one hand, they may put out their eyes
with the other; powder and Gunners are sent into the Castle,
which is not a trivial one but containes an English mile in curcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference:
in sum, it is a place strong both by Art &amp; Nature, having in
it more than 150 peeces of brasse Ordnance; the best that ever I
saw. <hi>Mustapha,</hi> the Captaine now displayes the Horse Taile, or
royall insigne of the great <hi>Turke,</hi> and stoutly defends the <hi>Barbariscos</hi>

major part of the Captaines commanded a retreate, contrary to
the will of that noble Generall <hi>Marine Capella,</hi> who for his worth
and valour may be ranked amongst the greatest Captaines of those
times. Thus ended that fight which had continued neare three
houres to the glory of the <hi>Turke</hi> for that present, who for joy
gave their feesses or out cries, <hi>Alla, Alla, Mahomet,</hi> and <hi>Rosallah,</hi>
which is God, God, alone; and <hi>Mahamet</hi> his prophet thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

the Serinissimo Prince and illusterous Sinate, what accurred;
Demanding their future pleasures concerning those <hi>Turkish</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates:
there's many Snake lies hid under Stawbury leaves for all
this great flash of the <hi>Turkish</hi> glory; they are yet timerous what
the event will be, and to prevent the worst, the same night they
difinbarqued all their Christians, carries them a mile into the
countrey, and erected Tents in the field for their randavowes,
being all well coupled tenne and tenne together in chaines, they
also makes a Trench opposite to their Gallies to play the brave

slenderly manned, as not having one Gally with another above

<hi>Turkes</hi> are now ashamed, and blames somes cowardlinesse, and
withall haste tallowes and prepares their Gallies which are soone
accommodated, but before a supply of Souldiers is come to the
<hi>Venetians</hi> from <hi>Corffue,</hi> but without the <hi>Turkes</hi> knowledge they
now call a councell and concludes to send <hi>Mustapha</hi> Captaine of
the Castle to treate with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Generall, and under that
pretence to spy out and discover their Forces. <hi>Mustapha</hi> goes
to them, parlies with <hi>Marine Cappella,</hi> and according to their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Generall, the great <hi>Turkes</hi> letter, but <hi>Marine Capella Semper
Idem,</hi> refuseth all treatie with them, and had good cause of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie
by good intelligencers. <hi>Mustapha</hi> returnes with this
answer, that if they would come forth they should bee most wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and couragiously received, but to their owne perills; and
that if it fortuned they to carry him, he must have patience: but if
it fortune he to carry them, as he hoped in the mercy of Jesus and
the vertue of their patron S. <hi>Marke</hi> he should, they must have the
like; he also saw the <hi>Venetians</hi> well armed, and having delivered
this answer to <hi>Ally</hi> hee is not a little perplexed; the <hi>Venetian</hi> on
their parts as vigellent as the <hi>Turke,</hi> had there especially some
<hi>Turkes,</hi> others <hi>Albinesses,</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> of the countrey, by whom hee
got daily information of the <hi>Turkes</hi> proceedings, excellently well
playd on their parts; they imployed <hi>Turkes</hi> averse in religion and
condition to the Christians, who without suspition every day
eate and dranke with the enemy: Consequently the better able to
informe the <hi>Albinesses</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> they imployed to accuse the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie
or invaliditie of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> reports the <hi>Venetian</hi> confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable

were placed where the <hi>Turkes</hi> must passe, if they attempted
it; and every night having their Frigats and Boats which came
under the Castle walls, and to the very Prowes of the Gallies
which so daunted the <hi>Turkes</hi> that they now utterly dissisted from
their resolution of combate, and all amort are devising a new way
to secure the Slaves, if the <hi>Venetian</hi> should land his Forces, and
ayme to fetch them off by force: 500. of us were put into a Tower
in the Castle; all lying 10. and 10. in chaines, a place as darke as
Pitch, and a foot thicke in dust, but its now seven weekes since the
arrivall of the <hi>Venetian Armatha</hi> in this Port, and their Gally

should doe, should bee well done, nor does hee omit any time
to illustrate his zeale to the divine majestie and valour to ruenate
so many miscrante enemies to the faith of Christ: who as breake

of day commences a second battaile with thundering off great
Ordnance, and vallies of small Shot; for although the <hi>Venetians</hi>
carries not so many Souldiers in their Gallies as the <hi>Turke</hi> does,
yet have they this advantage of them, that upon any occasion they
arme their <hi>Bonavollies</hi> and condemned men, who upon promise of
libertie or other reward will fight bravely; the <hi>Turke</hi> leaves their
Gallies and runnes into the Castle, Christians they force to be
Gunners, the two Galliasses with 4. other smaller Gallies, batters
that Castle whilest the others board the Turkish Gallies, lay their
fasts to them, and roaes them away; thus Nobly did the <hi>Venetian</hi>
end this fight in lesse than an houre, to their glory and the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of the Barberiscos: great murmerings were now amongst the
<hi>Turkes</hi> against <hi>Ally</hi> their Generall, who has no other way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
their furie and revenge, but by open handed liberalitie,
wherein he promised to relieve the Souldiers present necessitie:
In summe his generositie is universall to the reliefe of that ruena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
company, as well Christians as <hi>Turkes,</hi> and he promised the
remuneration of all the Captaines, by refurnishing them with as
many Gallies as they had lost. The hurleburly with these glorious
proffers being over; <hi>Ally</hi> now seekes all the coast, and recollects
the greatest shot the <hi>Venetians</hi> had made against them, which he
since presented to the great <hi>Turke,</hi> whom he intercedes for remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
and revenge, urging a breach of peace, in that the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
surprised their Gallies in one of his Masters Ports. But
three dayes after that fight he marched from <hi>Volloniea</hi> to <hi>Sellenico</hi>
in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> leaving behind him onely fiftie eight Christians in
great indisposition, whereof my selfe was one, so feeble as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a dead man; but such is the goodnesse of God as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
daily: It pleased the divine Majestie to keepe mee in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing

downe in relapse of a most violent Fever, but thankes bee unto
God that hath not given me over as a prey to their teeth; in 35.

               <p>Certaine <hi>Turkes</hi> were left with us a Guardians or Keepers,

landed before their surprisall, whereof the chiefe was <hi>Murate,</hi> by
a Renegatha of the <hi>Corceca</hi> nation, a person of great honour in
<hi>Argiere,</hi> Lievetenant Generall of the <hi>Armatha,</hi> a father in Law to
<hi>Ally</hi> the Generall, a man of an hundred and foure yeares of age,

               <p>God that had preserved us in so many inevitable dangers, did
also restore some of us to more then an ordinary strength of body,
from so great feeblenesse and such poore meanes for recovery:
no sooner were wee able to stand upon our legges, but we are stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
how to bring to passe our libertie; foureteene of us being
in reasonable strength resolves to give the attempt, yet some pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellanimous,
base spirit proves a Traytor, informes the Guardion
of our intentions, and not onely so, as being resolved to runne
away, but also to kill him; for his report we are all Castigated,
and our case pittious. Command was given to the Souldiers
of the Castle to looke vigilently unto us; that death is better then
so base a life, nor could this deter or disanimate us from our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to attaine libertie or death, no time so fit as the present,
come what will come.</p>
               <p>All were in chaines, foure and foure except a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the
supposed deare friend of our Guardion, and my selfe dispencer
of the house; it fortuned our Guardion to goe to the next towne,
called by them <hi>Deshera</hi> some mile off, in whose absence wee used
such Art as we got all the rest out of chaines, and the Locks againe
so put in, as to be taken out with our fingers; in the evening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
our Keeper, well fudled or well drunke, whereby no search
was made to our Fetters that night: It being <hi>Saterday,</hi> the 22.
of <hi>October</hi> 1638. betwixt twelve and one houres in the night we
rose together, two rouses the ablest men amongst us, throw
their Coates over their faces and would not goe: A <hi>Gersie</hi> man,
and by trade a Cooper, was so drunke that he could not goe, but


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8545:18"/>
my griefe is for those poore soules, whose indisposition was such
as they could not goe; I was conscious to their pittious moanes
but could not helpe them, what became of our Keeper I cannot
tell, my consorts told me they had not done him any violence;
hee had good clothes and some peeces of eight, of which wee
tooke not any with us, but left all, as a testimony of our genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
as to contemne all terrene materialls, preferring penurious
libertie before Fetters of Gold: our provision was some bread,
and we also carried a <hi>Boracha</hi> for water, and a double Rope, with
which we scaled the Castle walls: In this manner wee departed,
foure <hi>English</hi> men, one <hi>Welch</hi> man, a <hi>Gersie</hi> man, two <hi>French</hi> men,
one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> one <hi>Majorcine,</hi> a <hi>Neopolitane,</hi> a <hi>Greeke,</hi> and a boy
of <hi>Malta;</hi> in our passing through the Castle, although it be full
of houses and people, we heard onely the barking of a Dogge, and
having gone neare two miles, took the shore side for our director.
God that never failes those that trust in him, so provided for us,
that we found two Boates, one of them having a Maste standing,
her we imbraced, and sunke the other, to prevent their persuing
after us; and having rowed two nights and a day, wee recovered
the Ile of <hi>Corfue,</hi> and landed at a Monistary called Saint <hi>Catterines,</hi>
where we were curteously received by the Greeke Fathers; at
noone wee rowed to the Monestery of <hi>Madone,</hi> where wee had
intelligence of a Gally being some two miles from thence cutting
wood, and that night to goe for the Citie of <hi>Corfue.</hi> The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Illustricemo de Molimea</hi> entertained us with all courtesie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
us into his Gally, and carried us for that Citie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
us to the providitor of the Iland; who after our examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not a little to his content, sent us to the generall Gally of
<hi>Venice,</hi> where we had a supper and lodging that night, and the
next day a Passe, and imbarcation for <hi>Venice:</hi> being now to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thankes unto the Lord who has done this great worke for
me in delivering me from such an inextrecable labarinth of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>blessed be God that hath broken that snare, and set my fecte in a large
roome, not unto us O Lord, let unto thy name be the glory;</hi>
I am now in my way to <hi>Venice</hi> upon the Gally of <hi>Counterine;</hi> the
first skale we made was at <hi>Budway</hi> in <hi>Epire;</hi> our second at <hi>Catriea,</hi> a

antiquitie and strength, being an absolute Sinurie, having many
other Cities to her obedience, and in joying an ample patrimony,
onely its her misery to be tributary to the great <hi>Turke,</hi> to whom
for dismollistation they pay yearely 40000. peeces of eight: our
fourth ankering was at <hi>Lessena,</hi> our fift at <hi>Spellata,</hi> our sixt at
<hi>Sabainica.</hi> a sweet Citie famous for her Port and invincible Castle
in the Sea; our seventh at <hi>Zara,</hi> a sumptuous and spacious Citie;
we are shortning our way and come to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Dalmathiea,</hi>
and also passed other Cities not so remarkable as the rest, I doe
therefore omit to nominate, at <hi>Polla</hi> in <hi>Istra</hi> wee met with the
generall Gally of <hi>Argiere,</hi> and sometime the glory of <hi>Barbary,</hi> which
with one more presented by the <hi>Venetians</hi> to the Pope are all that
remaines of that 16. Gallies of the <hi>Turke,</hi> the rest being sunke in
<hi>Corfue:</hi> wee are come to <hi>Ruena,</hi> a pretty Citie and most fertile
Countrey, and from thence to <hi>Perenca,</hi> a Citie destroyed by the
Popes excommunication: In summe with sight of other Cities
I arrived in <hi>Venice,</hi> where I imbarked upon the great <hi>Charles</hi> of

to survive to see the naturall place of my habitation.</p>
               <p>Thus have I recorded a plenary memoriall of my seven yeares
bondage, but not the severall accidents of my indurances, there
wanting in me abilitie to devulge them, for as there is no cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
can befall a man in this life which hath the least parallell
to this of Captivitie, neither are the indurances of Captives
equall, although the least without the divine assistance were
insupportable; yet are they all easie in Comparison to that
of the Gallies which is most inhumane and diabollicall
and such as doth rather, imperverse men then Repleate any
good humour in them; good fortune to mee is a singular mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to modesty, and a forcible spurre to moderation; prayers
winne mee, menances reject me, favours relent mee, feares im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perverseth
me: alas, such are their ditraments, as causeth them
to curse the day of their Nativities, and the parents that engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
them, and if it were to dye to curse God himselfe, I speake
it with awfull timour: in their passions they renounce heaven, S.
<hi>Peter,</hi> and all sanctitie; in their agonies or discontents, they ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sially
spit against the wind, disputing whether God and Nature


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8545:19"/>
be conspired against them, when it is either calme or contrary; for
a drop of water they would pawne their soules, and often are
constrained to drinke of the Salt Oceans; their repast at best but
bread and water, and for want of sleepe are in continuall extasies;
the strokes of the Oare is dollerous, and with its ausideousnesse
many splits their hearts at it, in this miserie all things makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
themselves: the scorching heate now penetrates their brains,
their flesh is burned off their backes, when anon they are as much
pinched with cold: strong fetters are their neerest consorts from
which they are never exempted, unlesse for equall miseries; their
repose, when they have any, is sitting, their pillow the banke up
right, and that dubble, not having so much roome as to stretch
their legges; their sleepe when they have any is an houre in
twelve, and that at night, when the one halfe Roaes and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
slumbers: a call of a Whisell awakes them all three hundred
or more of them, their audiance and leape must be altogether; the
discpline take Oare in hand, the stroke regular and punctiall, their
heads shaved unto the skull, their faces disvigured with disbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
their bodies all naked, onely a short linnen paire of breeches
to cover their privities, they Mount and fall like <hi>Appe</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille,</hi>
for so is the command: from Poop to Prow nothing but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cecrations
and passing of blowes: Who has not his head and
face broken, all their bodies pearled with a bloody sweate? Nay,
which of their sences is not a window to let in sorrow? if chased
by the Christian Gallies, by whom they may be relieved, they are
then forced to put might and maine, to runne from them, the
Turkes standing with drawne sables over their heads, and if by
feabelnes any faints, has his Armes or head Cut off: they are beaten
to put on their clothes and beaten to take them off, they are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
to eate, drinke, sleepe, and wash, and are beaten for doing
any of these; what shall I say more of these exorbitant men, who
had they the vertue of patience, reposing sure confidence in the
Divine Majestie, I presume, God would deliver them, so wishing
them grace, whilst lamenting their estates, left in those torments,
many of whom I love most deare, doe end this discourse, desiring
God to send them libertie.</p>

the Turke is he that fights for all, both by Sea and Land, and by
his power as Conquerer keepes all the other sort of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

unto them, as possessing goods by imagination, and the others
possessing the essentialls: for the Moores and Tageriens are the
owners of Lands and ships, and the onely Armorers of them,
whom I may compare to the maine Sea, and the Turkes but as
Rivelets or small streames to emptie themselves in the great
Ocean, for besides their pay and shares, they get at Sea, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

the difference should not be onely judicated by <hi>Turkes,</hi> but rather

meane their government Millitary, they are so depraved as they
have no good Custome amongst them, for although in all their
doings, they begin with the first mover, if it be but in cutting a
peece of bread, and that in their way they wash and pray five times
a day, and are very ceremonious in their law; yet are they incori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly
flagitious, they are sayd to commit Sodomie with all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and tollerate all vices; so their women for their parts are
most impudent and addicted to all kindes of unnaturallnesse, yet
greedy lovers of money; they make no scruple of murder, neither
of infants is it enquired after: so on the contrary doth the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
upon discontent, jelousie, or displeasure, cut their throates,
throw them out at windowes into the Sea, and in the open
streets without remorse of conscience or inquisition of Justice,


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8545:31"/>
to say so much as what hast thou done. There is no Naturall love
from the man to the Wife, nor from the woman to her husband;
they marrie without sight one of another, and their ayme and
intent onely intrest: they buy their wives, paying halfe their
dowrie in hand, and the other upon divorce, for upon least diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
they turne away each other: the man obleiges himselfe to
maintaine his wife, with a precise forme of allowance, which if
he any wayes failes to performe, its frequent and legall the woman
to abandon her husband, and that without scruple, although in
their aboad together they have had many children, (like to like as
the Devill said to the Collier) for they are as well rewarded in
their children, whose disobedience is such, that to defame and buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet
them is usance, and their parents count it a favour to doe them

to all Nations; bloody hearted, living by defraudes, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their knowledge of the Law, are as disobedient to
their parents as the other. There is yet another sort of people and
they are Christians, whose case is to be pitied, that lyes groaning
under the yoake of <hi>Turkish,</hi> tyrannie, who Martyr them dayly
by their most contested, most inexorable, and unhumane creuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
whose number and vertues were they armed, were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough to master <hi>Argere,</hi> but to make a finall conquest of all
<hi>Africa;</hi> they are esteemed to be 60000. truely I thinke them little
lesse, for by common probabilitie, there being 16000. Gardens,
and one with another, having a Christian, some two, three, and
foure, besides so great a Number as are in the Citie, put to all vile
and base services, others that goe to Sea, they doing nothing
that tends to labour themselves, so that it carries too great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie
to be that Number: but those that I must lament, and
nature obliges to be most indulgent to, is for more than 1500. of
my miserable Countrie men, who are there plunged in the most
vile and greatest detriments, certainely a faire course would effect
their enlargement, and without all doubt be most acceptable to
Almightie God, and bring a benediction upon his Majestie, his
Royall posteritie, people and dominions; they have a most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
opinion of his Majesties gracious favour toward them, and
are credulous that his Royall bountie will be no lesse propence
to them, than it hath beene to those that were in <hi>Moroco</hi> and <hi>Sally;</hi>
they blame the wils of some ill affected persons, who they say


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8545:32"/>
have long countermaunded that beniffecence which would have
beene their remuneration; here are those indeede that pretend if
those men should be redeemed, upon like hopes others would
not fight, and so give away Merchants estates, which alas it is a
weake assertion; we all know it is not the common sort that
swayes, but the Captaine which if a Lyon, a sheepe will follow
him: in Corporall diseases, if the head be ill, how is all the body
distempered, but what rationall man is there that would yeeld
himselfe into a 14. or 15. yeares slavery, although he knew cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
at the end of that terminie, to be redeemed. Who does us
all this mischiefe but Christians, consider the unwonted damages
we dayly receive by them, premeditate what may more ensue, if
some speedy course be not taken to releeve them; those poore
soules who in anguish of their hearts, bereft of all Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations,
and meanes ordinary to reviste their <hi>Patria,</hi> many having
wives and Children, whom they love most deere, so that like a
Beare robbed of her whelpes, they are forced to take revenge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing
of better Fortunes, and suppose by doing great spoyles
to Anticepate their infranchisment; such men they are that had
or may his Majestie have occasion to use Sea-men, a 1000. of them
were better than the best 3000. in England; pardon me for the
comparison, for they have had custome to beget boldnesse, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
to doe execution, many of them have beene there 11.
some 12. yeares; fighting to them is as ordinary as to us carousing:
in summe, they are excellent men, either for offence or defence,
in Sea Services, and so accustomarily expert, that by judgement
of their eye, they will eschew and avoyd a great shot: It is further
pretended, if they should be inlarged, and a peace established,
those Pirats of <hi>Allgere</hi> would never conserve and keepe it; I am
certaine that the last peace was broken by the English, by whom
those of <hi>Argere</hi> received many injuries and long suffered them
before they sought the least revenge, and the first <hi>English</hi> shippe
brought thither, caused many differences betwixt themselves in

till they saw the poore men so neglected, as no man interceaded
for them; I am confident that if his Majestie should send for
those his poore, but most Loyall subjects; that the <hi>Turkes</hi> would

of plate and gold, I have sufficiently demonstrated to satisfie any
