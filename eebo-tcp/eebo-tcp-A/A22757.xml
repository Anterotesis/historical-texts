            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE KINGS most</hi> Excellent Majestie well knoweth, That the Calling, Adjourning, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing, and Dissolving of Parliaments, are undoubted Prerogatives insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly annexed to his Imperiall Crown, of which he is not bound to render any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:68:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but to God alone, no more then of his other Regall actions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neverthelesse</hi> his Majestie, whose Piety and Goodnesse have made him ever so order and govern all things, That the cleernesse and candor of his Royall heart may appear to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, especially in those great and publike Matters of State, that have relation to the weal and safetie of his People, and the honour of his Royall person and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: <hi>Hath thought fit,</hi> for avoiding and preventing all sinister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions and misinterpretations, which the malice of some persons ill-affected to his Crown and Soveraignty, hath, or may practise to infuse into the mindes and ears of his good and faithfull Subjects, to set down by way of Declaration, the true causes aswell of his Assembling, as of his Dissolving the late Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:68:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>IT is not unknown to most of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties loving Subjects, what discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements he hath formerly had by the undutifull and seditious carriage of divers of the lower house in preceding Assemblies of Parliament, enough to have made him averse to those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and accustomed wayes of calling his people together, when in stead of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull expressions towards his Person and Government, they vented their own malice and disaffections to the State, and by their subtile and malignant cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, endeavoured nothing more then to bring into contempt and disorder all Government and Magistracy.</p>
            <p>Yet his Majestie well considering that but few were guilty of that sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and undutifull behaviour, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that time and experience had made
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:68:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his loving Subjects sensible of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper the whole Kingdom was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be put into by the ill govern'd actions of those men, And his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie being ever desirous to tread in the steps of his most noble Progenitors, was pleased to issue forth his Writs under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be holden on the thirteenth day of April last.</p>
            <p>At which day, his Majestie by the Lord Keeper of His great Seal was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleased to let both houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament know, how desirous he was, That all his people would unite their hearts and affections in the execution of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels that might tend to the Honour of his Majestie, the safety of his Kingdoms, and the good and preservation of all his people. And withall how confident he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:68:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was that they would not be failing in their duties and affections to him and to the publique.</p>
            <p>He laid open to them the manifest and apparant mischiefs threatned to this and all his other Kingdoms, by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous and rebellious behaviour of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Scottish nation, who had by their examples drawn many of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there into a course of disloyalty and disobedience not fit for his Majestie in honour, safety, or wisdom to endure.</p>
            <p>How to strengthen themselves in their disloyall courses, they had addrest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to forraign States, and treated with them to deliver themselves up to their protection and defence, as was made apparant under the proper hands of the prime Ring-leaders of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious faction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:68:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>These courses of theirs, tending so much to the ruine and overthrow of this famous Monarchy, united by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> upon his Majestie, and his Father of blessed memory; his Majestie (in his great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in discharge of the trust repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in him by God, and by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall laws of both Kingdoms, for the protection and government of them) resolved to suppresse, and thereby to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate that soveraigne power entrusted to him. He had by the last Summers triall found, that his grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was abused, and that contrary to his expectation and their faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, they had, since his being at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and the Pacification there made, pursued their former rebellious designes, and therefore it was necessary now for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:68:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Majestie by Power to reduce them to the just and modest condition of their obedience and subjection, which when ever they should be brought unto, or see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own errours, should put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a way of humility and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience becoming them, his Majestie should need no other Mediatours for Clemency and Mercy to them, then his own Piety and Goodnesse, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection he hath ever born to that his native Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This being of so great weight and consequence to the whole Kingdom, and the charge of an Army, fit to master such a businesse, amounting to so great a sum as his Majestie had no means to raise, having not onely emptied his own cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, but issued between three and four hundred thousand pounds which he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:68:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his servants, upon security out of his own estate, to provide such things as were necessary to begin such an action with; his Majestie after the example of his Predecessors, resorted to his people in their representative body the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom he desired (with all the expressions of grace and goodnesse which could possibly come from him) That ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into serious and dutifull considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the nature of these bleeding evils, and how dangerous it was to lose the least minute of time, lest thereby those of <hi>Scotland</hi> should gain opportunity to frame their parties with forraign States, that they would for a while lay aside all other debates, and passe an Act for the speedie payment of so many Subsidies as might enable his Majestie to put in readinesse for this Summer those things
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:68:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which were to be prepared before so great an Army could be brought into the field.</p>
            <p>For further supply necessary for so great an undertaking, his Majestie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he expected it not till there might be a happy conclusion of that Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and till their just grievances might be first graciously heard and relieved.</p>
            <p>Wherein, as his Majestie would most willingly have given them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence before matter of supply, if the great necessity of his occasions could have permitted, so he was graciously pleased for their full assurance and satisfaction therein to give them his Royall word, That without determining the Session upon granting of the Subsidies, he would give them before they parted, as much time as the season of the yeer, and the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:68:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great affairs in hand would permit, for considering all such Petitions as they should conceive to be good for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and what they could not now finish, they should have full time to perfect towards Winter; his Majesty graciously assuring them, that he would go along with them for their advantage through all the expressions of a gracious and pious King, to the end there might be such a happy conclusion of that as might be the cause of many more meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them in Parliament. From their first assembling untill the <hi>21.</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, the house of Commons did nothing that could give his Majestie any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or confidence in their speedy supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him: Whereupon he commanded both the houses to attend him in the Banquetting house at <hi>Whitehall</hi> in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:68:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the afternoon of that <hi>21.</hi> day of April. Where by the Lord Keeper his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie put them in minde of the end for which they were assembled, which was for his Majesties supply, That if it were not speedy, it would be of no use unto him; Part of the Army then marching at the charge of above a hundred thousand pounds a moneth, which would all be lost if his Majestie were not presently sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, so as it was not possible to be longer forborn. Yet his Majestie then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest that the supply he for the present desired, was onely to enable him to go on with his designes for three or four mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and that he expected no further supply till all their just grievances were relieved.</p>
            <p>And because his Majestie had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of some misapprehensions
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:68:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
about the levying of the Shipping-money, his Majestie commanded the Lord Keeper to let them know, That he never had any intention to make any Revenue of it, nor had ever made any; but that all the money Collected had been paid to the Treasurer of the Navie, and by him expended, besides great sums of money every yeer out of his Majesties own purse.</p>
            <p>That his Majestie had once resolved this yeer to have levied none, but that he was forced to alter his resolution, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he was of necessity to send an Army for reducing those of <hi>Scotland,</hi> during which time it was requisite the Seas should be well guarded: And besides his Majestie had knowledge of the great Fleets prepared by all neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Princes this yeer, and of the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:68:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
committed by those of <hi>Algiers,</hi> with the store of Ships which they had in readinesse.</p>
            <p>And therefore though his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie for this present yeer could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it, but expected their concurrence in the levying of it, yet for the future to give all his Subjects assurance how just and Royall his intentions were, and that all his aime was but to live like their King, able to defend himself and them, to be usefull to his friends and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his enemies, to maintain the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie of the Seas, and so make the Kingdom flourish in trade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, he was graciously pleased to let them know, That the ordinary Revenue now taken by the Crown could not serve the turn, and therefore that it must be by Shipping-money or some other way,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:68:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wherein he was willing to leave it to their considerations what better course to finde out, and to settle it how they would, so the thing were done which so much imported the honour and safety of the Kingdom; and his Majestie for his part would most readily and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully grant any thing they could desire for securing them in the propriety of their goods and estates, and in the liberty of their persons.</p>
            <p>His Majestie telling them it was in their power to make this as happy a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as ever was, and to be the cause of the Kings delighting to meet with his people, and his people with him.</p>
            <p>That there was no such way to effect this as by putting obligations to trust and confidence upon him, which as it was the way of good manners with a King, so it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:68:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was a surer and safer course for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, then any that their own jealousies and feares could invent, his Majestie being a Prince that deserved their trust, and would not lose the honour of it, and a Prince of such a gracious nature that disdained his people should overcome him by kindnesse.</p>
            <p>He had made this good to some other Subjects of his, and if they followed his counsell, they should be sure not to repent it, being the people that were neerest and deerest to him, and Subjects whom he did and had reason to value more then the Subjects of any his other Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>His Majestie having thus graciously expressed himself unto them, he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the House of Commons would have the next day taken into consideration the matter of Supply, and laid aside all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:68:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other debates till that were resolved of according to his desire.</p>
            <p>But instead of giving an answer therein, such as the pressing and urgent occasions required, they fell into Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses and Debates about their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Grievances, and raised up so many, and of so severall natures, that in a Parliamentary way they could not but spend more time then his Majesties great and weighty affaires could possibly afford.</p>
            <p>His Majestie foreseeing in his great wisdom that they were not in the way to make this a happy Parliament, which he so much desired and hoped, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be wanting on his part to bring them into the right way for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the safety of the Kingdom, and their own good, he resolved to desire the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:68:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
assistance of the Lords of the higher house, as persons in rank and degree neerest to the Royall Throne, and who having received honour from him and his Royall Progenitors, he doubted not would for those and many other reasons be moved in honour and dutifull affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Person and Crown, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose the house of Commons to expresse their duties to his Majestie, in expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the matter of Supply, for which they were called together, and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired so present a dispatch.</p>
            <p>For this purpose, his Majestie in his Royall Person came again to the Lords house on Wednesday the <hi>24.</hi> day of April, where himself declared to the Lords the cause of his coming, which was, to put them in minde of what had been by the Lord Keeper in his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:68:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
name delivered unto both houses the first day of the Parliament, and after at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> how contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation the house of Commons having held consultation of Matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Property of goods, and Liberty of Parliament; and voted some things concerning those three heads, had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by given them the precedence before the matter of his supply, That his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities were such, they could not bear delay, That what ever he had by the Lord Keeper promised he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, if the house of Commons would trust him. For Religion, that his heart and conscience went together with the Religion established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and he would give order to his Archbishops and Bishops, that no innovation in matter of Religion should
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:68:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
creep in. For the Ship-money, that he never made or intended to make any profit to himself of it, but onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Dominion of the Seas, which was so necessary, that without it the Kingdom could not subsist; but for the way and means by Ship-money, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he left it to them. For property of goods, and liberty of Parliament, he ever intended his people should enjoy them, holding no King so great as he that was King of a rich and free people, and if they had not property of goods, and liberty of persons, they could be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rich nor free. That if the house of Commons would not first trust him, all his affairs would be disordered, and his businesse lost. That though they trusted him in part at first, yet before the Parliament ended he must totally
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:68:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
trust them, and in conclusion they must for execution of all things wholly trust him. Therefore since the matter was no more then who should be first trusted, and that the trust of him first was but a trust in part, his Majestie desired the Lords to take into their considerations his and their own Honour, the safety and welfare of this Kingdom, with the great danger it was in, and that they would by their advice dispose the house of Commons to give his supply the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before the grievances.</p>
            <p>His Majestie being departed, the Lords took into serious consideration what his Majestie had commended to their care, and forthwith laying aside all other debates, such was their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships dutifull and affectionate carriage, they remembring well what had been
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:68:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
formerly declared in his Majesties name to both houses, his Majesties gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises and expressions then and at this time, with the pressing and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occasions which so much imported the honour of his Majestie and the good of this Kingdom, their Lordships deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their votes in these words, <q>We are of opinion that the matter of his Majesties supply should have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence, and be resolved of before any other matter whatsoever; And we think fit there shall be a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence desired with the house of Commons to dispose them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly the next day being Sater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the <hi>25.</hi> day of April, a Conference was had in the Painted Chamber by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of both Houses, where the Lord
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:68:13"/>
Keeper, by the Lords command, told the House of Commons of his Majesties being the day before in person in the higher House, how graciously he had expressed himself, in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Propertie of Goods, and Liberty of Parliament; and that he would therein graciously hear and relieve them, and give them what in reason could be desired, with the effect of what else had bin graciously delivered unto them by his Majestie, as well touching his constant Zeal and affection to the Religion esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as touching the Ship-money, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of his affairs, which was such, that delay was as prejudiciall as denyall, and that if time were lost, both Houses could not recover it; and therefore their Lordships, though they would move no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:68:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor give any advice concerning Subsidies, but decline it, as that which naturally was to begin with the House of Commons, yet being alike interessed and concerned in the honour and safety of the Kingdom, they held it fit to let them know their opinions and desires, which was, That they should go first on with the matter of his Majesties supply, as that which was most necessary and fit to have precedence; And that being done, they would cheerfully joyn with them in the presenting of their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</p>
            <p>The House of Commons having heard their Lordships opinion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, instead of concurring with their Lordships in preferring the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majesties supply before their Grievances, they spent the whole day
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:68:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on Munday following being the <hi>27.</hi> of April, in taking causelesse exceptions to what had been at the Conference rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them; And the next day being Tuesday the <hi>28.</hi> of April, they desired a Conference with the Lords, and their Lordships meeting them presently in the Painted Chamber, they were so far from their expressing of any willingnesse to joyn with their Lordships in what had been upon so weighty reasons recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto them, that on the contrary they challenged the Lords for invading the Priviledges of the House of Commons, Alleadging, That the Lords having in the former Conference acknowledged that the matter of Subsidie and Supply ought to begin in the House of Commons, had in their voting that it was fit and most necessary that matter of Supply
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:68:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should have precedence before all other businesse, not onely been transported be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds which their Lordships had formerly set to themselves, but by medling with matter of Supply, had as far as in them lay, concluded both the matter and order of proceeding, which the House of Commons took to be a breach of their Priviledge, and for it desired reparation of their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</p>
            <p>And because the Lords had in the first Conference enumerated those three particulars, of Religion, Propriety of Goods, and Priviledge of Parliament, the House of Commons collected they had taken notice of some proceedings in their House concerning those particulars, and thereby broken another great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the House of Commons esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:68:15"/>
in Parliament, and called, The Indempnity of the Commons.</p>
            <p>This how strange and unexpected soever, the Lords heard with patience, and being desirous to remove all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, and clear any mistakings that might retard or avert the resolutions of supplying his Majestie, they seriously debated in the higher house what had been objected by the house of Commons, and resolved, first, <hi>That their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships former voting, That in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions his Majesties supply should have precedence before all other matters, was no breach of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the House of Commons.</hi> And secondly, <hi>That it was no breach of the Priviledges of the house of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for their Lordships to hear what his Majestie declared to them,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:68:15"/>
and thereupon to report the same to the House of Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the end the house of Commons might have a right understanding of their Lordships proceedings, their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships desired another Conference with them, which was accordingly had on Fryday the first of May in the painted Chamber, where by the command of the Lords, the Lord Keeper declared to the house of Commons, That the Lords of the higher house had, as in duty and affection to his Majesties Crown and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they were bound, taken into serious consideration the great and weighty motives of his Majesties cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this Parliament, The great evils and calamities that hung over their heads, and the apparent danger the Kingdom was like to run into, if by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:68:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
speedy and fitting supply his Majestie were not enabled to prevent it. How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable delay and protraction was, and how impossible for both houses to recover the losse of time in a matter of so pressing and urgent necessity. That his Majestie had both in the higher house, and in the Banquetting house at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> expressed his gracious and Princely desire to do all that from a just and gracious King might be expected, whereby this Parliament might have a happy conclusion. How his Majestie had promised all their just grievances should be graciously heard and relieved. That their Lordships were witnesses his Majestie had given his Royall word herein, which their Lordships for their parts did as much trust and confide in as ever Subjects did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:68:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>It was also then further declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, That his Majestie had lately honoured their house with his presence again, and had there renued the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what had before been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to both Houses, with the impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of admitting delay, &amp; the clearnes of his Majesties intentions and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to give all just satisfaction to what with reason could be desired of him.</p>
            <p>That his Majestie had taken notice of somewhat voted in the House of Commons concerning Religion, proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Goods, and liberty of Parliament, by which his Majestie conceived the matter of his supply set aside, which he had so often and with such weight of reason desired might have precedence.</p>
            <p>That his Majestie after very graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous assurances of his constant affection
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:68:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and zeal for true Religion, and for preventing all Innovations therein, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterating his often promises for relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all their just grievances, with his Royall intentions in that particular of Ship-money which he found much stood upon, was pleased to desire their Lordships (as Persons in rank and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree neerest him, in Honour as much or more concern'd then other, and in the safety and prosperity of the Kingdom at least equally interessed with others) That in a case of this great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant weight, their Lordships would by their counsell and perswasion encline the House of Commons to give his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie a speedy answer and resolution in the matter of Supply. That their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships had taken his Majesties desire into serious and dutifull consideration, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:68:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon great and solemn debate had, only voted in these words, <q>We are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the matter of His Majesties supply should have precedence, and be resolved of before any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatsoever.<hi>And </hi> that they did think fit there shold be a Conference desired with the house of Commons to dispose them thereunto;</q> which as it was just and honourable for their Lordships to do, so it was no breach of any priviledge of the house of Commons.</p>
            <p>For though their Lordships did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, That the Bill of Subsidies ought to begin in the House of Commons, and when it is agreed unto by the Lords, must be returned back, and be by their Speaker presented, and therefore their Lordships disclaimed to meddle with Subsidy or Supply, by such beginning in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:68:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the higher House, or by naming the number of Subsidies, times of payment, or any such circumstances incident to a Bill; Yet their Lordships might confer and talk about Supplies in generall, and give their advice therein, that being no whit derogatory to the Priviledges of the House of Commons, their Lordships in all reason being likelier to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the Councels and secrets of State, as those that were neerer to the Royall Throne, and having just cause therein to impart their fears and foresight of dangers to the House of Commons.</p>
            <p>That such proceedings of their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, as they were grounded upon just and weighty reason, so they were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ancient usage and custome, and were fully justified by that establishment in Parliament mentioned by the House
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:68:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Commons at the last Conference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> in the <hi>9.</hi> yeer of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and stiled not the Indempnity of the Commons (as had been said) but the Indempnity of Lords and Commons.</p>
            <p>And for the other breach of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge which had been objected, their Lordships declared, That his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie had told them the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons had resolved something concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those three heads, Of Religion, Propriety of goods, and Priviledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>How his Majestie knew of this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution belonged not to their Lordships to enquire into, their Lordships not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with any thing that others said to the King, but what the King said to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:68:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>And that their Lordships were so far from holding it any violation of the Priviledges of the House of Commons for their Lordships to hear what the King declared to them, and for them thereupon to report the same to the House of Commons, that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in dutie to his Majestie, their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships could do no other; and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of it was an argument of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and desire of good correspondence with the House of Commons, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited no such misconstruction as had been made of it; neither did that esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment in Parliament <hi>9. H. 4.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any words that could be construed to make their Lordships proceedings in this behalf any breach of the Priviledges of the house of Commons.</p>
            <p>Their Lordships proceedings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:68:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being thus cleared, the Lord Keeper by their Lordships command ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded further, That their Lordships could not but return to their first grounds and resolutions, which were in all fair and affectionate manner to stir up in those of the House of Commons the just consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of those great and imminent dangers that threatned the Kingdom at this time, and how dangerous and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable delay was, and withall to dispose them to take into their first and best thoughts the matter of his Majesties supply, and give him a speedie answer therein.</p>
            <p>Which their Lordships were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent would be the means to make this a happy Parliament, and to avert the publike calamities that menaced the ruine and overthrow of this famous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:68:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>This having been delivered at that Conference in their Lordships names, was by his Majestie most graciously interpreted as the noble testimony of their Lordships affections to his person and government, for which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie by the Lord Keeper the next day gave their Lordships hearty thanks.</p>
            <p>And withall that nothing on his part might be left undone, his Majestie that morning also being Saterday the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of May, sent a message to the House of Commons, which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them in these words;</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:68:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that his Majestie could not have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it without great prejudice to his Prerogative; And they were so far from declaring what they would do, That they entertained themselves with discourses tending to render odious to his people that gracious government of his, under which all his people have, during his happy reign, lived in such peace and felicitie, when all the neighbouring Kingdoms and States were in troubles and combustions.</p>
            <p>His Majestie was hereupon enforced by the advice of His Privie Councell to resolve to break up and dissolve the Parliament, from which he could hope for no other fruit then the hindring of His great affairs, and disordering His happy Government.</p>

the ancient and Noble way of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, used and instituted by his Royall Predecessours, for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and honour of this famous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie; and that on his Majesties part, nothing was wanting that could be expected from a King, whereby this Parliament might have had an happy conclusion, for the comfort and content of all his Majesties Subjects, and for the good and safetie of this Kingdom. On the contrary, it is apparant how those of the House of Commons (whose sinister and malicious courses inforced his Majestie to dissolve this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) have vitiated and abused that ancient and Noble way of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perverting the same to their own unworthy ends, and forgetting the true use and institution of Parliaments.

For whereas these meetings and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his Majestie with the Peeres and Commons of this Realm, were in their first originall, and in the practice of all succeeding ages, ordained and held as Pledges and Testimonies of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection between the King and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the King for his part graciously hearing and redressing such Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as his People in humble and dutifull manner should represent unto him, and the Subjects on their part, as Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their dutie, supplying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie upon all extraordinary occasions, for the support of his Honour and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie, and for preserving the Kingdom in glory and safetie; Those ill-affected members of the House of Commons, in stead of an humble and dutifull way of presenting their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:68:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to his Majestie, have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, to be the Guiders and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, in all matters that concern his Majesties Government both Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Ecclesiasticall, and (as if Kings were bound to give an account of their Regall actions, and of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Government, to their Subjects assembled in Parliament) they have in a very audacious and insolent way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into examination and censuring of the present Government, traduced his Majesties administration of Iustice, rendred (as much as in them lay) odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the rest of his Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, not onely the Officers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of State, but even his Majesties very Government; which hath been so just and gracious, that never did this or any other Nation enjoy more bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings

and happinesse, then hath been by all his Majesties Subjects enjoyed ever since his Majesties accesse to the Crown, nor did this Kingdom ever so flourish in Trade and Commerce, as at this present, or partake of more peace and plentie in all kindes whatsoever.</p>
               <p>And whereas the ordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Crown not sufficing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray extraordinary charges, it hath ever been the usage in all Parliaments to aid and assist the Kings of this Realm with free and fitting Supply to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintenance of their Wars and for making good their Royall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, whereby the Kingdome entrusted to their protection, might be held up in splendor and greatnes, Those ill-affected persons of the House of Commons have been so far from tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:68:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the steps of their Ancestours, by their dutifull expressions in this kinde, that contrarily they have introduced a way of bargaining and contracting with the King, as if nothing ought to be given him by them, but what he should buy and purchase of them, either by quitting somewhat of his Royall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, or by diminishing and lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Revenues. Which courses of theirs, how repugnant they are to the duty of Subjects, how unfit for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie in Honour to permit and suffer, and what hazard and dishonour they subject this Kingdome to, all men may easily judge, that will but equally and impartially weigh them.</p>
               <p>His Majestie hath been by this means reduced to such straights and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that were not his care of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
