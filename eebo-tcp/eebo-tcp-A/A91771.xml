            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſweeteſt, faireſt, and the beſt of flowers,</l>
            <l>Loſe their choiſe rarity in a few run hours:</l>
            <l>The wandring, glorious ſtars, when night is done</l>
            <l>Go down, and vail their bodies to the Sun:</l>
            <l>And when great <hi>Phoebus</hi> riſeth in a flame</l>
            <l>To view the throne of darkneſſe, and proclaim</l>
            <l>Joy to all drowzy Mortals, and doth ſay,</l>
            <l>Riſe ſlumbering Man, ariſe, and welcome day.</l>
            <l>The Moon aſhamed of her pale face, doth ſhrowd</l>
            <l>Her, in the boſom of ſome darkened cloud:</l>
            <l>And thus among earths Lamplets, there is one</l>
            <l>This day gone down, and left our darkened throne;</l>
            <l>A glorious Star indeed, whoſe ſhining name</l>
            <l>Was blown by Honour, and the breath of Fame:</l>
            <l>His heart was faithfull, vertuous, and his face</l>
            <l>Was dreſt with greatneſſe, goodneſſe, truth, and grace:</l>
            <l>Vertue and wiſdom taught him what to do,</l>
            <l>To unite all by love, and Juſtice too</l>
            <l>His lips, the lips of knowledge, in his eye</l>
            <l>Sate both humility, and Majeſty;</l>
            <l>There was high Honour, yet fidelity,</l>
            <l>There brightneſſe ſate in vertues bravery.</l>
            <l>He ſate in Honours Chair untill the laſt,</l>
            <l>In ſpite of Envy, or her nine dayes blaſt:</l>
            <l>His houſe was here on earth, his heart above,</l>
            <l>He lived in loyalty, and died in love.</l>
            <l>Oh, had he ſhined ſtill, his Orient light</l>
            <l>Might make us bluſh to ſee our overſight!</l>
            <l>But he is gone: Times hour-glaſs being run,</l>
            <l>This Star went down to meet the morning Sun.</l>
            <l>Thus vain is earthly pomp, the flouriſhing Crown</l>
            <l>Of earthly royalty, death trampleth down.</l>
            <l>Thus is our wealth but want, our flower fades,</l>
            <l>Our light is darkneſs, and our ſun-ſhine ſhades.</l>
            <l>Thus is our Honour loſt; thus like a Theam</l>
            <l>Is earth, and Dignity is but a dream.</l>
            <l>Thus is our glory graſs, our bravery breath,</l>
            <l>Our light is darkneſs, and our life is death:</l>
            <l>And if they promiſe more, they do but lie,</l>
            <l>'Tis but a dream; go earth, lie down and die:</l>
            <l>Go earth, lie down and die, go ſee</l>
            <l>The gallant confines of eternity:</l>
            <l>Go to Elyzium, go to Paradiſe,</l>
            <l>Where all the ancient Heroes live in bliſs.</l>
            <l>Go dwell in endleſs glory, till thou tire</l>
            <l>Times ſwift foot-race, for time cannot expire</l>
            <l>Thy laſting joy: go live above thy name,</l>
            <l>That rides on lofty wings of flying fame.</l>
            <l>Earth is too baſe to dwell on, go and paſs</l>
            <l>Thoſe ſtreets of Gold, like to tranſparent glaſs,</l>
            <l>And ſhining glittering pearl, whereon each Gate</l>
            <l>Is built: go kiſs the Lamb emaculate,</l>
            <l>Go put on robes of glory, go and be</l>
            <l>Swallowed with endleſs immortality.</l>
            <l>There is no Sun, nor Moon, no clouds, nor rain,</l>
            <l>No frowns, nor fortunes, nor corrupted gain;</l>
            <l>No curious gardens, nor no coſtly fare,</l>
            <l>No ſtately buildings, nor no worldly care;</l>
            <l>Nor no ridiculous ſmiles, no jeſts, nor play,</l>
            <l>No recreation, nor no holy-day;</l>
            <l>No drinking, curſing, ſwearing, nor abuſe,</l>
            <l>No ſin, no ſhame, no forrow, nor excuſe;</l>

            <l>No rape, no theft, no murder, nor no fear,</l>
            <l>Dwels in high glory, though they wander here:</l>
            <l>But high unmeaſured joy, and amity,</l>
            <l>And love, and peace, and vertues rarity,</l>
            <l>And Pearls, and Onix, and the Jaſper ſtones,</l>
            <l>And Palms, and Crowns, and Kingly royall thrones;</l>
            <l>And raviſht Allelujahs, which the breſt</l>
            <l>Of Angels warble in eternall reſt.</l>
            <l>Go earth, lie down and die; and to thy truſt,</l>
            <l>Oh earth, we recommend his Honoured duſt</l>
            <l>To lie and ſlumber, till his agedeyes</l>
            <l>Shall wake from deaths dark lullabies:</l>
            <l>Untill the trumpet ſounds, and heaven ſhall ſay,</l>
            <l>Riſe from the dead all Mortals, come away:</l>
            <l>And if thy Monument ſhall leave his truſt,</l>
            <l>And turn to aſhes like thy mouldring duſt,</l>
            <l>Thy fame that cannot die, ſhall be</l>
            <l>A Monument in the worlds memory.</l>
            <l>Alas, and is this all that earth can do?</l>
            <l>A way vain glory, go, be intombed too.</l>
