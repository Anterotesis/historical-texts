         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To the which Confeſſion and forme of religion we willingly agree in our conſciences, in all points as unto Gods undoubted truth and verity, grounded only upon his written word: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we abhorre and deteſt all contrary religion and doctrine: but chiefely all kinde of Papiſtry, in generall and particular heads, even as they are now damned and confuted by the word of God, and Kirk of <hi>Scotland:</hi> but in eſpeciall, we deteſt and refuſe the uſurped authority of that Romane Antichriſt, upon the Scriptures of God, upon the Kirk, the civill Magiſtrate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men, all his tyrannous lawes made upon indifferent things againſt our Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; his erroneous doctrine againſt the ſufficiency of the written word, and the perfection of the Law, the office of Chriſt &amp; his bleſſed Evangel. His corrupted doctrine concerning originall ſinne, our naturall inability and rebellion to Gods law, our juſtification by faith only, our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſanctification and obedience to the Law, the nature, number, and uſe of the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. His five baftard Sacraments, with all his rites, ceremonies, and falſe doctrine added to the miniſtration of the true Sacraments, without the word of God. His cruell judgement againſt Infants departing without the Sacrament, his abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſme, his blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous opinion of Tranſubſtantiation, or reall preſence of Chriſts body in the elements, and receiving of the ſame by the wicked, or bodies of men; his diſpenſations with ſolemne Oathes, perjuries, and degrees of marriage forbidden in the word, his cruelty againſt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent divorced, his develliſh Maſſe, his blaſphemous prieſthood, his prophane Sacrifices for the ſinnes of the dead &amp; the quick, his Canonization of men calling upon Angels or Saints departed worſhipping of imagerie relicts, and croſſes, dedicating of kirkes, Altars, dayes, vowes to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, his purgatory, prayers for the dead, praying, or ſpeaking in a ſtrange language, with his proceſsions, and blaſphemous lettany, and multitude of advocates, or mediatours, his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold orders, auricular confeſſion, his deſperate and uncertaine repentance, his generall, and doubtſome faith, his ſatisfaction of men for their ſinnes, his juſtifications by works, <hi>opus opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> workes of ſupererogation, merits, pardons, peregrinations and ſtations, his holy water baptizing of bells, conjuring of ſpirits, croſſing, ſaning, anointing, conjuring, hallowing of Gods good creatures, with the ſuperſtitious opinion, joyned there with his wordly Monarchy, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Hierarchy, his three ſolemne vowes, with all his ſhavelings of ſundry ſorts, his erronious and bloody decrees made at Trent, with all the ſubſcribers, and approvers of that cruell and bloody band conjured againſt the Kirk of God: and finally we deteſt all his vaine allegories, rites, ſignes, and traditions, brought in the Kirk, without or againſt the word of God, and doctrine of this true reformed Kirk; to the which we joyne our ſelves willingly in doctrine, faith, religion, diſcipline and uſe of the Holy Sacraments, as lively members of the ſame in Chriſt our Head, promiſing and ſwearing by the great name of God our Lord, That we ſhall continue in the obedience of the doctrine and diſcipline of this Kirk, and ſhall defend the ſame according to our vocation, and power, all the dayes of our lives, under the paines contained in the law, and danger both of body and ſoule in the day of Gods fearefull Iudgements. And ſeeing that many are ſtirred up by Sathan, and that Roman Antichriſt, to promiſe, ſweare, ſubſcribe and for a time uſe the holy Sacraments in the Kirk, deceitfully againſt their owne conſciences, minding thereby, firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Externall cloak of religion, to corrupt and ſubvert ſecretly Gods true religion, within the Kirk; and afterward when time may ſerve to become open enimies and perſecutours of the ſame, under vain hope of the Popes diſpenſation, deviſed againſt the word of God to his greater confuſion, and their double condemnation in the day of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We therefore willing to take away all ſuſpition of hypocriſie, and of ſuch double dealing with God and his Kirk, proteſt, and call the ſcearcher of all hearts for witneſſe, that our mindes and hearts do fully agree with this our Confeſſion, Promiſe, Oath, and Subſcription; ſo that we are not moved for any worldly reſpect; but are perſwaded only in our conſciences through the knowledge and love of Gods true Religion printed in our hearts by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as we ſhall anſwer to him, in the day when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall bee diſcloſed: and becauſe we perceive that the quietneſſe and ſtability of our Religion and Kirk, doth depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſafety and good behaviour of the Kings Majeſty, as upon a comfortable inſtrument of Gods mercy granted to this Countrey, for the maintaining of his Kirk, and miniſtration of juſtice amongſt us; we proteſt and promiſe with our hearts under the ſame oath, handwrit, and paines, that we ſhall defend his royall perſon and authority, with our goods, bodies, and lives, in the defence of Chriſt his Evangel, Liberties of our Countrey, miniſtration of juſtice, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of iniquity, againſt all enimies within this Realme or without, as we deſire our God to be a ſtrong and mercifull defender to us in the day of our death, and comming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with the Father and the holy Spirit be all honour and glory eternally.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N obedience to the Commandement of God, conforme to the practice of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in former times, and according to the laudable example of our worthy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Progenitors, and of many yet living amongſt us, which was warranted alſo by Act of Councell, commanding a generall Bond to be made and ſubſcribed, by his Majeſtis Subjects of all ranks, for two cauſes; one was for defending the true religion as it was then reformed, and is expreſſed in the confeſſion of faith above written, and a former large Confeſſion eſtabliſhed by ſundry Acts of lawfull generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and of Parliaments, unto which it hath relation, ſet downe in publick Chatechiſmes, and which had been for many years, with a bleſſing from heaven, preached and profeſſed in this Kirk and Kingdome, as Gods undoubted truth, grounded only upon this written word: the other cauſe was, for maintaining the Kings Majeſties perſon and Eſtate; the true worſhip of God, and the Kings authority being ſo ſtraightly joyned, as that they had the ſame friends and common enimies, and did ſtand, and fall together: and finally being convinced in our mindes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing with our mouthes, that the preſent and ſucceeding generations in this land, are bound to keep the aforeſaid nationall Oath and ſubſcription inviolable. Wee Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgeſſes, Miniſters, and Commons under ſubſcribing, conſidering divers times before, and eſpecially at this time the danger of the true reformed religion, of the Kings honour, and of the publick peace of the Kingdome by the manifold innovations and evills generally conteined and particularly mentioned in our late ſupplications, complaints, and proteſtations, doe hereby profeſſe, and before God, his Angels, and the world, ſolemnly declare, that with our whole hearts we agree and reſolve, all the dayes of our life conſtantly to adhere unto, and to defend the aforeſaid true religion, and forbearing the practice of all novations, already intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the matters of the worſhip of God, or approbation of the corruptions of the publick government of the Kirk, or civill places and power of Kirk-men, till they be tryed and allowed in free Aſſemblies, and in Parliaments, to labour by all meanes lawfull to recover the purity and liberty of the Goſpel, as it was eſtabliſhed and profeſſed before the aforeſaid novations: and becauſe after due examination we plainly perceive, and undoubtedly beleive that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations and evils conteined in our ſupplications, complaints, and proteſtations have no warrant of the word of God, are contrary to the Articles of the aforeſaid Confeſſions, to the intention and meaning of the bleſſed reformers of religion in this land, to the above written Acts of Parliament, and doe ſenſibly tend to the re-eſtabliſhing of the Popiſh religion and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and to the ſubverſion and ruine of the true reformed religion, and of our liberties, lawes, and eſtates. We alſo declare that the aforeſaid Confeſſions are to be interpreted, and ought to be underſtood of the aforeſaid novations and evils, no leſſe than if every one of them had beene expreſſed in the aforeſaid Confeſſions, and that we are obliged to deteſt and abhorre them, amongſt other particular heads of Papiſtry abjured therein; and therefore from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſcience of our duty to God, to our King and Countrey, without any worldly reſpect or inducement, ſo farre as humane infirmity will ſuffer, wiſhing a further meaſure of the grace of God for this effect; We promiſe &amp; ſweare by the great name of the Lord our God, to continue in the profeſſion and obedience of the aforeſaid religion: that we ſhall defend the ſame, &amp; reſiſt all theſe contrary errours and corruptions, according to our vocation, and to the uttermoſt of that power that God hath put in our hands, all the dayes of our life: and in like manner with the ſame heart we declare before God and men, that we have no intention nor deſire to attempt any thing, that may turne to the diſhonour of God, or to the diminution of the Kings greatneſſe and authority: but on the contrary, we promiſe and ſweare that we ſhall to the uttermoſt of our power, with our meanes and lives, ſtand to the defence of our dread Soveraigne, the Kings Majeſties perſon and authority, in the defence and preſervation of the aforeſaid true religion, liberties and lawes of the kingdome: as alſo to the mutuall defence and aſſiſtance every one of us of another, in the ſame cauſe of maintaining the true religion, and his Majeſties authority with our beſt counſell, our bodies, meanes, and whole power againſt all ſorts of perſons whatſoever; ſo that whatſoever ſhall be done to the leaſt of us for that cauſe ſhall be taken as done to us all in generall, and to every one of us in particular: and that wee ſhall neither directly nor indirectly ſuffer our ſelves to be divided or with-drawne, by whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuggeſtion or allurement, or terror from this bleſſed and loyall conjunction, nor ſhall caſt in any let or impediment, that may ſtay or hinder any ſuch reſolution, as by common conſent ſhall be found to conduce for ſo good ends: but on the contrary, ſhall by all lawfull meanes labour to further and promote the ſame; and if any ſuch dangerous and diviſive motion bee made to us by word, or writ; we and every one of us ſhall either ſuppreſſe it, or if need be, ſhall incontinent make the ſame knowne, that it may be timouſly obviated: neither doe we feare the foule aſperſions of rebellion, combination, or what elſe our adverſaries from their craft and malice would put upon us, ſeeing what we doe is ſo well warranted, and ariſeth from an unfeigned deſire to maintaine the true worſhip of God, the Majeſty of our King, and peace of the Kingdome, for the common happineſſe of our ſelves, and the poſterity. And becauſe we cannot look for a bleſſing from God upon our proceedings, except with our profeſſion and ſubſcription we joyne ſuch a life and converſation, as beſeemeth Chriſtians, who have renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Covenant with God; we therefore faithfully promiſe for our ſelves, our followers, and all others under us, both in publick in our particular families, and perſonall carriage to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep our ſelves within the bounds of Chriſtian liberties, and to be good examples to others of all godlineſſe, ſoberneſſe and righteouſneſſe, and of every duty we owe to God and man. And that this our union and conjunction may be obſerved without violation, we call the living God the ſearcher of our hearts to witneſſe, who knoweth this to be our ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and unfeigned reſolution, as we ſhall anſwer to Jeſus Chriſt in the great day, and under the paine of Gods everlaſting wrath, and of infamy and loſſe of all honour and reſpect in this world, moſt humbly beſeeching the Lord to ſtrengthen us by his holy Spirit for this end, and to bleſſe our deſires and proceedings with a happy ſucceſſe, that religion and righteouſneſſe may flouriſh in the land, to the glory of God, and honour of the King, and the peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of us all, in witneſſe whereof we have ſubſcribed with our hands all the premiſes, &amp;c.</p>
