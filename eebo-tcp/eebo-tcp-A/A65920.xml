            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Reply to the Answer of Lieut. General <hi>Ludlow,</hi> or his Answer to the Officers at <hi>Dublin</hi> examined; with a concluding Word to the present Authority in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough, to the understanding Reader, who by comparing, knows when a Letter is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, I need have done no more, then to have taken the same Letter (which he saith is answered) and affix't it in the end, calling it a Reply to the Answer; yet because those Worthies, to whom the Answer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals for Justice, may with the lesse expense of time see how insufficient the Answer is, and how unjustly the subscribers of the Officers Letter, are aspersed almost in every page of the pretended Answer, by the nickname of persons that have been for a late single Persons interest, I have therefore assumed (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly) this trouble by way of Replication: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43033:3"/>Sir; As I am not inclined to detract from your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, wherein they are praise-worthy, so I would have gladly seen the like ingenuity in your self, towards the Gentlemen, who rather have deserved your praise hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, then to have been the objects of your frownes and indignation, for what they have done.</p>
            <p>It seems your stomack will not easily digest any that submitted to the late Government of a <hi>single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> though they had no hand in setting him up; but why do you not quarrel with that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Let every soul be subject to the higher Powers, for the powers that are, are ordained of God?</hi> Let me ask you this Question from Common-wealth principles (though I doubt not but your tart words would be silenced from that Text) Can you imagine, That if all such were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, your petty peevish Interest (to say no more of it) would be enough to carry on that <hi>Good old Cause</hi> so much pretended to? when yet you saw by experience what knocking of heads there was at your <hi>Wallingford</hi>-House-meetings, To which you so much frequented (though to the blot of your former service) and when advised to the contrary by your known friends, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you that are ready to condemne the Parliament, for narrowing their interest now, do much more condemne your self, if that be your opinion.</p>
            <p>Your great care in your answer, is, to make the world believe, That you are <hi>the onely Person,</hi> that hath stood unshaken (as to the Parliaments cause) in the late Protectors day; But 'tis sufficiently known to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witnesses from your own mouth, That your trouble was not, That <hi>Oliver</hi> had pul'd out the Parliament; But that he was seated in the chaire of State, contrary
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43033:3"/>
to a former engagement, and so your expected good things, were not like to be accomplisht by him. As for the Parliament, you could have been contented then (as well as since) if they had never met more: and why then do you condemne others for the same things you are guilty of your self, namely for want of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this Parliament? Did not all the Armies of the three Nations, all the Fleets at Sea, all or most part of the Cities, Burrows, Towns, and Counties of this Common-wealth, yea, and all Plantations of English a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad own his Authoritie by Letters and Addresses, and were there not in all these (think you) as faithful men to the Parliament as your self?</p>
            <p>I might here tell you that you acted sometime your self under him; for you could be contented to receive pay, as Lieutenant General, Colonel and Captain, and I believe you would have done so to the last day of his Reigne, had not Orders been given by <hi>Fleetwood</hi> to cross you out of the musters. Your distinction here of being the Parliaments Lieutenant General, will not serve your turne; for any sober man may see, That though you abhor'd him (as the Jews did swines flesh) yet you lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the broth of abominable things. In the front of your second page you say, The Officers and Souldiers (within your precinct) of <hi>Duncannon,</hi> at your coming exprest much grief and trouble for the Parliaments interruption; But truly Sir, if their after-carriage be considered, which I know you are bound to justifie, I want faith to believe that their sorrow was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned.</p>
            <p>But your Irish Harp will make no Musick, unlesse you touch upon the same string, and therefore you say
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43033:4"/>
in the same page, <hi>That you sent to</hi> Ross, Waterford, <hi>and other places to presse them to declare for the Parliament, not in shew onely, but in reality. Answ.</hi> Truly Sir, if you might be Judge, no doubt but you would pass as severe a censure upon the persons, as you do upon the actions of those, which yet your Masters have judg'd to be real in what they have done, witness their Thanks sent them for their good service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Officers,</hi> you say, <hi>in declaring for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, designed rather to take advantage against those the Parliament had prefer'd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Though the Officers fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may justly merit the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet all is submitted to the Parliaments pleasure, who in answer to the Armies humble repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, voted this as answer to one of the heads therein contained, that such whos good service should merit inc<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement or re-reward, should accordingly have it; and though they have merited their thanks, yet whether they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served their places, is at their judgment</note> 
               <hi>thereby to get into their places, then out of any affection to the Parliament. Answ.</hi> Ill-will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver speaks well, The best actions of the best of men shall never clear their integrity, if a bare jealous affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation shall serve as a sufficient accusation. But in the mean time, Sir, those Officers so intrusted, were very faithful to their Masters; were they not? when others lesse trusted (as the like was here about <hi>London</hi>) must teach them in Commission, their duty, how to obey their Masters: the best is, as often and highly as you reflect upon them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by an easie and due paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, you reflect upon those few faithful ones, that remain'd in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But those in</hi> Ireland <hi>disputed your Authority, which was legally derived from the Parliament, for whom in the worst of times you have born your faithful witnesse. Answ.</hi> You are here mistaken in the dispute, which was not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you had not an Authoritie, but whether by your staying amongst the Parliaments enemies, and acting as one of the new Law-makers, you had not abused that Authoritie to the forfeiting of it; <hi>But the Officers you say were not Iudges of that, but the Parliament. Answ.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43033:4"/>
In case of Necessity, when there is no visible Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as then there was not (when they past those Votes against you) they were Judges of their own safety. And when afterwards they heard of their sitting, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to <hi>Caesar,</hi> whether they desired your Return.</p>
            <p>In the next, you tell them, <hi>That though the Officers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted your Authority, legally derived from the Parliament; yet they could yield obedience to Sir</hi> Hardress Waller <hi>that had no Commission. Answ.</hi> His being respited by the Parliament at present, did not make null his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, no more then the present want of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions could null all the Captains and other Officers of the Army, for then they had been like sheep without Shepherds; good reason therefore they had to own him (your Substitute having defected) who was made privy to much of the Design, some weeks before it was executed, he being next in Command. <hi>But Sir</hi> Hardress <hi>served a single persons interest whilest he might. Answ.</hi> He did no more, then the Generals at Sea, who all ingaged for the service of their Countrey, under the Command of a single person: who I suppose you do but equally asperse. <hi>But Sir</hi> Hardress, <hi>with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, subscribed a Letter to the Army in</hi> England, <hi>and bid them good speed in their undertakings. Answ.</hi> In that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Army of <hi>Scotland</hi> was equally and jointly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd and included, and therefore that Salute, which is rather your own fiction (then any thing in realitie) is to be equally shared between both. <hi>But Sir</hi> Hardress <hi>cleerly espoused the Armies interest, and cast off the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the Letter sent to General</hi> Monk. <hi>Answ.</hi> The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioned was prepared by <hi>Iones,</hi> and brought in for Subscriptions rather by way of surprize, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43033:5"/>
And though his policy did subscribe to a comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, where his opposition would have made him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, yet the honesty of his policy did quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But that excuse may as well serve the rest of the Subscribers as Sir</hi> Hardress, <hi>and may justifie all that joyn'd with the Army; for they will all say, they did it out of Policy. Answ.</hi> Had they taken an opportunity in season to have oppos'd the Army, as he did, the excuse would be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; but that they did not.</p>
            <p>In the next place you say, <hi>You did not own the Army in their late precipitate undertaking, nor acted with them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then in a military capacity, but refused to joyn in their Committee of safety, or Committee for Nomination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, you did not so own them (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) as to contrive the plot for setting up the Army as Legislators; as neither did the Army of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the Officers, that you say were for the interest of a single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, contrive his setting up; but you could honestly submit after it was done, as they did; nay, you could joyn with them in the same work of <hi>New Government-making.</hi> I wonder from hence-forth you should condemn others for that wherein you are ten times more guilty in another kind, and equally in the same kind with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as before proved. <hi>But you acted with them only in a military Capacity. Answ.</hi> Had <hi>Cromwell</hi> or <hi>Fairfax</hi> gone to the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and joyned, or acted with them in a <hi>military capacity,</hi> would this have served for an excuse to the Parliament, or not rather as an aggravation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger their not being welcome, when they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to sit at <hi>Westminster,</hi> as you have done?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what you did as to Government or Reformation, was
<pb facs="tcp:43033:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alwayes with an intention to submit the same to this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> A sorry excuse you think is better then none. But, 1. Who knew your Intentions? 2. Who knew the Parliament would ever sit again? 3. You have here coin'd an excuse (such a one as 'tis) for those that were for a single person; for might not they say, they were for him, only with an intention to submit it to this Parliament when they sate.</p>
            <p>You say in Page the eighth, <hi>The Officers design is to make Mole-hills Mountains, to asperse and not justifie, and therefore they quarrell with the title of</hi> Dear friend, <hi>written to</hi> Jones. <hi>Answ.</hi> They cite those words for this end, to let you know what cause they had to be jealous that you, who were a friend to their enemy, could be no good friend to them; had such a Title been written by any member of this house to <hi>Inchequin</hi> after his Revolt, it had been enough to have made the whole house jealous, that such a member was no good friend to them (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the pretence of private real friendship. <hi>But what you did therein (you say) was prudential, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your sword in his hands. Answ.</hi> That is, you called him friend till you could appear his enemy, as Sir <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse</hi> called General <hi>Monk</hi> Enemy, till he could appear his friend. The difference lies only in this, Sir <hi>Hardresse</hi> made hast to do the one, when you delaied to do the other.</p>
            <p>The next clause you say, that is aggravated against you is, <hi>That we seem to be necessitated to look towards the long Parliament; it is feared, if they come in without conditions they will be very high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which, whether you have given a sufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb facs="tcp:43033:6"/>
let the world judge; for who knew your Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to escape, or the way by <hi>Miniard,</hi> as you say in your Letter; or who can believe it, that shall consider what you say afterwards? That when <hi>Fleetwood</hi> heard <hi>Dublin</hi> had declared for the Parliament, he sent you away. The gloss by which you would evade this charge (if I should appeal to your self) is such, that you will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to others, <hi>viz.</hi> You writ so to <hi>Iones</hi> (out of policie) to let him see it was his prudence as well as his dutie, <hi>Not to do any thing in opposition to the Parliaments Authoritie, or to your self, who was invested therewith. Answ.</hi> He was like to do but little either against the Parliament, or your self, when before your going out of <hi>London,</hi> you heard he was imprisoned; for the mischief he had done was before, of which you had notice by several private let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And had you went according to the invitations in those letters, you had been most affectionately received, whereas your mition from their enemie was reason to the contrarie.</p>
            <p>The last clause in your Letter; you say, the Officers have to object against you, is this, <hi>I hope ere this the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions for setting of civil Iustice on the wheels, are come to your hands.</hi> At which you wonder it should be imputed as a crime to you, by those who were free, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of civil Justice should be derived from a military hand, during the Protectors Reign. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be feared, you say, they rather dislike the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons then the thing it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Imputation of it as a crime to you, was, because the Authority of that Sword, that pul'd out the Parliament, was thereby justified, when yet you would have the world to belive you were pleading against the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43033:6"/>
Army to bring them in; and if it were alwaies your principle to oppose the swords Authority, why was it not in this? the truth is, your words may here be justly retorted, That you dislike persons and not things; for you can make use of it as a discriminating Act against all that submitted to it in a single person, and yet you can find Arguments to plead for it, when it relates to the Army.</p>
            <p>But you say, 'Tis the Lawyers opinion, <hi>That whosoever is actually in power, may set the wheels of Iustice going. Answ.</hi> But the Army in <hi>England</hi> had nothing to do with <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor could they be in actual power, when there was a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing power in General <hi>Monk,</hi> that opposed them. And if the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> should have argued thus, to set their Wheels of Justice going, no doubt but you would have had better grounds for those reports you have raised, then yet you had. I wish it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a timely a consideration of their sufferings; Necessity is lawless.</p>
            <p>But you seem much to rejoyce that you have so just a Bar to appeal unto, as that of the Parliaments, who you doubt not but will protect you against the malicious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of any <hi>Cavilerish</hi> spirit whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In this you would insinuate the Subscribers to be <hi>Cavileers,</hi> and therefore they may equally rejoyce with you, as well for their own sakes as for yours; they have that power to appeal to now sitting, for whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution they have so freely adventured their All. 2. I will not say 'tis as strange to see how you interfere in your Principles, who can now own them as a Parliament, when not long since (you told some of themselves) you did not look upon them as a Parliament, but as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43033:7"/>
of honest Gentlemen that met there for the good of their Countrey, and upon that accompt you joyn'd with them.</p>
            <p>In concluding of the Paragraph, <hi>page</hi> 10. you say, <hi>If to be fai<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hfull and constant to the Parliament, in opposition to a single person, King-ship,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If to bear witnesse against such as are disaffected to publick interest, or as are vicious in their lives and conversations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be high Treason, you then confesse your self guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If that were all, I should say the same with you; But stay Sir, there is somewhat else: Is it fidelity to this Parliament, for a General of <hi>Ireland</hi> to come from thence, and sit in the Counsels of their enemies? would this have been judg'd so, had any Member of the house, or General of their Army gone to sit with the Kings Counsels, as I said before, in <hi>Oxford?</hi> Nay, have not the house already determined it in their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> and Major <hi>Sallaway</hi>? Is it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the Parliament to be ingaged as one of the chief to settle a new foundation of Government for these Nations? Is this to bear your witness, against such as are disaffected to the Parliaments Interest? Who were ever against the Parliament, if such be not, that shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to pull out their Masters, and make null their Lawes, and yet with such you could joyne; whether this be the substance of the Articles, or all that is to be said, I will not determine. But certainly, if these things are not Treason, they are highly criminal. For (to make the best of it) can any rational man think that 'tis a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient plea for a General of an Army, to quit his duty as a General, to run to the enemies Counsels to intreat them to let their Masters sit again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:43033:7"/>You tell them again in <hi>Page</hi> 11. <hi>Of your intentions to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thorow into</hi> Ireland, <hi>in order to compose the difference there. Answ.</hi> But why were not your intentions put in practise till within two dayes of the Parliaments sitting; can any man judge your intentions to be real, when your Actions were contrary? Had you been made a Prisoner for endeavouring to escape, the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> would have unanimously declared for you: But it seems there was no such danger; for in the same <hi>pag.</hi> you say, <hi>You had laboured with the Lord</hi> Fleetwood, <hi>that you might repair to your charge above a moneth or five weeks before he sent you</hi>; an ill sign your intentions were real: for to use your own words in the same <hi>page</hi>; had that power any longer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, you had staid longer with them, (I am sure nothing less can be imply'd:) But you say, <hi>Fleetwood having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter from Captain</hi> Algat, <hi>that</hi> Ireland <hi>had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for the Parliament, he then thought it necessary you should repair to your charge. Answ.</hi> It seems you were one of those soldiers that was under Authority, when you were bid stay, you stai'd; and when you were bid go, you went. And is this to shew your fidelity to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which you so much boast, that you would not adventure some hazards to get from their enemies? Or who will not say, The Army of <hi>Ireland</hi> had sufficient cause to conclude, That if you had been a friend to the Parliament, you had been clapt up in <hi>London,</hi> and not sent away with a <hi>Mandamus</hi> by <hi>Fleetwood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In page</hi> 12. you say, <hi>your brother</hi> Kempsons <hi>name was set to the Declaration, contrary to his minde, because he did not like the company. Answ.</hi> The latter I easily believe, because he found no whimsical persons amongst them; But I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you the former is not true, for he ordered the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43033:8"/>
               <hi>Clerk</hi> to set his name, after some contest had been, about the words, <hi>our Lieutenant General.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> you say, <hi>you looked upon it as your dutie to hasten into</hi> Ireland, <hi>because many persons that had subscribed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration were of a contrary principle thereto, and adhered to another interest, namely that of a single person. Answ.</hi> But suppose they had been such, are your principles so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid and imposing (which you yet condemn in others) as you will never admit of repentance? 2. But why more hast now then good speed? had your haste been so hastie, you would have hasted over before, to have hindred that revolt that was made from the Parliament; but it seems there was no danger on that side; for if the Work were done, as you declared at <hi>Connaway,</hi> you did not care by what Instruments, so it might not be by a single person.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the same page to answer the Officers, you tell them, that before you left</hi> London, <hi>you took your leave of the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and left the Addresse of the Officers with him, which declar'd their hearty affections to this Parliament, and their resolution to stand by them, to which very few of the Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers hearts or hands then were. Answ.</hi> No doubt your going to the Speaker at that time was your wisdome; but certainly there would have appeared more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie had you gone sooner, or else have published the Addresse in Print as soon as you came to <hi>London</hi>; but when it might have done good, you could keep it in obscurity, and then discover it when be sure it was of no advantage; 'tis well their fidelitie was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made knowne by their own Actions then by yours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Designe of the Subscribers,</hi> you say, <hi>is now laid
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43033:8"/>
open by their imprisoning many persons that did declare for the Parliament, though not with them. Answ.</hi> Friendship is best known in time of straights; at such a season the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> generally shewed their fidelitie, whereas several now under restraint declar'd not till forc'd to it, and the rest had publickly defected from the very beginning; but the world may see by this, who you judge to be the Parliaments best friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next,</hi> you say, <hi>it is now out of doubt they are for the King, because the moderatest of that party have publickly declar'd for Sir</hi> George Booth's <hi>design. Answ.</hi> There is much fraud in a general charge; why do you not come to particulars, who they are? Indeed Sir, if it may not offend you to compare persons with persons, I must then tell you, Sir <hi>George Booths</hi> offence will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to deserve a favourable extenuation, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> when the crimes of the late disturbers will be found flat rebellion. <hi>In page</hi> 13. you say, <hi>had you been upon the place of your command, as General</hi> Monk <hi>was, when the Resolution of the Army came to you, the advice of the Officers had been good, but you were in your journey towards</hi> London, <hi>when you first received the news. Answ.</hi> You received the news before you landed at <hi>Connaway</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was given you to returne for <hi>Ireland</hi>; which if you had done, you might have been in the same posture quickly with General <hi>Monk,</hi> had there been but the like affections; the want whereof you sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to Sr. <hi>Henry Ingoldsby</hi>; when you told him, That if those in power (meaning the Army) would do but as good things for the Nations; so the work was done, you ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not who were the instruments; a strange expression
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43033:9"/>
for a Parliaments General, who stands so much to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his constant good affection.</p>
            <p>The next thing you seeme to vindicate your self in, <hi>is in the election of the Officers that were to be sent to</hi> London, where you say, <hi>if they were design'd in opposition to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was contrary to what you intended; and General</hi> Monk <hi>Commissioners having consented, made you the more willing. Ans.</hi> But their meeting to such an end was not contrary to your knowledge, it being the third Article; and surely you could not plead ignorance, what the Articles were, when you confesse the Commissioners before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had sign'd them.</p>
            <p>But you had the better hope of such a meeting of the General Council, because as you say, <hi>Three parts of the Army had not been engaged in that Interruption, only that part about</hi> London.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis the same thing to justifie an evil act when done, as to be Actors in it; or else, why do you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Officers in <hi>Ireland</hi> for owning the interest of a single person when set up, though they had no hand in the doing thereof? But 'tis easier to see how partial your judgement is, especially considering the declarations that were sent up to General <hi>Fleetwood</hi> from <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,</hi> and severall others parts, to owne the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>You say, <hi>your Letters to Colonel</hi> Richards <hi>do sufficiently explaine what you meant, by the advice you gave, to choose such men that were spirited to the Work. Answ.</hi> But how should the rest of the Officers, to whom you writ, know your meaning, when you never told them to whom they should apply themselves for explanation? Surely since
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43033:9"/>
you are so exact to remember the Contents of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, amongst so many, you intended that should shelter you in case of a future storm.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>The Subscribers,</hi> you say, <hi>shew how ready they were to comply with the Army in</hi> England, <hi>by calling an</hi> Irish <hi>Parliament to meet on the same day. Answ.</hi> Suppose the Armie in <hi>Ireland</hi> to supply their necessities, had taken an example from General <hi>Monk</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when all visible face of Authoritie was pull'd down by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in <hi>England</hi>; had this been such a hainous crime? truly Sir, in condemning them for this, you do but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually charge him, whose Actions hath sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd honourable to the world.</p>
            <p>You now draw on to your concluding page, and say, <hi>Thus you hope satisfactorily you have given an answer to each particular in the Letter. Answ.</hi> But how well I appeal to your Judges. The truth is, that which you call an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is nothing but an Evasion fill'd with bespattering termes, a thing you complain of in your Opposites; and the chief parts of your answer consists, either in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Persons or actions of those the Parliament have justified, or pleading your own authoritie, which, for ought I know, you have sufficiently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; Or your good intentions, which none knew but your self.</p>
            <p>In your last page, you say, <hi>You have made it your practice, according to your principles, to promote an</hi> English <hi>Interest in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and to give countenance to all such who fear God. Answ.</hi> But is that the way to promote an <hi>English</hi> interest in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or to countenance such as fear God, and work righteousnesse? to set up Faction, and to lay aside Officers, saying, <hi>O he is a Presbyterian</hi>!
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43033:10"/>
what brave encouragement this was for any sober, honest Englishman to come over and plant in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let the world judge.</p>
            <p>But, you say, <hi>many that now pretend to wish well to the Parliament laid down their Commissions when they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, and some were laid aside by this Parliament, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others were so to be, because of their adherence to a contrary interest, and for viciousnesse of life and conversation. Answ.</hi> The first sort are (wilfully) mistaken, for the true reason of laying down their Commissions, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not run, with those sonnes of Errour, who had the onely smiles of your Authoritie: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sort have been alreadie vindicated, who by their actions have shewed themselves much more faithful then those, in which you so much confided: But seeing the Parliament have been mistaken in their friends once, I hope they will take heed who they trust now; And to conclude, let me here intreat our present Worthies, not to look upon their Cause to be so tottering, Thar they must needs go down to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help; take heed of such Oathes, that will turn out men of sobrietie, and not onely make way for all the factious spirits of the Nations, to bring them in again to its support, who make no conscience of keeping them, but do engage men to fight against heaven; Let God be trusted with his own cause in his own way, without leaning upon such broken reeds. Those that are sober Christians, though of different perswasions, countenance; But this hath not been our case, pragmatical, sausie, impudent fellows, whose tongues were set on fire of Hell, to raile against Ministrie, Learning, Tyrhes, or that could preach (yea, rather prate) for tolerating all heresie
<pb facs="tcp:43033:10"/>
and blasphemy, these have been the chief objects of favour, by which means you have lost five hundred for one in the affections of the Nations, and had so narrowed your interest, That the Parliaments cause for many years hath run retrograde, whereas, were but the House fill'd, a Synod call'd, and Religion settled, with a sober toleration, The Good old Cause would thrive in spight of Hell, without which, give me leave to tell you, A blast from the Almighty will suddenly come upon it and the Nations.</p>
