            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <q>Oh Hieruſalem, Hieruſalem, thou that killeſt the
Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto
thee: how often would I have gathered thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

That notwithſtanding our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1027:3"/>
predictions or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of all thoſe plagues ſhortly
to befall <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> there was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at this time <hi>a poſſibilitie left
for this people to have continued a
flouriſhing nation, a poſſibilitie left
for their repentance: that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and proſperity was the end
whereat the Lord himſelfe did
aime,</hi> in ſending Prophets, and
Wiſemen, and laſtly his onely
Sonne unto them.</p>
                  <p>The former of the two parts;
<hi>the poſſibility of their proſperity,
and repentance,</hi> was proved from
the perpetuall tenour of Gods
covenant with his people; firſt
made with <hi>Moſes,</hi> afterwards
renewed with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and ratified by <hi>Jeremie</hi> and

                     <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> The tenour of the
covenant (as you then heard)
was a covenant not of <hi>death</hi>
onely, but of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death:</hi> of
<hi>life,</hi> if they continued faithfull
in his covenant; of <hi>death,</hi> if they
continued in diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>The later part of the ſame,
<hi>viz. That this peoples repentance
and proſperity was the end inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by God,</hi> was proved from
that declaration of his deſire of
their everlaſting proſperity;<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 29</note> 
                     <hi>Oh
that there were ſuch an heart in
this people to feare me, and to keepe
my commandements alway, that it
might goe well with them and their

place, <hi>Pſal. 81. verſ.</hi> 13. to the
end. <hi>Eſay 48. verſe</hi> 18. Both
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1027:4"/>
places manifeſt Gods love, and
deſire of this peoples ſafety. But
the abundance, the ſtrength,
with the unrelenting conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and tenderneſſe of his love,
is in no place more fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
than in theſe words of
my text. The abundant ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
wee may note in the very
firſt words, in that his mouth
which never ſpake idle or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
words, doth here inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the appellation, <hi>Oh Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
Hieruſalem.</hi> This hee
ſpake out of the abundance of
his love: But love is oft times
fervent or abundant for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or whiles the object of our
love remaines amiable, yet not
ſo conſtant or perpetuall, if the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1027:4"/>
quality of what wee love bee
changed. But herein appeares
the conſtancie and ſtrength of
Gods love, that it was thus fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
ſet upon <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> not
onely in her pure and virgin
dayes, or whiles ſhee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
as chaſte and loyall, as
when ſhee was affianced unto
the <hi>Lord</hi> by <hi>David,</hi> a man after
his owne heart: but upon <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
often drunken with the
<hi>Cup</hi> of <hi>fornications;</hi> upon her long
ſtained and polluted with the
bloud of his Saints; upon <hi>her
children,</hi> who with the <hi>dogge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto their vomit,</hi> or <hi>with the
ſow unto their wallowing in the
mire,</hi> or puddle of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
duſt, whoſe ſacrifices were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1027:5"/>
mingled with righteous bloud;
upon <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> and her <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
after he had cleanſed her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
habitations with fire, and
carried her <hi>Inhabitants</hi> beyond
<hi>Babylon</hi> into the <hi>North-land,</hi> as
it had beene into a more freſh
and purer aire; not onely before
the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivitie,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their returne thence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatation
in their owne land,
<hi>God would have gathered them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as the Hen doth her chickens
under her wings, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words, beſides the
<hi>Tenderneſſe of Gods love towards</hi>
theſe <hi>Caſt-awayes,</hi> is ſet out unto
us <hi>the ſafety of his protection,</hi> ſo
they would have <hi>beene gathered.</hi>
For as there is no creature more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1027:5"/>
kinde and tender than the hen
unto her young ones: ſo is there
none that doth more carefully
ſhroud and ſhelter them from
the ſtorme, none that doth more
cloſely hide them from the eye
of the <hi>Deſtroyer.</hi> Yet ſo would
<hi>God</hi> have hidden <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>
under the ſhadow of his wings,
from all thoſe ſtormes which
afterwards over-whelmed her,
and from the <hi>Roman Eagle,</hi> to
whom this whole generation
became a prey; if ſo <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>
with her children after ſo many
hundred yeeres experience of
his fatherly love &amp; tender care,
had not remained more fooliſh
than the new hatched brood of
reaſonleſſe creatures; if ſo they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1027:6"/>
had not beene ignorant of <hi>his</hi>
call, that had often redeemed
them from their enemies. <hi>How
often would I have gathered you,
and you would not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here were large matter for
<hi>Rhetoricall</hi> digreſſions or melli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
<hi>Encomions</hi> of <hi>divine
love;</hi> points wherein many
learned <hi>Divines</hi> have in later
times beene very copious: yet
ſtill leaving the truth of that
<hi>Love</hi> (which they ſo magnifie)
very queſtionable. It ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
mee at this time,<note place="margin">Two points.</note> firſt, to
prove the undoubted truth and
unfainedneſſe of Gods tender
love, even towards ſuch <hi>Caſt-awayes,</hi>
as theſe proved, to
whom he made this proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1027:6"/>
Secondly, to unfold (as far
as is fitting for us to enquire)
how it is poſſible they ſhould
not be <hi>gathered</hi> unto God, nor
ſaved by Chriſt, whoſe <hi>gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
and whoſe ſafety, <hi>Hee</hi> to
whom nothing can be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
had ſo earneſtly, ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſo conſtantly longed
after.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are points of ſuch uſe
and conſequence, that if God
ſhall enable mee, ſoundly,
though plainly, to unfold their
truth; you will (I hope) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with mee for want of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall
exornations or words
more choice, than ſuch as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
ſpring out of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
handled; as willingly as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1027:7"/>
the poore amongſt you pardon
good houſe-keepers for wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
nothing but home-ſpunne
cloth. For as it is hard for a
man of ordinary meanes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
much on his owne back,
and feed many bellies: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it eaſie for mee and my
preſent opportunities, both to
feed your ſoules with the truth,
and to cloath my diſcourſe
with choice words and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
phraſes. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
many Preachers might,
in this argument, often prove
more <hi>Theologicall,</hi> ſo they could
be content to be leſſe <hi>Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi>
Yet let not theſe premiſes
prejudice the truth of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.
My purpoſe is not to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1027:7"/>
diſſent from any of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches,</hi> but only in thoſe
particulars, wherein they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
diſſent from themſelves,<note place="margin">1 Point. That God earneſtly deſires the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſuch as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</note>
and from generall principles of
truth acknowledged by all
that beleeve God or his word.</p>
                  <p>Were I to ſpeake in ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

might be replyed; <hi>That
albeit God be one, and the onely

wee are ſeeds of Rebels with

the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that is, <hi>the
Man anointed</hi> by the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi>
to be the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world.
As he truly tooke our fleſh upon

ſaith the Lord to the Eunuchs

                  <p>The very ground of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
reaſon thus bared will
of it owne accord reverberate
that <hi>Diſtinction</hi> which hath
beene laid againſt his meaning,
by ſome, otherwiſe moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
<hi>Defendants</hi> of the <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>diſtinction</hi> is, that, when the
Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God will have all
men to be ſaved,</hi> he means <hi>Genera
ſingulorum,</hi> not <hi>Singula generum,</hi>
ſome few of all ſorts, not al of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

ſome learned, ſome unlearned,
ſome <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſome <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1027:11"/>
                     <hi>Italians,</hi> ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The illuſtrations which they
bring to juſtifie this manner of
ſpeech, did the time permit, I
could retort upon themſelves,
and make them ſpeake more
plainly for my opinion, than
for theirs. It ſhall be ſufficient
by the way to note the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
of the application, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the inſtances brought,
were in themſelves juſtifiable
by the illuſtrations they bring:
or how little it could weaken
our aſſertion, although it might
intercept all the ſtrength or aid
this place affords for the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it. What can it helpe
them to turne theſe words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they make towards us,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1027:11"/>
from their ordinary or uſuall
meaning; or to reſtraine Gods
love only unto ſuch as are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
when as the current of it
in other paſſages of Scripture
is evidently extended unto ſuch
as periſh? In ſtead of many
words uttered by him that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lie, unto this purpoſe, thoſe
few, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
mee: <hi>As I live, ſaith the
Lord God, I have no pleaſure in
the death of the wicked; but that
the wicked turne from his way and
live: turne yee, turne yee from your
evill wayes; for why will yee die,
Oh houſe of Iſrael?</hi> If God minde
the ſafety of <hi>ſuch as periſh,</hi> yea
even or moſt <hi>deſperate</hi> and <hi>ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
ſinners:</hi> no queſtion but he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1027:12"/>
                     <hi>wils all ſhould be ſaved and come
to the knowledge of his truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former diſtinction then
will not ſtop this paſſage.
Howbeit ſome learned among
the Schoolmen, and other
moſt religious Writers of later
times, have ſought out another
for intercepting all ſuccour
this or the like places might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
to the maintenance of that
truth which they oppugne and
wee defend. That God doth
not will the death of a ſinner
<hi>Voluntate ſigni</hi> they grant: but
that hee wils it <hi>Voluntate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neplaciti,</hi>
they take as granted.
That is in other termes: God
doth not will the death of him
that dies, <hi>by his revealed will;</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1027:12"/>
but <hi>by his ſecret will.</hi> Not to
urge them to a better declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than hitherto they have
made, in what ſenſe God being
but one, may be ſaid to have two
<hi>Wils:</hi> That hee wils many
things which wee know not,
that hee hath divers ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
wee grant and beleeve as
moſt true indefinitely taken.
But becauſe theſe <hi>Wils</hi> or
<hi>Purpoſes</hi> are ſecret; man may
not without preſumption deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the particular matters
which hee ſo wils or purpoſes.
Otherwiſe they ſhould not bee
<hi>ſecret</hi> but <hi>revealed</hi> to us: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>things ſecret</hi> as <hi>ſecret, belong
only to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that they oppoſe this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1027:13"/>
will</hi> to <hi>Gods revealed</hi> will;
they doe as it were put in a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat</hi>
that we ſhould not beleeve
it in thoſe particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they apply it. For wee may
not beleeve any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ſalvation or damnation
of mankind, or the meanes
which lead to either; but what
is <hi>revealed.</hi> But this <hi>Secret will</hi> is
not <hi>revealed. Ergo,</hi> not to be
beleeved.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we by the principles
of <hi>Reformed religion</hi> bound one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not to beleeve it, but utterly
to diſclaime it: For admitting
what was before granted, <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite
beleefe, that God wils
many things which hee keepes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
from us:</hi> yet wee moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1027:13"/>
beleeve, <hi>that he never wils
any thing ſecretly, which ſhall bee
contrary or contradictory to that
whereon his revealed will is ſet;</hi> or,
<hi>to that which by the expreſſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
of his written word wee know
hee wils.</hi> Now every Chriſtian
muſt infallibly and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
beleeve, <hi>that God wils not
the death of the wicked, or of him
that dies,</hi> (ſeeing his written
word doth plainly regiſter his
peremptory will unto this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe).
Therefore no man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the contradiction to this,
to wit, <hi>That hee wils the death
of him that dies.</hi> Otherwiſe this
diſtinction admitted, <hi>untwines</hi>
the very bonds of mans ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For what ground of hope
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1027:14"/>
have the very <hi>Elect</hi> beſides <hi>Gods
will revealed,</hi> or at the beſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by an oath?</hi> Now if wee
might admit it but as probable,
<hi>That God voluntate beneplaciti,</hi>
or <hi>by his ſecret will may purpoſe
ſome thing contrarie to what hee
promiſes by his revealed will:</hi>
who is hee that could have (I
ſay not <hi>any certainty,</hi> but) <hi>any
morall probabilitie</hi> of his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
ſeeing God aſſures us of
ſalvation onely by his word <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,</hi>
not by his <hi>ſecret will</hi> or
<hi>purpoſe;</hi> which for ought we doe
or can poſſibly know, may ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
diſanull what his <hi>revealed
will</hi> ſeemes to ratifie.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is an infallible <hi>Rule,</hi>
or <hi>Maxime</hi> in divinitie, <hi>That we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1027:14"/>
may not attribute any thing to the
moſt pure and perfect Eſſence of
the Deitie which includes an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in it:</hi> much leſſe may
wee aſcribe any <hi>impurity</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths</hi>
to <hi>that Holy One, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all Truth.</hi> But to ſweare
one thing, and to reſerve a <hi>ſecret
meaning</hi> contrary to the plaine
and literall meaning profeſſed,
is the very <hi>Idea</hi> of untruth, the
eſſence of impious perjury,
which we ſo much condemne
in ſome of our adverſaries, who
(if this diſtinction might gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
paſſe for current amongſt
us) might juſtly ſay, that wee
are as maliciouſly partiall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> as the <hi>Jewes</hi>
were againſt <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1027:15"/>
wee are ready to blaſpheme
God, rather than ſpare to revile
them: ſeeing wee attribute that
to the divine Majeſtie which
wee condemne in them as moſt
impious and contrary to his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
will, who will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with <hi>Aequivocation</hi> or
<hi>Mentall reſervation,</hi> be the cauſe
wherein they bee uſed never ſo
good. Becauſe to ſweare one
thing <hi>openly,</hi> and <hi>ſecretly</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a contradictory meaning,</hi> is
contrary to the very nature and
eſſence of the very firſt truth;
the moſt tranſcendent ſin that
can be imagined: Wherefore,
as this <hi>diſtinction</hi> was lately hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
ſo it might be wiſhed,
that it might be quickly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1027:15"/>
and buried with their
bones that have revived it. Let
God be true in all his words, in
all his ſayings; but eſpecially
in all his oathes: and let the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite</hi>
be reputed, as hee is, a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diſſembling perjured lyer.</p>
                  <p>The former place of <hi>Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
as it is no way impeached
by this diſtinction laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned:
ſo doth it plainly refute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
gloſſe put upon my text
by ſome worthy and famous
writers, <hi>How oft would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
you &amp;c.</hi> Theſe words, ſay
they, were uttered by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
manifeſting his deſire as
man. But unleſſe they be more
than men which frame this
gloſſe, Chriſt as man was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1027:16"/>
than they, and ſpake nothing
but what hee had in expreſſe
commiſſion from his Father.
Wee may then (I truſt) without
offence, take his words as here
they ſound, for better interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his Fathers will, than
any man can give of his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in this paſſage, uttered by
himſelfe in words as plaine as
they can deviſe. Theſe words
indeed were ſpoken by the
mouth of man; yet as truly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting
the deſire and good
will of God, for the ſaving of
the people, as if they had beene
immediately ſpoken by the
voice of God.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould wee thinke
they were conceived by Chriſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1027:16"/>
as man, not rather by him as the
Mediatour betweene God and
Man; as the ſecond perſon in
the Trinity manifeſted in our
fleſh? He ſaith not, <hi>Behold my
Father hath ſent:</hi> but in his owne
perſon; <hi>Behold I have ſent unto
you Prophets and Wiſe.</hi> Nor is it
ſaid, <hi>How often would my Father;</hi>
but, <hi>How often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
you?</hi> this <hi>gathering</hi> wee
cannot referre only to the three
yeares of his <hi>miniſtery;</hi> but to
the whole time of <hi>Hieruſalems</hi>
running away from the <hi>Prophets</hi>
call, from the firſt time that
<hi>David</hi> firſt tooke poſſeſſion of
it, untill the laſt deſtruction of
it: For all this while, HEE,
that was now <hi>ſent</hi> by his Father
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1027:17"/>
in the ſimilitude of Man, did
<hi>ſend Prophets, Wiſemen</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi>
to reclaime them, if they
would have hearkened to his,
or his meſſengers admonitions.
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> puts this out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.
For repeating part of
this ſtory, hee ſaith expreſly,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 49.</note>
                     <hi>Therefore alſo ſaid the Wiſdome of
God, I will ſend them Prophets
&amp;c.</hi> And Chriſt is ſaid <hi>the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God,</hi> not as <hi>Man,</hi> but as
<hi>God:</hi> and conſequently hee
ſpake thoſe words not as man
only, but as God.</p>
                  <p>The ſame compaſſion and
burning love, the ſame thirſt
and longing after <hi>Hieruſalems</hi>
ſafety, which wee ſee here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
by a manner incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1027:17"/>
to fleſh and blood,
in theſe words of our Saviour
in my text, or the like uttered by
him <hi>Luke 19. verſe 41. &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentibus,</hi>
with teares and ſobs,
wee muſt beleeve to be as truly,
as really and unfainedly in the
divine nature, though by a
manner incomprehenſible to
fleſh and blood. How any ſuch
flagrant deſire of their welfare,
which finally periſh, ſhould be
in God, wee cannot conceive,
becauſe our minds are more da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeled
with the <hi>inacceſſible light,</hi>
than the eyes of Bats and Owles
are by gazing on the Sunne. To
qualifie the incomprehenſible
glory of the Deity, the <hi>Wiſedome
of God</hi> was made <hi>fleſh,</hi> that wee
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1027:18"/>
might ſafely behold the true
module or proportion of divine
goodneſſe in our Nature: as the
eye which cannot looke upon
the Sunne in his ſtrength, or as
it ſhineth in the firmament,
may without offence behold it
in the water, being an Element
homogeneall to its owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
Thus ſhould all Chriſts
prayers, deſires or patheticall
wiſhes of mans ſafety, be to us
ſo many viſible pledges or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
evidences of Gods inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
incomprehenſible love.

they were, and ſo conceited of

had in his life time oft to deale,
and for whoſe ſafety hee prayed
with teares before his paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and many like equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
paſſages of Scripture are
pathetically ſet forth by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to aſſure us, that there is no
deſire like to the Almighties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of ſinfull mans repentance,
no longing to his longing after
our ſalvation. If Gods love to
<hi>Judah</hi> comne to the height of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
had beene leſſe than
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1027:20"/>
mans or other creatures love to
what they affect moſt dearely:
if the meanes he uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
her, had beene fewer or
leſſe probable than any others
had attempted for obtaining
their moſt wiſhed end: his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
(to which the Prophet
thought no poſſible anſwer
could be given) might eaſily be
put off by theſe incredulous
<hi>Jewes,</hi> unto whom he had not
referred the judgement in their
owne cauſe, if they could have
inſtanced in man or other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more willingneſſe to doe
what poſſibly they could doe,
either for themſelves or others,
than hee was to doe whatſoever
was poſſible to be done for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1027:21"/>
them. <hi>And now, Oh inhabitants
of Jeruſalem, and men of Judah,
judge, I pray you, betweene mee
and my vineyard, what could more
be done to my vineyard, that I have
not done to it? Wherefore, when I
looked it ſhould bring forth grapes,
brought it forth wilde grapes?
Eſay</hi> 5. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>But the greater wee make the
truth and extent of <hi>Gods love,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Point. How it is poſſible then that all men are not ſaved.</note>
the more wee increaſe the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the ſecond point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
For amongſt women
many there be that would, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
dumbe creatures ſcarce
any that would not redeeme
their ſucklings from death by
dying themſelves: Yet what is
it they can doe, which they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1027:21"/>
would not doe to ſave their
owne lives? And did not <hi>God
ſo love the World that hee gave his
onely begotten Sonne for it?</hi> Yes,
for the <hi>World of the Elect.</hi> If
there be <hi>Worlds of the Elect,</hi> I ſee
not why any ſhould be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the number. But to
let that paſſe: Gods deſire of
their repentance which periſh,
is undoubtedly ſuch as hath
beene ſaid. Yet ſhould wee ſay
that he hath done all that could
be done for them; how chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
all are not ſaved? and was
the vineyard more barren than
<hi>Sarah,</hi> the fruit of whoſe
wombe he made like the ſtarres
of the skie, or like as the ſands by
the Sea ſhore, innumerable?
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1027:22"/>
was it a matter more hard to
make an impenitent <hi>Jew</hi> bring
forth fruits worthy of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
than to make a virgin
conceive and beare a Sonne? If
it were not; how chanceth it,
the word of the Lord (and that
but a ſhort one) ſhould bring
the one to joyfull iſſue; whiles
the other (the repentance of
theſe Jewes and other ungodly
men) after ſo many exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and threatnings, after ſo
many promiſes of comfort, and
denuntiations of woes (which
the Prophets, the Apoſtles, and
their Succeſſors have uſed) is
not to this day, nor ever ſhall
be accompliſhed? If repentance
of men borne and brought up
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1027:22"/>
in ſinne be a worke altogether
impoſſible: all of us ſhould ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
periſh; none repent. If
poſſible to any; ſhall it not be
poſſible to the Almighty, who
alone can doe all things? If
poſſible in him: why is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
wrought in all, whoſe
ſalvation he more earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
than the moſt tender hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mother doth the life and
welfare of her darling infant?</p>
                  <p>Hence in probability, ſome
may conclude, either Gods
love unto ſuch as periſh is not ſo
great as ſome mothers beare
unto their children: or elſe his
power in reſpect of them is not
infinite. And againſt our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
perhaps, it will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1027:23"/>
that by thus magnifying
Gods love towards all, we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
his power towards ſome.
From which to derogate ought,
is in ſome mens judgements the
worſt kind of blaſphemie: a
point as dangerous in divinity
to ſpeake but doubtfully or
ſuſpiciouſly of it, as in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of State to determine or limit
the <hi>Prerogative Royall.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
if no other choice were
left, but a neceſſity were laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us of leaving either the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
power, or infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of our God queſtionable
or unexpreſſed; the offence
were leſſe, not to ſpeake of his
power ſo much (as moſt doe,)
than to ſpeake ought prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1027:23"/>
to that conceit, which even
the Heathens by the light of
nature had of his goodneſſe.
This attribute is the chiefe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our love, and for which
hee himſelfe deſires to be loved
moſt. And in this reſpect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
ought from it, it muſt
needs be moſt offenſive. But his
curſe be upon him that will not
unfainedly acknowledge the
abſolute infiniteneſſe as well of
his power as of his goodneſſe.
Whoſoever hee be that loves his
goodneſſe, will unfainedly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
hee is to be feared
and reverenced, as the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Creator and Judge of men.
Unleſſe he were in power infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
hee could not be infinitely
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1027:24"/>
good. Howbeit hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines
his love and tender
mercy only to ſuch as are ſaved,
doth make his goodneſſe leſſe
(at leaſt extenſively) than his
power. For there is no creature
unto which his power reacheth
not. But ſo doth not his loving
kindneſſe extend to all; unleſſe
hee deſire the good and ſafety
of thoſe that periſh.</p>
                  <p>For winding our ſelves out
of the former ſnare; wee are to
conſider a maine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the love of man or other
creatures, and the love of God
to mankind. Dumbe creatures
alwayes effect what they moſt
deſire, if it be in the precincts
of their power, becauſe they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1027:24"/>
have neither reaſon, nor other
internall law of right or wrong
to controll or counterſway
their brutiſh appetites. Man,
although indued with reaſon
and naturall notions of right
and wrong, is notwithſtanding
oftentimes drawne by the
ſtrength or inordination of his
tender affection, to uſe ſuch
meanes as are contrary to the
rules of reaſon, equitie and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
for procuring their ſafety
or impunity, on whom hee
dotes. Howbeit among men,
wee may finde ſome, which
cannot be wrought by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
or perſwaſion to uſe thoſe
unlawfull courſes for the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of their children or deareſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1027:25"/>
friends, which the world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
moſt approveth. Not
that their love towards their
children, friends or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is leſſe; but becauſe their
love to publike juſtice, to truth
and equity, and reſpect to their
owne integritie, is greater than
other mens are. A fit inſtance
wee have in <hi>Zaleucus</hi> King of
Louis, who having made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
law, that whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ſuch an offence (ſuppofe
adulterie) ſhould loſe his eyes:
It ſhortly after came to paſſe
that the Prince, his ſonne and
heire apparent to the crowne,
treſpaſſed againſt this ſanction.
Could not the good King have
granted pardon to his ſonne?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1027:25"/>
Hee had power, no doubt, in
his hands, to have diſpenſed
with this particular, without
any danger to his perſon. And
moſt Princes would have done
as much as they could for the
ſafety of their ſucceſſour. Nor
could privileges or indulgences
upon ſuch ſpeciall circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
be held as breaches or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of publike lawes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the prerogative of the
perſon offending cannot be
drawne into example. But <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi>
could not be brought to
diſpenſe with his law, becauſe
he loved juſtice no leſſe dearly
than his Sonne, whom he loved
as dearly as himſelfe. And to
manifeſt the equality of his love
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1027:26"/>
to all three, hee cauſed one of
his owne eyes, and another of
his ſonnes to be put out: that
ſo the law might have her due,
though not wholly from his
Sonne that had offended; but
in part from himſelfe, as it were
by way of puniſhment for this
partiality towards his Sonne.</p>
                  <p>It were poſſible no doubt
for a King to reclaime many
inferiours from theft, from rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
or other ungracious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
ſo hee would vouchſafe to
abate his owne expences to
maintaine theirs, or afford them
the ſolaces of his Court, make
them his Peeres, or otherwiſe
allow them meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
their wonted pleaſures.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1027:26"/>
But thus farre to deſcend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifty
ſubjects humors, were
ill beſeeming that Majeſtie and
gravity which ſhould bee in
Princes. If one ſhould give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to a Prince how eaſie and
poſſible it were to him by theſe
meanes, to ſave a number from
the gallowes: his replie would
be, <hi>Princeps id poteſt quod ſalva
Majeſtate poteſt: That onely is
poſſible to a Prince, which can
ſtand with the ſafety of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie:</hi>
but thus to feed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable
appetites of greedy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts
(though otherwiſe ſuch
as hee loves moſt dearly, and
whoſe welfare he wiſhes as
heartily as they doe that ſpeake
for them) is neither Princely
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1027:27"/>
majeſticall. For a King in this
caſe to doe as much as by his
authority or other meanes hee
is able to doe, were an act of
weakneſſe and impotencie, not
an act of Soveraigne power; a
great blot to his wiſdome, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and dignity; no true ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of royall love or
Princely Clemencie.</p>
                  <p>In like manner we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that God, albeit in power
infinite, yet his infinite power
is matched with goodneſſe as
truly infinite; his infinite love,
as it were, counterpoiſed with
infinite Majeſtie. And though
his infinite mercy be as Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
to his or her Attributes:
yet is it in a ſort reſtrained by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1027:27"/>
the tribunitiall power of his
juſtice. This equality of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe
betwixt his attributes
being conſidered, the former
difficulty is eaſily reſolved. If
it be demanded whether God
could not make a thouſand
worlds, as good or better than
this: it were infidelity to deny
it, why? Becauſe this is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of meere power; and
might be done without any
contradiction to his goodneſſe,
to his Majeſtie to his mercy or
juſtice: all which it might ſerve
to ſet forth. And this is a Rule
of faith, <hi>that all effects of meere
power, though greater than wee can
conceive as poſſible, may be done of
him with greater eaſe, than we can
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1027:28"/>
breath.</hi> His onely Word would
ſuffice to make ten thouſand
worlds. But if it be queſtioned,
whether God could not have
don more than he hath done for
his Vineyard, whether he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſave ſuch as dayly periſh:
the caſe is altered, and breeds a
fallacy <hi>Ad plures interrogationes.</hi>
For mans ſalvation is no worke
of meere power: it neceſſarily
requires a harmony of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
of majeſty, of mercy and
juſtice, whereunto the infinite
power is in a manner ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
Nor are we to conſider his
infinite power alone, but as
matched with infinite majeſty;
nor his infinite mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
alone, but as matched with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1027:28"/>
infinite juſtice. And in this caſe
it is as true of God as man; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
id poteſt, quod ſalva Majeſtate
poteſt; quod ſalva bonitate &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia
poteſt: God can doe that
which is not prejudiciall to his
Majeſtie, to his goodneſſe and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
And hee had done (if wee
may beleeve his oath) as much
for his vineyard, as the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of his infinite power and
wiſdome could effect without
diſparagement to the infinitie
of his Majeſtie, or that internall
law or rule of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
whereby hee created man
after his owne image and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</p>
                  <p>God as he hath his being, ſo
hath he his goodneſſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1027:29"/>
and his goodneſſe is his
being: as impoſſible therefore,
that he ſhould not be good, as
not be. Man, as he had his life
and being, ſo had he his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
wholly from his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.
And as actuall exiſtence is
no part nor neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of his eſſence: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is his goodneſſe neceſſarie
or eſſentiall to his exiſtence.
As his exiſtence, ſo his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is mutable: the one neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
including a poſſibilitie
of declination or decay; the
other an inclination of relapſe,
or falling into evill. As he was
made after the ſimilitude of
God, he was actually and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
good. Yet was not his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1027:29"/>
goodneſſe eſſentiall, neceſſarie
or immutable. Nor did hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
his Creator in theſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall
attributes: but rather in
the exerciſe of them <hi>ad extra.</hi>
Now the exerciſe of them was
not neceſſarie, but free in the
Creator. For God might have
continued for ever Moſt holy,
righteous and good in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
albeit hee had never crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
man, nor other creature.
Wherefore hee made them
good, as hee was freely good.
And ſuch is the goodneſſe
communicated to them in their
creation, not neceſſarie, but free:
And if free, as well including a
poſſibilitie of falling into evill,
as an actuall ſtate in goodneſſe.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1027:30"/>
If then you aske, Could not
God by his almightie power
have prevented <hi>Adams</hi> eating
the forbidden fruit? None, I
thinke, will bee ſo incredulous
to doubt, whether he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Sunne to ſtand ſtill
in his ſphere, and did dead <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboams</hi>
arme, when he ſtretched
it out againſt the Prophet,
could not as eaſily have ſtayed
<hi>Adams</hi> hand from taking, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his eye from looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or his heart from luſting
after the forbidden fruit. All
theſe were acts of meere power.
But had he by his omnipotent
power laid this neceſſity upon
<hi>Adams</hi> will or underſtanding,
or had he kept him from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1027:30"/>
by reſtraint: hee had
made him uncapable of that
happineſſe, whereto by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
goodneſſe hee had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him; for by this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hee had not beene good in
himſelfe, nor could he be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of true felicitie, but he muſt
bee capable likewiſe of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and miſerie. The ground
of his intereſt in the one, was
his actuall and inherent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
communicated in his
creation: nor was hee liable to
the other, but by the mutability
of his goodneſſe, or poſſibilitie
of falling into evill. In like
manner, hee that gave that
knowne power and vertue to
the load-ſtone, could as eaſily
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1027:31"/>
draw the moſt ſtony hearted
ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> unto Chriſt, as it
doth ſteele and iron. But if hee
ſhould draw them by ſuch a
neceſſarie and naturall motion,
hee ſhould defeat them of all
that hope or intereſt in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
glorie, which hee hath
prepared for thoſe that love
him. If againe it bee demanded,
why God doth not ſave the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
and ſtubborne ſinner;
it is all one, as if wee ſhould
aske, why hee doth not crowne
bruit beaſts with honour and
immortality. That this he could
doe by his infinite power, I will
not deny. And if this he would
doe, no creature juſtly might
controll him, none poſſibly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1027:31"/>
could reſiſt or hinder him: yet
I may without preſumption af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that thus to doe, cannot
ſtand with the internall rule of
his juſtice, goodneſſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie.
Nor can it ſtand better
with the ſame rule to ſave all
men, if wee take them as they
are, not as they might bee; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
hee hath indued all with
reaſon to diſtinguiſh betweene
good and evill.<note place="margin">Jude 10.</note> For <hi>many of them
ſpeake evill of thoſe things which

                     <hi>It is a people</hi> (ſaith

of the Word and other
meanes, not prejudiciall to his

them as hee would have done
Jeruſalem here in my text. But
finally there is a certaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of iniquity, which where it

is full, an height of ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

of his infinite mercy, and
fore-caſting their finall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as neceſſary by aſſenting
not altogether neceſſarily to
the particular meanes whereby
it is wrought. That is, in fewer

infinite power or infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
matched with juſtice infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
without an infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

may determine) extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as hee did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> may
well ſtand with the eternall rule

to win others by his uſuall and
ordinary calling. Speciall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges

overthrow the courſe of juſtice.
It is not contrary then to the

                  <p>The ſecond extremity is,
<hi>That in man before his converſion
by grace, there is a freedome or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliment
to doe that which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and acceptable to God, or an
activity to worke his owne conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
This was the errour of the
<hi>Pelagians,</hi> and communicated
to the moderne <hi>Papiſts;</hi> who
hold a meane indeed, but a falſe
one, betweene the <hi>Pelagians</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1027:35"/>
and the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> The true
meane from which all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
ſwerve may bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in theſe two propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
the one negative; <hi>In man
after</hi> Adams <hi>fall there is no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of will, or ability to doe any
thing not deſerving Gods wrath or
juſt indignation:</hi> the other affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative;
<hi>There is in man after
his fall, a poſſibility left of doing or
not doing of ſome things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done or not done, he becomes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
capable of Gods mercies;
doing or not doing the contrary, he
is excluded from mercy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
a veſſell of wrath for his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to worke upon.</hi> For whether a
man will call this contingence
in humane actions, not <hi>a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1027:35"/>
of doing or not doing,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>a poſſibilitie of acknowledging
our infirmities or abſolute impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of doing any thing belonging or
tending to our ſalvation;</hi> I will
not contend with him: Onely
of this I reſt perſwaded, that all
the exhortations of the Prophets
and Apoſtles, to worke humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and true repentance in their
Auditors, ſuppoſe a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of humiliation and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
a poſſibility likewiſe of
acknowledging and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our owne impotency and
miſery; a poſſibility likewiſe of
conceiving ſome deſire, not
meerely bruitiſh, of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
or deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour (yee know) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1027:36"/>
not onely a deſire of
health, of ſight, of ſpeech, in
all thoſe whom he healed; reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſight, or made to ſpeake:
but withall a kind of naturall
beleefe, or conceit, that he was
able to effect what they deſired,
Hence ſaith the Euangeliſt,
<hi>Marke 6. 5. Mat. 13. verſe laſt;
Hee could not doe many miracles
among them, becauſe of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe.</hi>
Yet CHRIST alone
wrought the miracles, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
cured were meere patients,
no way agents. And ſuch as
ſollicited their cauſe in caſe of
abſence, at the beſt, were but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders.
Now no man (I
thinke) will deny, that Chriſt
by the power of his Godhead
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1027:36"/>
could have given ſight, ſpeech,
and health to the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and perverſe: yet by the
rule of his divine goodneſſe, he
could not caſt his <hi>pearles before
ſwine.</hi> Moſt true it is, that wee
are altogether dead to life ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
unable to ſpeake or think,
much leſſe to deſire it, as wee
ſhould. Yet beleefe and reaſon
morall and naturall ſurvive, and
may with <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi>
beſeech Chriſt to raiſe up their
dead brother, who cannot
ſpeake for himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The third Objection will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be preferred in Table-talke
diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> than ſeriouſly urged
in ſolemne diſpute. <hi>If God ſo
dearly deſire and will the life and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1027:37"/>
ſafety of ſuch as periſh; his will
ſhould not alwaies be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why?<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Dare any man living
ſay or thinke that hee alwaies
doth whatſoever God would
have him doe? So, doubtleſſe,
he ſhould never ſin or offend his
God. For never was there wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſo wilfull, or man ſo mad
as to bee offended with ought,
that went not againſt their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
will. Nor was there ever or
poſſibly can be any breach, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the will of the Law-giver
be broken, thwarted or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.
For he that leaves the
letter and followes the true
meaning of the Lawgivers will,
doth not tranſgreſſe his law,
but obſerve it. And unleſſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1027:37"/>
Gods will had beene ſet upon
the ſalvation of ſuch as periſh,
they had not offended, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleaſed him in running
headlong the wayes of death.
Yet in a good ſenſe, it is alwayes
moſt true, that Gods will is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>We are therefore to conſider,
that God may will ſome things
abſolutely, others disjunctive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
or that ſome things ſhould
fall out neceſſarily, others not at
all, or contingently. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
which God abſolutely
wils ſhould fall out neceſſarily,
muſt of neceſſity come to paſſe;
otherwiſe, his will could in no
caſe be truly ſaid to be fulfilled.
As, unleſſe the Leper, to whom
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1027:38"/>
it was ſaid by our Saviour, <hi>I
will, be thou cleane,</hi> had beene
cleanſed, Gods will manifeſted
in theſe words, had beene ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
broken. But if every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
which hee wils disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,
or which he wils ſhould
be contingent, did of neceſſity
come to paſſe; his whole will
ſhould utterly be defeated. For
his will (as wee ſuppoſe in this
caſe) is that neither this nor that
particular ſhould be neceſſarily:
but that either they ſhould not
be, or be contingently. And
if any particular compriſed
within the latitude of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency
with its conſequent,
come to paſſe; his will is truly
and perfectly fulfilled. As for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1027:38"/>
example, God tels the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
that by obſerving his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
they ſhould live; and
dye by tranſgreſſing them.
Whether therefore they live by
the one meanes, or dye by the
other; his will is neceſſarily
fulfilled: Becauſe it was not
that they ſhould neceſſarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his Commandements or
tranſgreſſe them: but to their
tranſgreſſion, though contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
death was the neceſſary
doome; ſo was life the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
reward of their contingent
obſerving them.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord hath ſworne
that he delighteth not in the
death of him that dieth;<note place="margin">Object.</note> but in
his repentance: if then hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1027:39"/>
repent, Gods delight or
good pleaſure is not alwayes
fulfilled; becauſe hee delights
in the one of theſe; not in the
other. How then ſhall it be
true which is written, <hi>God doth
whatſoever pleaſeth him in the
Heaven and in the Earth,</hi> if hee
make not ſinners repent, in
whoſe repentance hee is better
pleaſed, than in their death?</p>
                  <p>But unto this difficultie,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> the
former anſwer may bee rightly
fitted. Gods delight or good
pleaſure may bee done two
wayes, either <hi>in us,</hi> or <hi>upon us.</hi> In
the former place, it is ſet upon
our repentance or obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to his will. For this is that
ſervice, whereto by his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1027:39"/>
he ordained us. But if we
croſſe his good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
as it reſpects this point;
that is, if wee will not ſuffer our
ſelves to be ſaved; the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
or pleaſure is ſet upon
our puniſhment and fulfilled
upon us. And if wee would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into our owne hearts, wee
might ſee the Image of Gods
will hitherto manifeſted by his
word, diſtinctly written in
them: and that the Rule which
his juſtice obſerves in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
the wicked and reprobate,
is to meaſure out their plagues
and puniſhments according to
the meaſure of their neglecting
his will or contradicting his
delight in their ſubjection.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1027:40"/>
That as the riches of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
leading them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
hath beene more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
ſo they, by their impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie
ſtill <hi>treaſure up</hi> greater
ſtore of <hi>wrath againſt the day of
wrath.</hi> To this purpoſe doth
the Lord threaten the obſtinate
people before mentioned in
<hi>Eſay;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſa. 65. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe are as a ſmoake in
my noſe, and a fire that burneth all
the day;</hi> as hee hath ſpread out
his hands to them all the day.
<hi>Behold it is written before mee, I
will not keepe ſilence, but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
into their boſomes, your
iniquities, and the iniquities of
your Fathers together, ſaith the
Lord: which have burnt incenſe
upon the mountaines, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1027:40"/>
mee upon the Hils: therefore
will I reward their former workes
into their boſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Both theſe parts of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
are fully expreſſed by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon:
Wiſdome cryeth without,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 20, 21, &amp;c.</note>
                     <hi>ſhee hath uttered her will in the
ſtreets, ſhee cryeth in the chiefe
places of the concourſe, in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Gates, in the Citie, ſhee
uttereth her words, ſaying; How
long yee ſimple ones will yee love
ſimplicitie, and the ſcorners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in their ſcorning, and fooles
hate knowledge? Turne you at my
reproofe; behold, I will powre out
my ſpirit upon you, I will make
knowne my words unto you.</hi> Theſe
paſſages infallibly argue an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
delight in their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1027:41"/>
and ſuch a deſire of their
ſalvation as the wiſdome of
God hath expreſſed in my text,
But what followes? <hi>Becauſe
I have called and yee refuſed, I
have ſtretched out my hand, and no
man regarded: but yee have ſet at
nought all my counſell, and would
none of my reproofe; I alſo will
laugh at your calamitie, I will
mock when your feare commeth.</hi>
This his delight remaines the
ſame, but is ſet upon another
object: To the ſame purpoſe,
<hi>Eſay 65. 12. Therefore I will
number you to the ſword, and you
ſhall all bow downe to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
becauſe when I called, yee did
not anſwer; when I ſpake, yee aid
not heare: but did evill before
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1027:41"/>
mine eyes, and did chuſe that
wherein I delighted not.</hi> So then,
whether by the deſtruction of
the wicked, or ſalvation of the
choſen; Gods name is ſtill glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.
His juſtice expects what
ſhould have beene done, but
was not paid unto mercy. Hee
can be no loſer by mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe
or ungrateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
The caſe is all one, as if
one ſhould take that from a
theefe with the left hand, which
hee hath picked out of our right
hand. Thus much of the two
points propoſed.</p>
                  <p>I doe deſire no more than
that the tree may be judged by
the fruit: and queſtionleſſe the
uſe of theſe reſolutions, for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1027:42"/>
convincing our ſelves of ſinne,
or quelling deſpaire, or for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
the careleſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
unto repentance, by
giving them the right hold of
the meanes of life, is much
greater than can bee conceived
without the admittance of
their truth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſeeing the end of our
preaching is not ſo much to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the elect,</hi> as <hi>to call ſinners to
repentance;</hi> not ſo much to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
their faith that are already
certaine of ſalvation, as to give
hope to the unregenerate, that
they may bee ſaved: how ſhall
wee accompliſh either intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by magnifying Gods
love towards the elect? who
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1027:42"/>
theſe are, God and themſelves
know. How ſhall he that lives
yet in ſinne perſwade himſelfe,
there is probability that he may
bee ſaved, becauſe God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
decreed to ſave ſome
few? Rather ſeeing by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
doctrine, the moſt part of
mankinde muſt neceſſarily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
hee hath more reaſon to
feare, leſt he be one of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
than one of the few. The
bare poſſibility of his ſalvation
cannot be inferred, but from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite
premiſſes, from which
no certaine concluſion can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
follow: and without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
apprehenſion or conceit
of poſſibility, there can bee no
certaine ground of hope. But if
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1027:43"/>
wee admit the former extent of
Gods unſpeakable love to all,
and his deſire of their eternall
ſafety, which deſperately pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;
every man may, nay, muſt
undoubtedly thus conclude;
<hi>Therefore, Gods love extends to
mee: It is his good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
to have mee ſaved amongst
the reſt, as well as any other: and
whatſoever he unfainedly wils, his
power is able effectually to bring to
paſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The danger of ſinne, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of that dreadfull day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt made knowne to our
Auditory; the preſſing of theſe
points, as effectually as they
might bee, (were this doctrine
held for current) would kindle
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1027:43"/>
the love of God in our hearts,
and inflame them with deſires
anſwerable to Gods ardent will
of our ſalvation: and theſe once
kindled, would breed ſure
hope, and in a manner inforce
us to embrace the infallible
meanes thereunto ordained.</p>
                  <p>Without admiſſion of the
former doctrine, it is impoſſible
for any man rightly to meaſure
the hainouſneſſe of his owne or
others ſinnes. Such as gather
the infinity of ſinnes demerit,
from the infinite Majeſtie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which it is committed,
give us the ſurface of ſinne, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinite
in length and breadth;
but not in ſolidity. The will or
pleaſure of a Prince in matters
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1027:44"/>
meanly affected by him, or in
reſpect of which hee is little
more than indifferent, may bee
neglected without greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
than meaner perſons may
juſtly take for foule indignities
or grievous wrongs. But if a
Princes ſoveraigne command
in a matter which he deſired ſo
much as his owne life, ſhould
be contemned; a loyall ſubject
conſcious of ſuch contempt,
though hapning through riot,
or perſwaſions of ill company,
would in his ſober ſits be ready
to take revenge of himſelfe;
ſpecially if hee knew his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes
love or liking of him to
be more than ordinary. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then, that as the Majeſty
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1027:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and goodneſſe of our God, ſo
his love and mercy towards us
is truly infinite: that he deſires
our repentance as earneſtly, as
wee can deſire meat and drinke
in the extremity of thirſt or
hunger; as wee can doe life it
ſelfe, whiles wee are beſet with
death: This our <hi>God manifeſted
in our fleſh,</hi> did not deſire his
owne life ſo much as our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
We muſt therefore
meaſure the hainouſneſſe of our
ſinne, by the abundance of
Gods love, by the height and
depth of our Saviours humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thus they will appeare infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
not only becauſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt an infinite Majeſty,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1027:45"/>
but becauſe with this dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
they further include a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
neglect of infinite mercies,
and incomprehenſible deſires
of our ſalvation. Wee are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the ſeed of rebels, which
had lift up their hands againſt
the infinite goodneſſe of their
Creator, in taking of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fruit; whereby they ſought
to be like him in Majeſty. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of the tranſgreſſion, the
firſt actors immediately hid
themſelves from his preſence:
and, as if this their terrour had
imprinted a perpetuall antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
in their poſteritie, the leaſt
glimpſe of his glory for many
generations after, made them
crie out, <hi>Alas wee ſhall die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1027:45"/>
we have ſeene the Lord.</hi> We
ſtill continue like the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
of tame creatures grown
wilde, alwayes eſchewing his
preſence, that ſeekes to recover
us; as the bird doth the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
on the beaſts of the foreſt
the ſight of fire. And yet, unleſſe
hee ſhelter us under the ſhadow
of his wings, wee are as a prey
expoſed to the deſtroyer, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
condemned for fuell to the
flames of hell, or nutriment to
the breed of ſerpents. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
us from this everlaſting
thraldome, our God came
downe into the world in the
ſimilitude of our fleſh, made
as a ſtale to allure us with wiles
into his net, that hee might
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1027:46"/>
draw us with the cords of love.
The depth of Chriſts humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was as great as the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene God and the
meaneſt man; therefore truly
infinite. <hi>Hee,</hi> that was <hi>equall
with God,</hi> was converſant here
on earth with us in the <hi>forme</hi>
and condition <hi>of a ſervant.</hi> But
of ſervants by birth or civill
conſtitution, many live in
health and caſe, with ſufficient
ſupplies of all things neceſſary
for this life. So did not the Son
of God: His humanity was
charged with all the miſeries
whereof mortality is capable;
ſubject to hunger, thirſt, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
revilings and ſcornings
even of his ſervants; an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1027:46"/>
which cannot befall ſlaves
or vaſſals, either borne or made
ſuch by men: or, to uſe the
Prophets words, <hi>Hee bare mans
infirmities,</hi> not ſpiritually one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but bodily. For <hi>who was
weake and hee not weake?</hi> who
was ſick and hee whole? No
malady of any diſeaſe cured by
him, but was made his, by his
exact and perfect ſympathic:
Laſtly, <hi>Hee bare our ſinnes</hi> upon
the croſſe, and ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to greater torments than
any man in this life can ſuffer.
And though theſe were as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
to his humane nature,
as to ours: yet were our ſinnes
to him more diſpleaſant. As he
was loving to us in his death:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1027:47"/>
ſo was hee wiſe towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and in ſubmitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
unto his cruell and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
death did of two evils
chuſe the leſſe; rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the puniſhment due to our
finnes, than to ſuffer ſinne ſtill
to raigne in us, whom he loved
more dearely than his owne
life. If then, we ſhall continue
in ſinne after the manifeſtation
of his love: the hainouſneſſe
of our offence is truly infinite:
in ſo much as wee doe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
which is more diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to our gracious God, than
any torments can be to us. So
doing we build up the <hi>workes of
Satan which hee came purpoſely to
deſtroy.</hi> For of this I would not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1027:47"/>
have you ignorant; that albeit
the end of his death was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
ſinners: yet the onely
meanes predeſtinated by him
for our redemption, is <hi>deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the workes of Satan,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
of his Fathers Image</hi> in
our Soules. For us then to ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie
the workes of Satan, or
abett his faction, is ſtill more
offenſive to this our God, then
was his <hi>Agonie</hi> or bloudy
ſweat.</p>
                  <p>For taking a fuller meaſure
of our ſinnes: let us hereunto
adde his patient expectation of
his enemies converſion after the
reſurrection. If the ſonne of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi>
before mentioned ſhould
have pardoned any as deeply
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1027:48"/>
guilty as himſelfe had beene of
that offence for which hee loſt
one of his eyes, and his father
another; the world would have
taxed him, either of unjuſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
or too much facilitie, rather
than commended him for true
juſtice or clemencie. But that
we may know how farre Gods
mercy doth over-beare his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
he proceeds not ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to execute vengeance upon
thoſe Jewes which wrecked
their malice upon his deare and
onely Sonne, which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
nothing worthy of
blame, much leſſe of death.
Here was matter of wrath and
indignation ſo juſt as would
have moved the moſt mercifull
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1027:48"/>
man on Earth to have taken
ſpeedy revenge upon theſe ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of innocent blood; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the law of God permitting
thus much. But Gods mercy
is above his law, above his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
Theſe did exact the very
abolition of theſe ſinners in the
very firſt act of ſinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt God made man for
their redemption: yet hee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
expects their repentance
which with unrelenting fury
had plotted his deſtruction.
<hi>Forty yeares long had hee beene
grieved with this generation</hi> after
the firſt Paſſeover celebrated in
ſigne of their deliverance from
<hi>Aegyptian</hi> bondage, and for

                  </p>
                  <p>The principall difficultie or

what ſenſe <hi>Gods will or Indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

[whom hee will hee hardeneth.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to trouble you with any

<hi>Gods will:</hi> (this is a ſtring
which in moſt meditations we

<hi>Gods will</hi> be moſt truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibly
<hi>one,</hi> and in indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

of the object ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
cannot be reſiſted, becauſe
it is Gods will, that it ſhall

the exiſtence of any one ſo
willed ſhould be neceſſarie, his
<hi>will</hi> might bee reſiſted; ſeeing
his <hi>will</hi> is, they ſhould not bee
neceſſarie. Each particular of

true of all perſons in
every age of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſpecially
before his fall; <hi>Non Deus volens
iniquitatem tues:</hi> God doth not,
he cannot will iniquitie. And
yet wee ſee the world is full of

is as univerſally true; <hi>This is the

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1027:55"/>
behold a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in this little
world, in the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi>
whom hee created after his
owne image and ſimilitude. So
then, hee neither wils mens
goodneſſe, nor wils their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
by his irreſiſtible will.
Hee truly willed <hi>Adams</hi> integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but not by his <hi>irreſiſtible
will:</hi> For ſo <hi>Adam</hi> could not
have fallen. What, ſhall wee
ſay then, God did will <hi>Adams</hi>
fall, by his <hi>irreſiſtible will?</hi>
God forbid: For ſo <hi>Adam</hi> could
not but have ſinned. Where is
the meane or middle ſtation, on
which we may build our faith?
The immediate object of Gods
irreſiſtible will, in this caſe,
was <hi>Adams</hi> free will, that is,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1027:56"/>
                     <hi>Poteſtas labendi, &amp; poteſtas ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di:</hi>
Powre to ſtand and powre
to fall. By the ſame <hi>will</hi> hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<hi>Death,</hi> as the inevitable
conſequent of his fall; and <hi>life,</hi>
as the neceſſary unpreventable
reward of his perſeverance.

How often have <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>
beene accuſed by <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
as if they taught, <hi>That God did
directly harden mens hearts, by

the production of a reprobate or
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1027:58"/>
impenitent temper were ſuch an

we take <hi>Privative</hi> and <hi>Poſitive

them ſo farre aſunder; the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is altogether imperfect:
the former member comes as

neither the one way nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that is (as wee ſay in

verifie the truth of the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     </p>
                     <p>But many times hee hardens

inclining the Heart to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that is, by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his favours, and exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of motives more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
to repentance, not that
hee exhibites the ſame with
purpoſe to harden: but rather
to mollifie and organize mens
hearts to the receiving of Grace.
The naturall effect or purpoſed
iſſue of the <hi>Riches</hi> of Gods
bountie, is to draw men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
But the very attempt
or ſway of meanes offered, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
hearts faſtned to their
ſinnes, to greater ſtubbornneſſe
in the rebound. Hearts thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<hi>treaſure up wrath againſt

meaſure to the <hi>riches of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1027:59"/>
bountie</hi> offered, but not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by them. And ſuch a
cauſe as God is of their <hi>treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up of wrath,</hi> hee is likewiſe
of their <hi>hardening;</hi> no direct, no
neceſſary cauſe of either: yet a
cauſe of both, more than <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
a <hi>poſitive cauſe</hi> by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
or reſultance; not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
or neceſſary onely <hi>ex
hypotheſi.</hi> Meanes of repentance
ſincerely offered by God, but
wilfully rejected by man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
as poſitively to induration
of heart, as the heating of water
doth to the quick freezing of it,
when it is taken off the fire and
ſet in the cold aire. If a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
ſhould miniſter ſome phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
drink unto his patient, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1027:60"/>
heape clothes upon him with
purpoſe to prevent ſome diſeaſe
by a kindly ſweat; and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
throughly heated, wilfully
throw them off: both may be
ſaid <hi>poſitive cauſes</hi> of the cold,
which would neceſſary enſue
from both actions; albeit the
patient only were the true moral
cauſe, or the only blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
cauſe of his owne death or
danger following. Juſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the importance of this
ſuppoſition or ſimilitude, is the
cauſe of hardening in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to be divided betwixt God
and man. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did
harden their owne hearts in the
wilderneſſe; and yet their hearts
had not beene ſo hardened, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1027:60"/>
the Lord had done ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wonders in their ſight. In
every wonder his purpoſe was
to get beleefe: but through their
wilfull unbeleefe, the beſt effect
of his greateſt wonders was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration
and impenitencie.
Now as it ſuits not with the
rule of good manners for <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
to tie a mans hands of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
or place, leſt hee uſe
them to his owne harme: ſo
neither was it conſonant to the
rules of eternall equitie, that
God ſhould neceſſitate the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites

any man. But <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
caſe is extraordinarie. <hi>Beza</hi>
rightly inferres againſt <hi>Origen</hi>
and his followers; that this
hardening whereof the Apoſtle
here ſpeaketh, was irreſiſtible;
that the party thus hardened
was uncaple of repentance; that
God did ſhew ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> not with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to reclaime but harden
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to drive him
headlong into the ſnare prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for him from everlaſting.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1027:61"/>
All theſe inferences are plaine,
firſt that interrogation, <hi>Who

<hi>No man, no creature can at any

in this peremptory manner will
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> hardening, is evident
from the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> of that meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage

For this expoſtulation,
whereunto our Apoſtle in this

after the ſeventh wonder
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1027:66"/>
wrought by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
in the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> upon
which it is expreſly ſaid, that
<hi>The Lord hardned the heart of

unto them.</hi> Whereas of the five
going before, it is onely ſaid,
<hi>That Pharaoh hardned his heart,</hi>
or <hi>his heart was hardned,</hi> or <hi>hee
ſet not his heart to the wonders.</hi>
The ſpirits cenſure likewiſe of
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſtupiditie, upon the
firſt wonder may bee read im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſonally,
or to bee referred to
the wonder it ſelfe, which
might poſitively harden his
heart in ſuch a ſenſe as is before
expreſſed. Nor is it to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that upon the neglect of the
ſeventh wonder, the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1027:66"/>
his commiſſion to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and his threats to <hi>Pharaoh.
Thus ſaith the Lord God of the
Hebrewes, Let my people goe, that
they may ſerve mee. For I will at
this time ſend all my plagues upon
thine heart, and upon thy ſervants,
and upon thy people; that thou
maiſt know that there is none like

when the boiles were ſo rife
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1027:67"/>
upon the <hi>Magitians:</hi> but when

more expreſly thus:</hi> God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
had juſt cauſe to upbraid
Pharaoh heretofore, for neglect of
his ſignes and wonders: it was a

that which it is impoſſible for him to
avoid? For is it poſſible for him to
open the doore of repentance, when
God hath ſhut it? or to mollifie his
heart, whoſe hardning was now by
Gods decree irrevocable?</p>
                     <p>I have heard of a malepart

Then God expoſtulateth with

as a rejoynder upon Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

is man in reſpect of God? any

in reſpect of the artificer that
makes it? or than an earthen

Nay if wee might imagine a
baſe veſſell could ſpeake (as
fables ſuppoſe beaſts in old
time did) and thus expoſtulate
with the potter; <hi>[When I was
ſpoiled in the making, why didſt

a by-ſlander that had no skill

boy or apprentiſe thus to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate
on the veſſels behalfe to
his father or maſter, would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
ignorance and indiſcretion.
The potter at leaſt would take
ſo much authority on him, as
to reply; <hi>I will appoint every veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
to what uſe I thinke fit; not to
ſuch uſe as every idle fellow, or

Now all that our Apoſtle in
this ſimilitude intends is, that
wee muſt attribute more unto
the Creators skill and wiſdome
in diſpenſing mercy and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or in preparing veſſels
of wrath, and veſſels of honour,
than wee doe unto the potters
judgement in diſcerning clay,
or ſitting every part of his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>the potter is judge,</hi> ſaith the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

That very veſſell which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
the matter of this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to our Apoſtle, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 4.
was ſo <hi>marred in the potters
hand,</hi> as he was inforced to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
it againe to another uſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1027:71"/>
than it was firſt intended for.
That it was marred in the firſt
making, was the fault of the
clay. So to faſhion it anew, as
neither ſtuffe, nor former la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
ſhould be altogether loſt,
was the potters skill. And ſhall
wee thinke our Apoſtle did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any other inference from
this ſimilitude, than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
from whence hee bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
it, had made to his hand?
<hi>O houſe of Iſrael, cannot I doe
with you, as this potter, ſaith the
Lord? Behold, as the clay is in the
potters hand, ſo are yee in mine
hand, Oh houſe of Iſrael, Ierem.</hi>
18. 6.</p>
                     <p>The true and full explication
is thus much and no more; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1027:71"/>
God ſought to prepare
them to glorie, yet had they a
poſſibilitie or libertie utterly to
ſpoile themſelves in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
Howbeit, if ſo they did,
hee was able to forme them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
to an end quite contrarie
unto that whereto hee firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
them. So the Prophet
explicates himſelfe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
                     <p>And here wee muſt requeſt
our Reader alwayes to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that the Apoſtle compares
God, not to a frantick, or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick
potter, delighted to
play tricks to his loſſe; as to
make a veſſell ſcarce worth a

with the ſame eaſe and coſt,
might bee made worth a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1027:72"/>
onely to ſhew his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
authoritie over a peece of
clay. He imagineth ſuch a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as the Wiſe man did, that
knowes a reaſon why he makes
one veſſell of this faſhion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
of that; why he appoints
this to a baſe uſe, that to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
albeit an unskilfull by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtander
could perhaps diſcerne
no difference in the ſtuffe or
matter whereof they are made.</p>
                     <p>The ſumme then of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
intended inference is
this; As it is an unmannerly
point for any man to conteſt,
or wrangle with a skilfull arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
in his owne facultie, of
whom hee ſhould rather deſire
to learne with ſubmiſſion: ſo it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1027:72"/>
is damnable preſumption for
any creature to diſpute with his
Creator in matters of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or of the worlds regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or to debate his owne
cauſe with him thus; <hi>Seeing all
of us were made of the ſame maſſe,
I might have beene graced as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have beene with wealth, with
honour, with ſtrength, with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
unleſſe thou hadſt beene more
favourable to them than to mee.</hi>
Yet that which muſt quell all
inclination to ſuch ſecret mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings,
or preſumptuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
is it our ſtedfaſt beleefe of
his omnipotent power or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
will? No: but of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
wiſdome, equity and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
by which he diſpoſeth all
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1027:73"/>
things, even mens infirmities or
greater croſſes to a better end in
reſpect of them, (ſo they will
patiently ſubmit their wils to
his) than they could hope by
any other meanes to atchieve.</p>
                     <p>Gods will to have mercie on
ſome,<note place="margin">In what ſenſe Gods will is ſaid to be the abſolute and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible rule of equitle, or juſtice.</note> and to harden others, or
howſoever otherwiſe to deale
with men, is in this ſenſe moſt
abſolute. Whatſoever wee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know to bee willed by
him, wee muſt acknowledge
without examination, to bee
truly good. Whomſoever wee
aſſuredly beleeve it hath beene
his will to harden, wee muſt
without diſpute, beleeve their
hardning to have beene moſt
juſt. Yet thus to beleeve wee are
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1027:73"/>
not bound, unleſſe it were a
fundamentall point of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
that this his moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
will hath juſt reaſons
(though unknowne to us) why
hee hardneth ſome, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
yea ſuch <hi>ideall</hi> reaſons, as
when it ſhall be his pleaſure to
make them knowne to us, wee
ſhall acknowledge them to bee
infinitely better, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the immutable rules
of eternall equitie (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are) than any earthly
Prince can give, why hee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
this man, and rewardeth
that.</p>
                     <p>The contrarie in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
which ſome would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
out of our Apoſtle in this
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1027:74"/>
place, is the true, naturall, and
neceſſarie conſequence which
they have made of another or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall
principle, <hi>[Gods will
is the only infallible rule of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,]</hi>
that is, in their expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Things are good onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God doth will them;</hi> When
as in truth his <hi>will</hi> could not be
ſo infallible, ſo inflexible, and
ſo ſoveraigne a rule of <hi>goodneſſe,</hi>
(as all muſt beleeve it to bee,
that thinke themſelves bound
to conforme their wils to his)
unleſſe abſolute and immutable

<hi>It was Gods will to

deale thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
therefore they are moſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dealt withall:</hi> Yet on the other
ſide, this inference is as ſtrong
and ſound; <hi>Some kinde of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
are in their owne natures ſo
evidently unjust, that we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
it was not Gods will to deale
ſo with any man living. Abraham</hi>
did not tranſgreſſe the bounds
of modeſtie in ſaying to God,
<hi>That the righteous ſhould periſh
with the wicked, that be farre from
thee. Shall not the Judge of all
the earth doe right?</hi> Yet were
Gods <hi>will</hi> the rule of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in ſuch a ſenſe as ſome
conceive it; or our Apoſtles
meaning ſuch, as many in this
place have made it; <hi>Abraham</hi>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1027:75"/>
had beene either very ignorant
or immodeſt in queſtioning
whether Gods will concerning
the deſtruction of <hi>Sodome</hi> (lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
imparted to him, <hi>Geneſ.</hi>
18.) had beene right or wrong:
whether to have ſlaine the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
with the wicked had
beene juſt, or ill beſeeming the
great Judge and Maker of the
world. Howbeit to have ſlaine
the righteous with the wicked
would have beene leſſe rigorous
and leſſe unjuſt, than to harden
man by an inevitable neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
decree, before they had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
hardned themſelves,
or unneceſſarily brought an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
temper or neceſſitie of
ſinning upon themſelves. And
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1027:75"/>
for this cauſe, we may ſafely ſay
with our father <hi>Abraham; Thus
to harden any whom thou haſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that bee farre from thee, Oh
Lord.</hi> Farre be it ever from every
good Chriſtians heart to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
any ſuch conceit of his
Creator.</p>
                     <p>Albeit this firſt anſwer might

make: yet, as our Apoſtle in his
ſecond anſwer imports; wee
need not uſe the benefit of this
generall apologie in <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
caſe. The reaſon or manner of
Gods juſtice and wiſdome in
hardning and puniſhing him, is
conſpicuous and juſtifiable by
the principles of equitie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1027:76"/>
by all. For <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
and his confederates were
veſſels of wrath ſealed up for
deſtruction. Hell (as wee ſay)
did yawne for them, before
God uttered the former expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations:
perhaps from that
very inſtant, wherein hee firſt
ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> unto him. It being
then granted, that God (as wee
indeed ſuppoſe) did from the
plague of murraine, or that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of boiles poſitively and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably
harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart,
and after he had promiſed to let
the Iſraelites goe, infatuated his
braines to wrangle with <hi>Moſes;</hi>
Firſt, whether their little ones,
afterwards whether their flocks
ſhould goe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> along with them:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1027:76"/>
yet to reſerve him alive, upon
what condition or termes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
(though to bee hardned,
though to be threatned, though
to be aſtoniſhed and affrighted
with froſts, plagues, and laſtly
to bee deſtroyed with a more
fearfull deſtruction, than if hee
had dyed of the peſtilence,
when the cattell periſhed of the
murraine) was a true document
of Gods lenity and patience, no
impeachment to his juſtice; a
gentle commutation of due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
no rigorous inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of puniſhment not juſtly
deſerved. For what if God had
thruſt him quick into hell in
that very moment wherein hee
told him, <hi>Ad hoc ipſum excitavi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1027:77"/>
For this very purpoſe have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
thee alive,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">So the <hi>Septuagint</hi> expreſſe the ſenſe of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>that I might

but as the torments of
that lake are more grievous,
than all the plagues which <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
ſuffered on earth: ſo the
degrees of his hardning (had
he beene then caſt into it) had
been in number more, his ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with God more violent
and ſtubborne, his poſſibility
of repentance altogether as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
as it was after the ſeventh
plague, if not leſſe. But ſhould
GOD therefore have beene
thought unjuſt, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to puniſh him in hell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
poſſibility of repentance
was paſt? No; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1027:77"/>
beene the onely cauſe of his
owne woe, by bringing this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
upon himſelfe, of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
God and repining at his
judgements. All is one then in
reſpect of Gods juſtice, whether
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> having made up the
meaſure of his iniquitie bee ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocably
hardned here on
earth, or in hell. To reſerve him
alive in the ſtate of mortalitie,
after the ſentence of death is
paſt upon him, is no rigour,
but lenitie and long-ſuffering:
although Gods plagues be ſtill
multiplied in Egypt for his
ſake, although the end of his
life become more dreadfull,
than by the ordinarie courſe of
Gods juſtice it ſhould have
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1027:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beene, if hee had dyed in the
ſeventh plague.</p>
                     <p>Another reaſon why God
without impeachment to his
juſtice doth ſtill augment <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
puniſhment, as if it were
now as poſſible for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
as once it was, is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by our Apoſtle to be this;
That by this lenitie towards
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Hee might ſhew his
wrath and declare his power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all ſuch ſinners as he was,
that the world might <hi>heare and
feare,</hi> and learne by his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
not to ſtrive againſt
their Maker, nor to dally with
his fearefull warnings. Had
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people died of
the peſtilence or other diſeaſe,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1027:78"/>
when the cattell periſhed of the
murraine, the terror of Gods
powerfull wrath had not beene
ſo manifeſt and viſible to the
world, as it was in overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole ſtrength of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
which had taken armes
and ſet themſelves in battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. Now the more
ſtrange the infatuation, the
more fearefull and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
the deſtruction of theſe <hi>veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of wrath</hi> did appeare unto
the world; the more bright did
<hi>the riches of Gods glory</hi> ſhine to
the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whom hee was
now preparing for <hi>veſſels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi>
the hearts of whoſe poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
hee did not ſo effectually
fit or ſeaſon for the infuſion of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1027:79"/>
his ſanctifying grace, by any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarie
meanes whatſoever, as
by the perpetuall memory of
his glorious victory over <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
and his mighty hoſt. But
this faithleſſe generation (whoſe
reformation our Apoſtle ſo
anxiouſly ſeekes) did take all
theſe glorious tokens of Gods
extraordinarie free love and
mercy towards their Fathers,
for irrevocable earneſts or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligements
to effect their abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

not of perſon onely, but of
<hi>qualitie:</hi> yea of degrees of <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi>
For as the immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of divine approbation is
juſtice, conſonancie or confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
to the immutable <hi>rule</hi> of
<hi>goodneſſe:</hi> ſo the immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of reprobation or indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is not the abſtract <hi>entitie</hi>
or <hi>nature of man;</hi> but the <hi>nature</hi>
miſ-qualified, that is, unjuſt
or diſſonant from the <hi>rule of
goodneſſe.</hi> And according to the
degrees of injuſtice or diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie,
are the degrees of <hi>divine</hi>
diſlike, of <hi>divine</hi> reprobation or
induration. The <hi>minor</hi> propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1027:90"/>
includes not onely an <hi>iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie</hi>
of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> perſon, but
ſuch a meaſure of injuſtice or
diſſonancie, as makes him lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the eternall decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
or induration by
Gods irreſiſtible will. But it
ſuppoſeth not this <hi>identitie</hi> of
ſuch bad qualities, or this full
meaſure of iniquitie to have
beene alwayes in him. Without
alteration of his perſon or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he was ſubject to great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of qualification: and each
qualification capable of divers
degrees and different diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with the <hi>eternall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
rule of goodneſſe.</hi> And
therefore the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition,
albeit eternally true, yet is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1027:90"/>
true onely with reference
to thoſe points of time, wherein
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> was ſo qualified. No
univerſalitie can infer any more
particulars than are contained
under it: and all thoſe it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
infers. An univerſalitie
of time cannot inferre an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalitie
of the ſubject: nor an
univerſalitie of the ſubject in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
an univerſalitie of time.
This collection is falſe, <hi>God
from eternitie foreſaw that all men
would be ſinners,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
from eternitie, that Adam in
his integritie ſhould bee a ſinner.</hi>
The inference in the former <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme</hi>
is as bad; <hi>God decreed to
harden Pharaoh from eternitie.</hi>
Ergo, <hi>Hee detreed to harden him
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1027:91"/>
in every moment of his life.</hi> Or,
Ergo, <hi>He was a reprobate from his
cradle.</hi> This <hi>concluſion</hi> rightly
ſcanned, includes an univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the ſubject, that is, all
the ſeverall objects of divine
juſtice, which are contained in
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> life; not one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
onely. Whereas <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in
the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition, is but
one particular or individuall
object of induration, or of the
divine decree concerning it.</p>
                     <p>And thus at length we are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at that point,<note place="margin">That albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it Pharaoh was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one and the ſame man: yet he was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one and the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</note> whence wee

weight at the ſeven yeares end,
ſhould finde great difference in
the ſummes: though the grains
bee for number and ſubſtance
the ſame, yet their weight are
divers. Or, ſuppoſe it to bee
true which is related of the
<hi>Great Magore,</hi> that hee weighs
himſelfe every yeare in gold,
and diſtributes the ſumme
thereof to the poore; and that
he had continued this cuſtome
from the ſeventh yeare of his
age: yet cannot there bee halfe
the difference betwixt the
weight of one and the ſame
Prince in his child-hood and in
his full age, after many heartie
prayers to make him fat, as is
betweene the different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1027:93"/>
of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> induration
within the compaſſe of one

                     <p>Therefore, this argument,
<hi>[Pharaoh was hardned after the

is to a man of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
more groſſe, than if wee
ſhould argue thus; <hi>[The Great
Magore diſtributed to the poore
five thouſand pounds in gold in
this fortieth yeare:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Hee
diſtributed ſo much every yeare,
ſince hee began this cuſtome of
weighing himſelfe in gold.]</hi> For
as he diſtributes unto the poore,
not according to the <hi>identitie</hi> of
his perſon, but according to the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1027:93"/>
                        <hi>identitie</hi> or <hi>diverſitie</hi> of his

rule of juſtice render unto
every man, not according to
the unitie of his perſon, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the diverſity of his
worke. Unto the ſeverall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of one and the ſame mans
iniquities, ſeverall meaſures of
induration, whether poſitive or
privative, are allotted from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
But ſmall induration by
Gods irreſiſtible will, or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
reprobation, is the
juſt recompence of the full
meaſure of iniquity; or (as the
Prophet ſpeakes) To harden
thus, is <hi>to ſeale up iniquitie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi>
without hope or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of pardon.</p>

                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:1027:94"/>
Theſe two propoſitions are
of like eternall truth; <hi>[God
from eternitie decreed by his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible

made up the full meaſure of

eternitie did not decree by his ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible
will, that Pharaoh ſhould
make up ſuch a meaſure of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.]</hi>
For hee doth not decree
iniquity at all, much leſſe full

unleſſe he ſo decree, not iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
only, but the full meaſure of
it; <hi>Pharaohs</hi> induration or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
was not abſolutely
neceſſary, in reſpect of Gods
eternall decree. For it was no
more neceſſary, than was the
full meaſure of iniquity unto
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1027:94"/>
which it was due. And that (as
hath beene ſaid) was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
becauſe not decreed by
Gods irreſiſtible will; without
which, neceſſity it ſelfe hath no

                     </p>
                     <p>From theſe deductions I may
clear a debt for which I ingaged
my ſelfe, in my laſt publike me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations.
My promiſe was
then, to make it evident that
theſe two propoſitions <hi>[God
from eternity decreed to harden
Pharaoh by his irreſiſtible will;]
[God from eternitie did not decree
to harden Pharaoh by his irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

good friends, if their Abbettors
would ceaſe to urge them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their naturall diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1027:95"/>
From their natures, they
are <hi>indefinites</hi> not <hi>ſingulars.</hi>
Both, in a good ſenſe, may bee
made to tell the truth. But a
wrangler may work them both
to beare evidence for error.
<hi>[God from eternitie did not decree
to harden Pharaoh by his irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

truth of this affirmative,
<hi>[God from eternity decreed to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

this <hi>indefinite</hi> truth beyond its
compaſſe. For hee makes it an
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1027:95"/>
                        <hi>univerſall,</hi> in that hee termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
the irreſiſtible decree to
every moment of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> life,
without diſtinction of qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And it may be, hee was
of opinion, that as well each
ſeverall qualification, as each
different meaſure of <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
hardening or impenitency, did
come to paſſe by Gods irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

the greateſt Clerk living (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if hee be not an accurate
Philoſopher) might eaſily ſlide,
was in confounding eternitie
with ſucceſſive duration; and
not diſtinguiſhing ſucceſſion it
ſelfe, from things durable or
ſucceſſive. Hee and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in this argument ſpeake,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1027:96"/>
as if they conceived that the
neceſſarie coexiſtence of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with time did neceſſarily
draw every mans whole courſe
of life, <hi>motu quodam raptus,</hi> after
ſuch a manner as <hi>Aſtronomers</hi>
ſuppoſe that the higheſt <hi>Spheare</hi>
doth move the lower, whereas,
if wee ſpeake of the courſe, not
of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> naturall, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life; it was rather an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
heape or confuſed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of durables, than one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
uniforme duration. And
each durable hath its diſtinct
reference to the eternall decree.
That which was eternally true
of one, was not of all; much
leſſe eternally true of another.
Eternitie it ſelfe, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1027:96"/>
though neceſſarily,
though indiviſibly co-exiſtent
to all, was not ſo indiſſolubly

might have altered or ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his courſe of life before that
moment, wherein the meaſure
of iniquitie was accompliſhed.
But in that moment hee became
ſo exorbitant, that the irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
decree of induration did
faſten upon him. His irregular
motions have ever ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
irrevocable; not his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

carried headlong by the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

                     <p>The propoſition or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1027:97"/>
propoſed, <hi>[Pharaoh was
hardened by Gods irreſiſtible
will,]</hi> is true from all eternitie,
throughout all eternitie; and
therefore true from <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
birth unto his death: but not
therefore true of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
qualified, or of all <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh's</hi>
qualifications throughout
the whole courſe of his life.
For ſo the propoſition becomes
an univerſall, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the time, but of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
that is, of all <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
qualifications. The ſenſe is,
as if hee had ſaid, <hi>[God from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie
decreed to harden Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh,
howſoever qualified, as well in
his infancie as in his full age, by
his irreſiſtible will:</hi> and thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1027:97"/>
it is falſe. The inference is
the ſame with the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>[Adam in Gods fore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
was a ſinner from eternitie;</hi>
Ergo, <hi>Adam was alwayes a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
a ſinner before hee ſinned, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of his innocencie:]</hi> or
with this, <hi>God from all eternitie
did decree by his irreſiſtible will,
that Adam ſhould die the death;</hi>
Ergo, <hi>Hee did decree by his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible
will, that Adam ſhould die
as ſoone as hee was created, or be a
ſinner all his life long.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To reconcile theſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
aright, <hi>[God from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie
decreed by his irreſiſtible
will that Adam ſhould die,] [God
from eternitie did not decree by his
irreſiſtible will, that Adam ſhould
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1027:98"/>
die,]</hi> otherwiſe than wee have
reconciled the two former,
[God from eternitie decreed to
harden <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by his irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
will;] <hi>[God from eternitie
did not decree to harden Pharaoh
by his irreſiſtible will,]</hi> no Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I preſume, will undertake.
The onely reconciliation poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
is this, <hi>[God did decree by
his irreſiſtible will, that Adam
ſinning ſhould die:] [God did not
decree by his irreſiſtible will, that
Adam not ſinning, ſhould die]</hi> nor
did hee decree by his irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
will, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould ſin,
that hee might die. For (as wee
ſaid before) God did neither
decree his fall, nor his perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
by his irreſiſtible will.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1027:98"/>
And his death was no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable
than his fall. Nor was
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> finall induration
more inevitable, than the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of iniquitie to which ſuch
induration was from eternitie
awarded by Gods irreſiſtible
will. Of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thus conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the concluſion was true
from eternitie; true in reſpect
of every moment of <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
life, wherein the meaſure of his
iniquitie was, or might have
beene accompliſhed; though it
had beene accompliſhed within
three yeares after his birth. And
this accompliſhment preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
the induration was moſt
inevitable, his finall reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as irrecoverable, as Gods
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1027:99"/>
                        <hi>abſolute will</hi> (taking <hi>abſolute</hi> as

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame propoſition in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

that is, of every other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

was, when God did harden
him. Whoſoever ſhall, at any
time, become ſuch a man as
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> was then, is a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
from eternitie by Gods ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible

man is exempted from his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
hee may <hi>harden whom
hee will,</hi> after the ſame manner
that hee hardened <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>de facto</hi> hee doth not ſo
harden all the reprobates; that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1027:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is, hee <hi>reſerves</hi> them not alive
for examples to others, after the
ordinary time appointed for
their diſſolution. Nor doth he
tender ordinary meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to them, after the
doore of repentance is ſhut up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. God in his infinite
wiſdome hath many ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
incomprehenſible to
man; as, <hi>Why, of ſuch as are equall
offenders, one is more rigorouſly
dealt withall than another: Why,
of ſuch as are equally diſpoſed to
goodneſſe morall, one is called
before another.</hi> That thus to
diſpenſe of mercy and juſtice
in this life, doth argue no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie
or reſpect of perſons
with God, is an argument
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1027:100"/>
elſewhere to be inſiſted upon.</p>
                     <p>The point whereupon wee
are now to pitch, is this indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
<hi>[Men are not reprobated or

                        <note place="margin">Whether granting that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> was a reprobate from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, wee muſt grant withall that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> was a reprobate in his mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle age, youth, or infancie.</note> No

to make this inference good:
<hi>Pharaoh was abſolutely reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from eternitie,</hi> that is, <hi>His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
was immutable from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie;</hi>
Ergo, <hi>Pharaoh in his

To infer the conſequence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
no <hi>Medium</hi> more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
than this can poſſibly be
brought; <hi>Pharaoh from his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to his full age, was alwayes one
and the ſelfe ſame man; Et de eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1027:100"/>
impoſſibile eſt idem affirmari
&amp; negari.</hi> The <hi>conſequence</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
is no better than
this following: <hi>The Eclipſe of
the Moone was neceſſarie from the
beginning;</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Moone was
neceſſarily eclipſed in the firſt
quarter, or in the prime; Becauſe
the Moone being of an incorruptible
ſubſtance, hath continued one and
the ſame ſince the creation.</hi> But
unto this <hi>conſequence</hi> every <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>
could make replie, that the
proper and immediate ſubject
of the <hi>Eclipſe</hi> is not the <hi>Nature</hi>
or <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Moone</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
conſidered; but in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
oppoſition to the <hi>Sunne.</hi>
So that albeit this propoſition,
<hi>[The Moone ſhall be eclipſed]</hi> be
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1027:101"/>
true neceſſarily and from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting:
yet it is neceſſarie, yet
it is true onely of the <hi>Moone</hi> in
ſuch <hi>Diametrall oppoſition</hi> to the
<hi>Sunne,</hi> that the <hi>Earth</hi> may cover
it with her ſhadow as with a
mantle. Whenſoever it is in
ſuch <hi>oppoſition,</hi> it is neceſſarily
<hi>Eclipſed.</hi> Whenſoever it is not
in ſuch <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>Sunne,</hi> it
cannot poſſibly by courſe of
nature be <hi>Eclipſed.</hi> It is in like
manner true which wee have
often ſaid, that the proper and
immediate object of the eternall
decree, concerning induration
or reprobation, was not <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi>
individuall <hi>Entitie</hi> or <hi>eſſence:</hi>
but <hi>Pharaoh</hi> charged with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
meaſure of iniquitie, or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1027:101"/>
ſeparation from his God.
Granting then that <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
ſubſtance was one and the
ſame, as incorruptible as the
Moone: yet the degrees of his
declination from the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
rule of juſtice, or of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the fountaine of
mercy and goodneſſe, might be
more than are the degrees of the
<hi>Moones</hi> aberration or elongation
from the <hi>Sunne.</hi> Now the All-ſeeing
providence did more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
calculate each word,
each worke, each thought of
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and their oppoſition
to his goodneſſe, than <hi>Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
can doe the motions of the
<hi>Moone</hi> or <hi>Planets.</hi> And will he
not make his payment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1027:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to his calculation? So that
in one and the ſelfe ſame <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh</hi>
there might be more ſeverall
objects of the eternall decree,
than are minutes or ſcruples in
forty yeares motion of the
<hi>Moone.</hi> Not the leaſt varietie or
alteration in his courſe of life,
but had a proportionate conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of reward or puniſhment
allotted to it from all eternitie,
by the irreſiſtible decree. Unto
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> then having made up
the full meaſure of his iniquitie,
the irreſiſtible induration and
unrecoverable reprobation was,
by the virtue of this eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
altogether neceſſarie and
inevitable. But unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
before this meaſure of iniquity
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1027:105"/>
was made up, neither indurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor irrecoverable reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was ſo neceſſarie or inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
To thinke the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
rule of juſtice ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the ſame meaſure of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or reprobation unto
farre different meaſures of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
is deeper than the dregges
of Heatheniſme: it is a doctrine
which may not be vented where
any Chriſtian care is preſent.</p>
                     <p>The former reſemblance is
fully parallell to our reſolution
in all other points, ſave onely
in this, that the eternall decree
did not ſo neceſſary direct or
impell <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to make up the
full meaſure of his iniquitie, as
it doth direct and guide the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1027:106"/>
courſe of the <hi>Moone,</hi> till it come
in full and <hi>Diametrall oppoſition</hi>
to the <hi>Sunne.</hi> Therefore this <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude</hi>
will not follow, <hi>The</hi>
Moone, <hi>though not at this time
Eclipſed; yet holds that courſe
by the unchangeable decree, which
in time will bring it to be in</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrall
oppoſition <hi>to the</hi> Sunne,
<hi>and by conſequence to be</hi> Eclipſed:
<hi>So though</hi> Pharaoh <hi>in his infancie
was not reprobated or hardened by
Gods irreſiſtible will; yet was hee
by the eternall decree ordained to
ſuch reprobation or induration,
without poſſibilitie of altering his
courſe, or avoiding that</hi> oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>which his full age had unto
divine goodneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As every true convert or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1027:106"/>
perſon may ſay with
Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Ego non ſum ego;
I am become another man:</hi> ſo
might it be truly ſaid, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
ſenſe, <hi>Pharaoh ſometimes
was not Pharaoh.</hi> When he was a
childe, he ſpake as a childe, hee
thought as a childe. His mouth
was not opened againſt God:
his minde was not ſet on mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
To have ſeene the <hi>Iſraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
infants ſtrangled and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the mercileſſe flouds,
would more have affected his
heart, being young and tender,
than afterwards it did his
daughters. Nor was that cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which in his full age hee
practiſed, ſo contained in his
infancie, as poiſon in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1027:107"/>
egge. It did not grow up
by kinde or neceſſitie of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
temper; much leſſe was
it infuſed by Gods irreſiſtible
will: but acquired by cuſtome.
The ſeeds of it were ſowne by
his owne ſelfe will: ambitious
pride was the root: politick
jelouſie was the bud: tyrannie
and oppreſſion, the fruit. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it neceſſary by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
decree, that this corrupt
ſeed ſhould be ſowne: or being
ſowne, that it ſhould proſper
and bud; or that after the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
it ſhould ripen in malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
During all this progreſſe
from bad to worſe, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate

                     <p>It will be replied, that albeit

his ſalvation was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

a contradiction in Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

which drives the malady
from the outward parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

It removes the difficultie into a

may with ſafetie inferre, <hi>That
God did not decree by his irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

of ſalvation:</hi> becauſe, <hi>to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1027:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To ſave any man that hath not

To ſave ſuch as have

<hi>That albeit Gods will be moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable,

                     <p>For firſt, who can be longer

ſhall pleaſe him to conſider it?
That Gods purpoſe and will is

every object poſſible: that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie

as utterly to mortifie all luſts
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1027:119"/>

Untill then our mortification
be compleat and full, wee may
not preſume all poſſibilitie of

altogether ſo little, or truly

                     <p>But if to ſuch as finally periſh,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1027:120"/>
no true or reall poſſibilitie of
repentance during the whole

ſenſe can God be ſaid to allow
them a time of repentance?
How doth our Apoſtle ſay, that
<hi>the bountifulneſſe of God doth

Or if by his providence, they be
at any time brought to feare
hell, or the ſentence of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

Theſe and the like admonitions
frequent in the <hi>Prophets</hi> and the
<hi>Goſpell,</hi> ſuppoſe the men
whom they admoniſh to be as
yet not abſolutely reprobated,
but in a mutable ſtate; in a ſtate
ſubject to a mutable poſſibility
of becomming <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi>
or <hi>veſſels of mercy;</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
not altogether uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of that height of impietie
unto which onely the eternall

abſolute impoſſibility of
repentance, or of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Upon the true and reall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1027:122"/>
to all partakers of the word
and Sacraments, doth <hi>Saint
Peter</hi> ground that exhortation,
<hi>Brethren, give diligence to make
your calling and election ſure: for
if yee doe theſe things, yee ſhall
never fall. For ſo an entrance ſhall
be miniſtred unto you abundantly
into the everlaſting kingdome of
our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt:</hi>
2 <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. 10, 11. The end of
this exhortation was to bring
his Auditors unto that full
growth in grace and good
workes in this life, unto which
abſolute impoſſibilitie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie</hi>
is as irreſiſtibly aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by the eternall immutable
decree, as finall induration or
impoſſibilitie of repentance is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1027:122"/>
unto the full meaſure of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
                     <p>In what proportion theſe
two contrarie poſſibilities may
bee mixt in all or moſt men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they arrive at the point of
abſolute impoſſibilitie either
of <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> or of repentance;
wee leave it to every mans
private conſcience to gueſſe or
examine <hi>groſſo modo,</hi> and to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and eternall wiſdome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
and abſolutely to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
Unto whoſe examination
wee likewiſe referre it, whether
the impoſſibilitie of repentance
bee abſolute or equall in all that
periſh; or the impoſſibilitie of
<hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> be abſolute and equall
in all that are ſaved, at one time
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1027:123"/>
or other before they depart
hence: or whether the mutuall
poſſibilities of becomming <hi>veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of mercie</hi> or <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi>
may not, in ſome degree or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
continue their combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in ſome men untill the very
laſt act or exerciſe of mortall
life.</p>
                     <p>God alwayes ſpeakes, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his word preached or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
by his peculiar provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
as unto two: becauſe
every ſuch man hath ſomewhat
of the fleſh, and ſomewhat of
the ſpirit. For men as they are
the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are carnall;
and Gods words are all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
and alwayes leave ſome
print or touch behinde them,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1027:123"/>
whereby the ſoule, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or other, is preſently hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or preſently mollified; or
at leaſt diſpoſed to mollifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or induration. Continuall
or frequent calcitration againſt
the edge of this fierie ſword
breeds a <hi>Callum</hi> or compleat
<hi>hardneſſe;</hi> or (as the Apoſtle
ſpeakes) eit <hi>ſeares the conſcience.</hi>
But where it entereth, it cauſeth
the heart to melt, and makes
way for abundant mercie to
follow after.</p>
                     <p>Men as yet not comne to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
either of iniquitie, or of
growth of faith, are but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in Chriſt: and God ſpeaks
to his children, while they are
children, as wiſe and loving
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1027:124"/>
parents doe to theirs. Now if
a kinde loving father ſhould
ſay to one of his ſonnes, whom
hee had often taken playing the
wag, <hi>Thou ſhalt never have pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of what is mine;</hi> and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whom hee obſerved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his booke or other good
exerciſes well pleaſing to him,
<hi>Thou ſhalt bee mine heire:</hi> a man
of diſcretion would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue
his words (though affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately
uttered) in ſuch a
ſtrict ſenſe, as Lawyers would
doe the like clauſes of his laſt
Will and Teſtament; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
interpret his meaning thus;
that both continuing in their
contrary courſes, the one ſhould
bee diſinherited, and the other
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1027:124"/>
made heire. Though God by
an Angell or voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſhould ſpeak to one man
at his devotions, <hi>Thou ſhalt bee
ſaved;</hi> and to another at the
ſame time, <hi>Thou ſhalt be damned:</hi>
his ſpeeches to the one were to
bee taken as a good encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to goe forward in his
ſervice; his ſpeeches to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as a faire warning to deſiſt
from evill: and not as rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of immutabilitie in
either courſe, not as irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſentences of ſalvation or
damnation in reſpect of their
individuall perſons, but in
reſpect of their preſent qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
in whomſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
continued. <hi>Saul</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1027:125"/>
was a reprobate, or <hi>veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of wrath:</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
a Saint of God, a <hi>choſen
veſſell.</hi> It is univerſally true; <hi>The
ſeed of Abraham or Iſrael</hi> was
Gods people: yet it is true, that
the Jewes (though the ſeed of
<hi>Abraham</hi> and ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael)</hi>
were not partakers of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
made to <hi>Abraham.</hi> For they
became thoſe <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> thoſe
<hi>Philiſtines,</hi> thoſe <hi>Egyptians,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom Gods Prophets
had ſo often threatned his
judgements, whom they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
had excluded from Gods
temple. One principall cauſe
of their miſcarriage was their
ignorance of the <hi>Propheticall
language,</hi> whoſe threats or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1027:125"/>
are alwayes immediately
terminated not to mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but to their qualifications.
In their <hi>Dialect,</hi> only true <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi>
are true <hi>Jewes;</hi> every <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite</hi>
or <hi>backeſlider</hi> is a <hi>Gentile,</hi>
an <hi>Idumaean,</hi> a <hi>Philiſtine.</hi> None
to whom God hath ſpoken by
his Prophets, were by birth
ſuch obdurate <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> as had
no poſſibilitie of becomming
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> or true <hi>Confeſſors.</hi> The
children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not by
nature ſo undegenerate ſonnes
of <hi>Abraham</hi> as to be without all
poſſibility of becomming <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The true ſcantling of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
up-ſhot, <hi>[Hee will have
mercy upon whom hee will have
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1027:126"/>
mercie, and whom he will he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,]</hi>
rightly taken, reacheth
exactly to theſe points follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and no farther.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to admoniſh theſe <hi>Jewes</hi>
by Gods judgements on <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
not to ſtrive with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
not to neglect the warnings
of their peace, upon preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that they were <hi>veſſels</hi> of <hi>mercy</hi>
by inheritance: ſeeing they could
not pretend any privilege able
to exempt them from Gods ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
juriſdiction of <hi>hardning
whom he would,</hi> (as well of the
Sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as of the
Aegyptians,) of diverting thoſe
beames of glory which had
ſhined on them, upon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="243" facs="tcp:1027:126"/>
It ſecondly reacheth to us
Gentiles, and forewarns all and
every one of us, by Gods feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
judgements upon theſe
<hi>Jewes,</hi> not to tie the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of Gods decree for Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto any hereditarie, amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
nationall diſpoſition; but
to faſten one eye as ſtedfaſtly
upon <hi>Gods ſeveritie</hi> towards
the <hi>Jew,</hi> as we doe the other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>riches of his glorie and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
towards our ſelves. <hi>For if he
ſpared not the naturall branches, let
us take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not
us,</hi> who have beene hitherto the
flower and bud of the <hi>Gentiles.
Behold therefore the goodneſſe and
ſeveritie of God: on them which
fell, ſeveritie; but towards thee,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1027:127"/>
goodneſſe, if thou continue in his
goodneſſe: otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt
be cut off. And they alſo, if they
bide not ſtill in unbeleefe, ſhall bee
graffed in: for God is able to
graffe them in againe.</hi> The one
aſpect breedeth <hi>feare,</hi> the other
bringeth forth <hi>hope:</hi> and in the
right counterpoiſe of <hi>hope</hi> and
<hi>feare</hi> conſiſts that uprightneſſe
of minde and equabilitie of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
without which no
man can direct his courſe aright
unto the <hi>Land of promiſe.</hi> This
manifeſtation of Gods mercie
to one people or other, after a
kinde of equivalent viciſſitude
perpetuated from the like revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of his ſeveritie towards
others, was the object of that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1027:127"/>
profoundly divine contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
out of which our Apoſtle
awaking, as out of a pleaſant
ſleepe, cryes out, <hi>O the depth of
the riches both of the wiſdome and
knowledge of God! how unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
are his judgements, and his
wayes paſt finding out! Rom.</hi> 11.
33.</p>
                     <p>Hee that deſires to have his
heart filled with ſuch a meaſure
of joyfull admiration as will
ſeeke a vent in theſe or the like
unaffected ſerious exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
muſt feed his thoughts
with contemplation of <hi>divine
attributes;</hi> ſpecially with thoſe
of <hi>infinite duration</hi> or <hi>eternitie,</hi> of
<hi>infinite wiſdome,</hi> of <hi>infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
and <hi>love</hi> to man. In all
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1027:128"/>
which I have adventured to
tread a path for others to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
or follow upon triall; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſured of this, that without
the knowledge of theſe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
nothing can be ſaid to any
purpoſe in the particulars thus
farre proſecuted, or in the like to
bee proſecuted more at large,
when God ſhall grant leaſure
and opportunitie.</p>
                     <p>Theſe preſent diſquiſitions
(though ſeeming curious, as the
reſolution is truly difficult)
have a vulgar and immediate
uſe; yet not ſo vulgarly plaine
or common to all, as profitable
to every particular Chriſtian
not fully perſwaded in the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of his ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1027:128"/>
The ſpeciall aime of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
in this argument is,
firſt, to deterre my ſelfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
from all evill wayes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
but ſpecially from thoſe
peculiar and more dangerous
ſinnes, which make up the full
meaſure of iniquitie with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſpeed: Secondly, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
mine owne ſoule and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with it, to accompliſh
thoſe courſes unto which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutabilitie
or abſolute certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>election</hi> it ſelfe (which
muſt in order of nature and
time goe before our infallible
apprehenſions of it) is inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
predeſtinated by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and irreſiſtible decree.</p>
                     <p>Theſe exhortations are more
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1027:129"/>
fit for popular ſermons, than
ſuch points as hitherto have
beene diſcuſſed: whoſe diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
nevertheleſſe hath ſeemed
unto me very expedient, as well
for warranting the particular
uſes which I purpoſe (if God
permit) to make out of the
chapter following, as for giving
ſuch ſatisfaction to my beſt
friends as God hath enabled
me to give my ſelfe, concerning
the Apoſtles intent and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in this ninth chapter.</p>
                     <p>If what I have ſaid ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to fall into any mans
hands, which hath a <hi>logicall</hi>
head, and beares a friendly heart
to truth (though otherwiſe no
friend to mee:) yet I preſume
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1027:129"/>
hee will not bee ſo uncharitable
towards mee, as to ſuſpect I
have intended theſe premiſes to
inferre any ſuch diſtaſtfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
as theſe; <hi>That election
ſhould be ex fide aut operibus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſis,
for our faith or workes ſakes;
That any man ſhould be more than
meerly paſſive in his firſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
That the working of ſaving
grace might be reſiſted;</hi> or laſtly,
<hi>That in man before his converſion,
there ſhould bee any ſparke of free
will remaining, ſave onely to doe
evill</hi> Whoſoever will grant me
theſe two propoſitions, <hi>[That
the unregenerate man hath a true
freedome in doing evill,]</hi> and <hi>[The
eternall Creator a freedome in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good:]</hi> I will engage my
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1027:130"/>
ſelfe to give him full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that no difference betwixt
<hi>Reformed Churches</hi> concerning
<hi>Predestination</hi> or <hi>Reprobation,</hi> is
more than verball, or hath any
other foundation beſides the
ambiguitie of unexplicated
termes. The errors on all ſides
grow onely from pardonable
miſtakings, not ſo much of
truth it ſelfe, as of her proper
ſeat or place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

<hi>Of his owne will he begat us with
the word of truth, that wee ſhould
be Primitiae, the firſt fruits of his
creatures;</hi> that as we conſecrate
all his <hi>creatures</hi> to him in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1027:138"/>
and religious uſe of them:
ſo as the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of all, wee
ſhould principally conſecrate
our ſelves to his ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
                  <p>Now there were three pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>firſt fruits</hi> appointed
by God to the Jewes. The firſt
were <hi>Primitiae ſpicarum, The
firſt fruits of their eares of corne:</hi>
and this was only about <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
The ſecond were <hi>Primitiae pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
the firſt fruits of loaves,</hi> after
the corne was converted to that
uſe: and this, though it were
not ſo ſoone, yet it was early
too, about <hi>Whitſuntide.</hi> The
third were <hi>Primitiae frugum,</hi> of
all <hi>their latter fruits</hi> in generall;
and this was very late in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne,</hi>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:1027:139"/>
in the <hi>Fall,</hi> about <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
In the two firſt of theſe
three, in thoſe that were offered
<hi>early,</hi> God had his part; he had
his part in the <hi>corne,</hi> and in the
<hi>loaves:</hi> but in the <hi>latter fruits</hi>
he had no portion. Offer thy
ſelfe to God then, as <hi>Primitias
ſpicarum,</hi> whether thou gleaneſt
in the world, or bindeſt up by
whole ſheaves; whether thine
increaſe be by little and little,
or thou be rich at once, by the
devolution of a rich inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and patrimony unto thee.
Offer this in an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that this proceeds from
the treaſure of his goodneſſe,
and not from thine induſtrie.
And offer thy ſelfe againe as
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1027:139"/>
                     <hi>Primitias panum,</hi> when: thou
haſt kneaded up riches, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and favour, in a ſetled and
eſtabliſhed fortune: offer that
to God in an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that hee can ſcatter and
moulder away that eſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
how ſafe ſoever it ſeemes
to be ſetled. Offer at thy <hi>Eaſter,</hi>
when ſoever thou haſt any <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
any ſenſe of raiſing thy
ſoule from the ſhadow of
death: offer thy confeſſion to
God, that it is the <hi>ſun-ſhine of his
grace,</hi> and not of <hi>thy moralitie.</hi>
Offer at thy <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> when ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>the holy Ghoſt deſcends</hi>
upon thee <hi>in a ſierie tongue,</hi> that
thou feedeſt thy ſelfe melted by
the powerfull preaching of the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1027:140"/>
word: offer thy confeſſion then,
that this is the <hi>proceeding of his
grace,</hi> and not <hi>the diſpoſition, or
concurrence, or tenderneſſe of thy
nature.</hi> For if thou deferre thine
offering till <hi>September,</hi> till thy
<hi>Fall,</hi> till thy <hi>winter,</hi> till thy <hi>death;</hi>
howſoever thoſe may be <hi>thy
firſt-fruits,</hi> becauſe they be the
<hi>firſt</hi> that ever thou gaveſt: yet
they are not ſuch as are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God; God hath no porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them if they come ſo late.</p>
                  <p>Offer thy ſelfe <hi>now;</hi> nay doe
but offer <hi>to thy ſelfe now;</hi> that is
but an eaſie requeſt; and yet
there is no more asked. <hi>Viximus
mundo; vivamus reliquum nobis
ipſis:</hi> Thus long we have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>the world;</hi> let us ſerve <hi>our

Hadſt thou rather be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

Thy buſineſſe is to <hi>Remember:</hi>
ſtay not for thy laſt ſickneſſe,
which may be a <hi>Lethargie,</hi> in

is to <hi>Remember,</hi> and thy time

                     <hi>Remember</hi> then, and <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Now; Nunc in die, Now

die velociter exaudiet, in any
day hee will heare thee quickly:</hi>
but ſtill it is <hi>Opus diei, a worke
of the day,</hi> to call upon God.
For in the <hi>Night,</hi> our <hi>laſt Night,</hi>
theſe thoughts that fall upon
us, are rather <hi>Dreames</hi> than <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrings:</hi>
upon our death-bed
wee rather dreame that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
than repent indeed. To
him that travels by <hi>Night,</hi> a
buſh ſeemes a horſe, and a horſe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1027:141"/>
ſeemes a man, and a man ſeemes
a ſpirit; nothing hath its proper
ſhape: to him that repents by
<hi>Night,</hi> on his <hi>death-bed,</hi> neither
his owne time nor the mercies
of God have their true propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>This night they ſhall fetch
away thy ſoule,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to
the ſecure man: but hee neither
tels him who they be that ſhall
<hi>fetch it away,</hi> nor whither they
ſhall carry it. Hee hath no
<hi>light</hi> but <hi>lightning,</hi> a ſudden
<hi>flaſh</hi> of horrour: and ſo is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
into the fire which hath
<hi>no light. Nunquid Deus paravit
nobis ignem iſtum? Non nobis,
ſed Diabolo &amp; Angelis ejus.</hi> And
yet we who are <hi>veſſels ſo broken,
that there is not a ſheard left to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1027:142"/>
fetch water at the pit,</hi> (as the
<hi>Prophet</hi> expreſſeth an irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ruine,) no meanes in our
ſelves to derive one drop of the
blood of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> upon us,
no meanes to wring out one
teare of true contrition from us,
have plunged our ſelves into
<hi>this dark, this everlaſting fire</hi>
which was not prepared for us.
A wretched covetouſneſſe to be
intruders upon the devill! a
wofull ambition to be uſurpers
upon damnation! God did not
make that fire for us, much leſſe
did hee make us for that fire:
(make us to damne us? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid:)
but yet though it were
not made for us at firſt, now it
belongs to us; the judgement
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1027:142"/>
takes hold of us. <hi>Whoſoever
beleeveth not, is already condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>
there the fire belongeth to
our <hi>infidelitie,</hi> and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
takes hold of us. <hi>Ite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledicti;
you have not fed mee, nor
cloathed mee, nor harboured mee,
therefore goe yee curſed:</hi> then that
fire takes hold of our <hi>omiſſion</hi> of
neceſſarie duties and good
workes. Whats our remedy
now? why ſtill this is the way
of Gods juſtice, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<hi>ut ſententia lata ſit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valida,</hi>
That if hee publiſh his
judgement, his judgement is
not executed. The judgements
of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> were
irrevocable: but the judgements
of God, if they be given and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1027:143"/>
publiſhed, are not executed. The
<hi>Ninivites</hi> had periſhed, if the
ſentence of their deſtruction
had not beene given: and the
ſentence preſerved them by
bringing them to repentance.
So in this cloud of <hi>Ite maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti,</hi>
wee may ſee <hi>Day-breake,</hi> and
diſcerne beames of <hi>Sunning light</hi>
in this judgement of <hi>Eternall
darkneſſe.</hi> If the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods judgements bring
us to <hi>Remember him,</hi> it is but a
darke and ſtormie <hi>Day:</hi> but yet
ſpirituall affliction and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of Gods anger, is
one <hi>Day</hi> wherein wee may <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi>
God. And this is <hi>Copio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa
redemptio,</hi> the overflowing
mercy of God, that hee affords
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1027:143"/>
us <hi>many dayes</hi> to <hi>remember</hi> him
in: for it is not <hi>in die,</hi> but <hi>in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Remembring</hi> which we
intend, is an inchoation, yea it
is a great ſtep into our <hi>Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>Regeneration,</hi> whereby
wee are <hi>New Creatures:</hi> and
therefore wee may well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as many <hi>dayes</hi> in this <hi>New
creation,</hi> as were in the firſt <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the world.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt day was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Light:</hi> and our firſt day
is the <hi>knowledge</hi> of him who
ſayes of him ſelfe, <hi>Ego ſum Lux
mundi, I am the light of the world;</hi>
and of whom Saint <hi>John</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
<hi>Erat Lux vera, Hee was the
true Light which lighteth every
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1027:144"/>
man that commeth into the world.</hi>
This is then our firſt day, The
<hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>knowledge</hi> the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Goſpell of <hi>Chriſt
Ieſus.</hi> Now God made <hi>Light</hi>
firſt, <hi>ut operaretur in Luce,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Saint Auguſtine, that hee might
worke in the light,</hi> in producing
other creatures: not that God
needed <hi>Light</hi> to worke by, but
for our example. God hath
ſhed the beames of the <hi>light of
his Goſpell,</hi> firſt upon us in our
<hi>Baptiſme,</hi> that wee might have
that <hi>Light</hi> to worke by, and to
produce our other Creatures;
and that in every enterpriſe wee
might examine our ſelves, our
conſciences, whether we could
not be better content, that that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1027:144"/>
                     <hi>Light</hi> went out, or were <hi>Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi>
than the light of our owne
glory: whether wee had not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that the <hi>Goſpell</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
ſuffered a little, than our
owne ends and preferments.</p>
                  <p>God made <hi>Light</hi> firſt, that
hee might make his other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
by the light, (ſaith <hi>Saint
Auguſtine:)</hi> and hee made that
firſt too, <hi>ut cernerentur quae fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Saint Ambroſe) that
theſe creatures might ſee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
for <hi>fruſtrà eſſent ſi non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derentur,</hi>
ſaith that <hi>Father,</hi> It
had been to no purpoſe for God
to have made creatures, if hee
had not made <hi>Light,</hi> that they
might ſee one another, and ſo
glorifie him. God hath given
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1027:145"/>
us this <hi>Light</hi> of the Goſpell too,
that the world might ſee our
actions by this <hi>Light.</hi> For the
nobleſt Creatures of Princes,
and the nobleſt actions of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Warre,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and
<hi>Treaties,</hi> and all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and actions, which move
in the lower <hi>Spheares, Fruſtra

they will come to nothing,
they are nothing, if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
not this <hi>Light,</hi> if there
appeare not to the world a
true <hi>Zeale</hi> of the preſervation
of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and that wee
doe not in any thing <hi>erube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcere

of making and declaring
the love of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> to be our

principall end in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Now when God had made
<hi>Light,</hi> and had made it to theſe
purpoſes, <hi>Hee ſaw that the light
was good,</hi> ſayes <hi>Moſes.</hi> This <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
implyes a conſideration, a

That a religion, a forme of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing

Wee muſt <hi>ſee this light;</hi>
and then the <hi>Seeing that it is
good</hi> implyes the accepting of
ſuch a religion as is <hi>ſimply good</hi>
in it ſelfe; not good for eaſe or

or profit, not good for the

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:1027:146"/>
collaterall or by-reſpects; but
ſimply, abſolutely, and in it

                  <p>
                     <hi>And when God ſaw this light

with the true Religion. But
God ſevered them otherwiſe
than ſo too: hee ſevered them
(as wee ſay in the Schooles)
<hi>Non tanquam duo poſitiva,</hi> that
<hi>Light</hi> ſhould have a being here,
and <hi>Darkneſſe</hi> a being there;
but <hi>tanquam Poſitivum &amp; priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum,</hi>
that <hi>Light</hi> ſhould have

utterly aboliſhed. And
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1027:146"/>
this ſevering muſt hold in the
<hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>the Goſpell</hi> too; not
ſo ſevered as here ſhall be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and there a Maſſe: but
that the true religion be really
profeſſed, and corrupt Religion
be utterly aboliſhed. And <hi>then</hi>
and not till then it was <hi>a Day,</hi>
(ſayes <hi>Moſes.)</hi> And ſince God
hath given us <hi>This day, The light
of the Goſpell,</hi> to theſe uſes, to

to bee good, and that it is

implicitly; but ſo that it is able
to abide any triall that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1027:147"/>
Fathers and Councels,</hi>
ſince it is ſo ſevered, as that

&amp;c.</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes of other
dayes of Gods inſtitution) hee
that will not throw downe
himſelfe before God <hi>on this day,</hi>
in humble thanks that wee have
it, and in humble prayer that
wee may ſtill have it: hee does
not <hi>remember God in his firſt day;</hi>
he doth not conſider how great
a bleſſing <hi>the light, the profeſſion
of the Goſpell</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>To make ſhorter <hi>dayes</hi> of the
reſt (for we muſt paſſe through
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1027:147"/>
all the dayes in a few minutes:)
God in the <hi>ſecond day made the
firmament to divide betweene the
waters above, and the waters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi>
And this <hi>firmament</hi> in man
is <hi>Terminus cognoſcibilium, The
limit of thoſe things</hi> which God
hath given a man meanes and
faculties to <hi>conceive</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi>

our eyes with a <hi>ſtarrie firmament</hi>
too, with the <hi>knowledge</hi> of thoſe
things <hi>quae ubique, quae ſemper,</hi>
which thoſe <hi>ſtarres</hi> whom hee
hath kindled in his <hi>Church, The
Fathers and the Doctors</hi> have
ever from the beginning propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
as things neceſſarie for the
ſalvation of our <hi>ſoules.</hi> As for
the <hi>eternall decrees of God,</hi> and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1027:148"/>
                     <hi>his unrevealed will and myſteries,</hi>
and <hi>the knottie and inexplicable
perplexities of the Schooles,</hi> they
are <hi>waters above the firmament.</hi>
Here <hi>Paul plants,</hi> here <hi>Apollo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
here God raiſeth up men to
convey to us the dew of his
<hi>Grace,</hi> by <hi>waters under the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
by viſible meanes, by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi>
and by the <hi>Word</hi> ſo
preached and ſo explicated, as
it hath beene unanimly and
conſtantly from the beginning
of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>this ſecond day</hi>
is conſummated and perfected
in the <hi>third:</hi> for in the <hi>third day,</hi>
God came to that, <hi>Congregentur
Aquae, Let the waters be gathered
together into one place.</hi> God <hi>hath
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1027:148"/>
gathered all the waters of life into
one place;</hi> all the doctrines ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
for the life to come into
the <hi>holy Catholick Church.</hi> And
in this <hi>third day,</hi> God came to
his <hi>Producat terra,</hi> there here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Earth</hi> all herbs and fruits ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
for mans food ſhould
bee produced: that here in the
<hi>viſible Church</hi> ſhould bee all
things neceſſarie for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

therefore in this <hi>third day</hi> God
repeats twiſe that teſtimonie,
<hi>Vidit quod eſſet bonum, Hee ſaw
that it was good,</hi> that all herbs
and trees ſhould bee produced
that bee ſeed; all doctrines that
are to bee ſeminall to be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
and propagated, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:1027:149"/>
continued to the end, ſhould be
taught in the Church: But for
ſuch doctrines as were but to

men, or to ſerve the turne of
great men for a time, for colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
doctrines, temporarie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlinearie,
marginall doctrines,
which belong not to the bodie

things neceſſarie to ſalvation:
for theſe, there is no <hi>Vidit quod

are good.</hi> Now, <hi>ſi in diebus iſtis,</hi>
if in theſe dayes, when God
gives thee a <hi>Firmament,</hi> a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:1027:150"/>
                     <hi>Remember in this day</hi> too, that

an uncomely dejection, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditie,

ſuffer thy retiring of thy ſelfe
from the world, to degenerate
into a contempt and deſpiſing

of thine owne perfections,
thine owne puritie and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie

                  <p>Let the <hi>ſixt day,</hi> on which

                  <p>And let the <hi>Sabbath remember

It is true, <hi>the market is open till

for ſinne, theſe are not

And therefore whilſt thou haſt

to defeat other mens purpoſes
by evill meanes, <hi>Remember.</hi> But
<hi>whom? Creatorem:</hi> for wee have

                  <p>

The <hi>Memorie</hi> reaches farre: but

And what was done before the

meanes to conceive or to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
any of Gods actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that. For when men will
ſpeake of <hi>Decrees of Reprobation,

This is to put a preface before

                     <note place="margin">Iohn 7. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>The
Holy Ghoſt was not yet</hi> given;
<hi>becauſe that Jeſus was not yet
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:1027:157"/>
glorified;</hi> though the ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeeme neceſſary for the
clearing of the ſenſe, yet the
word <hi>Given</hi> is not in the text:
but it is ſimply <hi>Spiritus ſanctus
non erat, the holy Ghoſt was not.
Non erat antequam operaretur,</hi>
ſaies Saint <hi>Auguſtine: Hee was
not</hi> to this intendment and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
hee was not manifeſted
nor declared to us, till hee
wrought in us. And ſo wee ſay
of God in generall, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in any one perſon, wee
cannot <hi>remember</hi> him but in
producing of his workes, in
<hi>the Creation.</hi> Thy <hi>Bible</hi> begins
there, thy <hi>Creed</hi> begins there;
and thou haſt a good and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>memorie,</hi> if thou <hi>remember</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:1027:158"/>
all that is preſentd unto thee by
thoſe wayes: and thoſe wayes
goe no higher than <hi>the Creator.
Remember the Creator</hi> then; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou canſt <hi>Remember</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beyond him.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Remember</hi> the Creator
ſo too, that thou maiſt ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nothing on this ſide him:
that ſo <hi>neither height, nor depth,
nor any other Creature may ſeparate</hi>
thee from God; not onely <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
thee finally, but not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard</hi>
thee any other wayes; but
as the love of the <hi>Creature</hi> may
lead thee to <hi>the Creator.</hi> Wee
ſee faire ſhipping in the River:
but all their uſe were gone, if the
River led not into the Sea. Wee
ſee men fraughted with honour
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:1027:158"/>
and riches: but all their uſe is
gone, if they lead them not to
the honour and glory of the
<hi>Creator.</hi> And therefore ſaies the
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Let them that ſuffer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their ſoules to God as to a
faithfull Creator.</hi> Hee had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
purpoſes upon us in our
<hi>Creation;</hi> and if hee bring us
back againe to as good a ſtate as
wee had in our <hi>Creation,</hi> wee
enjoy the very <hi>Redemption</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>This is then the true contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting:
and this is the true exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this facultie of <hi>the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,</hi>
to <hi>Remember the Creator,</hi>
and ſtay there, becauſe there is
no proſpect farther: and to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Creator,</hi> and get ſo
farre, becauſe there is no ſafe
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1027:159"/>
footing, nor relying upon any
creature. <hi>Remember then the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Remember thy Creator.</hi> If
thou deſire wiſdome; <hi>Quis pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentior
Sapientia?</hi> where wilt
thou ſeeke it, but of him who
is <hi>Wiſdome</hi> it ſelfe? If thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
profit, <hi>Quis utilior bono?</hi>
Who can profit thee more than
<hi>Goodneſſe</hi> it ſelfe? And if thou
wouldeſt <hi>Remember</hi> that which
is neereſt unto thee; <hi>Quis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctior
Creatore?</hi> Who is ſo neer
thee, as hee that made thee, and
gave thee thy being? What pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſoever thy Parents or thy
Prince have to make thee great:
how, had all theſe purpoſes
beene fruſtrated, if God had not
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:1027:159"/>
made thee before? Thy very
<hi>Being</hi> is the greateſt degree. As
in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> how great a
number ſoever a man expreſſe
in many figures; yet when all
is done, and that wee begin to
reckon and name this number,
the firſt figure of all is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
of all: So what degrees or
titles ſoever a man hath in this
world, the greateſt of all is the
firſt of all; that hee had a <hi>being</hi>
by Creation: for the diſtance of
<hi>Nothing</hi> to a little is the beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of this life. And therefore
<hi>Remember thy Creator,</hi> as by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, hee hath done more
for thee than all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Remember</hi> ſo too, with
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:1027:160"/>
this conſideration, that ſince
thou haſt a <hi>Creator,</hi> thou waſt
once <hi>Nothing:</hi> Hee made thee,
hee gave thee a <hi>Being:</hi> theres
matter of <hi>Exaltation.</hi> He made
thee <hi>ex nihile,</hi> thou waſt leſſe
before than a worme; theres
matter of <hi>Humiliation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But hee did not make thee
<hi>Ad nihilum,</hi> to returne to <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
againe: theres matter of
<hi>Studie</hi> and <hi>Conſideration,</hi> how
to make thine immortalitie
profitable unto thee. For it is
a deadly immortalitie, if thou
be immortall onely for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
torments.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Being</hi> which wee have
from God ſhall not returne to
<hi>Nothing:</hi> nor that <hi>Being</hi> which
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:1027:160"/>
wee have from men neither. As
Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Image
of God</hi> imprinted indelibly in
mans ſoule, <hi>Vri poteſt</hi> in <hi>Gehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
non exuri;</hi> That ſoule which
deſcends to Hell, carries the
Image of God thither too, and
that can never be burnt out in
Hell: So thoſe Images, thoſe
impreſſions which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from <hi>Men,</hi> from <hi>Nature,</hi>
from the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> of the
<hi>Lawyer,</hi> the <hi>Image of the Lord,</hi>
the <hi>Image of the Biſhop,</hi> may all
burne in Hell; but they cannot
be burnt out: not onely, not
thoſe ſoules, but not thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
ſhall returne to <hi>Nothing;</hi>
but our condemnation ſhall be
everlaſtingly aggravated, for
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:1027:161"/>
the ill uſe of theſe offices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remember</hi> therefore <hi>thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
who, as he made thee of <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
ſhall hold thee ſtill to <hi>his
glorie,</hi> though <hi>to thy confuſion</hi> in
a ſtate capable of his heavieſt
judgements. For the court of
God is not like other courts,
that after a ſurfet of pleaſure, of
greatneſſe, a man may retire:
after a ſurfet of ſinne, there is no
ſuch retiring, as a diſſolution of
the ſoule to <hi>nothing.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>remember, that he made thee;</hi>
thou waſt <hi>nothing:</hi> and <hi>what hee
made thee;</hi> thou canſt not be <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
againe.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up this circle, and to
returne to the beginning; to
excite the particular facultie of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:1027:161"/>
the <hi>memorie.</hi> As wee <hi>remember</hi>
God: ſo for his ſake, and for
him, let us <hi>remember</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In my long abſence and
farre diſtance <hi>remember mee,</hi> as I
<hi>ſhall doe you,</hi> in the eares of God:
to whom the fartheſt <hi>Eaſt</hi> and
the farther <hi>Weſt</hi> are but as the
right and left eare in one of us.
Wee heare with both eares at
once; and hee heares in both
places at once. <hi>Remember</hi> mee;
not my abilities. For when I
conſider my Apoſtleſhip to
you, that I was ſent to you, I am
in Saint <hi>Pauls Quorum; Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
ego minimus;</hi> I am the leaſt
of them that have beene ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you: and when I conſider
mine infirmities, (I know I
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:1027:162"/>
may juſtly lay a heavier name
upon them) I know, I am in his
other <hi>Quorum, Quorum ego ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus;</hi>
ſent to ſave ſinners, <hi>of
whom I am the chiefeſt.</hi> But yet
<hi>remember</hi> my labours, my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
at leaſt my deſires to doe
that great ſervice of making
ſure your ſalvation: and I ſhall
<hi>remember</hi> your religious cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
in hearing the Word,
and your Chriſtian-like reſpect
to thoſe who bring this Word
unto you; and of me in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
ſo farre above my merit.
And ſo as your eyes that ſtay
here, and mine that muſt bee far
off, for all that diſtance, ſhall
meet every morning in looking
upon the ſame <hi>Sunne,</hi> and meet
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1027:162"/>
every night in looking upon
the ſame <hi>Moone:</hi> ſo our hearts
may meet morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
in that God, who ſees and
heares alike at all diſtances.
That you may come up to him
in your prayers on my behalfe,
that I (if I may bee of any uſe
for his glorie and your edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this place) may be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to you againe in this place:
and I may come up to him in
my prayers on your behalfe,
that what <hi>Paul</hi> ſoever <hi>ſhall plant</hi>
here, and what <hi>Apollo</hi> ſoever
<hi>ſhall water</hi> here, <hi>he himſelfe</hi> will
bee pleaſed <hi>to give the increaſe.</hi>
And that if I never meet you,
till by ſeverall wayes wee have
met in the gates of death; that
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1027:163"/>
within the gates of heaven I
may meet you all, and there ſay
to <hi>my Saviour</hi> and <hi>your Saviour,</hi>
that which he ſaid to <hi>his Father</hi>
and <hi>our Father; Of thoſe whom
thou gaveſt me I have not loſt one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remember</hi> me thus, you that
ſtay in this <hi>kingdome of peace,</hi>
where no ſword is drawne but
the <hi>ſword of juſtice:</hi> as I ſhall
<hi>remember</hi> you in thoſe <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,</hi>
where <hi>Ambition</hi> on the
one ſide, and a <hi>neceſſarie defence
of religion</hi> againſt imminent
perſecution on the other ſide,
hath drawne many ſwords.
And <hi>Chriſt Jeſus remember</hi> us
all in his <hi>kingdome,</hi> to which
though wee muſt ſaile through
a ſea, yet it is the ſea of his
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:1027:163"/>
bloud, in which never ſoule ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
ſhipwrack. Though we
muſt bee blowne with ſtrong
windes, with vehement ſighes
and groans for our ſinnes: yet
it is the Spirit of God that
blowes all that winde in us, and
ſhall blow away all contrarie
windes of diffidence in his
mercy. It is that <hi>kingdome,</hi> where
we ſhall all be ſouldiers, but of
one armie, the <hi>Lord of hoſts;</hi> and
all children of one <hi>Quire,</hi> the
<hi>God of harmonie and conſent;</hi>
where all <hi>clients</hi> ſhall retaine
but <hi>one Advocate, the Advocate</hi>
of us all, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and yet
every <hi>client</hi> receive a ſentence
on his ſide; not onely a <hi>verdict</hi>
of <hi>not-guiltie,</hi> a non-imputation
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1027:164"/>
of ſinne; but a <hi>Venite Benedicti,</hi>
a reall participation of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
<hi>crowne of glorie:</hi> where
there ſhall bee no difference in
affection nor in voice, but wee
ſhall all agree as fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
in our <hi>Hallelu-jah</hi> and
our <hi>Gloria in excelſis,</hi> as God the
Father, God the Sonne, and
God the holy Ghoſt agreed in
their <hi>Faciamus Hominem;</hi> wee
ſhall praiſe the whole <hi>Trinitie</hi>
as unanimly, as the <hi>Trinitie</hi>
concurr'd in making us. To
end, it is the <hi>kingdome</hi> where
we ſhall end, and yet begin but
then; where we ſhall have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
reſt, and yet never grow
lazie; where wee ſhall have
more ſtrength, and no enemie;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:1027:164"/>
where wee ſhall live, and never
die; where we ſhall meet, and
never part; but here
we muſt.</p>
