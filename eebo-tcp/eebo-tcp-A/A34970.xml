            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
SIR MARC-ALBERT
D'OGNATE KNIGHT,
Counsellour to his Catholick
Majesty, Commissary for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevving
of Magistrats in the
Province of Flanders, President
of the Chamber of Commerce
and Navigation, and Envoyé
from the King of Spain to his
Majesty of Great Brittain.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>It had been to be vvished that
vve might have concealed from
Strangers the Stains of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that they might remain
ignorant that neither Fidelity to
our Prince, nor Charity to our
fellovv-Subjects can secure Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
<pb facs="tcp:49053:3"/>
from the vvorst effects of
vvar in the midst of Peace:
such is the Virulence of one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Party: vvho though
they enioy their lives by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited
Pardon of their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
vvill never pardon us for
our Loyalty.</p>
            <p>In most Countreyes of Europe
there are agitated dayly Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and Controversies about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and in Books on each side
ordinarily some sharpness is
mingled. But in England our
Lott must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, vve are
forced to contend vvith Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
vvhose minds by our late
Tumults are rendred savage
and implacable. They to spite
us, resume a Nevv vvar
<pb facs="tcp:49053:3"/>
against Heaven it self, deriding
and blaspheming the Saints in
Glory. And against Gods
Church on earth they frame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
never heard of before,
making her greatest Vertues passe
for the directly opposite greatest
Crimes. The most Saintly Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of Persons among us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
to God and entirely
subiect to Authority are disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cefully
stiled Fanaticism: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
vve vvill not be chusers
each one of his ovvn Faith, vve
are accused to have an Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick
vvay of Religion: vvee
exercise Charity to our Freinds
Deceased, and that is called an
Impediment of Deuotion: vve
teach (as our Saviour did) that
<pb facs="tcp:49053:4"/>
the vvay to Heaven is strait,
and consequently that to enter
into it vve must practise Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Sins, Pennances, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
Praying, Fasting,
Alms-giving &amp;c. and for this
vve are charged to be Hinderers
of Piety and a Good Life: Our
acknovvledging an Authority
in Gods Church to end Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
is called an effectuall
Mean to multiply them: If out of
Compassion to persons guilty of
Schism, and out of a tender love
to Vnity any one among us
strains his vvitts to persvvade
our Adversaries that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
betvveen us is not so vast
as some of them seem vvilling to
conceive, his recompense must
<pb facs="tcp:49053:4"/>
be contemptuous revilings: No
Pagans or Cannibals must be
esteemed so blindly, so horribly
I dolatrous, No Quakers so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously
Frantick, No Fifth-Monarchists
so dangerous both
to Church and State.</p>
            <p>These enormous Excesses
vvich have been lately exposed
to the vvorld in a Stile partly
Burlesque and partly Tragicall
vvere never heard of in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nation but England, and
only of late in England, and
I hope, for the credit of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are not taken notice of by
many Strangers living here, and
thereby less in danger to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished abroad.
But from you,
SIR, they could not be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb facs="tcp:49053:5"/>
since your zeal to Catholick
Religion makes you inquisitive
into all things that concern it,
and your perfect knovvledge in
our Language renders all our
BOOKS as intelligible to you, as
if vvritten in your ovvn. My
hope novv is that you being vvell
acquainted vvith the present
Temper of our Nation, vvill
judge aright, that a Book vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in such a Stile, and vvholly
composed of malignant Passions
and nevv-invented Calumnies
against Gods Church vvas only
the private Design of a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Brain on purpose to feed
the exulcerated minds of a, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent
Party among us, and
consequently not to be imputed
<pb facs="tcp:49053:5"/>
to any other besides. The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
you bear to our Nation,
from vvhich you are not quite,
even in blood, a Stranger,
encourages mee to expect thus
much iustice from you.</p>
            <p>As for my self, I being,
I hope, not the only person, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the defence of Truth
and Innocence against Malice
and Calumny, am desirous
to address to you this my Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver,
as a Testimony of my
gratefull resentment of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and honour you have been
pleased to conferr generously on
mee, in allovving mee a share
in your freindship: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
effects vvhereof have
<pb facs="tcp:49053:6"/>
likevvise been extended to an
afflicted Community abroad,
recommended by mee to your
Protection.</p>
            <p>But besides this, a far
greater obligation both my self
and all loyall English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
have to honour you for
your constant respect, duty,

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>THE report is very current that
Doctour Stillingfleet wonders,
and even complains that, having
made a generall formall <hi>Challenge to
Catholicks to come openly into the field
against him</hi> being ready with weapons
in his hand, he cannot yet have the
contentment to give further proof of
his Skill and courage against them. But
surely it is not for the Doctors credit
to make such a Complaint, when
the world knows how all passages
into <hi>the field</hi> are stoppd and even wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up, I will not say, by himself,
yet at least by his Partizans; how
<hi>Stationers</hi> apprehend greater danger in
publishing <hi>Answers</hi> to his <hi>Book,</hi> then
any <hi>Books</hi> of Sedition or <hi>Treason;</hi> and
how during the space of a few months
since his last <hi>Book</hi> saw the light,
<hi>Searches</hi> into <hi>Presses</hi> have been more
sollicitously exact, and more frequent
dayly and hourly, then they have
<pb facs="tcp:49053:8"/>
been all the years taken together since
his <hi>Majesties Restauration, Inquisitors</hi>
searching into every hole, turning
over every small paper, and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
examining both Maisters and
Servants whether any thing has been
written against <hi>Doctour Stillingfleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How securely now may the Doctor
triumph, and as oft as he pleases, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
his <hi>Challenges</hi> of <hi>Defiance</hi> against
<hi>Catholick Adversaries</hi> so bound hand
and foot: and at how cheap a rate has
he gotten (from Tradesmen and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips)
immortall honour by a <hi>Book,</hi>
then which <hi>England</hi> never to this day
saw any one, pretending to Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy,
more harmless to the <hi>Church</hi>
he professes to oppose, nor more
destructive to the <hi>Church</hi> he professes
to defend. Now whether this be
not a true <hi>Character</hi> of it, I do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and confidently stand to the
judgment of any learned and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<hi>Protestant Reader</hi> who shall
think fit to peruse the following <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
but that the <hi>Doctor</hi> has used a
<pb facs="tcp:49053:8"/>
wonderfull dexterity in mannaging
this Controversy: For though his
<hi>Book</hi> proves in effect exceeding harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to the common <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi>
and though all the Weapons
made use of by him against the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith</hi> really want both edges
and points of Sufficient sharpnes and
strength to make an entrance into the
<hi>Rock</hi> on which our <hi>Saviour</hi> has built
his <hi>Church,</hi> yet they pierce into the
very bowells of the Persons, fortunes
and condition of English Catholicks,
whose destruction he seems to design.
And on the other side, though the
same weapons do draw out the very
<hi>heart-blood</hi> of the <hi>English Church,</hi> yet
he pretends all the way, and seems
to be acknowledged by them a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
of its cause, and not to intend the
least harm to the <hi>Prelats</hi> and <hi>Subiects</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>Cicero was wont to say, that he
thought any one Roman Augur could
not without Smiling look upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Augur, considering what large
preferments and honours they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
by befooling the whole <hi>Roman
<pb facs="tcp:49053:9"/>
Common-weale</hi> with their ridiculous
fopperies. The like smile of secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
passes between the <hi>Doctor</hi>
and his ancient <hi>Brethren.</hi> For a great
pleasure it must needs be to them to
see him in his new dress, in his <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice</hi>
and <hi>Scarlet-Hood,</hi> so Canonically
defending out of the Pulpitt the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> or brandishing his Sword
against her Adversaries in printed Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes;
but so defending it, as not to
do the least harm to the <hi>old cause:</hi> Not
one word falls from his tongue or
pen to give his now Prelats warning
of their danger from Presbyterians,
Independents, Latitudinarians and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sects, though all these conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
against them had held their Necks
so many years of late under their
feet.</p>
            <p>But nothing can be more ridiculous
to those Sectaries (nor truly more
deserving detestation from all loyall
Subiects) then to see the same <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
quondam</hi> friend <hi>Doctour Stillingfleet</hi>
zealously pretending a care of the
Safety of his <hi>Majesty</hi> and the <hi>State</hi>
against the seditious writings and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
<pb facs="tcp:49053:9"/>
of ill-principled Subiects, and
at the same time, as if he thought the
world by vertue of the <hi>Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion</hi>
had quite forgott the last twenty
years troubles, naming none but Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
as such ill-principled Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
who yet alone among all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
from the English Church had
all of them unanimously adhered to
his Majesty, and for his Majesties
sake had defended also the said Church
against the <hi>Doctor</hi> and his <hi>Brethren in
evill,</hi> the Sectaries.</p>
            <p>The plain truth is, the <hi>Doctors</hi>
collusion and prevarication in his Book
seems to me so visible and so insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
that it is a shame that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
not one true <hi>Prelaticall Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
has appeared as a Defender of
the <hi>English Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> against
him: but on the contrary even some
<hi>English Prelats</hi> themselves have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated
and boasted of his supposed
succesfull endeavours against the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church,</hi> though ruinous only
to themselves. Indeed it was the
<hi>Doctors Master-piece</hi> by his <hi>Drollery</hi> to
putt <hi>Protestants</hi> into a fitt of laughing,
that being in so good an humour they
<pb facs="tcp:49053:10"/>
might drink down the <hi>Poyson</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
them. This <hi>Poyson,</hi> it seems,
does not yet sensibly work with
them, and therefore they neglect to
provide <hi>Antidots.</hi> Well: all J can say
is, <hi>Viderint ipsi.</hi> But they may also do
well to consider that to this hour they
have not from this <hi>Defender of the
Church of England</hi> seen one line which
was not more to the advantage of
their <hi>Enemies,</hi> the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> then of
their own <hi>Church.</hi> So that abating
severall hundred pounds of yearly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
he still is what he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his <hi>Majesties</hi> return. He was
pleased to stile some late <hi>Catholick
Writers</hi> by the name of <hi>Ratts,</hi> for not
answering line by line his great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume:
He must give me leave to make
use of his <hi>Metaphor</hi> another way, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
it to himself. It is a common
Observation among <hi>Mariners</hi> that
when they see a <hi>Ship</hi> suddenly freed
from <hi>Ratts</hi> formerly abounding there,
they conclude that there are some leaks
in it, unobserved by any but the <hi>Ratts</hi>
themselves, which threaten its sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
sinking. Now let any one judge
wherther the <hi>Doctour</hi> by publishing his
<pb facs="tcp:49053:10"/>
               <hi>Principles</hi> has not stolln out of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> (yet with a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarian
conscience holding fast his
Preferments:) and does not this argue
that the <hi>Ratt</hi> foresees, or shrewdly
suspects some danger to the <hi>Ship,</hi> and
therefore provides for his own safety,
by returning to the same <hi>Sects</hi> which
uncessantly plott against <hi>it,</hi> and, it is
to be feared, against the <hi>Civill State</hi>
too?</p>
            <p>It is a sad thing therefore that not
one <hi>Protestant</hi> will open his eyes, and
give warning of the dangerous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of their <hi>Champion.</hi> Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that task and duty deserted by
them, has not been efficaciously enough
undertaken and performed by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
of the following <hi>Treatise.</hi> J leave
to all indifferent <hi>Iudges</hi> to determine.
They are also hereby entreated to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the <hi>delay</hi> of this <hi>Answer</hi> to the
true cause above mentioned, or indeed
to any thing rather then to the least
guilty apprehension which <hi>Catholicks</hi>
may have of encountring such an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary</hi>
as the <hi>Doctour</hi> is supposed to be
by persons who are perswaded that an
insolent confidence must needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb facs="tcp:49053:11"/>
with <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> And
for such persons, so qualified, no doubt,
it was that the <hi>Doctor</hi> wrote his <hi>Book,</hi>
not to instruct them, but to imprint his
own enormous passions in their minds.
Whereas <hi>Readers</hi> of but ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and prudence will easily perceive
that it was a consciousness of his own
inability to cast any prejudice on the
received <hi>Doctrins</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> her-self that forced
him to indulge to his fancy and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to expose to contempt and hatred
of unwary Readers the Opinions and
Practises of a few particular persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Catholicks, not alwayes faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
related by him, and most of them
already censured by Superiours. But
that which has gained to him the most
of his applauding Readers is his acting
the Theologicall Zani, after a fashion
altogether new and unexpected, whilst
he most ridiculously imputes Fanaticism
to the Catholick Church, of which
never any Heretick before him suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her capable.</p>
            <p>My last request to the Reader is that
seeing this Treatise written in a stile
so unpractised hitherto by mee, and
<pb facs="tcp:49053:11"/>
indeed so contrary to mine own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
he will interpret it aright, and
believe that J judged my self obliged
to neglect complements of Civility to
such an Adversary. If he had written
like one that sought out Truth, J
should have condemned my self if any
phrases of bitterness had escaped my
pen. But in answering such a mass of
Buffonry mixed with rancour and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
the Wise man has taught me my
Duty. Proverb. xxv. 5.</p>

Church, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>1. THe <hi>Authour</hi> of this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Treatise</hi> may with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
profess, that it was not from a
resentment of severall contemptuous
Aspersions cast on him by <hi>Doctour
Stillingfleet</hi> in his lately published <hi>Book,</hi>
that he was induced to write this
<hi>Answer.</hi> For who would not glory
in suffring any scorns or calumnies,
when merited only for recommending
to devout <hi>Christians</hi> instructions for the
practise of <hi>Christian Vertues</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> in
the greatest perfection that this life is
capable of? His <hi>Motiues</hi> therefore of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49053:13"/>
writing and publishing this Discourse
were first his <hi>Obedience</hi> to certain freinds
whose commands he ought in no wise
to resist: And then a just <hi>Indignation</hi>
in seeing the most <hi>Sacred</hi> things and
<hi>Persons</hi> in the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> selected
on purpose by him, to be contaminated
with his inck full of gall and poyson,
thereby imprudently ministring new
aims to <hi>Atheists</hi> (against whom as a
considerable and growing <hi>Sect</hi> among
them, he and others begin to preach and
write) by shewing, to his utmost abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that all the <hi>Religion</hi> professed in the
world, and that <hi>thing</hi> that bare the
name of a <hi>Catholick Church</hi> for so many
Ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the times of <hi>Luther</hi> and
<hi>Calvin,</hi> was nothing, for their <hi>Worship,</hi>
but <hi>Idolatry;</hi> for their <hi>Devotions,</hi> but
<hi>Fanaticism:</hi> and for their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Disciplin;</hi> nothing but <hi>Faction, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Avarice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The task therefore here imposed
being to answer in the <hi>Doctours</hi> last
Book, not the <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Controversy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> and <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
(reserved for a more learned pen
of his worthy <hi>Antagonist</hi>) but those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
in his <hi>Book</hi> (and principally tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49053:13"/>
                  <hi>Fanaticism</hi>) in which the <hi>Doctour</hi>
seems not to have intended to employ
his <hi>Talent</hi> of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> but to discharge
his excess of <hi>Spleen</hi> and choler and to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
free scope to all <hi>Vnchristian</hi> and even
<hi>in human Passions,</hi> the <hi>Authour</hi> hopes he
shall not deserve justly a <hi>Censure</hi> from
the <hi>Reader,</hi> if he endeavour here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Truth with as much zeal and
confidence as his Adversary hath assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it: So long as nothing passeth from
him that any way woundeth <hi>Christian
Charity,</hi> nor any sharpness is used, but
such as may, through <hi>Gods Grace</hi> prove
beneficiall to <hi>him,</hi> and his applauding
Readers.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Now in the</hi> Doctours Book <hi>there
are</hi> three Heads <hi>of Accusation selected
by him with intention to disgrace, and
fright his Readers from the</hi> Communion
<hi>of the</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>by imputing to
her.</hi> 1. That she is guilty of Severall
Opinions and Practises which hinder De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
and a good life. 2. That Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism
is not only countenanced by her, but
made a ground of believing some Doctrins,
of making some Ecclesiasticall Ordonnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
of erecting Religious Orders, and
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kewise of resisting lawfull Authority.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49053:14"/>
3. That there are among her Subiects Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
about Doctrins of great moment and
no possibility of reducing dissenting Parties
to Vnity or Obedience.</p>
               <p>4. These <hi>Accusations</hi> my purpose
is to refute, and for his <hi>Proofs</hi> of them,
to shew the invalidity of those which
are pretended by him to regard the
<hi>Church</hi> her self. But as for such as regard
the <hi>Opinions</hi> or <hi>Actions</hi> of particular
persons, and which fill up the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number of his leaves, some thing
shall be said to those among them which
seem of any considerable moment, and
the rest shall be neglected, as needing
no <hi>Answer,</hi> though never so truly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by him. And having done this,
I will, as I am perswaded, with much
greater confidence, <hi>retort</hi> the same
<hi>Heads</hi> of his <hi>Accusations</hi> upon himself,
demonstrating that <hi>his Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as principled by him. 1. doe evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undermine the foundations of Piety and
a Good life. 2. That the Essence of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is meer Fanaticism, in his own sence
of the Word: and that it iustifies Rebellion
against the Civill Magistrate. 3. That by
the Grounds of his Religion all manner of
Divisions and Schims are not only excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49053:14"/>
but lawfull, and withall incurable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. He will perhaps, when he sees
his large <hi>Book</hi> pretended to be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answered in a few sheets of paper,
renew the scornfull complaint made by
him in his Preface, <hi>That those who in,
some small measure have attempted to
answer him, have performed it in a way
that Ratts answer Books, by gnawing some
of the leaves of them, the Body and Design
of them remaining wholly untouched by
them.</hi> Now who those persons are
whom he is pleased to resemble to
<hi>Ratts,</hi> I can only iudge by guess: and if
I guess aright, particularly of one <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,</hi>
I could make it appear to the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi>
that the very bowells and most
<hi>Vitall parts</hi> of his great <hi>Volume</hi> have been
eaten through and consumed by that his
<hi>Adversary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. However, I conceive he wil not
have iust reason to apply this <hi>Metaphor</hi>
to the <hi>Authour</hi> of this present <hi>Treatise,</hi>
since it was his own fault, by heaping
together a great Masse of rubbage and
stuff altogether impertinent, to make
a short <hi>Answer</hi> sufficient. Does he think
his <hi>Adversaries,</hi> in case they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the liberty and commodity of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49053:15"/>
publishing large Volumes, so much at
leasure as to follow him step by step in
examining <hi>Quotations,</hi> and answering
<hi>Obiections</hi> which are of no moment
whether they be true or false? He may
by such a way of writing beget in the
minds of the vulgar sort of <hi>Readers</hi> a
high Opinion of the Vastnes of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
reading, and his well-furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Library:</hi> but his <hi>Adversaries</hi> will be
much to blame if they trouble themssel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
with defending every <hi>Old Story,</hi> or
personall imputations: or indeed, if he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter
they engage themselves in any
<hi>Controversy</hi> with him, except in <hi>Points</hi>
pretended by him of such consequence
as to iustify a necessity in <hi>Protestants</hi> of
separating from the <hi>Catholick Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
And few such <hi>Points</hi> are to be found
in his <hi>Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. But moreover, as short an <hi>Answer</hi>
as this is, he wil have less reason to say,
<hi>That the Body and Design of his Book will
remain wholly untouched in it.</hi> He may
indeed perhaps have some <hi>ill Design</hi> in
publishing (as it were by conspiracy
with others) a Book so voyd of <hi>Christian
Charity</hi> and moderation: Which <hi>Design</hi>
may remain <hi>untouched</hi> by mee, because
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49053:15"/>
I am unwilling to declare the grounds
of my coniectures moving me to look
upon it as an <hi>Ominous ill-boading Book,</hi>
fore-running some expected mischeif.
But for the <hi>Body of his Book,</hi> that is,
whatsoever appears to me in it of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
it is truly a <hi>very slender dwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish
Body,</hi> being almost entirely contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a few sheets at the beginning, and
in the last single sheet which enwraps
his <hi>Protestant Principles.</hi> The publishing
of which <hi>Principles</hi> was truly an act of
commendable ingenuity and confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
also: For I think he is the first <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant-Controvertist</hi>
who upou such a
tender Subiect has appeared bare-faced
out of the Clouds. And moreover I
may take leave to tell him that from a
heedfull consideration of those his
<hi>Principles</hi> I do collect that <hi>He</hi> and <hi>myself</hi>
are of the same iudgment in one matter
of great importance, viz. <hi>That no shew
of Reason or conscience can be pretended to
escape from the Authority of the Catholick
Church but by renouncing entirely (as he
has done in his Principles) all Ecclesiasticall
(or even Civill) Authority: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
that no Churches proceed Logically
in asserting the grounds of their Religion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49053:16"/>
but only Catholicks or Single-Independents.</hi>
The reason hereof is, Because for any
<hi>Ecclesiasticall Superiours</hi> to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
any obligation lying on thers <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects</hi>
to submitt to their <hi>Authority,</hi> and
at the same time to preferr the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of a particular <hi>Church</hi> before that of
the <hi>Vniversall,</hi> which is the fountain
of all <hi>Authority,</hi> is to putt out their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects</hi>
eyes, and to hale them after them
with chains. And above all other <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations</hi>
the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> is
most brutish, who after a denyall of all
<hi>Visible Authority</hi> extant before them,
endeavour violently to subdue mens
consciences to the Jurisdiction of their
<hi>Classes,</hi> erected upon controverted <hi>Texts</hi>
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as interpreted by themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
alone.</p>
               <p>8. The <hi>Doctours Principles</hi> therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
being by far the most materiall Part
of his <hi>Book,</hi> it is not notwithstanding
my business in this <hi>Treatise</hi> to examine
them apart one by one, or to trouble
my self with making a setled <hi>Iudgment</hi>
whether of the <hi>two</hi> fore-named <hi>Parties,
Catholicks</hi> or <hi>Independents</hi> has the most
solid reasons on their side. For being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to make <hi>Reflexions</hi> on that part of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49053:16"/>
his Book which is of least importance,
writen in an immodest, uncivill, petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
stile, it was not fitt in my <hi>Answer</hi>
to mingle considerations on a <hi>Subiect</hi> so
serious, and soberly expressed as his
<hi>Principles</hi> are, which indeed deserve to
be examined separately with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
calmness and impassionateness, as
being an <hi>Argument</hi> on which all other
<hi>Controversies</hi> do depend, and which
one way or other makes an end of them
all.</p>
               <p>9. Yet for all this, it was not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for me to avoyd all mention of his
<hi>Principles</hi> in this <hi>Answer</hi> to a different
<hi>Subiect:</hi> since (as hath been already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated,
and will be seen by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele)
whatsoever <hi>Charge</hi> he brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and which
I pretend here to refute, does scarce at
all touch <hi>Her,</hi> but lyes most heavily and
unmoveably upon his <hi>Principles,</hi> and on
any <hi>Church</hi> acknowledging or adopting
them. He must therefore dispose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with the greatest patience he can,
to be put in mind more then once or
twice of his <hi>Principles</hi> and the fatall
<hi>Consequences</hi> of them. From which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences</hi>
till he can effectually clear
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49053:17"/>
them, he will have little cause to call, as
he hath done, for an <hi>Answer</hi> to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
large <hi>Volume.</hi> For if it shall appear,
by the ruine of his, that the <hi>Principles</hi>
of <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> only are solide and
inexpugnable; that is, that the Catholick
Church is indeed, and to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>the Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> from
whose <hi>Authority</hi> no <hi>Appeal</hi> is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
then both his Former and latter
Books are thereby sufficiently refuted,
as far as they condemn or but question
any Doctrins whatsoever determined
by <hi>her.</hi> This being once established, he
will find his <hi>Books,</hi> not having <hi>a few
leaves gnawed by Ratts,</hi> but <hi>unà liturâ</hi>
entirely abolished.</p>

               <p>10. HAving given this Account

the forementioned <hi>Heads</hi> of

the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which he thinks of
sufficient weight to deterre any one
from ioyning in her <hi>Communion.</hi> I will
begin with that touching <hi>Fanaticism,</hi>
which though the <hi>Second</hi> in his Order,
yet principally concerned me to dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,
and particularly that part of it which
contains an <hi>Invective</hi> against the <hi>Life</hi>

descanting on the whole life of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
rendred him and his <hi>Attendants,</hi>
men and women, Obiects of the utmost
scorn and a version, as if they all of them
had been only a pack of dissolute <hi>Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds</hi>
and <hi>Cheats.</hi> This the <hi>Preacher</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
taking on him the person of a
<hi>Iewish Pharisee</hi> and <hi>Persecutour</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
And he performed it so to the life, that
he would have shamed <hi>Lucian,</hi> and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
envy in the <hi>Doctour</hi> himself. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
upon it, changing his stile as beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
a <hi>Disciple</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> he with such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
dexterity and force of <hi>Reason</hi>
answered all the <hi>Cavillations</hi> and <hi>Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
before made, that the loudly repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Applauses</hi> of his Hearers hindred him
a good space from proceeding. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this, the <hi>Grave Doctours</hi> and
<hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> though
much satisfied with his Intellectuall abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
yet wisely considering that a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant,
histrionicall Stile even in Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
did not befitt so <hi>Sacred a Subiect,</hi>
and that it was not lawfull to personate
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49053:19"/>
too naturally a <hi>deriding Iew,</hi> obliged the
<hi>Preacher</hi> to a publick <hi>Recantation-Sermon</hi>
in the same Pulpit the <hi>Sunday</hi> following.
And this deservedly, For <hi>Vitium simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari
non potest, Virtus potest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. If the <hi>Doctour</hi> would now make a
second Essay of his <hi>Witt</hi> and invention
on severall <hi>Stories</hi> as we find them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
find his <hi>Fancy</hi> as inventive, and if
Nature had denyed him, the <hi>Devill</hi>
would, no doubt, once more furnish
him with <hi>Expressions</hi> as apt to move the
Spleen and laughter of his present ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding
<hi>Readers,</hi> as any are now found
in his <hi>Book:</hi> by which means he perhaps
may arrive at the glory to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>New Sect</hi> of the
<hi>Ecclesiae Malignantium.</hi> And unless <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
deceives us, there are already se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Holy Bible</hi> descanted
upon in a stile like to his, and it may be
the unhappy <hi>Authours</hi> conceive that the
same <hi>Press</hi> may (without an <hi>Imprima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>)
be allowed them also.</p>
               <p>14. It is not now my purpose to make
a particular Vindication of each <hi>Saint</hi>
traduced by him. But considering the
publick Interest obliging the whole
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49053:19"/>
                  <hi>Western Patriarchat,</hi> and most especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>England</hi> to be tender of the <hi>Honour</hi>
of <hi>S. Benedict,</hi> by whose <hi>Disciples,</hi> if
they were <hi>Fanaticks, Christianity</hi> has
been established among us, and in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to whom such a world of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
houses</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> have been
erected and enriched with vast posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
I can not, without renouncing
my Duty as a <hi>Christian, Religious man,</hi>
and an <hi>English man,</hi> by silence conspire
to his dishonour: the rather, because
to my best remembrance I never knew
that any of the <hi>English Church</hi> since the
<hi>Reformation</hi> did ever cast any scornfull
<hi>Aspersions</hi> on his <hi>Memory:</hi> and I believe
the <hi>Doctour</hi> will scarce find any one he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter
willing to imitate his malignant
Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>15. Now what is it that the <hi>Doctour</hi>
layes to the charge of <hi>S. Benedict?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 262.</note> 
                  <q>The
whole <hi>Charge</hi> consists in repeating af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a ridiculons manner certain passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of <hi>S. Benedicts life</hi> written by <hi>S.
Gregory:</hi> As 1. how being a child he by
his Prayers obtained <hi>a Miracle</hi> for the
consolation of his <hi>Nurse,</hi> a <hi>Monument</hi>
of which <hi>Miracle</hi> remained publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Visible many years after. 2. How
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49053:20"/>
he lived three years with wonderfull
austerity in a cave, unknown to any
but <hi>S. Romanus,</hi> who to the <hi>Devills</hi>
despight furnished him with necessary
food. 3. How he rolled himself in
thorns to conquer his amorous Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
4. How he was enabled by
<hi>Supernaturall Revelations</hi> and <hi>Lights</hi>
to spy out <hi>Devills,</hi> to discover things
absent and foretell things to come, to
be a Spectatour of the Soule of his
<hi>Sister S. Scholastica</hi> in the shape of a
<hi>Dove</hi> going up to Heaven, and to
see all the world <hi>in uno radio Solis,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>16. By this brief <hi>Account</hi> of the life
and actions of <hi>S. Benedict,</hi> all which the
<hi>Doctour</hi> expects that his <hi>Readers</hi> should
esteem to be meer <hi>fanaticall Lyes and</hi>
forgeries, his intention seems to be to
convict both <hi>S. Benedict</hi> and <hi>S. Gregory</hi>
of lying against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
to a <hi>Divine Power</hi> pretended
<hi>Miracles, Visions</hi> &amp;c. which either were
not at all, or were Sleights of <hi>Leger-de-main.</hi>
But what arguments does the
<hi>Doctour</hi> give to disparage <hi>S. Gregories</hi>
relation? Will he deny that any <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
were wrought by <hi>Gods</hi> servants in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49053:20"/>
that Age? If so, he will find it a hard
task to defend himself against so many
<hi>Saints,</hi> learned and prudent men, who
have testified that they have been eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses
of many. He will not sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm (though he is bold enough to
affirm anything) that such <hi>Miracles,</hi> if
reall, were <hi>Proofs</hi> that the Workers of
them were <hi>Fanaticks</hi> and <hi>Deceivers.</hi>
These things considered where will
he hope to find <hi>Readers</hi> who can be
inwardly perswaded that what <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
relates is sufficiently confuted by
his scornfull manner of repeating it in
the new stile of a <hi>Theological Scarron?</hi>
Or to iudge this a concluding argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>S Benedict</hi> wrought <hi>Miracles,</hi>
was favoured with supernaturall <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
and <hi>Revelations,</hi> therefore he is
manifestly convicted of <hi>Fanaticism?</hi> and
upon that <hi>Fanaticism</hi> he instituted his
<hi>Religious Order,</hi> for which he framed a
<hi>Fanaticall Rule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. Now by <hi>Fanaticism</hi> the <hi>Doctour</hi>
ays he intends <hi>an Enthusiastick way of
Religion,</hi> that is, a Religion built upon
<hi>falsly pretended Inspirations, Illuminations</hi>
&amp;c. Which <hi>Definition</hi> being approved,
with what shew of reason can the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49053:21"/>
accuse <hi>S. Benedict</hi> of <hi>Fanaticism?</hi> For
did <hi>S. Benedict</hi> frame to himself a <hi>New
Religion?</hi> Did he make any the least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in the <hi>Religion</hi> conveyed to
him by <hi>Tradition,</hi> and professed by the
whole <hi>Church?</hi> Had any of his <hi>Visions</hi>
or <hi>Revelations</hi> any influence on his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
to make him introduce any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations?
How was he then an <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. But <hi>S. Gregory</hi> affirms that he had
<hi>Revelations, Inspirations</hi> and the <hi>Guift</hi>
of <hi>discerning Spirits:</hi> And these things the
<hi>Doctor</hi> will needs call <hi>Enthusiasms.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he will not deny but that <hi>God</hi> may;
yea often has conferred on his servants,
<hi>Revelations</hi> of his will, in some speciall
circumstances, which are not in the
<hi>Doctors</hi> sence, <hi>Enthusiasms:</hi> Neither,
will I on the other side deny but many
persons, even in the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
have bin seduced by the <hi>Devill,</hi> and
their own pride, to pretend to lights re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from <hi>God,</hi> which were either
effects of a distempered fancy, or sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of the <hi>Devill.</hi> The question
therefore is, whether <hi>S. Benedicts vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
and <hi>Revelations</hi> came the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
or the latter way. But it is no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49053:21"/>
question touching the <hi>Doctours</hi> Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this case: for certainly he durst
not decide them, if he thought or but
suspected that they came from <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19. I beseech him now that he would
examine his own conscience, whether,
I will not say, convincing proofs, but
rational grounds may not be affoorded,
that <hi>S. Benedicts Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi>
were truely <hi>divine,</hi> considering. 1. the
Innocence, purity and vninterrupted
fervour of devotion conspicuous in <hi>S.
Benedict,</hi> from his Infancie, to his
death. 2. The admiration in which the
age wherein he lived held him, both for
his piety, and the stup<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nduous favours,
conferred on him by <hi>Almighty God.</hi>
Will the <hi>Doctor</hi> now say, that all that
age, and all ages following, have been
deluded by an <hi>Hypocrit,</hi> and <hi>Counterfeit
Enthusiast,</hi> and that himself was the
only person Clear-sighted enoug to
discover the cheat? not only all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
living in his time, but even the
<hi>Pagan Goths</hi> had him in veneration: By
what light now after above a thousand
years, has he seen that the whole world
besides himself have been deluded? Hee
will easily giue me leave to say assuredly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49053:22"/>
it was not by a supernaturall light, least
he himself should be suspected an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast:</hi>
And for a naturall light to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him, he has shewed us none, having
concealed the reasons moving him to
make a <hi>Saint</hi> soe glorious in the esteem
of the <hi>Christian</hi> world, the obiect of his
derision.</p>
               <p>20. I verily believe the <hi>Doctor</hi> would
have been easily induced to have spared
the person of <hi>S. Benedict</hi> (and so of the
other <hi>Saints</hi>) had not a saying of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Bellarmin</hi> afflicted his mind, and
stirred up his choler, viz. <hi>That Religious
orders were at first instituted by S. Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
S. Romualdus, S. Bruno, S. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,
and S. Francis by the inspiration of
the holy Ghost:</hi> This was a sayeing insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
to a mind by education, and
wordly interest preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with a strong
preiudice, and therefore all books
and <hi>Legends</hi> must be searched, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
crifling passage, and circumstance,
perhaps indiscreetly inserted any whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
by, <hi>Authors,</hi> must be made use of to
disgrace the <hi>Saints,</hi> and to prove them
<hi>Enthusiasts:</hi> Though all the world besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
haue them in veneration.</p>
               <p>21. Now to enter into dispute concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49053:22"/>
their personall qualities with such
an Adversary, wil bee to offend against
<hi>Charity</hi> by giving him occasion, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling
yet more <hi>Gods</hi> most beloued per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
servants. The most commodious
way then to make a true judgement of
them will be, to examine their fruits.
For <hi>by their fruits,</hi> saith our Saviour,
<hi>they will be known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>22. Therefore to determine, whether
it was by <hi>Gods Inspiration</hi> that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
their respective <hi>Orders,</hi> lett
those <hi>who</hi> doubt, yea those who scarce
think it lawfull to doubt. 1. Examine
their severall <hi>Rules,</hi> according to which
their <hi>Disciples</hi> oblige themselves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their lives and actions. And. 2.
consider whether <hi>God</hi> has acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them for his servants, by making
use of them to the great benefitt of his
<hi>Church,</hi> and dilatation of his <hi>honour.</hi>
Now if it shall appear that their <hi>Rules</hi>
advance perfection in all <hi>Christian</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
And that such among them as
have Squared their Actions by their
<hi>Rules</hi> have in a signal manner benefitted
<hi>Gods Church,</hi> and encreased his <hi>honour,</hi>
It is most certain that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had
just grounds, how angrie soever the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49053:23"/>
Doctour be, to say, that <hi>such Orders were
Instituted by the Inspiration of the Holy
Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>23. I doe heartily wish for the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi>
good, that he would without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
examine these two points, or at
least patiently read what is here writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
concerning them: Now to descant
upon all their <hi>Rules,</hi> and to Enumerate
the services done by the severall <hi>Orders</hi>
to <hi>Gods Church</hi> would be too tedious. I
will therefore as my duty more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
engages me, confine my self to <hi>S.
Benedicts Rule</hi> and his <hi>Disciples Actions:</hi>
And in so doeing the <hi>Reader</hi> will be
sufficiently informed in all the rest:
Since they all agree in the Sanctity of
their <hi>Rules</hi> and glory of their actions,
Though in some circumstantiall Rites,
and Observances there be some va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.</p>
               <p>24. As touching therefore <hi>the Rule of S.
Benedict,</hi> whether it was written with
a <hi>Fanatick Spirit</hi> or not, The <hi>Doctours</hi>
own Judgement may be appealed to, If
he would vouchsafe to read and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
it. For what is it but a collection
skilfully made of all <hi>Evangelicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi>
and <hi>counsells of perfection?</hi> There
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49053:23"/>
the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Office</hi> is so wisely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that the whole Church Judged
it fitt to be her Pattern. There <hi>S. Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi>
teaches his <hi>Disciples</hi> to begin all
their Actions with an eye to <hi>God,</hi> beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his assistance, and referring them
entirely to his <hi>Glory.</hi> There a holy <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi>
is so ordered, with such a decent
assignation of dutyes proper to all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
both of Superiors, and subjects, in
their severall Rancks, that a great and
Wise <hi>King</hi> made choice of it for his <hi>Rule</hi>
in <hi>Managing</hi> his Kingdome. There a
contempt and hatred of the world is
taught with great <hi>Energy: Religious
men</hi> are enioined to hide themselves
from it, that they may in their Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
cells enioye a freer conversation
with <hi>God.</hi> And because they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
themselves out of their Solitude,
They are instructed to mortifie there all
<hi>Sensuall Passions,</hi> by prayer and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
If by <hi>Gods Providence</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
plenty of Temporall goods, The
poore and strangers only reaped the
fruits of it. Yea their <hi>Lawgiuer</hi> taught
them not only by his <hi>Rule,</hi> but example
also, to preferre even in the times of the
greatest scarcity the satisfieing the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49053:24"/>
wants of others before their own:
<hi>Hospitality</hi> was a vertue soe peculiar to
them, and so constantly practised by
them, that till the Rapine and furie of
a <hi>Tyrant</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> destroyed
them, there was no need of any <hi>Law</hi>
among us for sustaining the Poor,
who after soe many <hi>Modern Lawes</hi>
can scarce be preserved from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing.
And there (which the <hi>Doctour</hi>
may doe well to consider) the vertues
of <hi>Humilitie</hi> and <hi>Peacefull obedience</hi> most
contrarie to and Inconsistent with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism</hi>
are of all others most copiously
and vehemently inforced, as if in them
the <hi>Spirit of his Rule</hi> did Principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.
By these two vertues his Disciples
were securely guarded from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which an externall exercise of
other vertues might expose them to: By
the former (<hi>Humilitie</hi>) they were exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
from <hi>Pride</hi> and self complacencie,
in case <hi>God</hi> should bestow any Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
favours on them: And by the
latter (<hi>Obedience</hi>) which obliged them
to discover even their most secret
Thoughts to their <hi>Superiours</hi> and <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Directors,</hi> they were secured <hi>a
Demonio Meridiano,</hi> from <hi>false Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49053:24"/>
and <hi>Illusions</hi> of the <hi>Enemy.</hi> And
lastly to prevent all Innovations in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
touching <hi>Religion,</hi> and disturbing
of the Churches peace by spreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
new invented Fancies; a most
strict <hi>Silence</hi> was inioynd them at home,
and none permitted to goe abroad, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for busines, or preaching, but such
as the <hi>Superiour</hi> esteemed fitt, with the
benediction and prayers of whom, and
of their other Brethren they were sent
forth, and at their Return received
again.</p>
               <p>25. Now can the <hi>Doctour</hi> believe
that it was a fault in <hi>Cardinal Bellarmin</hi>
to say that it was by the <hi>Inspiration of the
Holy Ghost</hi> that such <hi>a Rule</hi> as this was
instituted, and Families erected for the
observing of it? And yet if he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
it he will find that I have omitted
many other <hi>Perfections</hi> which shine
forth in it.</p>
               <p>26. And whereas from some mistaken
expressions of <hi>S. Gregory</hi> he charges <hi>S.
Benedict</hi> with the great crime of being
<hi>a hater of Human Learning:</hi> wee doe not
find that he forbids his <hi>Disciples</hi> the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of it in his <hi>Rule,</hi> at such times as the
<hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Quire</hi> and <hi>Manuall Labour</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49053:25"/>
for the benefit of the <hi>Monastery</hi> affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them a vacancy. And it is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
that wee owe to his followers
the preservation of almost all the <hi>Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature</hi>
which remains in the world:
For by their care in conserving and
Transcribing of books, all our <hi>Libraries</hi>
are now soe richly furnished and the
Doctour enabled to write against them
and their Master. This they did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
such a deluge of <hi>Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
which for <hi>Religions</hi> sake hated
and sought to destroy all manner of
<hi>Learning:</hi> And <hi>S. Benedicts Disciples</hi>
doeing so, they thought such their care
to be no Transgression of their <hi>Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>27. But as for <hi>S. Benedict</hi> himself
<hi>Almighty God</hi> did not call him to be a
<hi>Critick,</hi> but a Teacher of <hi>Sanctity.</hi> And
to enable himself thereto, wee find in
the last <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Rule,</hi> that he was
no stranger in the books of <hi>Holy Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
in the writings of the <hi>Ancient Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> in the <hi>Conferences,</hi>
and lives of the holy <hi>Fathers,</hi> all which
he recommends to his <hi>Disciples.</hi> But as
for the <hi>Subtilties</hi> of <hi>Pagan Philosophers,</hi>
the <hi>Elegancies</hi> of their <hi>Poets</hi> and the
like (considering his Vocation) it would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49053:25"/>
have been in him the vice of <hi>Curiosity</hi>
to have spent his time in them: Which
<hi>S. Augustin</hi> Judges to have been <hi>the
Concupiscence of the Eyes,</hi> reckoned by
<hi>S. Iohn,</hi> as one of the three great <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>
of the world.</p>
               <p>28. <hi>S. Benedict</hi> therefore was not <hi>a
hater of Human Learning</hi> (as the <hi>Doctour</hi>
vnjustly and without warrant stiles
him) But for his own vse and office he
preferred before it that Learning which
the <hi>Wiseman</hi> stiles <hi>Scientiam Sanctorum,</hi>
that learning which does not puff up
the mind, but renders it <hi>Docibilem Dei,</hi>
and makes the possessors of it <hi>Saints:</hi>
And I am confident that in the day of
<hi>Iudgment God</hi> will never (as the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
does) impute this choice to him as
a fault. I would to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Doctour,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of deriding, would imitate him.
In this regard therefore it was that <hi>S.

and had more understanding then his

Enemies, Then his Teachers, Then the

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 118. Mem.</note> only by <hi>meditating on Gods
law,</hi> and <hi>Keeping his Precepts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>29. Thus far concerning the severall
<hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>accusations</hi> of <hi>S. Benedict,</hi> in a
scornefull manner represented by the
<hi>Doctour</hi> to make his <hi>Readers</hi> merry at
the expences of a <hi>Glorious Saint.</hi> But wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall
his <hi>Readers</hi> are desired to consider,
that all these heads are borrowed from
<hi>S. Gregory</hi> who wrote the <hi>Saints</hi> life,
from the testimonie of certain Holy
men who had been <hi>S. Benedicts Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
So that the very same things which
<hi>S. Gregory</hi> wrote to prove the Sanctity
of <hi>S. Benedict,</hi> the <hi>Doctour</hi> makes use of
to shew him, as it were on a stage to
have been a <hi>Fanatick, a false pretender
to Miracles, Visions</hi> and <hi>Inspirations,</hi> and
an <hi>Ignorant Fool:</hi> And all this without
any reason or proof given to iustifie such
<hi>Imputations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>30. But the <hi>Readers</hi> are desired
to consider, that whatever opinion
they have of <hi>S. Benedict</hi> (to the zeal and
Charity of whose <hi>Disciples</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they owe their Christianity)
yet surely <hi>S. Gregory</hi> was not a person
fitt to make sport for the <hi>Doctour</hi> and his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49053:26"/>
                  <hi>Readers: S. Gregory,</hi> perhaps the most
exalted and most humble <hi>Saint,</hi> the
most <hi>Illuminated Doctour,</hi> the most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and most Charitable <hi>Prelat,</hi> that
since the <hi>Apostles</hi> times <hi>Almighty God</hi>
ever provided to govern his <hi>Church.</hi>
Thus he has alwayes been esteemed not
only through the <hi>Western, but Eastern
Churches</hi> also. And can the <hi>Doctour</hi> think
he can find any <hi>Reader</hi> who has not in
his heart renounced <hi>Christianity,</hi> that
wil applaud him for trampling with
scorn on <hi>S. Gregory?</hi> For it is from <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
indeed that the <hi>Doctour</hi> is informed
that <hi>S. Benedict</hi> was a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> if he
were such an one: It is <hi>S. Gregory</hi> who
commended and confirmed his <hi>Rule,</hi>
and if the <hi>Doctour</hi> may be believed, it
seems very ignorantly and foolishly sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it [<hi>Discretione Praecipuam</hi>] <hi>eminent
for the discretion of it;</hi> which is a vertue
ill suiting with a <hi>Fanatick.</hi> It is <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
who has conveyed to posterity an
account of the <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Supernaturall
Favours</hi> by <hi>God</hi> conferred on <hi>S. Benedict:</hi>
the truth of which I believe scarce any
one hitherto has disbelieved, beside the
<hi>Doctour:</hi> Certain it is that a generall
firm belief of them, both during <hi>S. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicts</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49053:27"/>
times and afterward, made a
change in <hi>Christendom</hi> scarce ever to be
paralleld before or since, whilst incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
multitudes of well meaning <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
wakened from a <hi>Lethargy</hi> of sin,
either flocked together to take on them
the <hi>Yoke</hi> of that <hi>Rule,</hi> or if they wanted
such courage, powred forth their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to entertain such as consecrated
themselves to <hi>Gods</hi> service. And all this
the <hi>Doctour</hi> without any proof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
<hi>Fanaticism,</hi> and is desirous that
men of this <hi>Reformed Age</hi> should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
these <hi>Divine Favours</hi> communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>S. Benedict</hi> to have been <hi>Illusions</hi>
of <hi>Satan</hi> (which <hi>Satan</hi> himself never
durst own) and that men had done mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
wisely if they had continued to serve
the world, and the Flesh, rather then
to quitt both in following an <hi>Hipocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Fanatick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31. Surely the <hi>Doctour</hi> was much to
blame, and I hope he will sadly reflect
on the danger of raising mirth from such
an argument as this. Or if he doe not,
it will be very fitt that when hereafter
he mentions those two persons so vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by all but himself, he would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from calling them <hi>Saints.</hi> For in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49053:27"/>
the same breath to call <hi>S. Benedict</hi> a
<hi>Saint</hi> and a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> savours something
of blasphemy. Yet it will be a hard task
for him to conquer so inveterated a cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome:
Mens tongues are so enured ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to mention them without that Title
of <hi>Saint,</hi> that the only expedient to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
that fault in himself and others,
will be to let his <hi>Readers</hi> know that he
intends the same ill thing by the terms
of <hi>Saint</hi> and <hi>Fanatick.</hi> Thus farr tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<hi>S. Benedict</hi> and his <hi>Rule:</hi> by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
whereof I conceived men
might Judge whether, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>Doctours Raillery, God</hi> did not
esteem him his faithfull servant.</p>
               <p>32. The next thing proposed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to make the like judgement, was to
consider whether after <hi>S. Benedicts</hi>
death, <hi>God</hi> did not declare the same
thing, by making choice of the <hi>Disciples</hi>
of <hi>S. Benedict</hi> to procure an encrease of
his honour, and considerable blessings
to his <hi>Church:</hi> For if he did, surely the
<hi>Doctour</hi> himself, how bold so ever, will
scarce dare to disgrace them hereafter
by the Title of <hi>Fanaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>33. To clear this, it is to be observed
that in <hi>S. Benedicts</hi> age <hi>Christians</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49053:28"/>
were falln into such a decadence
from <hi>Piety,</hi> charity among them was
become so cold and frozen, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of vices raigned so impudently and
uncontrollably, that <hi>Almighty God</hi> was
even forced to open a free passage
among them for Innumerable armies of
barbarous <hi>Pagan Nations</hi> from the
North, <hi>Getes</hi> (or <hi>Goths) Vandalls,
Francks, Hunns, Saxons, Danes, Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi>
and many others, which like
<hi>Locusts</hi> spread themselves, devouring all
things through all countreyes, especially
of the <hi>Western Church,</hi> all which did
not expresse their fury so much against
their <hi>Christian Enemies</hi> forces, as against
their <hi>Religion.</hi> Now what could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from such <hi>Conquerours,</hi> but that
the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> should be vtterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished.</p>
               <p>34. Yet such was the infinite <hi>Wisedom</hi>
and <hi>Goodnes</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that that which was
a most terrible <hi>Plague</hi> to impious and
dissolute <hi>Christians</hi> then alive, proved
in generall to <hi>Gods Church</hi> and <hi>Christian
Religion</hi> a most unvaluable blessing. For
in a short time, <hi>God of those stones raised
up Children to Abraham:</hi> Children, not
like the former, who sluggishly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49053:28"/>
themselves with the name of
<hi>Christians,</hi> and in their lives denyed
<hi>Christ:</hi> but heroically zealous servants
of <hi>our Lord:</hi> Witness innumerable <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
magnificently built, and richly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed,
to his honour: Witness innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<hi>Monasteries</hi> and Schooles of
Piety frequently inhabited by <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
Kings, Queens, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,</hi>
who preferred a voluntary life of
<hi>Solitude, Poverty,</hi> and <hi>Mortification</hi> (to
the end they might more freely attend
to heavenly Meditations) before Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
<hi>Courts, Scepters,</hi> and <hi>Crowns.</hi>
Lastly witness a numerous Army of
<hi>Martyrs,</hi> not a few of them <hi>Soueraign
Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princesses</hi> &amp; tender <hi>Virgins</hi>
witness likewise <hi>Aposticall Bishops</hi>
who willingly offered their blood for
the Salvation of their <hi>Barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>35. Now who were the persons
who, by <hi>Gods</hi> most blessed direction,
instilled into the hearts of all these such
an <hi>Heroicall Faith</hi> and <hi>Divine Loue?</hi>
were they not principally the <hi>Disciples</hi>
of <hi>S. Benedict?</hi> Let the <hi>Records</hi> and
<hi>Annals</hi> of so many <hi>Nations</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> be
consulted: they will justifie the same,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49053:29"/>
and to <hi>Gods</hi> glory will testify how his
<hi>Apostolick Preachers</hi> to convert their
Ancestours have been dignified with
stupendious <hi>Miracles.</hi> Yet all these are
derided by the <hi>Doctour</hi> as <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> the
Children of a <hi>famous Hypocrit</hi> and <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick:</hi>
by the Doctour, I say, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
shew one Village converted to
<hi>Christianity</hi> by any one of his own sect,
nor one <hi>Miracle</hi> pretended to.</p>
               <p>36. Now if any thing here delivered
touching <hi>S Benedict</hi> and his <hi>Disciples</hi>
be true (and if all be not true, wee have
been deceived by the <hi>Common Tradition</hi>
of whole <hi>Nations,</hi> besides bookes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hitherto contradicted) Nay if any
one <hi>Miracle</hi> has been truly reported of
<hi>him</hi> or <hi>them,</hi> in what a condition has the
<hi>Doctour</hi> by his unseasonable mirth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
himselfe? The <hi>Wiseman</hi> tells us
<hi>there is a time to weep, and a time to laugh
God</hi> has placed them in this order, that
<hi>weeping</hi> should goe before <hi>Laughing;</hi> but
the <hi>Doctour</hi> has perverted the order:
He must expect therfore after his and
his profane <hi>Readers</hi> mirth, a time of
weeping will succeed: <hi>God Almighty</hi>
grant that his weeping time may come
in this life, and that <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49053:29"/>
and gnashing of teeth come not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>37. I doe not know how any <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary</hi>
of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> could
with all his study have shewd himself
more impotent in his passions, and less
succesfull in reasoning, then the <hi>Doctour</hi>
has done in his book. Certainly it must
be a hatred horribly poysonous against
the <hi>Catholick Church Militant,</hi> which
will not spare the <hi>Church Triumphant.</hi>
I defy the <hi>Doctour,</hi> how bold a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
soever for Schism to say publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or by writing to signify only his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that <hi>S. Benedict, S. Gregory, S.
Francis</hi> and the rest are now reprobate,
damned souls in hell: Yet such they must
needs be; if they were <hi>Hipocriticall Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionaires,</hi>
and false pretenders of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
on purpose to gather <hi>Disciples,</hi> and
withal dyed vnrepentant of these
things, as most certainly they did. Now
if such be not his opinion, nay if he be
not assured that they are in an accursed
condition, was not his tongue (or penn)
<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] <hi>Sett on fire
of hell,</hi> whilst it uttered such <hi>Blasphemies</hi>
against them, as a perpetuall <hi>Monument</hi>
of his rage till the day of <hi>Iudgment,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49053:30"/>
when he must be answerable for all that
shall be corrupted by them.</p>
               <p>38. But suppose that all these <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations</hi>
could really be verified, must
the whole <hi>Church</hi> be esteemed <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
in which Salvation is scarce pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be had (for to prove that is the
<hi>Doctours</hi> design) because five or six <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits</hi>
have lived undiscovered in it? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a <hi>Young man</hi> notwithstanding
all his <hi>austerities,</hi> and <hi>prayers,</hi> having
been inflamed by the spirit of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
chose rather to torment his flesh
by rowling himself naked among bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars
and nettles, then to suffer its impure
delectations? or because <hi>another young
man</hi> having been commanded to restore
to his Father all the goods committed to
his care, meerly to hinder his Charitie
to the poor, in a fitt of fervour gave up
not only his goods, but cloaths also, to
his very Shirt? or because <hi>another man</hi>
out of some severe (or the Doctour may
call it, capricious) humour, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
contempt to himself, would refuse
to give a civill respect to his betters?</p>
               <p>39. What then would the <hi>Doctour</hi>
say of a <hi>Church,</hi> in which <hi>Visions,</hi> and
<hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi> far more exotick
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49053:30"/>
in outward appearance, are proposed to
mens belief? In which one who calls
himself a <hi>Prophet</hi> professeth that another
sort of <hi>Mortification</hi> was enioynd him
then that which <hi>S. Benedict</hi> practised,
namely to mixe his bread with mans
dung, and so to eat it? In which a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
by <hi>Gods</hi> command for three years
together walked naked and with his feet
bare before all the people? In which
another commands his <hi>Disciple</hi> not to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
or shew any respect to any person
whosoever should come in his way? Yet
not any of these persons or actions the
<hi>Doctour</hi> dares deride, or refuse to yield
his assent and approbation of them,
though he has encouraged his profane
Readers by his example to deride
them.</p>

               <p>41. If he doe acknowledge a reall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between an <hi>Active</hi> and a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative

might doe well to teach this Age what
is meant by a <hi>Contemplative life,</hi> and
what way and Manner of <hi>Devotion</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
suits to it: And whether among
all the <hi>Sects</hi> which he call by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
name of <hi>Protestants,</hi> he can tell us
any news of any who have pretended
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49053:32"/>
to a <hi>Contemplative life,</hi> or given any
<hi>Rules</hi> for such as would performe the
exercises of it: Such are, and have always
been esteemed such, <hi>Solitude, Abstrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
from worldly cares, <hi>Rigorous absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences,
Cilices,</hi> indispensable <hi>Obedience</hi>
to <hi>Superiours, Continuall Prayer</hi> practised
according to the degrees of it, still more
and more pure and Spirituall, a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of all dutyes and even ordinarie
actions in vertue of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Vnion in
Spirit</hi> with <hi>God</hi> &amp;c. I doe not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of him an account of <hi>Raptures, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies,
Passive Vnions</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> in which
a pure soule only receives <hi>Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences:</hi>
For these things he derides as
<hi>Phantasticall Enthusiasms,</hi> and yet all
ages have mentioned them, and affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
innumerable Examples of them,
and they are recorded by persons emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for Piety and Learning.</p>
               <p>42. But the <hi>Doctour</hi> has one argument
unanswerable, which iustifies him to
call that language <hi>unintelligible Canting,</hi>
by which certain <hi>Mystick Divines</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
as well as they can, to express
the most pure operations of the soule
herself, and likewise of <hi>God</hi> upon the
soule in <hi>Contemplative Prayer:</hi> and this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49053:32"/>
argument is drawn from a treasvre of
most deep <hi>Humility.</hi> His argument is
this; <hi>I, even I the most learned, and all
comprehending Doctour Stillingfleet doe
not understand the language of such Mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
therefore it is unintelligible Canting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>43. Yet notwithstanding this more
then Herculean argument, I believe I
can oppose against him an <hi>Antagonist</hi>
who will have the boldnes to maintain
that he will answer this argument, and
demonstrate it not to be concluding.
And this is a certain <hi>Holy man</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
of himself that in a wonderfull
<hi>Extasy</hi> he found himself present in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,</hi>
and there saw and heard (as he
thought) God only knows what. Now
what soever it was that he saw and
heard, he was, no doubt, willing to
have communicated it to his brethren,
but he had not the power to doe it.
No human language could afford words
to express matters so elevated and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.
For if it could, I am assured he,
who was the greatest <hi>master of language</hi>
that perhaps ever was, had not failed to
do it. Nay more, which still encreases
the wonder, though he professes that
he really saw and heard these inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49053:33"/>
glorious things, yet he could not
determin whether all the while his
corporall sences, externall or internall,
were employed in this <hi>Divine Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>44. This was surely, according to the
<hi>Doctours</hi> grounds, the greatest <hi>Fanatick</hi>
that ever was, yea the <hi>father of all Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
Yet the <hi>Doctour</hi> dares not call him
so,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. v. 2. 3. 4.</note> after he is told that this was <hi>S. Paul:</hi>
and that he it was who describes the
<hi>Revelations</hi> communicated to him by
<hi>Gods Divine Spirit:</hi> describes them, I
say, by not describing them, but by
professing that no human language
could describe them, nor humane fancy
comprehend them. This certainly the
<hi>Doctour</hi> will not deny to have been a
<hi>Passive Vnion</hi> (so derided by him) of <hi>S.
Pauls</hi> soule with <hi>God,</hi> for he contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing actively either to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
or enioying of it.</p>
               <p>45. If therefore <hi>Mystick Writers,</hi>
many of them persons both of great
Sanctity and Learning, in endeavouring
to describe what passed in their soules
during <hi>Vnions</hi> far inferiour to those of
<hi>S. Paul,</hi> are forced to make Expressions,
out of the common road, and not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49053:33"/>
agreeing with <hi>School Philosophy;</hi> if obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that in <hi>pure Contemplative Prayer</hi>
their own operations, and the <hi>infusions</hi>
of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> are so in time in the soule,
that it seems to them that there is as it
were a <hi>Region</hi> of it beyond the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which they think fit
to call the <hi>Apex mentis,</hi> and <hi>Fundus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi>
the <hi>Doctour</hi> might without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
guilt have abstained from imputing
<hi>Fanaticism</hi> to <hi>Ludo vicus Blosius,</hi> or <hi>M.
Cressy,</hi> for transcribing such expressions.
But this is a <hi>Sycophancy</hi> inexcusable in
the <hi>Doctour,</hi> who mentions such <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
phrases</hi> on purpose to deride them as
unintelligible Non-sence, and at the
same time omitts the setting down ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
which interpret them.</p>
               <p>46. <hi>But there is one speciall</hi> Phrase
<hi>which above the rest cited by</hi> M. Cressy,
<hi>exposes him to the</hi> Doctours <hi>utmost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
This is where it is sayd that,</hi> In
the supreme Degree of Contemplative Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the soule is so united to God as if nothing
were existent but God and the soule:<note place="margin">P. 334.</note> Yea
so far is the soule from reflecting on her own
existence, that it seems to her God and she
are not distinct, but one only thing. This
is called by some Mysticks an Vnion of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49053:34"/>
with nothing in which the soule comes
to a feeling of her not being, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the not being of Creatures: the
which is indeed a reall Truth. True, says
the Doctour, this is indeed either a reall
Truth or else Intollerable Non-sense.</p>
               <p>47. Now I suppose it is not for the
<hi>Doctours</hi> interest to seem to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
any satisfaction from persons iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by him: Therefore addressing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to any indifferent <hi>Reader,</hi> I doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that the most supreme affirmative
<hi>Notion</hi> that we can have of <hi>God</hi> is that
which is implyed in his most adorable
incommunicable name of <hi>Iehova,</hi> or as
himself interprets it <hi>[Sum qui Sum] I am
what I am,</hi> which imports an <hi>infinite
Vniversall Plenitude of Being.</hi> Therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
as the <hi>Schoole Doctours</hi> say, if we
hold to the Notion of <hi>Being,</hi> between
the Being of <hi>God</hi> and the limited, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated
<hi>Being</hi> of Creatures, there is an
infinite distance, and by consequence
Creatures compared with <hi>God</hi> have
more of <hi>Not-being,</hi> then they have of
<hi>Being;</hi> in which regard their denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
so considered, ought rather to
be taken from <hi>not-being,</hi> then from
<hi>being.</hi> Thus the <hi>Sthooles:</hi> which if they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49053:34"/>
speak <hi>Nonsense</hi> (for my part I think they
doe not) yet surely the nonsense is not
<hi>intolerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>48. But moreover <hi>Mystick Divines</hi>
though they acknowledge the <hi>Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
Totality,</hi> and <hi>Vniversality</hi> of <hi>Gods
Being;</hi> yet they rather chuse [to which
choice the Nature of <hi>Contemplative
Prayer</hi> even forces them] to reiect all
distinct, <hi>affirmative Notions</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and
his perfections, as coming Infinitely
short of his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and which
indeed are falsely applied to him, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as they are comprehended by
us: and they frame to themselves a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Notion</hi> of him, by separating from
him all <hi>Attributes</hi> whatsoever compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by us, because as such they are
indeed imperfections. And to instill
into our minds such a Notion of <hi>God,</hi> of
all others least imperfect, he is pleased
to describe himself in <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be
<hi>inaccessible light,</hi> that is, light though infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
glorious, yet to us <hi>invisible,</hi> and
<hi>invisible because of the excess of its Visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
Hence he is sayd to <hi>dwell in darknes,</hi>
and <hi>to make darknes his secret place,</hi> and
<hi>his pavilion round about him to be dark
waters and thick clouds of the skyes.</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49053:35"/>
In this darknes it is that <hi>God</hi> is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated
in pure <hi>Spirituall Prayer,</hi> in which,
all Images and positive Notions of the
Divinity being reiected, an <hi>Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Nothing</hi> remains, to which the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
is united, and in whose presence all
<hi>Created Beings</hi> are <hi>annihilated.</hi> In this
darkness therefore contemplative Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
have, as it were, an experimentall
perception of what <hi>Schoolmen</hi> deduce
from reasoning.</p>
               <p>49. It seems now to mee that a
weaker Capacity then the Doctours
may perceive in this no <hi>intolerable Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense.</hi>
Yea I must add, that here the
<hi>Doctour</hi> gives a manifest proof of his
<hi>dishonesty,</hi> in wilfully leaving out that
which evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly explains <hi>M. Cressy's</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
which if it had not been concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from the Readers would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
his Assertion touching the <hi>Not-being
of Creatures</hi> to be most rationall.
<q>For thus M. <hi>Cressy</hi> (in <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi>
Treat. 3. p. 304.) treating of <hi>the State
of Perfection,</hi> writes: In this <hi>State</hi> the
soule comes to a feeling indeed of <hi>her
Not being,</hi> and by consequence of <hi>the
Not being of Creatures:</hi> The which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is reall Truth: Not as if the soule
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49053:35"/>
or other creatures either did cease ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Naturall Being; or as
if a natural Being were indeed no
reall Being (as <hi>F. Benedict Canfield
doth</hi> seem to determin) But because
all sinfull adhesion by affection to
creatures being annihilated, then
<hi>they remain (as to the soule) only in that
true Being which they have in God, by
dependance on him, and relation to him,
so that he</hi> (alone) <hi>is all in all.</hi> Whereas
while we sinfully adhere unto them,
by staying in them with Love, we
carry our selves towards them as if
we thought them to have a <hi>Being</hi> or
subsistance <hi>of and in themselves,</hi> and not
of <hi>God</hi> only, and that they might be
<hi>loved for themselves,</hi> without refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>God:</hi> Which is <hi>the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Errour and root of all Sin.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>50. Thus the <hi>Doctour</hi> deales with
his <hi>Catholick Adversaries.</hi> He can at
pleasure make them write <hi>Non-sense</hi> by
concealing their <hi>Sense.</hi> And thus also he
treats <hi>M. Cressy</hi> again in repeating seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
passages of <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> touching
<hi>Contemplative Prayer:</hi> For selecting from
severall places certain abstruse <hi>Words</hi>
and <hi>Phrases</hi> made use of by <hi>Mysticks</hi> to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49053:36"/>
express, as well as they can, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
he presents them all together
in a heap before his Readers eyes, and
then miscalls them <hi>Vnintelligible Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
whilst in the mean time he leaves
out the interpretation which <hi>M. Cressy</hi>
gives of those <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phrases,</hi> to make
them <hi>intelligible.</hi> Truly it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some scruple now that I take noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of any thing that such an Adversary
as the <hi>Doctour</hi> shewes himself, doth or
can write on an argument so unfitt for
Controversy as <hi>Contemplative Prayer</hi> is,
which cannot but he disgustfull to such
a sensuall <hi>Palat</hi> as he shews his to be,
being willing to corrupt the <hi>Palats</hi> also
of his Readers. It may be e're long they
will see a <hi>Treatise</hi> on this Argument,
demonstrating the substance of what
so ever the <hi>Doctour</hi> finds fault withall in
<hi>M. Cressy's Sancta Sophia,</hi> to be suitable
to what the <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>Gods Church</hi> have
both from Tradition, and from their
own experience also, delivered on that
most Divine Subject. And the <hi>Doctour</hi>
shall have free leave (without any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>Reply</hi>) once more to call what those
Holy Fathers write <hi>unintelligible Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
and <hi>intolerable Non-sence,</hi> though
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49053:36"/>
their expressions be parallelled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by numerous <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
In the mean time,<note place="margin">P. 336</note> for the Readers
sake, I will here add some Reflexions
upon what the <hi>Doctour</hi> has written.</p>
               <p>51. He proceeds further, saying
That the <hi>utmost effect of contemplative
Prayer if intelligible and practicable, is
gross Enthusiasm.</hi> And why? Because,
forsooth <hi>M. Cressy</hi> says <hi>that by a diligent
practise of such internall Spirituall Prayer
the soule receives from God a heavenly light
and Inspiration for her direction in all her
actions,</hi> according to the <hi>Psalmists</hi>
words. <hi>Accedite ad Deum &amp; illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>
and according to the Prayer in his
own <hi>Churches Liturgy,</hi> borrowed from
the <hi>Roman:</hi> [Fifth Sunday after Easter]
<hi>Lord from whom all good things doe
come, grant us thy humble servants that
by thy holy Inspiration, we may think those
things that be good, and by thy mercyfull
guiding we may perform the same.</hi> The
word <hi>Inspiration</hi> therefore needs not
trouble the <hi>Doctour:</hi> neither by it is any
other thing meant, but <hi>Divine Grace,</hi>
which, sayes he, none denyes.</p>
               <p>52. Yet he must know that this <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
Grace</hi> obtaind by <hi>Spirituall Prayer</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:49053:37"/>
constantly exercised, though it be in its
nature and Kind the same which every
good <hi>Christian</hi> enioyes, yet the lights
and motions of it extend much farther,
even to the directing a person not only
in necessary dutyes, but to the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiing
of all his actions, otherwise in
their own nature indifferent, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
them for the perfectiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the soule in <hi>Divine love,</hi> in soe much
as those actions which are performed by
ordinary good <hi>Christians</hi> meerly out of
an impulse of <hi>Nature,</hi> or for some sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
satisfaction, are by these done in
obedience to the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to them.</p>
               <p>53. And whereas to distinguish these
<hi>Inspirations</hi> from those pretended to by
<hi>Fanaticks,</hi> it was sayd, that in <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative
persons these direct rather to not
doing, then doing, when both these seem
otherwise equally indifferent,</hi> I wonder
why the <hi>Doctour</hi> should be displeased
with this. He may remember that in
the time of the <hi>late Vsurper,</hi> when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was a great leading <hi>Preacher,</hi> all the
actions almost of his <hi>Brethren</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to come from a <hi>Divine light</hi> and
<hi>Inspiration</hi> all warranted by the <hi>Bible,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:49053:37"/>
which <hi>Light</hi> (more, it seems, to the
<hi>Doctours</hi> mind) directed them to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but doing, viz: to reform <hi>Religion,</hi>
to rebell against their <hi>King,</hi> to pluck
down <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> to multiply <hi>Sects,</hi> to
usurp the office of <hi>Preaching</hi> without
any <hi>Vocation,</hi> to imprison, Pillage, kill
their fellow subiects and the like: But
no such effects proceed from the lights
and <hi>Inspirations</hi> of <hi>Internall livers</hi> among
<hi>Catholicks:</hi> they (having the same Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
that <hi>S. Mary Magdalen</hi> had) lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
the many businesses to <hi>Martha,</hi> vnles
<hi>God</hi> by their lawfull <hi>Superiours,</hi> calls
them to externall <hi>Emploiments,</hi> which
when he does, he enables them to
perform them with greater <hi>Perfection,</hi>
as we see by the <hi>Conversion</hi> of many <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
performed by such as had spent a
great part of their lives in Solitude and
<hi>Contemplation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>54. It is most certain that if <hi>Luther,
Calvin, Tindall</hi> and such <hi>Reformers</hi> had
by <hi>Prayer</hi> disposed themselves for such
lights as these, and also followed the
direction of them, they would never
have procured warre and bloodshed,
destruction of Kingdoms, rebellions of
Subjects, tearing asunder Gods Church
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49053:38"/>
and sacrilegiously invading its revenues
neither would they to satisfie their lusts
have incesttuously polluted themselves
with <hi>Consecrated Virgins:</hi> in a word they
would have done all things contrary to
what they have done. And if the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
himself had followed the guidance
of such a <hi>Light,</hi> he would never have
published such a <hi>Book,</hi> in which preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to demonstrate that <hi>Salvation</hi> can
scarce possibly be attayned in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church,</hi> whatsoever is alledged
by him which truly concerns the <hi>Church</hi>
it self, may be contained in twenty or
thirty pages, whereas the <hi>Book</hi> it self
consists of five or Six hundred, all the
rest being Scurrilous <hi>buffonries,</hi> petulant
revilings of <hi>Gods Saints,</hi> imputing to the
<hi>Church</hi> the Doctrins and practises of
madmen or <hi>Sectaries</hi> condemned by the
<hi>Church</hi> herself, and any thing that he
could take out of <hi>Dunghills</hi> which
might be serviceable for his unchristian
purpose to eradicate out of his Readers
hearts <hi>Charity</hi> and all sense of humanity:
and all this without any provocation, as
if, enraged to see that the same merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
indulgence is not denyed to <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
alone, which is allowed to himself,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49053:38"/>
and all <hi>Sects</hi> among us which vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
conspired to his <hi>Majesties</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction,
and of which not any one to
this day has renounced the <hi>Principles</hi>
which led them thereto: as if, I say, in
that rage his design was to expose inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and peaceable subiects to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Contempts, affronts, hatred, and
mischievous attempts of their fellow
Subiects, to the disturbance of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
peace and the renewing of our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
calamities and <hi>Tragedies,</hi> to which
he knows that thirty years since, such
<hi>books</hi> and <hi>Sermons</hi> were made use of as a
<hi>Prologue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>55. He must give me leave to add
hereto, that in the <hi>Principles</hi> at the end
of his <hi>Book, giving an account of the Faith
of Protestants,</hi> he has layd a foundation
to support and iustify not only all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Sects,</hi> but the worst effects of
them, I mean, the late <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and any
other that may follow hereafter: I will
not say this was his <hi>Intention,</hi> but the
consequence may easily be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>56. For in the said Principles this being
layd down by him as a ground of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy,
That every sober enquirer into
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49053:39"/>
Scriptures may be infaillibly certain of all
necessary Truths contained in them without
any obligation to consult or however to obey,
Ecclesiasticall Superiours and Teachers:</hi>
does it not necessarily follow, that all
<hi>Sectaries</hi> are equally iustifiable, since it
is impossible, without looking into
their thoughts, to evince against them
that they have not <hi>enquired soberly?</hi> What
monstrous opinions now may not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be justified? and what possibility
of confuting them? now if among
such opinions this be one, <hi>That it is
the necessary Duty of a Christian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to contribute all that is in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
even goods and life it self, to sett up the
true Religion, that is, his own Sect, and
this against all Power whatsoever civill or
Ecclesiasticall, which shall seek to oppress
it,</hi> what will the <hi>Doctour,</hi> standing to
his own Principles, say hereto, if he
had a mind to oppose it? Now that such
an <hi>Opinion</hi> may possibly spring up, and
the <hi>Assertours</hi> of it may pretend that it
is grounded on evident <hi>Scripture,</hi> the
<hi>Doctour</hi> himself will not deny, since I
am sure he remembers, and has reason
to do so, that this was the <hi>Architectoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Principle,</hi> common to all <hi>Sects</hi> in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49053:39"/>
like <hi>Rebellion:</hi> this was thundred out in
<hi>Pulpits,</hi> of this all <hi>Pamphlets</hi> were full:
the <hi>Bible</hi> and nothing but the <hi>Bible</hi> was
all their <hi>warrant,</hi> the <hi>Bible</hi> was the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>
carried up aloft before their Troops,
as if the <hi>King, Bishops,</hi> and all their party
had been professed Enemies to the <hi>Bible,</hi>
or had grounded their <hi>Religion</hi> upon the
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> whereas indeed all these <hi>Sects</hi>
had turned <hi>Christs</hi> Doctrine into that
bloody law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this the <hi>Doctour</hi> zealously
and furiously against the <hi>Papists</hi> still
contends for putting the Bible into all
mens hands, and assures them that they
are the only <hi>Legall Iudges</hi> of the sense of
it in <hi>Necessaries,</hi> upon condition they
will only say that they are <hi>Sober Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
into it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>57. This seems to me to be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
consequence of the <hi>Doctours Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;</hi>
a <hi>Principle</hi> never acknowledged
in <hi>Gods Church</hi> for above fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
years by any one <hi>Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
or by any unless by some
whom the <hi>Doctour</hi> himself will call
<hi>Hereticks.</hi> If the <hi>Doctour</hi> think I doe
not speak truth, lett him search, and lett
him employ his freinds to search into
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49053:40"/>
                  <hi>Libraries:</hi> let them consult all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and all <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills:</hi>
and when they have done, and
seen themselves deserted by all <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
and Vertually condemnd and
<hi>Anathematized</hi> by all <hi>Councills</hi> (which
pretend to have right to teach, and to
oblige Christians to yeeld their assent)
will it not follow that his <hi>Religion</hi> hath
a most pittifully unstable and sandy
Foundation? But to return from this
digression to an argument more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Doctour, the <hi>Fanaticism</hi> by
him imputed to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
with regard to the Prayer of <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>58. Whereas <hi>M. Cressy</hi> in his <hi>Sancta
Sophia</hi> among severall things by which
<hi>Liberty of Spirit</hi> may be hindered,<note place="margin">P. 336.</note> reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
this for one: <hi>The doing actions meerly
for edification:</hi> the <hi>Doctour</hi> in scorn
adjoyns hereto these words, <hi>A most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and Apostolicall Doctrine!</hi> These
words shew that the <hi>Doctour</hi> likes not
that saying: but I cannot imagin what
reason he had for it. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> indeed
requires <hi>that our light should shine before
men, that they seeing our good works might</hi>
(being edified) <hi>glorifie our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49053:40"/>
But this concerns only such good
works as our <hi>Duty</hi> obliges vs to doe in
<hi>Publick.</hi> But as for other duties, such
as is <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Fasting,</hi> he bids us retire
into our closets to practise them there,
without an eye to the <hi>Edifiing</hi> others,
and condemns the <hi>Pharisees</hi> for doing
them <hi>that they may be seen of men.</hi> In like
manner those who are called to an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life</hi> and Solitude, for them to
quitt their proper <hi>Exercises</hi> to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
on purpose to do actions good in
themselves, for no other end, but
<hi>Meerly</hi> to give a good example for the
<hi>Edification of others</hi> was there iustly
esteemed a prejudice to the <hi>liberty of
Spirit</hi> necessary for their state.</p>
               <p>59. But moreover I would ask the
<hi>Doctour,</hi> whether being at <hi>Church</hi> in a
<hi>publick Duty,</hi> and not having any <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>
himself at present, he would
esteem it a commendable action to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to much fervour, by lifting vp his
eyes or beating his breast, and this <hi>meerly</hi>
and <hi>only</hi> to the end that others seeing
him might be <hi>edifyed,</hi> himself being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the better for such grimaces? or
would he give an <hi>Alms</hi> before people
<hi>meerly for their edification,</hi> and not out of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49053:41"/>
a Motive of <hi>Charity</hi> inherent in himself?
Truly if he should doe all this in such a
manner, I should be none of his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
And much lesse do I, or I think,
any good <hi>Christian</hi> admire him for his
<hi>Book</hi> so full af all manner of Vnchristian
affections, which surely he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be written <hi>meerly for edification,</hi>
and for which I hope his Judgement is
not soe perverted as to expect a reward
from <hi>God,</hi> who litle esteems witt wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout
Charity, or rather witt shewed

<hi>Truth also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>60. After this the <hi>Doctour</hi> out of the
same <hi>Book</hi> mentioning the <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Favours</hi> which innumerable <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Writers both ancient and Modern,<note place="margin">P. 337.</note>
do testify to have been communicated
by <hi>Almighty God</hi> to his servants after a
constant exercise of <hi>Internall Prayer,</hi>
and <hi>Mortification,</hi> the <hi>Doctour,</hi> I say,
would have his Reader think that his
deriding of these is a sufficient confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And I may more justly think that
a sober <hi>Reader</hi> will Judge that the only
mentioning of a proceeding so contrary
to all rules of reasoning is a sufficient
<hi>Reply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49053:41"/>61. What hath been hitherto sayd is
even too much touching the defence of
a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> published by <hi>M. Cressy,</hi>
in which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
concerned, and which was compiled
for the use of good devout humble Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
and not at all for persons of the
<hi>Doctours</hi> temper. Those eminently
learned and Pious <hi>Fathers,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>R. F. Leander a S. Martino</hi> who
with great care perused the severall
Spirituall <hi>Treatises</hi> written by <hi>R. F.
Baker,</hi> and gave their <hi>Approbations</hi> of
them, were persons in all regards for
their profound universall Learning far
exalted above the censures of <hi>Malignant
Pedants:</hi> and the devout soules to whose
practise they recomended those pious
<hi>Instructions,</hi> have reaped such fruits
from them, such effectuall helps far
their advancement in the <hi>Divine Love</hi>
and <hi>Spirituall Perfection,</hi> that the <hi>bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foneries</hi>
of such a <hi>Doctour</hi> will only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this effect upon them, to give <hi>God</hi>
daily thanks that they have escaped
from a <hi>Church</hi> in which blasphemous
<hi>Invectives</hi> against <hi>Gods Saints</hi> and the
<hi>Science of Saints</hi> are not only permitted,
but applauded and rewarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:49053:42"/>62. None can justly wonder that a
soule so manifestly voyd of <hi>Divine Love</hi>
should want both light and tast in such
things. <hi>Daamantem &amp; sentit quod dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
saith <hi>S. Augustin.</hi> But does the
<hi>Doctour</hi> hope that because he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
not and therefore proudly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns
<hi>Misticall Theology</hi> and the <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises</hi>
of an <hi>Internall life,</hi> the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of it will abate
their esteem of that <hi>Blessing,</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
proves that <hi>Gods Holy Spirit</hi> does
not communicate his most sublime and
precious Gifts to <hi>Sects</hi> divided from the
<hi>Church,</hi> of which scarce any pretend to
them, and those that doe so, do evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew by their contempt of all <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
renunciation of all <hi>Christian Charity,</hi>
furious and restles attempts of new <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations</hi>
and <hi>Seditious Combinations</hi> to
the ruine of all <hi>Peace,</hi> that it is <hi>a black
Spirit,</hi> which was <hi>a Murderer from the
beginning,</hi> by which they are agitated?
Whereas those humble, devout, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
soules among <hi>Catholicks,</hi> stiled by
the <hi>Doctour, Fanaticks,</hi> are so far from
any intention of disturbing <hi>Peace,</hi> and
so entirely submitted to Lawfull <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
(the Spirit of Prophets being</hi> so indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49053:42"/>
                  <hi>Subiect to the Prophets</hi>) that they
are in a continuall readines to renounce
all <hi>Reuelations, Apparitions, impulses</hi> and
whatsoever extraordinary <hi>Visitations,</hi> if
they seem any wayes to occasion in
them <hi>Doubts</hi> of the <hi>Churches Faith,</hi> or to
prejudice <hi>Obedience</hi> to her <hi>Ordonnances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>63. The <hi>Doctour</hi> I am sure, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his supposed Universall reading,
cannot be ignorant, that such <hi>Fanaticks</hi>
as these, though invisible to the busy
World, were yet esteemd <hi>Chariots of
Israël and the horsemen thereof.</hi> That
pious, wise, and Potent <hi>Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>
have consulted them in their
greatest affairs, and have acknowledged
themselves obliged to them for miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Victories over <hi>Tyrants,</hi> resolving
upon warre by their encouragement,
beginning them with their benediction,
and conquering by the assistance of their
Prayers: By their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and not their
<hi>Disputations,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> has triumphed
over <hi>Heresies,</hi> and the world been freed
from Plagues and Mortalities. At their
Names <hi>Devills</hi> have trembled, and by
their command, though absent, those
proud Spirits have with a mixture of
feare and rage quitted their habitation
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49053:43"/>
in the Bodies of unhappy men. Yet the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the <hi>Doctour</hi> dares deride, and because
they are patient, will not perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
till it be too lare, but will justify
still his impious boldnes and petulancy.</p>
               <p>64. It is truly a sad thing to consider
with what disposition of mind persons
qualifyed, as (it seems) the <hi>Doctour</hi> is,
do apply themselves to the reading of
<hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> written by <hi>Catholicks.</hi> It
is as daggers piercing their hearts when
they find no advantage to expresse their
malignity: If in a great volume full of
most heavenly <hi>Instructions</hi> for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of all vertues and dutyes to <hi>God</hi> and
man, they can find but a line or two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they think they can make
their Venenious teeth to enter, by that
line or two they become edified, that is
comfortable nourrishment to their
minds, the whole Book besides being
nauseous to them; Would not <hi>damned</hi>
soules in <hi>Hell,</hi> if <hi>Spirituall Books</hi> were
sent them, thus read and thus descant
upon them?</p>
               <p>65. Now whether the <hi>Doctour</hi> (and
some other of his freinds) has not
shewed himself such a <hi>Reader</hi> of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Books</hi> truly innocent, devout, and in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49053:43"/>
which the breathing of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> may,
as it were, be perceived, let any indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<hi>Reader</hi> of his <hi>Book</hi> be judge. How
many of such <hi>Books,</hi> from <hi>S. Gregory</hi> to
<hi>S. Ignatius</hi> his time, does the <hi>Doctour</hi>
shew that he has read, how many <hi>Lives</hi>
of <hi>Saints,</hi> how many Treatises of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi>
and among them he will give
me leave to name <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> and
poor <hi>Mother Iuliana?</hi> And what account
does he give to his <hi>Readers</hi> of the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi>
Benefit reaped by him from his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
reading? He it seems is not able
out of them all to suggest any point of
Instruction in <hi>Christian Doctrin,</hi> not
one good affection to <hi>God,</hi> not the least
encouragement to a vertuous holy life.
All these things are vanished out of his
memory, and evaporated out of his
brain, having never affected his heart.
What then does he yeild for his <hi>Readers</hi>
edification? He teaches him in reading
such <hi>Books</hi> to pronounce mimically and
Scornfully what he finds there concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Miracles,</hi> how wel soever attested,
and concerning <hi>Divine Favours</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
by <hi>God</hi> to his Speciall <hi>Servants:</hi>
and this being done, to call them <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
and so doeing to esteem such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49053:44"/>
sufficiently confuted, and such
<hi>Spirituall Books</hi> sufficiently disparaged.
He teaches him to snatch out of a great
<hi>Book</hi> three or four passages lamely and
imperfectly cited, to give what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to them he pleases, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he does not understand, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understand
them, to pronounce them
still <hi>Fanaticall,</hi> and there is an end of
those Books: By the <hi>Doctours</hi> good will
no <hi>Protestant</hi> hereafter must receiue
the least good from them, vnless pride,
malice, and contempt of godlines be
good things.</p>
               <p>66. Now having named in the last
place poor <hi>Mother Iuliana,</hi> a devout
<hi>Anchoret</hi> about three hundred years sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
living in <hi>Norwich,</hi> I must needs Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
my wonder, what could move his
Spleen and choler against her litle <hi>Book.</hi>
It is true, her language to the ears of
this age, seems exotick: But it is such
as was spoken in her time: therefore she
may be excused: Her expressions tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<hi>Gods</hi> favours to her are homely,
but that surely is no sin. For affections
to <hi>God</hi> are set down with great simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
indeed, but they are withall cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and fervent, and apt to imprint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49053:44"/>
in the heart of an unpreiudiced
<hi>Reader.</hi> The sense and tast she shews
to have had of <hi>Gods Speciall love</hi> to his
servants, of the omnipotent efficacy of
his <hi>Grace,</hi> and his impregnable defence
and watchfullnes over his <hi>Elect,</hi> to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them finally from all dangers of
<hi>Tentations,</hi> is indeed admirable. Yet the
<hi>Doctour</hi> has no eyes to see any of these
things. But through what glasses he
looked when he spied out <hi>blasphemy</hi> in
her Writing, I am not able to say: <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi>
which never hitherto could be
observed by so many learned and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi>
persons as have perused them. But
it is no wonder that <hi>Spiders</hi> should suck
and digest into <hi>poyson</hi> the most whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
nourishment.</p>
               <p>67. What hath been hitherto said of
<hi>Contemplative Prayer</hi> is but even too
much to such an <hi>Adversary,</hi> it being a
Subiect too <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> to be
treated of in a <hi>Polemicall Discourse</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
an Opponent of the <hi>Doctours</hi>
temper: Who, I think, is the <hi>first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Writer</hi> that ever made that an
argument of <hi>Controversy</hi> against the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church.</hi> The only <hi>Excuse</hi> that I
can devise for so unreasonable a quarrel
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49053:45"/>
begun by him, is his indulgence to a
froward passion conceived by him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any provocation, against <hi>M. Cressy,</hi>
who severall years since published a
<hi>Book</hi> on that Subiect, called <hi>Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia:</hi>
in which <hi>Book</hi> notwithstanding he
challenges nothing to himself, but the
Labour of making Collections and the
Method of it. In that regard therefore
it may be permitted him to commend
the <hi>Directions</hi> for the Exercise of <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Spirituall Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Practise</hi>
of <hi>all Christian Vertues</hi> in <hi>Perfection</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it. And this, in despight of
the <hi>Doctours</hi> unmerited malice, he does
with such confidence, that he dares
promise to himself that if any sober;
well affected <hi>Reader,</hi> though a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,</hi>
and though at present one of the
<hi>Doctours</hi> admirers, shall seriously and
with an humble heart peruse it, he will
either apply himself to the practise of
the excellent <hi>Instructions</hi> contained in it,
or bewayle his want of <hi>Spirituall coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge</hi>
in not daring effectually to aspire to
so glorious an <hi>Attempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>68. <q>Wee must not here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
two <hi>Notable Saints,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 244.</note> which as
the <hi>Doctour</hi> confidently pretends
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49053:45"/>
have given him sufficient advantage
so to denigrate their persons, as by
them to cast an aspersion on the
<hi>Church.</hi> These are a <hi>Holy Widow</hi> and a
<hi>Virgin, S. Brigit,</hi> and <hi>S. Catharine of
Siena.</hi> Both these had <hi>Supernaturall
Revelations:</hi> therefore says the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi>
they were <hi>Fanaticks.</hi> But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
their <hi>Revelations</hi> touching the
<hi>Conception of our Blessed Lady</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
one the other, and the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
of both are allowed, and of
one confirmed by the <hi>Church</hi> in a
<hi>Councill:</hi> and by consequence the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
with assurance pronounces the
<hi>Church</hi> to be a favourer not only of
<hi>Fanaticism,</hi> but <hi>Errour</hi> also. To this
purpose the <hi>Doctour.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>69. Hereto I answer, 1. That all
<hi>Catholicks</hi> acknowledge both these to
have been <hi>Saints.</hi> 2. And that each of
them hath been favoured with <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
Revelations</hi> the <hi>publick Office</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> testifyes. Thus much is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed:
but it is utterly denyed that the
<hi>Church</hi> does so approve them, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
any one to make iust exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them: as wee see many <hi>Writers</hi>
on both sides have done: <hi>she</hi> judges
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49053:46"/>
they may in generall be usefull to stirr
up devotion in <hi>Readers</hi> minds, but <hi>she</hi>
does not confirme them as infallible.
For how could it be known to the Pope
or <hi>Councill</hi> that any <hi>Speciall Revelation</hi>
made, or pretended to be made to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was from <hi>God,</hi> unles the person
also testify them by Miracles? And it is
observable that when examination is
made of <hi>Miracles</hi> in order to the <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation</hi>
of any <hi>Saint,</hi> the testimony of
women will not be received. Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagination is stronger in them then
judgement, and whatsoever is esteemed
by them to be pious, is easily concluded
by them to be true. This I say upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that such <hi>Revelations,</hi> were not
pretended by persons interessed on both
sides of the Controversy about the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
Conception.</hi> And particularly
touching <hi>S. Catharine of Siena,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Suar. in 3. S Th q 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Suares</hi>
affirms <hi>That not any who have written her
life have made mention of this Revelation.</hi>
It will suffise therefore to set down he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
what two illustrious <hi>Catholick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
have declared touching this Point.
The former is <hi>S. Antoninus</hi> mentioned
by the <hi>Doctour.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>If you say,</hi> saith he, <hi>that
some Saints, have had a Revelation of these
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49053:46"/>
things, as S. Brigit: it is to be observed that
other Saints who have wrought Miracles,
as S. Catharin of Siena, have had a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the contrary. And since true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
doe sometimes think that a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from Divine Revelation which they
utter of themselves, there is not inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
to say, that such Revelations were
not from God, but human dreames. An
example hereof may be found in the Prophet
Nathan speaking to David proposing to
him his dessign to build a Temple to God.
For David though he answered him by a
Spirit of Prophecy, the contrary hereof
after wards appeared.</hi>

hath these words: <hi>I doe indeed honour

but touching the Revelations had by them,

               <p>70. I am sorry I cannot impute it to
so harmles a <hi>Principle</hi> as <hi>ignorance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 248.</note> that
the <hi>Doctour</hi> speaking of two <hi>Writers</hi>
who both of them <hi>rejected these preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Revelations of both these Saints as illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and fancies, adds, What becoms

then of the Popes and Councills Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
who have approved both?</hi> By which
words an unwary <hi>Reader</hi> will not
doubt but that an <hi>Oecumenical Councill</hi>
had made a <hi>Canon</hi> with an <hi>Anathema</hi>
against all those who should not ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge
all the <hi>Revelations</hi> of <hi>S. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git</hi>
to have been <hi>Divine,</hi> and the belief
of them necessary to Salvation. Whenas
all that was done by the <hi>Councill</hi> was,
upon occasion of Invectives made
against those <hi>Revelations</hi> by many <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi>
to require <hi>Ioannes a Turrecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi>
to peruse and give his judgment of
them, which being favourable, the
<hi>Councill,</hi> saith he, approved them, that
is, freely permitted them to be read, as
contayning nothing contrary to <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>good Manners.</hi> Notwithstanding
which kind of approbation, we see li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
taken, and with leave enough
from the <hi>Church,</hi> by many <hi>Writers</hi> to
decry both the one and the other, and
there is scarce a <hi>Catholick</hi> alive that
thinks he has an obligation to believe

                  <note place="margin">P. 235.</note> that it

                  </q> Indeed
if he could prove that any such <hi>Points</hi> of

be declared <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> upon
no surer grounds than <hi>modern Miracles</hi>
or <hi>Revelations,</hi> it would have been the
<hi>Maister-piece</hi> of all that he has, or ever
shall write. But this he durst not say
explicitely, though perhaps he is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>Readers</hi> should understand that
to have been his meaning: For then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49053:48"/>
all the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Gods Church</hi>
would have confuted him, since they
professe that <hi>the only ground of their Faith

by Christ and his Apostles, and conveyed to

               </p>
               <p>72. Now this the <hi>Doctour</hi> being I

be esteemed a preiudice to <hi>Catholick
Faith</hi> that <hi>Almighty God</hi> to confound
<hi>Hereticks</hi> and establish the belief of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi>
should in severall succeeding
ages afford particular <hi>Revelations,</hi> or
enable his servants to work <hi>Miracles:</hi>
And that he has done so, we have such
a <hi>Cloud of Witnesses,</hi> that credit must be
denyed to <hi>History</hi> in generall, if none
of such Witnesses must be admitted. As
for the <hi>Doctour,</hi> the only expedient
made use of by him to invalidate their
testimony, is to produce it in a stile of
<hi>Raillery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>73. As for the instituting <hi>Festivalls,</hi>
for example of the <hi>Conception of our
Blessed Lady</hi> &amp;c. it cannot be denyed but
it is a <hi>Lawfull Church-institution:</hi> and
might at any time on any occasion be
appointed: And if on some <hi>Revelation,</hi>
supposed <hi>Divine,</hi> an occasion was given
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49053:48"/>
to the <hi>Pope</hi> to ordain it, this can be no
prejudice to it, being a Glorifying of
<hi>God</hi> for the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> the <hi>Mother
of our Lord,</hi> her being either <hi>preserved,</hi>
(as some <hi>Catholicks</hi> say) or at least
<hi>Cleansed</hi> (as others) from the common
pollution of <hi>Originall Sin</hi> at her <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
without any determining which
of these two hapned to her, and so the
<hi>Festivall</hi> is equally observed by <hi>Catholicks</hi>
of either Opinion. The like may be
said of the <hi>Feast of Corpus Christi,</hi> of <hi>S.
Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangëll</hi> &amp;c. by none of
which the least alteration was made in
the <hi>Common Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>74. But truly we have great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to the <hi>Doctour,</hi> though I believe
he does not expect wee should thank
him, for imputing to the <hi>Church</hi> the
frantick <hi>Preachings</hi> and practises of <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and at the same time telling us,
that they were excommunicated and
other wayes punished by <hi>Popes, Princes</hi>
and <hi>Bishops.</hi> Indeed it is a terrible <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to prove it dangerous to live in a
<hi>Church,</hi> because there <hi>Heresies, false
Revelations</hi> and impure actions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by it. If <hi>Holy Institutours</hi> of
<hi>Religious Orders</hi> could with their <hi>Rules</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49053:49"/>
give also power and will to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
not to transgress them, the world
would be even too happy. But this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
a <hi>Created power</hi> to doe, it is even
necessary that <hi>Scandalls</hi> should follow,
such as were given by a <hi>Sect of Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi>
the <hi>Authours</hi> of the horrible <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium

a cursed imitation of the <hi>Graces</hi> and
<hi>Gifts</hi> communicated by <hi>God</hi> to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
and faithfull servants. But the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>

for opposing and dividing <hi>God<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

that he did it by the <hi>Devills</hi> instigation,
Scornfully derides and reviles any one
who shall pretend to defend the <hi>Church</hi>
by <hi>Gods Inspiration</hi> or Miracles. But <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Calvin</hi> had not failed in his designed

to <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Inspirations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>75 Thus we see that nothing that
<hi>God</hi> has done, or perhaps can do, for the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49053:49"/>
benefit of his Church will please the
<hi>Doctour.</hi> If <hi>Catholicks</hi> live abstracted lives
in the Exercise of pure <hi>Spirituall Prayer,</hi>
or if <hi>God</hi> confers on any of them <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
Gifts,</hi> all this must passe for meer
<hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> though the persons with
perfect humility submit all to <hi>lawfull
Authority,</hi> and though the <hi>Doctour</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
nothing to disprove any of these
things.</p>
               <p>76. But least we may in the end
hope that he will permitt and encourage
us to keep to the <hi>Externall Devotions</hi> and
<hi>Publick Liturgy.</hi> By no meanes: there
must nothing be thought or done by
the Children of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>

               <p>77. WE have hitherto seen the
Doctors charge of <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism</hi>
on the Catholick Church, and
his <hi>proofs</hi> also, such as they are: But he
concludes this his accusation with an
<hi>Epiphonema</hi> truly of great importance, if
rightly applied, which is <hi>The Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
of Catholicks, in resisting Authority
under a pretence of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>78. To make this good, he very
ingenuously absolves the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> her self, and layes this fault
only on the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practises</hi> of
the <hi>Iesuiticall party, a party,</hi> saith he
<q>
                     <hi>most countenanced and encouraged by the
Court of Rome.</hi> And for proof of this
he produces severall Books written
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49053:50"/>
and actions done by them in the last
age.</q>
               </p>
               <p>79. Hereto our <hi>Answer</hi> must be: that
<hi>Scandalls in Gods Church are unavoydable,</hi>
as our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells vs. But where will
he find any Catholick who will be
answerable for all the actions of the
<hi>Court of Rome,</hi> or all the <hi>Writings</hi> of a
single party? The <hi>Popes</hi> are absolute
<hi>Princes</hi> as well as <hi>Prelats,</hi> and if some
of them have been tainted with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

and a desire to invade the rights of
other Princes (For what Courts have
ever been entirely free?) Such can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
want <hi>Ministers</hi> zealous, diligent
and inventive to justify all their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and designs, whatever they are.
Vice will never want Instruments and
supporters, till the <hi>Devill</hi> himself be
converted and become a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and it will be long before this
happen.</p>
               <p>80. But it is well known that in this
<hi>Point, Princes,</hi> and <hi>States</hi> are generally
become more clear sighted and more
wise then formerly they have been,
and by consequence the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome
also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>81. But to be more particular. If the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49053:51"/>
                  <hi>Doctour</hi> will think good to consult the
<hi>Iesuits,</hi> I believe they will tell him,
<hi>That</hi> if they find speciall favour in the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is not with regard to
any such <hi>Books</hi> or <hi>Actions</hi> imputed by
him to their fore fathers and which
they are far from defending: <hi>That</hi> they
have other <hi>Merits</hi> and endowments to
recommend them to the <hi>Popes</hi> Favour.
And particularly <hi>that</hi> this is not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
among their <hi>Merits,</hi> their equally
free access and more then ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of favour in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France</hi>
(where, the <hi>Doctour</hi> knows, such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins
are far from being admitted) will
more then sufficiently testify. They
will further tell him that for as much as
concerns the unsafe <hi>Antimonarchicall
Doctrins</hi> contained in the foresaid <hi>Books</hi>
cited by him, it is almost a whole Age
since that they have been by their <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi>
forbidden under paine of <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi>
and other most greivous
<hi>Censures</hi> to iustify them, either in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
preaching or disputing: and more
over (which is very considerable) this
Prohibition was not only made before
the condemnation of these <hi>Books</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> but also was known to the <hi>Pope</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:49053:51"/>
and permitted by him. I am moreover
confident that he cannot with any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
proofs make good his accusation
of their being wanting in their fidelity
to <hi>his Majesty,</hi> or his <hi>Glorious Father,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the late rebellious warr, which
was raised and prosecuted by the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi>
best <hi>quondam</hi> freinds: And more
over I may assure the <hi>Doctour,</hi> that if an
<hi>Oath</hi> were framed free from ambiguity,
and without odious phrases inserted in
it (wholly unnecessary to the substance
of it) they would not make any Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of ioyning with all their <hi>Catholick
Brethren</hi> in taking it. But then what
thinks the <hi>Doctour</hi> of these two <hi>Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
to be sett in the scale against his?
1. <hi>That it is absolutely unlawfull to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
by arms to propagate or defend Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
against their Lawfull Prince. 2. That</hi>
(I say not by the <hi>Pope;</hi> to this he and his
brethren are as forward as any, but) <hi>by
no Assembly Civill or Ecclesiasticall, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
can be authorized by arms to oppose
their Prince, upon any pretence what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
Are he and his <hi>quondam</hi> party ready
to declare these? Will <hi>he</hi> or they damne
the execrable <hi>Covenant?</hi> Surely the
<hi>Kings</hi> safety and the <hi>publick Peace</hi> are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49053:52"/>
far more concernd in these then in the
former. This therefore would be a task
in which his <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi>
would be worthily employed: And
more over in case himself either by
<hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Writing</hi> has declared the
contrary to either of these, or engaged
his soule in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> so great, so
horrible a <hi>Scandall</hi> as that, certainly
ought not only to be repented of, but
a publick <hi>revocation</hi> of it to be made. And
moreover my <hi>Lords</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> his <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours</hi>
deale but too mercifully in
not requiring also a <hi>Recantation</hi> from
him of what he has written destructive
to the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Government</hi> of that
<hi>Church,</hi> in whose revenues they have
now given him so great a share. But I
despair of being able to extort from the
<hi>Doctour</hi> a free expression of his mind
touching these <hi>two Points,</hi> which invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
a secret never to be discovered. At
least then he may with <hi>Civilitie</hi> be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to satisfy the world touching
the sense of the <hi>two Oaths</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi>
and <hi>Allegiance</hi> which he has taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
as appears by the <hi>Preferments</hi> he
enioys: unles perhaps for the tendernes
of his conscience he has been dispensed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49053:52"/>
with taking them. I doubt not but that
in the <hi>Oath of Alleagiance</hi> he cheer-fully
renounced all <hi>Authority</hi> in the <hi>Pope</hi> or
any forrain <hi>Potentate</hi> to absolue Subiects
from their <hi>Allegiance:</hi> but will he doe
the same with regard to any <hi>domestick
Power, Assembly,</hi> or <hi>State</hi> at home? This
were worth the knowing.</p>
               <p>82. And next touching the <hi>Oath</hi> of
<hi>Supremacy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Irenic. P. 392.</note> the <hi>Doctour</hi> during the late
execrable <hi>Vsurpers</hi> time publishing in
his <hi>Irenicum</hi> the Iudgement touching
<hi>Church Government</hi> of the prime <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi>
of the <hi>English Reformation,</hi> stiled
by him <hi>that most worthy Prelat and glorious
Martyr Archbishop Cranmer</hi> (a <hi>Martyr</hi>
indeed, if an impenitent <hi>Traytor</hi> may be
called a <hi>Martyr:</hi>) and his judgment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in an answer to a <hi>Petition</hi> of the
<hi>Clergy</hi> in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> was in brief,
<hi>That Princes and Governours may make</hi>
(Bishops and) <hi>Priests as well as Bishops
may: And that a Bishop or a Priest made
by them needeth no Consecration by the
Scripture.</hi> Moreover the <hi>Doctour</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
that he had in his possession an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Copy</hi> of the same <hi>Cranmers Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
in resolution of certain doubts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the same <hi>Clergy</hi> touching
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49053:53"/>
                  <hi>Doctrinall Points,</hi> as about the <hi>Masses
institution, nature, receiving &amp;c.</hi> But this
<hi>Secret</hi> the <hi>Doctour</hi> envyed his <hi>Readers:</hi>
Notwithstanding we may collect the
sense of <hi>Cranmers Answer</hi> from the
<hi>Subscription</hi> to both the <hi>Resolutions,</hi> the
<hi>Form</hi> whereof is this, <hi>T. Cantuariens.
This is mine Opinion and Sentence at this
present, which I do not temerariously define,
but do remit the judgment thereof wholly to
your Majesty.</hi> So that it seems a finall
<hi>judgment</hi> both touching <hi>Government</hi> and
<hi>Doctrin</hi> is by the <hi>Prime Bishop</hi> referred
to a <hi>Child</hi> of about nine years old: a great
glory surely to the <hi>English Clergy,</hi> for
the knowledge of which they are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Doctour,</hi> as the <hi>Doctour</hi> was
to <hi>Cranmer</hi> for confirming the substance
of his Book touching <hi>Church Government,</hi>
very advantageous to my <hi>Lords</hi> the <hi>Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>83. Now this being premised, and
notice being taken that this Book, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
all this power to the <hi>Supreme Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Governour,</hi> was printed in <hi>Cromwells</hi>
time: he cannot surely refuse to declare
whether he intended in taking lately
the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> to acknowledg as
much in the <hi>King,</hi> whose <hi>Title</hi> by <hi>Law</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:49053:53"/>
is, <hi>Supreme Head and Governour of the
Church of England:</hi> and whether by the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is to be understood
only the <hi>Prelaticall Church,</hi> so as that all
the <hi>Doctours</hi> other <hi>Protestant Churches</hi>
are to be supposed exempt from his <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</hi>
For if they be not, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that the <hi>Doctour</hi> should declare
that the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>Head of the Church</hi> may
ordain <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> for his own
<hi>Church:</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> for the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Ministers</hi> for the <hi>Independents,
Holders-forth</hi> for <hi>Anabaptists; Declarers</hi>
for <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Tub-preachers</hi> for that
sort of <hi>Fanaticks.</hi> But this is not all: For
the <hi>Doctour,</hi> if holding to his <hi>Book,</hi>
seems obliged to assert a power in the
<hi>King</hi> to appoint also <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Belief,</hi> a
hundred ways varying and contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one another, to fitt the fancies of
each respective <hi>Congregation.</hi> But how
would the <hi>Doctour</hi> advise him about
<hi>Fifth Monarchists?</hi> Thus much at present
upon this <hi>Subiect,</hi> by occasion of the
<hi>Doctours</hi> requiring an account from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
touching their <hi>Fidelity,</hi> which
account none were less fitt to require
then the <hi>Doctour. Causa patet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>84. But after all, did it become a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49053:54"/>
                  <hi>Doctour</hi> of such reputation (though ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a design to doe all the mischeif he
could to <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who never provoked
him) to call into his ayd two such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
as the <hi>Answerer to the Apology for
Catholicks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 346.</note> and the <hi>Answerer to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax?</hi>
For touching the <hi>former,</hi> he cannot
but know that his barbarous <hi>Answer</hi>
has mett wich a <hi>Reply</hi> already from an
<hi>Honourable</hi> pen. And for the <hi>other,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
was the <hi>Doctours</hi> modesty when he
stiled himr a <hi>worthy Authour</hi> for belying
most horribly <hi>a party among Catholicks,
as if they had had an influence</hi> (and had
joyned with the Doctours friends) <hi>in
the most barbarous effects of Fanaticism
here in the murther of a most excellent
Prince?</hi> Does he not know how oft, and
particularly how upon the complaint of
the late <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> of most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
memory, he has been summoned
to make good that his forged calumny;
but all in vain? Js that wretched Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
to be stiled <hi>a worthy-Authour,</hi> who
if he had not been warmed and thawed
by <hi>English</hi> preferments, had never been
able to hiss in his own countrey, and
much less to disgorge his poyson to
the disturbance of our <hi>Island?</hi> Js any
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49053:54"/>
credit to be given to him who would
haue that to be believed in <hi>England</hi>
which all <hi>France</hi> knows to be false, viz.
That his <hi>Father</hi> was a loyall subiect to
his <hi>King,</hi> that is, that he was an Apostar
from <hi>Huguenotterie,</hi> where <hi>Confession
of Faith</hi> obliges them to be <hi>Traytours</hi> and
<hi>Rebels whensoever the Honour of God</hi> (that

<hi>is concerned?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>85. If the <hi>Doctour</hi> had had the patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

and strengthned his cause very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably

<hi>Venner and his company, who (saith he)
acted to the height of Fanaticism among our
Sectaries.</hi> Thus far indeed J agree with
him, That these <hi>Frantick Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchists</hi>
do more professedly teach <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>
then any other Sect: but I
should renounce common Reason, if I
should affirm that such à handfull of
mad-men, as <hi>Venner</hi> and Riscrew, are a
<hi>Sect more dangerous</hi> to the Kingdom then
those numerous Armies of <hi>sober Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
(Presbyterians, Independents, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi>
&amp;c.) who all conspired to the
raising and prosecuting the late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
Yet all these will say as much for
themselves as the Doctour has here do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
viz. <hi>We condemn any opposition to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
under any pretence whatsoeuer:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 350.</note>
For it was in Obedience to a <hi>Government</hi>
such as it was, that the Rebellion was
upheld; a Government divided from the
Kings, and usurped on purpose to destroy
him. To conclude this point, as zeale for
the <hi>Kings</hi> safety and the <hi>Publick</hi> Peace is
commendable in all <hi>English Subjects</hi> and
in such Strangers salso whom <hi>English
Preferments</hi> have made his <hi>Subiects,</hi> yet
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49053:56"/>
certainly in the <hi>Doctour</hi> and his <hi>worthy
Huguenot Authour</hi> it seems a preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and suspicious zeale, which has
been shewn only against a Party, of
which not one can be accused of want
of fidelity to his Maiesty, whilst they
speak not a word, nor so much as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
any apprehension of danger from
<hi>those</hi> who unanimously conspired to his
Destruction, and who, for any thing to
the contrary appears, cannot yet find
one word in the <hi>Scripture</hi> (or the <hi>Lawes</hi>
of the <hi>Kingdom</hi>) which condemns their
former <hi>Rebellion.</hi> But enough, if not too
much, of this argument, which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
would needs discourse upon.</p>

               <p>87. THe <hi>Doctour</hi> now for the
recreation of his <hi>Readers</hi>
hauing represented <hi>Catholicks,</hi> not only
such as now liue, but many in glory
with <hi>God</hi> in heaven, <hi>travestis</hi> in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
of <hi>Ffanaticks</hi> acting a <hi>Ffarce</hi> or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49053:56"/>
                  <hi>Enterlude</hi> composed by him, the glory
of which invention he may lawfully
challenge to himself alone; for I do not
find that any pattern has been giuen
him by any other Adversaries of <hi>Gods
Church:</hi> He cannot iustly take it ill, if
in some degree of requitall we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to shew not only himself, but the
whole <hi>Church,</hi> I mean all the <hi>Churches</hi>
of <hi>Protestants,</hi> as they are <hi>Principled</hi> by
him in his <hi>Book,</hi> to be really, without
any vizard or disguise <hi>very Fanaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>88. Jn pursuing this subiect, we
cannot hinder the <hi>Doctour</hi> from chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
some, by him esteemed great,
advantages, in which he much glories,
and for which he giues <hi>God</hi> humble
thanks. For 1. we can find no <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Orders</hi> among them, upon the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutours</hi>
and <hi>Subjects</hi> of which we
might fasten this <hi>Title,</hi> and whom we
might <hi>Stigmatize</hi> with this brand. An
attempt indeed has once been made of
beginning such an <hi>Order</hi> of young men
and women liuing promiscuously toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
But by reason of two defects it
presently expired; For neither would
they be persuaded to <hi>vow continency</hi> (in
such circumstances truly vnreasonable:)
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49053:57"/>
Neither could a <hi>Superiour, he</hi> or <hi>she</hi> be
found to whom they could be obliged
in conscience to profess <hi>Obedience;</hi> and
no wonder, since, it seems, their own
<hi>Church</hi> cannot exact it from them. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
We cannot heare of so much as one
single person whom we might call a
<hi>Fanatick</hi> for leauing the flesh and the
world to the end <hi>he,</hi> or <hi>she</hi> might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
consecrate themselues to <hi>God</hi> in
<hi>Solitude</hi> and <hi>Exercises</hi> of <hi>Spirituall Prayer</hi>
and <hi>Mortification.</hi> 3. Jn case God should
call any one to such a state of life, there
is an vtter want among them of <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours</hi>
and <hi>Instructions</hi> proper for it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<hi>The crumms of comfort,, The Practise
of Piety,</hi> truly for the Substance good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Books, with store of pious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
or else one, a more late one, yet
better then those called, <hi>The whole duty
of man</hi> could serue their turns. But
these hauing neuer been intended for
such an vse, it cannot reasonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from them. 4. They all of them
(except the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chists,</hi>
with few besides) disclaiming
all <hi>Gratuite Graces, Visions, Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Inspirations, Passiue Vnions,</hi> &amp;c.
Jf vpon this account we should call any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49053:57"/>
of them besides these, <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> they
would, and very iustly, call us impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Slanderers. 5. Not one <hi>Miracle</hi>
hauing been pretended to since the
first <hi>Reformation</hi> not so much as the
curing <hi>a Tertian Ague</hi> to testify that
<hi>Reformation</hi> was pleasing to <hi>God,</hi> we
cannot reasonably accuse them of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
any <hi>Miracles.</hi> 6. The <hi>Doctour</hi> might
haue done well, even in revenge
against his enemy M. <hi>Cressy</hi> and his <hi>Church
History,</hi> or as he scornfully stiles it <hi>Great
Legend,</hi> to have given to the world at
least a pretty little <hi>Legend</hi> of his <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Saints.</hi> But alas, his <hi>Records</hi> will
not furnish him with matter of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to fill a <hi>nutshell.</hi> So that he
has deprived us of the means of requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him with finding <hi>Fanaticks</hi> among
his <hi>Rubricated Saints.</hi> Yet if he will
consult more <hi>Ancient</hi> and some even
<hi>Primitive Records,</hi> as <hi>S. Ireneus, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
and after them <hi>S. Epiphanius, S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi>
and <hi>Philastrius,</hi> together with
other <hi>Modern writers,</hi> as <hi>Alphonsus a
Castro, Prateolus,</hi> &amp;c. who have compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Books expressly touching the <hi>Lives</hi>
and <hi>Doctrins</hi> of many of his <hi>Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,</hi>
it will goe hard if he be not able
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49053:58"/>
to discover some among them whom
he may call <hi>Saints</hi> (as well as <hi>Cranmer</hi>)
and we in requitall, <hi>Fanaticks.</hi> But he
is too wise to loose his advantage.</p>
               <p>89. And all these manifold advantages
wee yield up to him, to our shame, and
to the <hi>Doctours</hi> great contentment, and
to the glory of his <hi>Protestant Churches.</hi>
Yet all this will not discourage vs
from endeavouring at least, to iustify
that the <hi>Doctour</hi> and his <hi>Churches</hi> are
<hi>meer Fanaticks.</hi> This we confidently
pronounce, and to make this good we
will not, as he has done, exemplify in
the Writings or <hi>actions</hi> of a few persons
culld out, with an intention to baffle,
affront and reuile them, but we will
demonstrates vpon his own grounds
and <hi>Principles,</hi> that the very nature
and <hi>Essence</hi> of his <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi>
is <hi>pure putid Fanaticism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>90. <hi>Now a demonstrable proof of
this the</hi> Doctour <hi>himself affords vs in
the 13. and</hi> 15. Principles <hi>at the end
of his</hi> Book.<note place="margin">13. Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciple,</note> 
                  <hi>His words are these:</hi> Such
a particular way of Reuelation being
made choice of by God (for the means of
making known his Will in order to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
of Mankind) as Writing, we may
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49053:58"/>
iustly say, that it is repugnant to the nature
of the Design, and the Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of God to giue infallible assurance to
persons in Writing his Will for the benefit
of Mankind, if those Writings may not be
vnderstood by all Persons who sincerely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
to know the meaning of them in
all such things as are necessary for their
Saluation. <hi>And consequently,</hi> there
can be no necessity supposed of any infallible
Society of men,<note place="margin">15 Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</note> either to attest or explain
those Writings among Christians.</p>
               <p>91. What is this now but <hi>Fanaticism</hi>
in the heighth of the <hi>Notion</hi> signified
by the word, to make euery <hi>Christian
Soberly enquiring</hi> into Scripture to be his
own <hi>Teacher</hi> in <hi>all necessary Points of
Faith</hi> (and it is no matter what becoms
of <hi>vnnecessary Points</hi>) and to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<hi>Iudge</hi> of the true sence of <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
in them: all this without any regard
to all <hi>Externall Authority infallible,</hi> or
<hi>fallible</hi> either; for an <hi>infallible</hi> one being
vnnecessary, what necessity can there
be of a <hi>fallible Authority,</hi> which none
is or can be bound to <hi>Belieue?</hi> If it be
<hi>Fanaticism</hi> to attend to and belieue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
pretended <hi>Illuminations, Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>Reuelations</hi> concerning parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49053:59"/>
matters, perhaps of no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
with a refusall to submitt
them to any <hi>Externall Authority:</hi> what
is it to ground his whole <hi>Religion</hi> vpon
his own fancy, enquiring into the true
sense of <hi>Diuine Reuelation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>92. But perhaps the <hi>Doctour</hi> thinks
<hi>himself</hi> and his <hi>Churches</hi> secure notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any thing here said, &amp; because
neither himself, nor they, pretend to
any <hi>New Reuelations, Illuminations,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations</hi>
in this matter. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he will not find an euasion by this.
For besides that, J am sure, <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
at least, if not the other <hi>Sects,</hi> and
likewise the <hi>Huguenots</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in
their <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> haue always
professed that they haue not only the
true sense of <hi>Scripture</hi> by <hi>Inspiration</hi> of
the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> but that thereby they
are enabled to distinguish <hi>true Scripture</hi>
from <hi>Apocriphall Writings:</hi> I will take
the boldnes to tell him, That he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
does the same, and if he denyes it,
it is because he is ignorant of what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in his own mind.</p>
               <p>93. To shew this, I will here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a few <hi>Questions</hi> to him, and he not
being present to doe it himself, I will
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49053:59"/>
suppose he gives me leaue to make Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
to them, such as J conceiue he
will not disavow. The. 1. Question:<note place="margin">I. Que. Ansvv.</note>
                  <hi>Does he after a sober Enquiry vnderstand
and assent to the true sense of Scripture
in all necessary Points?</hi> Answer. Yes.
2. Question.<note place="margin">II. Qu. Ansvv.</note> 
                  <hi>Is his Assent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to such
Points an Act of meer naturall Reason
or is it a Diuine Faith?</hi> Answer.
<hi>A Diuine Faith</hi> surely as he hopes,
and is fully perswaded: For he would
be sorry if he belieued not better then
Devills. 3. Question.<note place="margin">III Qu. Ansvv.</note> 
                  <hi>Is a Diuine Faith
a Supernaturall Gift of Gods Holy Spirit.</hi>
Answ. Yes: the Scripture saying so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly.
4. Quest.<note place="margin">IV. Qu. Ansvv.</note> 
                  <hi>Is this Gift of God
communicated to his servants any other
way, then by Illumination, Inspiration, or
the like Diuine operation Equivalent?</hi>
Answ. J must answer in the Doctours
place, till he better informs me, that no
other way is known. Jn the last place.
5 Q.<note place="margin">V. Qu. Ansvv.</note> 
                  <hi>Does he think himself fobliged to ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledge
that he receies this</hi> Faith <hi>from, or
to Submitt this his perswasion of a Diuine
operation in him to the Teaching of any
Church?</hi> Answ. He will not (though
J thank God J doe) acknowledge any
Church, fallible or infallible, which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49053:60"/>
can iustly require thus much from him.
Now therefore <hi>a primo ad vltimum,</hi>
does the Doctour want any necessary
qualification to make him passe for a
perfect <hi>Fanatick</hi> and <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> a Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
by duty imposed on him from the
Essence of his Religion, and moreouer
a Teacher of <hi>Fanaticism?</hi> Jf I could ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
him from this; I would very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly:
but sincerely I cannot, since he
himself has giuen me a distinct notion of
Fanaticism, by which he, and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>vnderstands an Enthusiastick way of
Religion, or resisting Authority</hi> (Civill
or Ecclesiasticall) <hi>vnder a pretence of
Religion:</hi> by which Notion, in it self true
and proper, he is to be iudged without
Appeale.</p>
               <p>94. Now though the Doctour takes
vpon him, and is generally conceiued
by others to be a <hi>Champion of the Church
of England,</hi> yet perhaps it would be
rashnes in me from his warrant alone
to affirme that the Church of England
(that Church, J mean which is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by publick Authority) does
now at last ground her Faith on such a
Fanatick Principle, as the Doctour in
her name has layd: For then it might
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49053:60"/>
indeed be truly sayd, that the New
Faith of the Church of England, is the
very Faith of New England. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
how learned soeuer otherwise,
he is but a Neophit in this Church: and
therefore all he says not to be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
presently without examining: if
he wrong the Church of England, J am
vnwilling to wrong her with him.</p>
               <p>95. And one particular thing which
I have observed from his Book, makes
me suspect that my Lords the Bishops
will not avow this Principle imposed
by him on them, which is, that his Book
wants an <hi>Imprimatur.</hi> Now if an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
was either not demanded by
him, or being demanded was refused
him: it seems strange that against order
and Publick command it should be
permitted to be so dispersed without
any Controll. But the truth is, there is
a great Mistery of late in that <hi>Formality</hi>
of <hi>Approbations:</hi> for some Books want
an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> for the Reader, which
was not wanting to the Printer. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the Doctours virulence against
poore Catholicks was so highly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the grave <hi>Censor Librorum,</hi> that
rather then it should be hindred from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49053:61"/>
doing mischief to them, he was content
the <hi>Principles</hi> also should passe: which
utterly destroy the foundations of his
own Church. This may seeme more
probable, because in like manner a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
is given to the Printer for a Book
of Sermons, in one of which, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
entirely of Lying Invectives against
Catholicks, and by a most horrible ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
imputing the Pouder Treason to
the Preaching of Catholick Religion,
there is this passage becoming a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of the Gospell; <hi>I wish that the Lawes
against these Foxes (the Papists) might be
put in execution, as they were anciently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Wolues.</hi> Nothing but an vtter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of Catholicks, it seems, will
content the charitable Preacher, who
seems to intimate also, that in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is fitt a price should be sett on
every Catholicks head as formerly on
Wolues, to be payed to his murderer.
Such a Sermon as this the Printer is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced
to print; but he who gave it,
being ashamed that his Approbation of
so barbarous a piece should appeare to
the world, has given order that his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
should be concealed.</p>
               <p>96. What judgment therefore in this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49053:61"/>
regard, to make of the Doctours Book,
truly I cannot determine. Only this I
may say, That if Prelaticall Protestants
do allow him for their Champion, and
approve the Grounds of his Religion, it
is one of the most Signall Victories that
in any Age has been gained by a single
Doctour over a whole Church, the
Governours whereof will be forced to
acknowledge that they have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to teach truth, or condemn Errours;
that all the people (formerly under
them) are becom <hi>Prophets,</hi> and that all
their Articles, Constitutions, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donances
have been comp<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
by an usurped Authority, of
which they are not willing to be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyled,
and perhaps, after the example
of a late Scottish Bishop, to do Pennan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
for their fault of being Bishops. But
certainly my Lords the Bishops will
hardly, with all the Doctours eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
be perswaded to this compliance
with him: Regard both to the Kings
and Kingdoms safety, and their own
Character will not permit them to
yeeld to an Anarchy first in the Church,
and presently after in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>97. Notwithstanding it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49053:62"/>
but the Doctour may expect more
then ordinary indulgence from them,
since during their late calamities, he did
not joyn in the clamour for destroying
them.<note place="margin">Irenic.</note> He was no <hi>Root and branch enemy,</hi>
but on the contrary generously under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
their defence, and with great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
told his then <hi>Maisters,</hi> that though
Episcopall goverment and <hi>Ordinations,</hi>
as likewise <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters</hi> (which
anciently were the Bishops Counsell)
were not necessary, nor perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
as matters then stood, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was their utter destruction: they
might, if the State pleased, be retained
without sin, upon condition that for
their Maintenance the ravenous beasts
then in power would be content to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
up three or four hundred thousand
pounds of yearly <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ents. But my best
course is to leave the Doctour to plead
his own cause, much better then I can
doe; And I assure him I would not have
touched this String, nor calld to mind
these things passed, were it not that
hitherto he has made no retractation of
any thing written by him, and also if
his Principles newly published should
prevayle in mens minds, they would be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49053:62"/>
more destructive to both Kingly and
Church goverment then all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Presbyters and Independents
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>98. But perhaps after all, the said
Principles, though pernicious to Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
may at least produce Vnity and
peace among the people. For a man
would think if every sober enquirer (and
who thinks not himself such anone) may
be allowed to chuse a sence of Scripture
for himself, what can he desire more?
Every one then surely will be quiett
and contented. But I must tell him, <hi>Quid
verbo audio, cum facta videam.</hi> If indeed
men could be content to enioy their
Faith to themselves, and not think
themselves obliged to propagate it; if
they could with patience see their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins
confuted, their actions derided,
and their designs opposed, peace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
might be hoped for <hi>ad Graecas, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>99. Yet I confess that (according to
the Welsh Proverb, <hi>The Gospell and a
Stone will drive away a dogg</hi>) the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
Principles and a severe Civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ioynd together, that is, a
charitable indulgence to tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49053:63"/>
with a watchfull care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
quarrells and eager disputes about
Religion, may produce that peace,
which has hitherto never been seen in
England since the Reformation, and
mens minds, being enured to tast the
pleasure of such a peace, may probably
in a short time becom as zealous against
quarrelling, as they are now for it.</p>
               <p>100. But there is another sort of
Peace and Vnity more fitt to be the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Writings composed by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
persons, that is, Vnity of
Faith and Doctrin. And this Vnity was
intended certainly by Christ, when he
left his Church established under Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
governours, to continue in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Succession till the worlds end:
and was Signifyed by S. Paul, saying,
<hi>There is one Body and one Spirit: one Lord,
one Faith, and one Baptism &amp;c.</hi> who also
declares that this one <hi>Body</hi> and one <hi>Faith</hi>
is preserved by <hi>Apostles</hi> and other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
instituted by Christ in his
Church,<note place="margin">Eph. iv 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>To the end that Gods people may
not be tossed to and fro,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">vers. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and carried about
with every wind of Doctrin &amp;c.</hi> This
Unity also is proposed and professed by
us in the Creed, <hi>I believe one holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49053:63"/>
and Apostolick Church.</hi> Now this
Vnity the Doctour, seeing utterly chaced
out of his Churches principled by him,
earnestly endeavours to prove it a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Catholick Church also: and
would seem to intimate that if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be attained, it must be by his
<hi>Principles.</hi> And the truth is, if men might
enioy their consciences, and would be
induced to abstain from quarrelling, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
and hating one another; Truth
in the end would probably prevaile,
were there not one hindrance more, I
feare, insuperable, which is, that Truth,
or true Religion has no other passions
and Carnall affections to combat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
besides quarrelsomnes. It requires a
bending, and even breaking of the Will
to the Obedience of Lawfull Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours:
it requires yet further <hi>a captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
even of the Vnderstanding to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Faith taught</hi> them by the same
Superiours: It requires also a free disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the most secret and most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be acknowledged crimes, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to painfull Satisfactions to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
for their expiation, and for obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Absolution and pardon of them: It
requires from many a totall renouncing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49053:64"/>
of all carnall Lusts, and all Externall
remedies of quenching them. These and
many other severe exactions are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by true Religion, and only by it<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and therefore no wonder if Sects dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing
in these things, prevaile so much
against it: Yet Gods grace is omnipotent,
and can work greater and more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
effects in the hearts of his servants,
when he is pleased to exert it.</p>
               <p>101. It is truly an Attempt worthy
so heroicall a Champion to pretend to
bring proofs, <hi>from which,</hi> saith he, <hi>it
appears that the Church of Rome can have
no advantage in point of Vnity above his
Protestant Churches,</hi> which is in effect
to demonstrate that one Article of our
Faith ceases to be true.</p>
               <p>102. Let this be examined: and first
let us enquire what helps for Unity (I
mean Unity of Faith and Doctrin) Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
have, and then compare them
with those of Catholicks. First, for the
Doctour himself, who as yet, must pass
for the common Advocate of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
till he be disavowed, surely he
will not pretend to contribute the least
advantage to such Unity, unles he hopes
to perswade any one, <hi>That a licence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49053:64"/>
to every Christian to chuse his own
Faith out of Scripture be a probable way
to make all agree in the same Faith:</hi> which
Licence he gives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and justifying it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is
the principall Design of all his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
Is not this all one as to say, <hi>Let
every man in England think and doe what
he pleases, and by this means all will agree
to be Good Obedient Subiects to the King?</hi>
Yet the Scripture argues the contrary,
saying, That <hi>because there was no King in
Israel, everyone went severall ways, doing
what was good in his own eyes.</hi> So that by
the Doctours way of proceeding, one
would almost believe that his meaning
was, that our Saviour had no intention
that his <hi>Church</hi> should be <hi>one,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that Generall Councills,
which took great paines to procure
Vnity, transgressed therein our Saviours
order.</p>
               <p>103. But all Protestants are not of the
Doctours mind: for though they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
make Scripture, not only the Rule,
but judge also of Faith when contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted:
Yet they do not so neglect V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
but that they profess a willingnes
to submit their judgments for the sence
of Scripture to a Lawfull generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49053:65"/>
This the Doctour cannot doe,
now that he has sett forth his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
unless he will confess the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Protestant Religion to be
unsound. He might well enough have
done it before, whilst he was a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Archbishop Lawd:</hi> but now it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that the Archbishops Principles
and his are not the same, nor probably
ever were, and I doe assure my self that
if the Archbishop were alive, none
could be more ready to condemn them.</p>
               <p>104. Other Protestants therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
not submission to Councells: as may
appear by their confident demanding
them.<note place="margin">Gesner in Re Bellar. Def.</note> For <hi>Gesner</hi> speaking in their name

permitted to be the Iudge of Controversies.</hi>
And our Countreyman <hi>Sutcliff</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
cryes out that <hi>Catholicks are
afraid of Councills.</hi> Yet all the world sees
that if a Lawfull Generall Councill
were called, according to the order of all
past lawfull Councills, even those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49053:65"/>
by Protestants, they must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
be condemned.</p>
               <p>105. This some others more wise
then these loud Sollicitours for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills
saw; and therefore when a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill
was ready to be called, they, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for themselves, would not permit
any Point to be decided by Catholick
Bishops alone, but euery Minister, yea
Lay-men, must have votes in them: and
a plurality of Suffrages was not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayle,
but an equall number on both si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
must dispute, and Lay Judges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide:
that is, declared <hi>Hereticks</hi> must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
greater Priviledges then Catholicks,
and instead of a Councill there must be
an Assembly of wild beasts consulting
to establish Unity in Gods Church,
which, it seems, was only to be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by confusion, and not by Order.

known Buffon calld <hi>Marcolphus,</hi> who
was wont to say, <hi>That after all his search

Such a tree would a Legitimate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill

               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:49053:66"/>106. Yet there is one expedient for
producing Unity, which the Doctour
may doe well to advise upon: for if it
take, it will certainly have that effect:
even the Quakers themselves and Fifth
Monarchists will not refuse to be of the
Doctours Church, if they be not already.
Nay, which is more, the Catholicks
will come in too. This is no invention
of mine, but was many years since sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
by one of the Doctours Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
<hi>Robert Robertson an English Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist</hi>
of <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> This surely well
meaning man perceiving how litle suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
Scripture alone had to vnite <hi>Sects,</hi>
agreeing only in opposing <hi>Popery,</hi> in the
year sixteen hundred and two printed a
Book in <hi>Holland,</hi> in which he proposed
to them all this means of <hi>Vnity</hi> viz. That
they should all ioyn in a common <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to the States to give them leave to
assemble themselves in some Town or
field, and there each <hi>Sect</hi> severally to
pray to God, one after another, that he
would shew some evident <hi>Miracle</hi> for
decision of their <hi>Controversies,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
which among them had the
Truth, (which he supposed vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
was not among <hi>Catholicks</hi>) And
to the end the <hi>Devill</hi> might not enter
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49053:66"/>
in, and deceive them with a <hi>false Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
the man told them he had thought
of one allowed by Scripture, and which
he was sure the <hi>Devill</hi> could not work,
namely, to make the <hi>Sun</hi> stand still for
a certain considerable time: not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
but that <hi>God</hi> of his great <hi>Goodnes</hi>
would not refuse to condescend to the
Petition of such devout servants of his
in a matter so iust and necessary.</p>
               <p>107. I suppose the Doctour will not
deny this design (if succesfull) to be a
most powerfull and unfaileable <hi>Mean</hi>
of producing <hi>Vnity,</hi> which his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
have utterly destroyed, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
impossible, if not unlawfull. And
let him with all his wit and invention
devise any other more probable, since
the Catholick Churches Authority is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
by him and them.</p>
               <p>108. Notwithstanding all this, the
Doctour, according to his custom and
nature, is confident, that he has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
<hi>that the Church of Rome can have
no advantage in Point of Vnity above his
medley Church.</hi> Now to the end any
impartiall Reader may be a competent
Judge between us, I will briefly set
down the <hi>Instruments</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:49053:67"/>
left by <hi>our Lord</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> to <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
end the Truth of this <hi>Article</hi> of our
<hi>Faith, I believe one Catholick Church,</hi> may
remain to the worlds end unalterable.
1. <hi>Catholicks</hi> do ground their <hi>Faith</hi> on
Gods revealed Will in <hi>Scripture</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by <hi>Tradition.</hi> 2. They believe
that <hi>God</hi> according to his <hi>Promise, will
lead</hi> and preserve his <hi>Church in all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Truth,</hi> or in the true sense of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
3. That for this purpose, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
that <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on a false sense of <hi>Scripture,</hi> would
in after times come, has established in
his <hi>Church</hi> an unfaileable succession of
<hi>Teachers</hi> of his <hi>Truth,</hi> with whom he
will continue till the worlds end. 4. It
is his Will and Command that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
should <hi>obey these Teachers, who are
to give an account of their soules.</hi> 5. These
<hi>Teachers</hi> constitute the <hi>Churches Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi>
6. The <hi>Vniversall Church</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by these <hi>Teachers</hi> assembled in a
Lawfull <hi>Generall Councill.</hi> 7. Such a
<hi>Councill</hi> therefore is the <hi>Supreme Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> from whose <hi>Decisions</hi>
there must be no <hi>Appeale.</hi> 8. But because
the difficulties of making such <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi>
are extreamly great, therefore it is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49053:67"/>
necessary there should be a <hi>standing
Authority</hi> with power to prevent <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies</hi>
and <hi>Schisms</hi> in the intervalls of
<hi>Councills,</hi> arising and disturbing the
<hi>Church.</hi> 9. This ordinary <hi>Authority</hi> is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablished
in the <hi>Supreme Pastour,</hi> the <hi>Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop</hi>
of <hi>Rome.</hi> 10. His <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> therefore
as to such an end, extends it self to the
whole <hi>Church,</hi> and is exercised in taking
care that the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Generall
Councills</hi> be not by any transgressed: and
also in case any <hi>Heresies</hi> arise, or that
any <hi>Controversies</hi> in <hi>Causis Majoribus</hi> can
not be otherwise ended, either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Catholick Truth</hi>
opposed, or at least to impose <hi>Silence</hi>
upon disputants and Litigants, till he can
assemble a <hi>Councill</hi> to declare un-appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
the Truth, and to do iustice upon
the guilty parties. Thus the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> is furnished against Schisms, and
none of these <hi>Defensive arms</hi> will the
<hi>Doctour</hi> allow to any of his <hi>Protestant
Churches,</hi> and yet he confidently avows
that Catholicks have no advantage.</p>
               <p>109. But let us consider what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
an over-weening witt can alledge
to prove so strange an affection; for
he might as well have said, <hi>That Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49053:68"/>
and such Government as obliges the
conscience, has not so much force to preserve
men in Vnity, as Anarchy has.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>110. As touching his Proofs, which
take up above an hundred pages, our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to them must be, that we may yield
him in a manner all the <hi>Premises</hi> of his
faulty Sillogisms, and must deny the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence</hi>
of the <hi>Conclusions</hi> he would
draw from them. He tells us many
<hi>Tragicall Stories</hi> of miscarriages of <hi>Popes,</hi>
how they revolted from the <hi>Empire,</hi>
and upon such revolting layd the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of greatnes to their <hi>See:</hi> How
afterward challenging to themselves a
<hi>Supreme Temporall Dominion</hi> over the
whole world, they quarrelled with
<hi>Emperours</hi> and other <hi>Christian Princes,</hi>
from whence followed rebellions, mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres,
and a whole <hi>Iliad</hi> of all sorts of
mischiefs. Well: this being granted,
what follows? Therefore says he, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
authority</hi> in <hi>Gods Church</hi> is no, good
mean to produce peace and order (nor
consequently Kingly authority in the
common wealth, since notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it many <hi>Kings</hi> have exercised <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi>
and could not always prevent
rebellions.) But <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:49053:68"/>
never thought of such an argument,
when the most abominable Monster
that ever lived governed the <hi>Roman</hi>
world. It was to <hi>Nero</hi> that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Christians to be subiect, to pay
taxes, to yeeld honour &amp;c.</hi> and this not
only out of <hi>feare</hi> of his power, but also
<hi>for conscience sake.</hi> It was such an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as this (as the Doctour has reason
to remember) that was made use of to
the destruction of the best <hi>King</hi> that
ever governed this <hi>Island.</hi> Be it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
granted, that after a thousand years
of excellent order produced in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
world by the government of <hi>Popes,</hi>
some of their <hi>Successours</hi> for about an age
or two caused intolerable disorders in
the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Empire:</hi> What follows?
Therefore a <hi>Supreme authority</hi> in <hi>Gods
Church</hi> is of no good use at all: Nay
more, all manner of Authority is useles;
for if any authority, then <hi>Subordination:</hi>
and if Subordination, then of necessity
a <hi>Supreme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>111. <q>From hence the <hi>Doctour</hi> descends
to a way of arguing yet less reasonable
then this: for he tells his <hi>Reader</hi> of I
know not how many <hi>Schisms,</hi> yet all
of them after the <hi>Church</hi> was above
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49053:69"/>
twelve hundred years old (for before
there were scarce any:) and of yet
later disorders since <hi>S. Bernards</hi> time,
by reason of quarrels between <hi>Bishops</hi>
and <hi>Monastick orders</hi> about <hi>Exemptions</hi>
and <hi>Priviledges:</hi> likewise between
<hi>Regulars</hi> and <hi>Seculars</hi> the other day
in <hi>England,</hi> and much more such stuff
which <hi>Popes</hi> either would not, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could not compose, for feare of
greater disorders by endangering
Schisms yet more pernicious to the
Church then the former. And what
would he conclude from hence? The
very same as before: for his argument
in brief is this: Subiects are oft times
rebellious to their Superiours: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it were better there were no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
at all. But might he not as
rationally argue, that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
of the world: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this the far greatest part of the
world, not in one or two, but in all
ages, from the beginning hath been
rebellious to him, therefore his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is of small benefitt?</q>
               </p>
               <p>112. As touching certain (truly scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous)
quarrells between <hi>Bishops</hi> and
some <hi>Regulars</hi> concerning <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:49053:69"/>
and the <hi>Churches Government,</hi> the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
ought to have taken notice that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any <hi>Regular</hi> pretended <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to
be <hi>Antichristian,</hi> as the <hi>Doctours</hi> freinds,
the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and other
later <hi>Sects</hi> have done; Neither have
they declared a <hi>Government by Bishops</hi> to
be in it self indifferent, or that <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Consecration</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>Priests</hi> is a meere <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
as well and Legally by <hi>Lay Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi>
as by <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> as the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
himself has done: The whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
consisting among <hi>Catholicks</hi>
about restraining some part of <hi>Episcopall
Iurisdiction,</hi> and maintaining <hi>Priviledges</hi>
granted by some <hi>Popes</hi> to certain <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi>
A vast difference therefore there
is between <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> in
<hi>Disputes touching Church Government:</hi> and
utterly irremediable on the <hi>Protestants</hi>
side, whereas wee see it ended, or at
least silenced, among <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>113. <q>But differences of this Nature
are not considerable compared to those
obiected by the Doctour in the last
place,<note place="margin">P. 443.</note> which are touching <hi>Matters of
Doctrin,</hi> and as he pretends of <hi>Faith:</hi>
in which regard <hi>he says that the Church
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49053:70"/>
of Rome</hi> can have no advantage in
point of <hi>Vnity above others:</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he, not content with this, adds,
That <hi>the Popes Authority</hi> being ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledged
by <hi>Catholicks the fountain
of Vnity,</hi> and all <hi>Catholicks</hi> not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> Whereas
both <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> agree
in the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which
is to <hi>Protestants</hi> a more certain way
of ending <hi>Controversy,</hi> therefore he
concludes that <hi>Protestants</hi> have a more
certain and safe way of <hi>Vnity,</hi> then
<hi>Catholicks.</hi> For that the <hi>Pope</hi> has not
a sufficient power to reduce to <hi>Vnity</hi>
parties dissenting in <hi>Doctrinall</hi> Points
of weight, such as are the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
between the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
about <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Free Will;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciscans</hi>
about the <hi>Immaculate Conception &amp;c.</hi>
is, he saith, evident, since those quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
have to this day continued many
ages, and are prosecuted with great
eagernes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>114. In this manner argues the <hi>Doctour,</hi>
whereto the <hi>Answer</hi> is obvious. For.
1. he trifles with and abuses an unskilfull
<hi>Reader,</hi> in telling him that the <hi>Scripture
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49053:70"/>
being acknowledged on both sides to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
is a more certain way of ending
Controversies then the Popes determination,
who is not by many Catholick believed to be
infallible.</hi> For how can a <hi>Writing,</hi> the
sense whereof is controverted, end a
<hi>Controversy?</hi> And to say that a writing
is of it self a surer mean to end debates,
then when interpreted by a <hi>Iudge,</hi> to say
this, and to think to be believed, is to
call his <hi>Readers</hi> brutish, irrationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and to make all <hi>Tribunalls</hi> ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
2. It is not the <hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi>
but his. <hi>Authority</hi> which ends the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,</hi>
either by <hi>Determining</hi> the
Point in Controversy, so as his Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
is accepted by the Church: or
at least by imposing <hi>Silence</hi> among <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants,</hi>
till himself in a <hi>Councill</hi> unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeably
decide it: By which way of
imposing <hi>Silence</hi> severall eager <hi>Disputes</hi>
have been ended by <hi>Popes,</hi> as this age
can witness. 3. Though all <hi>Catholicks</hi>
do <hi>in thesi</hi> acknowledge that they are
obliged, at least, to silence when impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the <hi>Pope:</hi> Yet it cannot be denyed
but that some have not complied with
this Obligation. But this is not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to want of <hi>Authority</hi> in the <hi>Pope,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49053:71"/>
but to the unrulines of mens passions
and pride. And the same fault we see in
<hi>Secular Tribunalls,</hi> which yet does not
hinder but that <hi>Iudges</hi> are reputed fitt
and proper to end <hi>Law suits.</hi> 4. That
neither the <hi>Pope</hi> nor the <hi>Councill</hi> of
<hi>Trent,</hi> have decided the fore mentioned
<hi>Controversies,</hi> we are to ascribe either to
the inconsiderablenes of them; or to the
want of Sufficient clearness of <hi>Scripture</hi>
or <hi>Tradition</hi> for either party; or to a just
and prudent care of preventing <hi>Schisms</hi>
in the <hi>Church</hi> by such <hi>Determinations,</hi>
wherein so considerable parties in the
<hi>Church</hi> are divided in opinion. 5. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Doctour</hi> says that the <hi>Points</hi> in
<hi>Controversy</hi> among <hi>Catholicks,</hi> being
many of them the same agitated among
<hi>Protestants,</hi> are <hi>Points of Faith,</hi> he is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
mistaken: For there are among
<hi>Catholicks</hi> no <hi>Points</hi> controverted, but
such <hi>Doctrins</hi> where the sense of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
being variously expounded by the
two <hi>Parties,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> as yet hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
nothing which sense of them
is <hi>de Fide</hi> (though the Parties themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
would each of them have their own
to be so,) not determined, I say, so
clearly, as that both sides are agreed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49053:71"/>
that such is the <hi>Churches Decision.</hi> As for
<hi>Protestants,</hi> what <hi>Doctrins</hi> are esteemed
<hi>Points of Faith,</hi> and what School Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
I think no <hi>Oedipus</hi> can resolue. <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
Stillingfleet</hi> elsewhere saith down
right,<note place="margin">Ration Accou. p 54.</note> That the Church of England
holds no <hi>Points</hi> to be <hi>Articles</hi> of her
<hi>Faith,</hi> but those wherein the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> also agrees with her, and holds
the same to be such. His words are,
<hi>There is a great deale of difference between
the owning of some Propositions in order to
Peace, and the believing of them as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Articles of Faith. The Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
makes no Articles of Faith, but such
as have testimony and approbation of the
whole Christian world of all ages, and are
acknowledged to be such by Rome it self;
and in other things she requires Subscription
to them, not as Articles of Faith, but as
inferiour Truths, which she expects Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to, in order to her Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.</hi>
Thus the <hi>Doctour.</hi> But here I
cannot well understand, why he saith
her <hi>Subiects Subscribe them as inferiour
Truths,</hi> and yet maintains the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> to require no <hi>Subscription</hi> to her
<hi>Articles</hi> as <hi>Truths,</hi> for that surely is a
requiring of assent to them, but a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:49053:72"/>
of non-contradiction, or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opposition
of them, which consists
with the parties holding them <hi>Errours.</hi>
Now methinks, this the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
believing nothing as of Faith, but
what the <hi>Popes</hi> and the <hi>Roman Churches
Faith</hi> also secures to them to be so,
should sound somewhat harsh in the
ears of many of his <hi>Disciples.</hi> Again, it
necessarily follows, that the <hi>Church of
Rome,</hi> notwithstanding its <hi>Idolatry, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism
&amp;c.</hi> yet failes in no necessary
<hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> 6. Lastly, that which
makes <hi>Disputes</hi> among <hi>Christians</hi> about
<hi>Dostrinall Points</hi> pernicious, is not the
heynousnes of the <hi>Errours</hi> themselves
on either <hi>Party,</hi> but the refusall to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt
to the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> when
condemning them, from whence
<hi>Schisms</hi> are inevitable, and such <hi>Refusers</hi>
then truly stiled <hi>Hereticks.</hi> No man will
deny but that the Errour of the <hi>Photi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
[or <hi>Socinians</hi>] called anciently
<hi>Homuncionists,</hi> for affirming <hi>Christ to be
meer man,</hi> is a most grievous <hi>Errour,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
exceeding any among <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks:</hi>
Yet if one living in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion
of Gods Church, should hold
this most pernicious Errour, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49053:72"/>
that the Church had condemned it,

                  <hi>S. Augustin</hi> professes
he durst not call such a man an <hi>Heretick.</hi>
How the <hi>Doctour</hi> would call such an
one, I know not. But this I will iustify,
that according to the <hi>Doctours Principles</hi>
he ought to pass for as good and as well

therefore especially <hi>Orthodox,</hi> for not

that it is scarce possible any of them
should be an honest man? The <hi>Doctour</hi>
has told them that these wicked men

with <hi>Contrition</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">P. 180.</note> as he interprets,

               </p>
               <p>116. Here if the Doctour were asked,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49053:73"/>
Does the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> held the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin</hi>
here by him reproved? He could
not say she did, because then the express
<hi>Decision</hi> of the <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
him:<note place="margin">Conc. Triden. Sess. XIV cap. 3.</note> Where three parts of the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Pennance</hi> are declared,
<hi>Contrition, Confession,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction:</hi>
Now in two of these the forsaking of
sin are contained. For <hi>Contrition</hi> implies
a sorrow for sin proceeding from a love
of <hi>God</hi> victorious over sin, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
a detestation of sin. And <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
signifies yet more, viz: A <hi>holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi>
taken by the <hi>Penitent</hi> upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for offending <hi>God,</hi> by denying to
himself even Lawfull pleasures because

sin: which is a great deale more then

               <p>117. A disposition, one may say, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour

from <hi>Christ</hi> himself, and not such
an aery <hi>Phantosme</hi> of an <hi>Absolution</hi> as the

he, is that we mean by Absolution:</hi> and
which say I, the Silliest woman in the
<hi>Doctours</hi> Parish can conferr as well and
validly as himself. But who are these
<hi>Wee,</hi> who mean no more then this by
<hi>Priestly Absolution?</hi> I am sure not the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats</hi>
of his <hi>Church,</hi> (But I must not say <hi>his
Church</hi> when I mean the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>)
who all hitherto have justified
this as one essentiall <hi>Character</hi> of the
order of <hi>Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Episcopat;</hi> unles
since the <hi>New Reformation</hi> (not yet ten
years old) they have been content that
this <hi>Character</hi> should be wiped out by
the <hi>Doctour,</hi> and that instead of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:49053:74"/>
of <hi>Gods Church, Maister Calvin</hi>
should be the universall authentick
<hi>Teacher</hi> of their <hi>Clergy.</hi> But I believe the
<hi>Doctour</hi> will in vain expect this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
from them: And I am sure the
now highest and worthiest of his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,</hi>
will not be of the number of the
Doctours <hi>Wee,</hi> who has solidly asserted
this <hi>Primitive Doctrin,</hi> and to confute
whom perhaps the <hi>Doctour</hi> has publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so pittifull a sense of <hi>Absolution;</hi> to
their preiudice ingratiating himself
with all other <hi>Sects,</hi> enemies to all <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Orders</hi> and <hi>Ordinations,</hi> and
making every one of them (as before
<hi>Iudges</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> sense, so) now
<hi>Vsurpers</hi> of their <hi>Offices,</hi> and, as they
hope, ere long of their <hi>Revenues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>118. The <hi>Church</hi> then is manifestly
free from the charge here imputed to
<hi>Catholicks</hi> by the <hi>Doctour,</hi> and by him
made use of to deterr any one from ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
themselves to her, because <hi>in her</hi>
(not, <hi>by her) Doctrins</hi> are by some taught
<hi>destroying the necessity of a good life.</hi> All
the <hi>Doctour</hi> can say is: Some reach some
such Doctrins, which some also refute,
and the whole <hi>Church</hi> disavows. This
being so, with what conscience can the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49053:75"/>
                  <hi>Doctour</hi> pretend danger upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in being members of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church,</hi> whenas in his own <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Churches,</hi> for which he has layd
grounds and <hi>Principles,</hi> every <hi>Christian</hi>
is allowed by himself in these <hi>Principles</hi>
to chuse not only what opinions, but
what <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> (after using a
sober enquiry into the <hi>Scriptures</hi>) they
like best. And what most horrid <hi>Doctrins</hi>
he has thereby excused and defended,
all <hi>Christendom</hi> at this time sees with
amazement and detestation.</p>
               <p>119. Surely when the <hi>Doctour</hi> wrote
this passage he conceived himself quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
not with <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
assert against <hi>Protestants,</hi> the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of good works to Salvation, and
their <hi>Efficacy</hi> in it, upon Supposition of
our <hi>Lords gracious Promise</hi> to reward
them, but with some of his own <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
(perhaps with himself) who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all <hi>Merit of good works</hi> from a
<hi>Christians Salvation:</hi> or with his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
Luther,</hi> who said that <hi>good Works
did more harme then good;</hi> Therefore he
may doe well to ask them pardon after
<hi>Contrition,</hi> and <hi>Confession</hi> of his fault.</p>
               <p>120. Certainly if he could bring
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49053:75"/>
himself to a willingnes of informing
himself in true <hi>Catholick Doctrins,</hi> he
would find that the way to <hi>Salvation</hi>
there taught is much strayter then that
which is chosen by <hi>Protestants,</hi> and
<hi>Holines</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> far more strictly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
For proof of which it were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
only to repeat what was even
now cited out of the <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi>
touching the <hi>Doctrin of Pennance:</hi> But a
proof visible of late to all our eys are so
many <hi>Apostats</hi> from the <hi>Catholick
Church, Apostats</hi> first from <hi>Obedience</hi>
and <hi>Chastity,</hi> and next from <hi>Faith;</hi> For
doe not they declare to all the world
that <hi>Carnall Liberty</hi> and <hi>Carnall Lusts</hi>
drove them first out of their <hi>Monasteries,</hi>
and next out of the <hi>Church:</hi> As soon as
they come into the aire of <hi>Protestancy,
a woman</hi> becoms necessary to them, and
<hi>Fasting</hi> insupportable, and if they can
ravish from <hi>Christ</hi> a <hi>Spouse</hi> consecrated
to him, they promise to themselves a
more gainfull and honorable reception.
But if they will needs have <hi>Women,</hi>
because the <hi>woman</hi> is handsom and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive,
is therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> presently
turned <hi>Antichrist?</hi> does our <hi>Lord</hi> cease
to be present in the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> is <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:49053:76"/>
presently extinguished? doe <hi>Angells</hi>
and <hi>Saints</hi> no longer deserve to be ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledged
our <hi>Protectours?</hi> in a word,
have they forgotten what they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleived and are they in a moment
inspired to answer to a <hi>new Catechism,</hi>
full of <hi>new Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> gravely
proposed to them by a Patriarch and
Pandar for impure <hi>Apostats,</hi> out of the
Pulpitt? What influence has the <hi>woman</hi>
upon them to make all this change?
Truly the very same the <hi>Woman</hi> had
from the <hi>Creation.</hi> She presents an
<hi>Apple</hi> to them, which wonderfully
delights them to look upon (Especially
if growing in <hi>England,</hi> where they
heare the fairest are to be had.) But if
besides seeing it, they get a tast of the
<hi>Apple, their eys are presently opened,</hi> and
as it were <hi>in uno radio solis they see (all)
good and evill,</hi> and nothing appears <hi>good</hi>
but what the <hi>woman</hi> approves, and
without which they can not enjoy and
maintain the <hi>Woman,</hi> nor make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
and <hi>Mistress</hi> to our noblest
<hi>young Ladyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>121. But leaving these putrid <hi>Carci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomata</hi>
of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
stains to the <hi>Protestant,</hi> is it not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49053:76"/>
apparent that the Doctrin of <hi>Pennance</hi>
and <hi>Mortification</hi> hath been rejected by
<hi>Protestants,</hi> not because they are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
of good life (as the Doctour says,
and I dare say not one understanding
person in his own <hi>Parish</hi> beleives him)
but for the Severity of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood?</hi> Besides
this, where doe we hear of <hi>Restitution</hi>
of goods got by Usury and deceit among
<hi>Protestants,</hi> there being among them no
obligation of confessing such sins, and
by consequence of making <hi>Satisfaction,</hi>
without which <hi>Absolution</hi> cannot be
granted? The <hi>Doctour</hi> will not allow
me here to name those <hi>Schooles</hi> of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and <hi>Devotion, Monasteries,</hi> though
from the Primitive times esteemed a
principall Ornament of <hi>Gods Church,</hi>
because he will esteem them nothing
but Schooles of <hi>Fanaticism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>122. But in generall most certain it
is, that among <hi>Catholicks</hi> the Study of
ways promoting <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> is
incomparably greater, but withall more
painfull, then among <hi>Protestants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>123. But this satisfies not the <hi>Doctour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 181.</note>
who brings in <hi>Bishop Taylour,</hi> using the
same argument with him in his <hi>Disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49053:77"/>
from Popery,</hi> viz: the <hi>no-necessity of
forsaking sins in the Catholick Church, since
if a man commits them again and again, he
knows a present remedy,</hi> toties quoties? <hi>it is
but confessing with Sorrow or Attrition,
and upon Absolution he is as whole, as if he
had not Sinned. Yea if after Sixty or eighty
years together of a wicked life, he shall doe
this in the Article of his death, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
passes him into a state of Salvation.</hi>
Yea moreover the <hi>Doctour</hi> afterwards
taxes the Indulgence of the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. z12</note> because in her <hi>Rituall</hi> she or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains
that <hi>Extreme-Vnction should be
conferred on persons unable to confess as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under a</hi> delirium, <hi>or wholly insensible,
if before it be but probable that they desired
it, or gave any signs of Contrition.</hi> And
hereby, saith he, if <hi>any sins have remained
upon them, they are taken of by vertue of
this Sacred Vnction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>124. As touching the too great facility
allowed by some <hi>Catholick Writers</hi> in
giving Absolution <hi>toties quoties</hi> to sinners
returning to their vomit, and giving but
small signs of their Will to relinquish
sins, the <hi>Doctour</hi> does very well to taxe
it, as a great hindrance indeed to a holy
life. But because some few have practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49053:77"/>
or perhaps taught this, he does very
ill to make this a <hi>Disswasive</hi> from ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Church</hi> herself, expressly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
in the <hi>Councill of Trent</hi> such a

Crimes, they themselves become partakers
of the crimes of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>125. Besides this, the <hi>Doctour,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
is not ignorant, though it was
not for his purpose to take notice of it,
that not very long since, among severall
dangerous <hi>Positions</hi> collected out of some
<hi>Modern Casuists,</hi> such scandalous relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in administring the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of

which were not only condemnd by the

but also a <hi>Book,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of which
undertook to defend them, was solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>126. IN the next place for as much as
concerns the conferring <hi>Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and administring the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of
<hi>Extreme Vnction</hi> to persons in <hi>Articulo
Mortis,</hi> who do, or have given any sign
of Sorrow or desire of them: the Church
in her Rituall does no more then hath
been the practise ever since the first
Councill of <hi>Nicea.</hi> And <hi>S. Augustin</hi>
treating of this Subiect in a <hi>Sermon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August lib. 50 hom.</note> tells
his Auditors that out of Charity and
care to dying persons,<note place="margin">Hom. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods Ministers</hi>
upon the least testification of Sorrow in
such patients administer the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
to them, though despairing that they
shall live to doe works worthy of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi>
so leaving them to <hi>Gods</hi> mercy:
(This they did by warrant from the
first <hi>Councill of Arles,</hi> and the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Pope Innocent</hi>) But withall he
seriously exhorts them to doe such
works in time of health, and not to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49053:78"/>
to an <hi>Absolution</hi> conferr'd in such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances;
for <hi>though they may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of enioying the full effect of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet, saith he, I am not confident of

                     </gap>.</hi> Yet notwithstanding such want of
confidence he would not be wanting to
them, to afford them all his assistance in
such a perillous hour. And if the <hi>Doctour</hi>
were seriously examined by any one of
his freinds, or by any but a <hi>Catholick,</hi>
whether in such circumstances he
would refuse an <hi>Absolution,</hi> I mean an
Absolution according to his <hi>Mode,</hi> by
<hi>applying the Promises of the Gospell to his
Patient;</hi> Sure he would not say that his
custom among his <hi>Parishioners</hi> is to bid
the poor <hi>agonizant</hi> to goe to the <hi>Devill,</hi>
for there was no hopes for him. He
would no doubt tell him of <hi>Promises,</hi>
and bid him rely upon them, though he
will not permit <hi>Catholicks</hi> to do so.</p>
               <p>127. But the <hi>Doctour</hi> in prosecuting
this Subiect alters his Method of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
For whereas generally in his <hi>Book</hi>
he endeavoured to make <hi>Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
odious, by telling <hi>Stories</hi> of the
actions and Doctrins of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<q>disowned by the <hi>Church:</hi> here he
absolves some <hi>Catholick Doctours,</hi>

among the rest, <hi>Monsieur Arnaud,</hi>
and charges the Church itself for tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
a <hi>Doctrin</hi> (as he pretends) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly

be effectually conferred by the force of the

all Catholicks)<note place="margin">P. 206.</note> what need can there be of
a true preparation of the mind by the
exercise of Faith, Prayer, Repentance
&amp;c. in order to the receiving the benefitt
of them?</hi> He further adds, that thoug<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Cassander</hi> interprets this to have res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<hi>to the worth of the Priest,</hi> as if his
unworthines could hinder the Validity
and Efficacy of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> though
the receivers be never so well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Yet (saith he) this cannot consist
with the <hi>Councills</hi> meaning, because
in the <hi>twelfth Canon</hi> following it was
condemned expressly, and it is not to
be supposed that the <hi>Councill</hi> would
frame two <hi>Canons</hi> to condemn the
same errour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>128. Thus argues the <hi>Doctour,</hi> but
under favour deales not fairely in not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49053:79"/>
citing the <hi>Councills Canon</hi> entirely,
which had he done, would have spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his inferences from it. The words
are, <hi>Whosoever shall say that by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
themselves of the New Law Grace is
not conferr'd</hi> ex opere operato, <hi>but that a
belief alone of the Divine Promise is Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the obtaining Grace, Let him be
Anathema.</hi> Which <hi>Canon</hi> was made
specially against <hi>Luthers</hi> errour, who
attributed all good to <hi>Faith</hi> alone, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the <hi>Sacraments</hi> entirely useless. In
which <hi>Errour</hi> I doe not know that he is
followed by any Sober <hi>Protestants,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the <hi>Doctour,</hi> who by his discourse
seems to renounce all benefitt from the
<hi>Sacraments</hi> themselves: he will owe
<hi>Grace</hi> to nothing but his own <hi>Faith,
Prayer &amp;c.</hi> In his opinion the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of the <hi>New Law</hi> as well as the <hi>old,</hi>
are <hi>[infirma &amp; egena elementa] weak
and beggarly elements.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note>
But <hi>Scripture</hi> and
<hi>Tradition</hi> have taught the <hi>Church,</hi> and
the Church us, otherwise, viz. That
by Baptism the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Regeneration is</hi>
conferr'd; that the Holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> is
<hi>Semen immortalitatis;</hi> that by <hi>Extreme
Vnction</hi> and the <hi>Priests Prayers</hi> sins are
forgiven &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:49053:80"/>129. Neither from hence can the
<hi>Doctour</hi> rationally inferr, that there
will be no need of a true <hi>preparation</hi> of
mind by the excuse of <hi>Faith &amp;c.</hi> since
the <hi>Church</hi> herself requires such prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
as the <hi>Doctour</hi> speaks of: And the
very term of <hi>Preparation</hi> implies that
some <hi>Benefitt</hi> is expected to be received
from the <hi>Work it self,</hi> besides, and
beyond what is obtained by <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>130. But this being a <hi>Doctrinall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy</hi>
and brought in only by the way
in this his present discourse, the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it ought to be reserved for his
worthy <hi>Adversary,</hi> if he think good:
Yet this right I will doe the <hi>Doctour,</hi>
that he has with <hi>Monsieur Arnaud</hi> justly
censured one particular <hi>Writer</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
as necessary, for example, to a
worthy receiving of the most <hi>holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi>
no other preparation of mind but
only an absence of Mortall sins, to be
had by <hi>Confession</hi> of them. But will any
rationall man judge that because there
are found in a <hi>Church</hi> a few <hi>Teachers of
Security,</hi> and <hi>Sowers of pillows under mens
Ellbows,</hi> that therefore it is dangerous
to be a member of a Church most free
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49053:80"/>
from warranting that <hi>Doctrin</hi> which is
scarce received by one <hi>Bishop</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>131. Yea moreover, if he would
search among <hi>School-men</hi> who make the
largest allowances in this business, he
will find that generally all require <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Repentance</hi> in the Receivers of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
and these two joyned with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
for the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Pennance;</hi>
they require also the <hi>State of Grace</hi> (that
is the habit of <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi>
and so of <hi>Devotion</hi>) for the <hi>Eucharist
&amp;c.</hi> And whosoever wants any such

                  <q>
                     <hi>the care of a good life is taken off among

                        </gap>ation of
sin (by the Prayers of the living) after
death.</hi> Whereas <hi>wee Protestants, says
he, in our plain Doctrin teaching that
every impenitent Sinner must expect no
less then eternall vengeance in another
world, if this will not prevail upon men
to leave their sins, and lead a good life,
we cannot imagine a groundles fiction
of Purgatory should ever doe it.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>134. Who would not think now
that the <hi>Doctour</hi> in such a way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
is willing that his <hi>Readers</hi>
should believe that <hi>Catholicks</hi> very
seldom, if ever, endeavoured to terrify
impenitent <hi>Sinners</hi> with the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of eternall torments in <hi>Hell fire?</hi>
And no doubt if he had plainly said so
he would not have wanted some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Readers,</hi> it being in this age so
gainfull a trade to traduce Catholicks
by odious, false imputations both in
pulpits, presses, and any where else.</p>
               <p>135. Therefore though I must not
expect to be believed by all, that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> so well as the <hi>Doctour,</hi> yet I
will not forbear plainly to declare it.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49053:81"/>
                  <hi>Catholicks</hi> are taught. 1. <hi>that</hi> finally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
sinners, if guilty of mortall
sins, shall irremediably suffer everlasting
torments of <hi>Hell. 2. That Catholicks</hi>
guilty of mortall or venial sins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
of them before death, unless
they also undergoe such <hi>Pennances</hi> and
<hi>Satisfactions</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> imposes, or
such as in any faulty indulgence of their
<hi>Spirituall Superiours</hi> herein, the quality
of their sins and the imperfection of
their <hi>Contrition</hi> in <hi>Gods</hi> iustice requires,
and by that means dye in <hi>perfect Charity,</hi>
and their <hi>Souls</hi> entirely purged from the
stains of them, shall suffer most greivous
yet temporall, punishments after death,
since <hi>no unclean thing,</hi> remaining so, <hi>can
enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> 3. We are
taught that many conditions are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us to the end our <hi>Lords</hi> all, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Satisfactions</hi> may be
applied to us, by the <hi>Charity, Alms,</hi> and
<hi>Prayers</hi> of devout <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>136. Now such being the <hi>Catholick
Doctrin</hi> touching this <hi>Point,</hi> with what
shew of reason can any one affirm, that
this <hi>Doctrin</hi> takes away the care of a
good life? It teaches all that <hi>Protestants</hi>
teach touching the pains of Hell atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49053:82"/>
a wicked life: and withall it teaches
the terrible consequences of a tepid, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent,
imperfect, though otherwise
not bad life, which <hi>Protestants</hi> do not
teach: <hi>Protestants</hi> require to <hi>Repentance</hi>
only a change of life: but the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> besides this, requires <hi>Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for past sins, herein following <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Antiquity,</hi> whose <hi>Doctrine</hi> in
this Point is thus declared by <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. Hom. 50. cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vlt.</note>
                  <hi>It is not Sufficient for a Penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to change his manners to the better, and
to recede from evill actions, except for sins
past Satisfaction be made to God by the
dolour of Pennance, by humble sighs and
groans, by the Sacrifice of a contrite heart,
and by Almsgiving &amp;c.</hi> Thus it is that
the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> hinders a good life,
and thus do <hi>Protestants</hi> promote it.</p>
               <p>137. <q>Yea but, says the <hi>Doctour,</hi> a fear
of such temporall torments is in a
manner taken away by an expectation
of the <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> of living
freinds, especially if the dead person
had been <hi>rich,</hi> and had left means of
procuring <hi>Masses &amp;c.</hi> for his soule.</q>
Be it so: yet how ever, some terrour
there is to <hi>Catholicks,</hi> restraining them
from Security in an imperfect life, which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49053:82"/>
                  <hi>Protestants</hi> laugh at, whilst they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
imperfect Soules with all their stains,
a present possession of heaven after
death, to be obtained not by laborious
<hi>Good Works,</hi> but by <hi>Faith,</hi> that is, a
strong fancy that their sins are certainly
forgiven, and that they are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Gods Elect,</hi> in whom <hi>God</hi> sees no
sins, though themselves &amp; their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
see too too many.</p>
               <p>138. But the <hi>Doctour</hi> pleases himself
in one great advantage which he has
found against this <hi>Doctrine:</hi> which is
thus expressed by him,<note place="margin">P. 681.</note> 
                  <hi>How easy is it
(according to this Doctrin) for a rich man
to enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi> But
with his leave, such easines of being
saved is not thereby promised to <hi>rich
men.</hi> Yet thus much We will allow
to the <hi>Doctour,</hi> that in some small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<hi>rich men</hi> may enioy an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
as to <hi>Salvation,</hi> which <hi>poor men</hi>
want; And this surely he will not deny,
when he considers that speech of our
<hi>Saviour,</hi> who though he had formerly
said, <hi>How hardly shall a Rich man enter
into the Kingdom of heaven?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk xvi. 9.</note> Yet speaking
to <hi>Rich men,</hi> he counsells them, saying,
<hi>Make to your selves freinds of the Mammon
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49053:83"/>
of iniquity, that when ye faile they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
you into euerlasting Tabernacles.</hi>
Which speech of his seems exactly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the present Subiect. Here it is
euident that <hi>Rich men</hi> by the ir riches
may procure that which <hi>poor men</hi> for
want of the <hi>Mammon of iniquity</hi> cannot.</p>
               <p>139. Yet in many other regards it is
certain that <hi>poor men</hi> haue a very great
advantage aboue the <hi>Rich,</hi> being free
from many <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Snares</hi> to
wich Wealth, ease and plenty exposes
men. So that at least for escaping <hi>Hell</hi>
and <hi>Purgatory</hi> the <hi>Poorer</hi> are in a much
fairer and easier way. The <hi>poor</hi> also are
these <hi>Freinds</hi> here Spoken of by our
<hi>Lord,</hi> beloued of <hi>God,</hi> who not only
with ease enter into his Kingdom, but
by their credit can help to bring their
rich benefactors thither also.</p>
               <p>140. But after all this, the application
of the <hi>Churches</hi> and particular persons
<hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Suffrages</hi> for the <hi>Deceased,</hi>
that are Procured by the <hi>Alms</hi> of the
<hi>Rich,</hi> Whether it be not <hi>Vniuersall</hi> or
whether, to recompence this, the <hi>Poor</hi>
do not share more the <hi>Common Prayers</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> not made with respect to
particular persons, the <hi>Church hath</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49053:83"/>
nothing. And of these <hi>Common
Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> more applied to
the <hi>Poor and</hi> freindles, <hi>S. Augustin</hi> speaks
thus [J quote him because being a

of <hi>Nola, whether it were any benefit
or advantage to the soule after death to be

Shrine or Tombe of a Martyr?</hi> he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
it was: that so this might mind the
Kindred or freinds of the <hi>Deceased</hi> to
recommend such a soule to the <hi>Martyr,</hi>
whose <hi>Relicks</hi> lay there, so to be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with our <hi>Lord</hi> by his <hi>Intercession</hi>
                  </q>
(where it may be observed, that <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>

its decision of this <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Indulgences,</hi>
expressly <hi>Condemns a too frequent vse of
them, as enervating Ecclesiasticall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and desirous to correct all scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
abuses crept in them, ordains an vtter
abolishment of all vnlawfull gain for the
obtaining of them, enioyning likewise all
Bishops in their Provinciall Synods to take
care that the Benefit of Indulgences may be
dispensed piously, holily and without corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
to the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>142. Now if after such solicitude she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
by the Councill, all abuses doe not
yet cease,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> this must be imputed to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailty and corruption, and to the
erroneous <hi>Doctrin</hi> of some <hi>Schoolmen:</hi>
or rather some passages of them singled
out from the context, and stript from
the necessary circumstances, and so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied,
whereby the power of the
<hi>Donour</hi> of them is extended without its
certain limitts, and a vertue attributed
to them far exceeding that which the
present <hi>Church</hi> acknowledges in them.</p>
               <p>143. <hi>This seems plainly to appeare
by the words of the</hi> Councill <hi>declaring,</hi>
That since a Power of conferring Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49053:85"/>
hath been giuen by Christ to his
Church, which from the most ancient times
hath exercised this Power, diuinely granted
to her; Therefore the Holy Synod doth teach
and command the vse of Indulgences to be
retained in the Church, as very healthfull to
Christian people, and approved by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Holy Councills.</p>
               <p>144. From this <hi>Declaration</hi> of the
<hi>Councill</hi> the <hi>Doctour</hi> truly says, that some
<hi>Catholick Writers</hi> do make this <hi>Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
                  <q>That Indulgences are only a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ancient Severity of Church Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin
according to the old Penitentiall
Canons.</q>
                  <note place="margin">P. 516.</note> Which <hi>Deduction</hi> seems the
lesse irrationall, since the <hi>Indulgences</hi>
inserted by the Councill are the same,
<hi>which from the most ancient times have
been exercised by the Church.</hi> And such
an vse of <hi>Indulgences</hi> if the <hi>Doctour</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> he dares not
to his own, Since he cannot deny
but that in the <hi>Spirituall Courts</hi> the
<hi>Iudges</hi> assume a power either to qualify
<hi>Corporall punishments</hi> imposed by the
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> on Speciall sins, or
commuting them into <hi>Pecuniary.</hi> But
I must add one thing, that euen these
<hi>Indulgences</hi> may be said to extend their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49053:85"/>
vertue till after death: Since it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that being duly administred, and
taking away the obligation to the <hi>Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of the <hi>Penitential Canons,</hi> they doe
consequently abate the <hi>Suffrings</hi> after
death, which otherwise the <hi>Penitent</hi>
was to vndergoe having neglected to
make <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in this life. In a word,
<hi>Catholicks</hi> are taught that <hi>Indulgences</hi> are
beneficiall to none but those that are
already in the <hi>state of Grace:</hi> And that
<hi>Remission</hi> of <hi>Penalty</hi> only, and not sin, is
conceded by them: Likewise that they
relate to <hi>Purgatory</hi> only, not to <hi>Hell:</hi>
And lastly by the form of them it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that the vertue of them after
death is only <hi>per modum Suffragij.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>145. As touching the <hi>Doctours Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions</hi>
concerning <hi>Indulgences</hi> if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
an <hi>Answer</hi> to them, he must goe
into some of our <hi>Catholick Schooles,</hi>
where he will not faile to receiue <hi>Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
to them all, if they were twice as
many; but I dare not assure him that
these <hi>Solutions</hi> will give him <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
For my part I have nothing to say
about them, nor, I am sure, any other
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> as a <hi>Catholick:</hi> Neither doe
I belieue that euer any <hi>Protestant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertist</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:49053:86"/>
wrote a <hi>Volume</hi> against the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> of which not near a
tenth part did in any sort concern her:
and such a Book the Doctour, certainly,
knows his to be: and by consequence
every ingenious prudent <hi>Reader</hi> will
easily discouer from how poysonous a
heart it issued, and to how vnchristian
an end it was directed.</p>

he will not allow to be a matter of

for a power beyond that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>

               </p>
               <p>147. Notwithstanding, with the
<hi>Doctours</hi> favour, his allegations doe not
proue the mater not to be of <hi>Discipline</hi>
meerly. For the <hi>Case</hi> stands thus: It
was far from being the <hi>Churches Primary
intention</hi> that the <hi>publick Office</hi> should
be in a tongue not vnderstood by the
people; for it was at first composed in
the language generally Spoken and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
through <hi>Europe.</hi> But that <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>
being changed by a mixture of
the <hi>Dialects</hi> of seuerall barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
she thought it not prudent that
the publick Service of <hi>God</hi> composed
with great care and exactnes, should
be exposed in euery Nation to vnsskill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Translatours,</hi> and every age to be
varied, as <hi>Dialects</hi> did alter, it not being
in her power to examine all <hi>Translations</hi>
after every new <hi>Edition.</hi> And the same
judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the most ancient &amp; most exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Churches</hi> in the <hi>East had,</hi> all which
in a manner do to this day retain their

by the <hi>Common</hi> ignorant <hi>people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>148. Notwithstanding to repair, as
much as may be, this incommodity, the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49053:87"/>
                  <hi>Roman Church</hi> (at least) has taken
great care in her <hi>Councills</hi> that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in all Nations should be furnished
with <hi>Devotions</hi> in their <hi>Natiue Tongues,</hi>
which are for the most part taken out
of the <hi>Publick Liturgy,</hi> and moreouer
has commanded all <hi>Pastours</hi> to interpret
to the people in the administring of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi>
especially the most Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
whatsoever they are capable of
vnderstanding: by which means there
is scarce a Rustick so ignorant but well
vnderstands what the <hi>Priest</hi> does
through the whole course of the <hi>Masse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>149. Matters standing thus, the <hi>Church</hi>
esteems it more prudent and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
also to <hi>edification</hi> in generall, that
all <hi>Catholick Churches</hi> should serve
<hi>God</hi> vniformly in a language which
cannot be corrupted, especially such
provisions being made for the peoples

wiser then the whole <hi>Western</hi> and
most <hi>Eastern Churches,</hi> much ioy may
he take in his great humility.</p>
               <p>150. But after all, how can the people
say, <hi>Amen,</hi> will the <hi>Doctour</hi> say from
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49053:87"/>
                  <hi>S. Paul?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> I answer. <hi>S. Paul</hi> in that place

all that can be deduced from it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the <hi>Publick Divine servcie,</hi> is
this, that either this be performed in a

hath reasonable <hi>Motives</hi> (which she,
not we, must judge of) not to change
the formerly vsed language of it, so
much as is necessary for the common

ouer and over again.)<note place="margin">Vers. 5. 9. 13. 27 28.</note> Now such <hi>Prayers,

also of the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Masse</hi> necessary

it is their duty to believe and obey

               <p>153. How much would the <hi>Doctour</hi>
be beholden to that freindly man who

of any <hi>Ancient Ecclesiasticall Writer,

<hi>That euery sober enquirer may be a Iudge

assure him, such a freind is not to be

that he embraces seuerall <hi>Points</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

he would, no doubt, with ioy

               </p>
               <p>154. To descend to our <hi>Modern</hi> times:
Though <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:49053:89"/>
those disturbers of the world, to gain
the affections of the <hi>Common rabble,</hi>
were very earnest to put the <hi>Bible</hi> into
their hands, yet does the <hi>Doctour</hi> think
that they would patiently haue suffred
any of their followers to chuse any
other <hi>Religion</hi> out of it, but what they,
as <hi>Prophets</hi> sent from <hi>God,</hi> had taught
them? Nay would the <hi>Doctour</hi> take it
well of his own <hi>Parishioners</hi> if they
should doe so? Yet he is angry with
<hi>Catholicks</hi> because we rather trust the
<hi>Churches</hi> iudgment, then our own: a
strange quarrell certainly. But it is a
folly to think that any of the <hi>Common</hi>
sort of people seek into the <hi>Bible</hi> to find
their <hi>Religion</hi> there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not one in ten
thousand among us but for his whole
<hi>Faith</hi> relyes vpon the credit and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
honesty of some zealous <hi>Lecturer,</hi> or
reputed learned <hi>Doctour.</hi> Now J would
fain know of <hi>Doctour Stillingfleet</hi>
with what conscience he can suffer a
whole <hi>Congregation</hi> of well meaning
men, who can rely vpon nothing but
<hi>authority,</hi> to prefer his authority before
that of the whole <hi>Church:</hi> For nothing
can be more contrary to the <hi>Rules</hi> of
<hi>Common reason</hi> in them; and for their
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49053:89"/>
sinning against <hi>Reason</hi> he must be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to <hi>God.</hi> How does one of the
<hi>Doctours Parishioners</hi> find his whole
Religion in Scripture? Thus: The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
will bid him read the last verse
of the 6. chap. to the <hi>Romans:</hi> (or
he will read the words to him) <hi>The
Gift of God is eternall life:</hi> Here, says he,
the <hi>Papists</hi> are plainly confuted, who
say that <hi>God rewards our good works with
Heaven.</hi> He will tell him again that the
<hi>Papists</hi> hold that our <hi>Lords body</hi> is in the
<hi>Sacrament.</hi> How shall they be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
<hi>Christ</hi> indeed says, <hi>This is my Body:</hi>
What then? this must be vnderstood as
if he had sayd, <hi>This is the figure of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
Then plain <hi>Scripture</hi> interpreted by
the <hi>Doctour</hi> is against them. Again,
Look out the first Chapter to <hi>Titus,</hi> you
will find that those who are called
<hi>Elders,</hi> or <hi>Presbiters</hi> in the fifth verse,
are called <hi>Bishops</hi> in the Seaventh: Here
our <hi>Antichristian Prelats</hi> are plainly
confuted, who exalt themselues aboue
<hi>Elders,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>155. But one <hi>Point</hi> there is of main im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to these who will find all
things in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is, A <hi>Proof</hi>
that these <hi>Books</hi> which they are taught
to call <hi>Scripture,</hi> are the same which were
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49053:90"/>
                  <hi>Anciently</hi> written by men inspired
by <hi>God: That</hi> they have not been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and that they are rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted.
None of all these things they
can find in <hi>Scripture:</hi> what remedy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for this? None in the world, but
the <hi>Doctours</hi> own authority. He will
tell them perhaps that the <hi>Vniversall
Tradition</hi> of all <hi>Ages,</hi> which is of it self
credible, testifies this, and therefore
they ought to belieue it. But if they
should reply, and tell the <hi>Doctour,</hi> that
for all necessary Points of belief they
were, according to his <hi>Principles,</hi> to be
<hi>Iudges</hi> for themselues, but of that which
they call <hi>Tradition,</hi> they know not how
to iudge. If any of the <hi>Doctours Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioners</hi>
should be thus troublesom:
then must he be angry, and with a
frown tell them, <hi>Will ye be Papists?</hi> Is
it not fitter ye should believe me, then
like blind <hi>Papists,</hi> pin your soules vpon
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the present <hi>Vniversall
Church?</hi> This stops their mouths: Now
they are fully satisfied, and ask pardon
for presuming to doubt, hauing such an
<hi>Oracle</hi> to teach them: that they ought
to be their own Teachers.) Thus it is
that ordinary people, even boyes and
girles, are to be fooled, and made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49053:90"/>
that they see all their <hi>Religion</hi> in
<hi>Scripture:</hi> whenas in very truth they
may as well be told, that they <hi>Smell</hi> it
out with their <hi>noses,</hi> as I once heard
<hi>Sir Francis Wenman</hi> say in a discourse
on a subiect like this.</p>
               <p>156. Howeuer the whole <hi>Stress</hi> of
the <hi>Doctours Religion</hi> lying vpon it, that
euery <hi>Christian</hi> is to be a judge of
the sence of Scripture: hence it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for his ends to contend <hi>Manibus
pedibusque</hi> that none should be discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from reading <hi>Scripture:</hi> (Yet I hope
he will excuse those who are not able
to read.</p>
               <p>157. To make this good, he employes
the vtmost of his invention, Subtilty
and reading. He who cannot find out
one single short sentence in <hi>Antiquity</hi>
to help to support the main Pillar of his
Religion: Yea moreouer he who has
not alledged one probable argument of
reason for strengthning that tottering
<hi>Pillar,</hi> except only a <hi>Negatiue one,</hi>
which is this, That <hi>Christians haue no
obligation to belieue any Church or Teacher
expounding the sence of Scripture, therefore
they must if they will be believers, believe
themselues alone:</hi> In this miserable exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

this same Doctour notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

per <hi>reductionem ad absurdum &amp; impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi>
which demonstrations also he

their <hi>Doctrin</hi> is (saith he) acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by late <hi>Catholick Diuines, Espenceus</hi>
and <hi>Alphonsus a Castro,</hi> and (one more
I will add,) by the vnworthy <hi>Writer</hi> of
this <hi>Treatise</hi> also.</p>
               <p>158. But this being granted, no <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi>
and, J think, no man in his right
witts will grant, that euery <hi>Porter, Cobler</hi>

I have so much confidence now in the

acknowledge thus much, yea by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in teaching ignorant people,
J am assured he has found no small dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in making such and other like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<hi>Doctrins</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> sink into
the minds of the rude people, though
sett down in the simplest, plainest <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms</hi>
for infants, though also those <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisms</hi>
were with all his skill explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by himself.</p>
               <p>159. Now taking this for granted
(till he contradict it) J would ask him,
Does he in his conscience think that
the forecited <hi>Fathers,</hi> when they exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Christians</hi> of their times to the
reading of <hi>Scriptures</hi> did not suppose
that for the sence of them in things any
way difficult or controverted they
would submitt their judgements to the
<hi>Church:</hi> which had they not supposed,
they would haue been less liberal in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> into their hands?
For hence it is that the <hi>Bible</hi> is called by
<hi>S. Ambrose, liber Sacerdotalis,</hi> because
to be dispensed to the people according
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49053:92"/>
us <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> iudged it might
proue beneficiall to them, and in all
ambiguities to be interpreted by the
same Pastours, Besides this, the art of
<hi>Printing</hi> being then vnknown, it was
not every ordinary <hi>Mechanick</hi> who
could purchase so costly a <hi>Manuscript,</hi> as
the <hi>Bible</hi> was: every <hi>groom</hi> or <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid</hi>
could not carry it vnder their arms
to Church, vnles they could spare at least
two years wages to buy it, and hire also
a <hi>litle Asse</hi> to carry it, so great was the
bulk, considering the largenes of <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
writen in these <hi>Ancient times.</hi> The
persons invited therefore by these <hi>Holy
Fathers</hi> to the frequent reading of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
were for the most part those of
the higher rank, of more ingenuous edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and so Prudence and discretion:
and especially such as they knew to be
firm to the teaching of the <hi>Church.</hi> Now
to such persons the <hi>Roman Church</hi> freely
allows the reading of <hi>Scriptures:</hi> and
on the other side, for such as the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour</hi>
qualifies with the name of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
according to his <hi>new Mode,</hi>
that is <hi>Independents</hi> on any <hi>Authority,</hi>
the <hi>Fathers</hi> most certainly would more
strictly, then they are now, have pro-prohibited
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49053:92"/>
the reading of them.</p>
               <p>160. Neither is it much to his purpose,
his alledging that though <hi>in the time of
the first four Generall Councills the Fathers
had tryall enough of the mischief of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 174.</note>
                  <hi>yet notwithstanding they did not on
that account forbid the people to read the
Scriptures.</hi> For who knows not the vast
difference between the <hi>ancient</hi> and our
<hi>Modern Heresies?</hi> Anciently the <hi>In ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi>
of <hi>Heresies,</hi> were great learned
<hi>Prelats,</hi> and subtile <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and the
obiect of their <hi>Heresies</hi> were <hi>Sublime
Mysteries of Faith,</hi> examined and framed
by them according to the grounds of
<hi>Plato's</hi> or <hi>Aristole's Philosophy,</hi> far above
the reach of Vulgar capacities; from
whence it is that <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the
<hi>Ancient Philosophers, the Patriarchs of
Hereticks.</hi> And moreover their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scriptures</hi> for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
such <hi>Heresies,</hi> were so Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
nice and <hi>acroamaticall,</hi> that both
great sharpnes of witt and learning too
were necessary to the discovering and
unridling the fallacy. Hence it came to
pass that in those dayes the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
might freely enough be read by ordinary
<hi>Christians</hi> without danger, especially
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49053:93"/>
considering their intention in reading
them was not to find out a <hi>New Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
but to instruct themselves in <hi>Piety,</hi>
and inflame their hearts in the <hi>Divine
Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>161. Thus stood matters in the <hi>Church</hi>
during the times of the first <hi>four Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councills.</hi> But our <hi>Modern Heresies</hi>
are of a quite different Complexion.
They are conversant about matters ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to the weakest capacities, as the
external administration of <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
the <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> of <hi>Superiours, Civill</hi> and
<hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> the manner of mens <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,</hi>
the <hi>Institution of Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
the <hi>Obligation of Vows;</hi> the <hi>Ordon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> teaching <hi>Fasting,
Matrimony, Celibacy, Paying of Tithes,
&amp;c.</hi> Or if about Sublime <hi>Mysteries,</hi> Men
are taught to examine such Mysteries
by naturall <hi>Reason</hi> and the Verdict of
their outward <hi>Senses.</hi> Hence it is come
to pass that our late <hi>Heresiarcks</hi> have not
been profound <hi>Subtle Philosophers,</hi> but at
the best a few <hi>Sensuall incestuous Fryars</hi>
abroad, and <hi>Popular Preachers</hi> at home:
yea, as we have lately seen, even <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks,
Souldiers</hi> or any other ignorant
persons actuated by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Pride</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:49053:93"/>
and <hi>Licentiousness</hi> to begin a <hi>Sect</hi> fitt for
the palats and complexions of <hi>Seekers</hi>
after <hi>Novelties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>162. Matters therefore standing thus
in these later times, can any rationall
man be perswaded that if any of those
<hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> cited by the <hi>Doctour,</hi> had
lived among us, or if such <hi>Heresies</hi> had
been spred among their <hi>Disciples,</hi> and
pretended to have been evidently dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from <hi>Gods Word,</hi> they would have
been so zealous in their Exhortations to
a promiscuous reading of <hi>Scriptures?</hi> But
how much think we, would such their
zeale have been cooled, in case such an
<hi>Architect</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> as the <hi>Doctour</hi> is,
had been in Vogue in their times? For
<hi>Principles</hi> they are which evidently
contain the most pernicious, <hi>Soule-des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying
Heresy</hi> that ever assaulted <hi>Gods
Church: Principles</hi> which banish <hi>Peace,
Charity, Humility</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> vtterly
from the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State: Principles</hi>
which if through <hi>Gods</hi> judgment they
should generally prevaile, what think
you would become of our <hi>Saviours Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi>
for there would not be left in the
world one <hi>Church</hi> at all, true or false:
Since where every one is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49053:94"/>
the only inventer and <hi>Iudge</hi> of his
own <hi>Faith,</hi> there may meet a <hi>Multitude,</hi>
but it is no <hi>Church,</hi> none having right
over another; <hi>errour</hi> and <hi>truth, vertue</hi>
and <hi>vice</hi> being equally <hi>Iustifiable.</hi> Lastly
these are <hi>Principles,</hi> the admirable vanity
of which I think was never paralleld
by any <hi>Heresiarch,</hi> but a certain <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
mentioned by <hi>Philastrius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philast</note> who
taught, <hi>That all Heresies were in their
precepts of life, innocent; and in their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins
true: [Omnes Hereses rectê ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
&amp; vera docere.</hi>]</p>
               <p>163. <hi>Non sum ambitiosus in malis,</hi> I
may with a good conscience protest that
it is only <hi>Truth</hi> and a <hi>Charitable</hi> compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to soules miserably seduced by so
<hi>Comprehensive</hi> a <hi>Heresy</hi> as is contained in
the <hi>Dostours Principles,</hi> which hath
moved mee to fix such a brand upon
them: Not that I suspect that he would
approve such consequences: but I am
confident with all his skill he cannot
avoyd them.</p>
               <p>164. Now I must acquaint the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
that my iust indignation against
these <hi>Principles</hi> is heightned from my
own unhappines, if not guilt in being
the first who gave occasion that they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49053:94"/>
should be known and received into the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> This I am sure nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he, nor perhaps any one now alive,
does know, and therefore I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the true <hi>Story</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them.</p>
               <p>165. As I remember it was in the
year 1638. that I had occasion to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
a <hi>Noble freind</hi> in a iourney from
<hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>London.</hi> When we were ready
to return, I went to a Booksellers shop
to search out some b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oks to be carried
back into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and among others I
bought <hi>Daillé du vray usage des Peres,</hi> a
<hi>Book</hi> at that time not at all taken notice
of. That <hi>Book</hi> the same night I shewd
to my <hi>Noble dear Lord Lucius Lord Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who perusing and liking the
<hi>Contents</hi> of it, desired me to give it him,
which I willingly did. About a month
after my return into <hi>Ireland,</hi> he sent me
a most civill letter, full of thanks both
in his own, but especially in <hi>M. Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi>
name for that small present, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me that that litle <hi>Book</hi> had saved
him a most tedious labour of reading
almost twenty great Volumes.</p>
               <p>166. This Mysterious speech I easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood. For <hi>M. Chillingworth</hi> a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49053:95"/>
litle before was returned out of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
where he had professed himself a
<hi>Catholick:</hi> and being sent for by <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
Laud,</hi> was strictly examined by
him touching his <hi>Religion,</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went to <hi>Masse,</hi> or <hi>Common
Prayer;</hi> to whom he gaue this account,
That he had entertained such scruples
touching <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
was as yet so vnsatisfyed with the
grounds of the <hi>English Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
that at the present his conscience
would not permitt him to goe either to
<hi>Masse</hi> or to <hi>Common Prayer.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with his <hi>Graces</hi> leaue he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to spend a year or two in a solitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
and the Study of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin
Fathers,</hi> fully purposing to embrace that
<hi>Religion</hi> which appeared to him most
consonant to what the <hi>Fathers</hi> generally
taught. The <hi>Archbishop</hi> much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
his design, and dismissed him
with his blessing, and a promise also
that he should enioy entire liberty to
prosecute so laudable a <hi>Study.</hi> Very
busy in this <hi>Study</hi> I found, and left him,
in <hi>England.</hi> But it was presently after
interrupted by that vnlucky <hi>Book</hi> of
<hi>Daillé,</hi> which perswaded him to a light
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49053:95"/>
esteem of the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> vpon whose
authority he would no longer rely.
But yet this did not bring him into the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> so as to think himself
obliged to belieue her <hi>Doctrins,</hi> and
whose authority he saw was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the other: and from all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,
but diuided <hi>English Sects,</hi> he
had a horrible aversion and contempt.
Therefore without any long demurr
he fixed his mind vpon <hi>Socinian grounds,</hi>
which he afterwards shewed in a litle
<hi>Book</hi> of one of them which was an <hi>Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
to certaine <hi>Theses Posnanienses,</hi>
which <hi>Theses,</hi> as J remember, asserted
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> in
opposition whereto the <hi>Socinian,</hi> reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all <hi>Externall Authority,</hi> layd these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
grounds of his <hi>Religion: That in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Doctrins the Scripture was clear:
Therefore euery sober Enquirer might with
ease find them in it, without any help of a
Teacher or at least any obligation to believe
him.</hi> Vpon these grounds <hi>M. Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
dilated his <hi>Discourses</hi> with much
art and gracefullness of Stile in his <hi>Book</hi>
against a learned <hi>Catholick writer:</hi> And
the same grounds so discoursed on, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
Stillingfleet</hi> has contracted <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:49053:96"/>
into his <hi>Principles:</hi> And both these
<hi>Books</hi> though manifestly destroying
all <hi>Authority</hi> in the <hi>English,</hi> or any
other Church, haue been patiently and
quietly suffred, yea commended by <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours</hi>
here, to their infinit dammage,
as is seene at this day: which dammage
is J belieue more sensible to them since
they see no considerable prejudice to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
by them, for J doe not remember
to haue heard of any one <hi>Established
Catholick</hi> Shaken in his <hi>Faith</hi> by such
grounds: Though I confess they obctruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a good while my entrance into the
<hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>167. Now it being certain that these
<hi>Princi ples</hi> came originally into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
from the <hi>Socinians</hi> (a <hi>Sect</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a <hi>Fundamentall Heresy</hi>) it is of
small edification and less glory to the
<hi>English Church</hi> (in case, as the <hi>Doctour</hi>
pretends, his <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>hers</hi> are built on
the same <hi>Principles</hi>) that she should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
acknowledge herself forced
to desert the grounds vpon which she
proceeded since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as
being grounds by <hi>M. Chillingworths</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
found to be Sandy and ruinous,
and consequently acknowledge all her
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49053:96"/>
                  <hi>Articles of belief,</hi> all her <hi>Laws, Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Canons, &amp;c.</hi> misgrounded. The
consideration of this, besides disreputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
cannot but raise great <hi>Scruples,</hi> in
the minds of her <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Subiects,</hi>
till she not only disavow this her <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi>
but likewise assert her <hi>Authority</hi>
by <hi>Answering</hi> all the <hi>Discourses</hi> of <hi>M.
Chillingworth, my Lord Falkland, M.
Digges, M. Whitby, Doctour Stillingfleet
and severall other Doctours and Professours
in the Vniversities,</hi> who all exalt their
Single judgments above her <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>168. And as for <hi>Doctour Stillingfleet</hi>
there is another task to be undertaken
by him, which I believe will give him
excercise enough. For he knowing that
the <hi>Socinians,</hi> as well as himself, do
make <hi>the plain evidence of Scripture in all
necessaries to all Sober enquirers, a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of their Religion,</hi> and upon this <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
building their <hi>Heresy,</hi> his <hi>Study</hi>
must be to beat them from this <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
which can be done no other way,
but either by confessing that the <hi>Doctrin</hi>
of <hi>Christs Divinity</hi> is not necessary to be
believed, or by demonstrating to them
that they do not understand the plainest
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49053:97"/>
                  <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> not having been sober
enquirers into it. This will be a task be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
such an <hi>Hectorean Controvertist</hi>
as the <hi>Doctour</hi> is esteemed to be, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how even among his freinds the
<hi>Socin<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ans,</hi> among all <hi>Protestant Sects,</hi> are
acknowledged to have been very <hi>Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
and far most exact in interpreting
the most difficult <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and
this not without good Success, except
where their iudgment has been perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a resolution to defend their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<hi>Hereticall Doctrins.</hi> Now by this
time I believe the <hi>Doctour</hi> sees what a
world of work his <hi>Principles</hi> have cut
out for him, which he is obliged to jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
not only against Catholicks, who
abhorr them, but <hi>Socinians</hi> also who
invented them as necessary for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
their <hi>Heresy,</hi> &amp; lastly against my
<hi>Lords</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> his <hi>Superiours,</hi> as I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believe. His <hi>Principles</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of so very main importance &amp; being
the only considerable <hi>Subiect</hi> treated of
in his <hi>Book,</hi> my Readers must not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that in so short a <hi>Treatise</hi> I have so
oft put him in mind of them, since a
horrour of the consequences of them
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49053:97"/>
forced me to look on them as <hi>mihi saepe
vocandum ad partes monstrum nullâ virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
redemptum a vitijs.</hi>
               </p>

            <div n="13" type="section">
               <head>§. 13. The Conclusion: vvith
Advices to the Doctour.</head>
               <p>169. THus much I judged suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make up an
Answer to those parts of the Doctours
Book, which do not <hi>purposely</hi> treat of a
Doctrinall Controversy: for no more
was required from mee, indeed not
quite so much: it being only the <hi>Section
of Fanaticism</hi> in which J was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
concerned. But the others intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themselves, J know not well how:
and by that means forced me also to
neglect observing the order in which
they lye in his <hi>Book.</hi> Which being no
very great fault, J hope a pardon from
the <hi>Doctour</hi> will without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
be obtained.</p>
               <p>170. J shall also stand in need of
another <hi>pardon</hi> for a fault, such as it is,
willingly committed, and not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of, because J beleive, except
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49053:98"/>
himself, none will esteem it a <hi>fault.</hi> It
is this. Observing in the <hi>Doctours Book</hi>
a world of <hi>Quotations</hi> out of <hi>Authours</hi>
which J never saw, nor intend to see,
containing many dismall <hi>Stories,</hi> and
many ridiculous passages of things done
or said by severall <hi>Catholicks</hi> in former,
and some latter, times: if J had had a
mind to examine, and say something
as in <hi>Answer</hi> to them, an impossibility
of finding out those <hi>Authours</hi> must have
been my excuse. But J have a <hi>better
Excuse</hi> then that. For if the <hi>Doctour</hi>
would have lent mee those <hi>Books</hi> out of
his <hi>Library,</hi> I should have thanked him
for his <hi>Civility,</hi> but withall I should
have refused to make use of his <hi>Offer.</hi>
For to what purpose would it have been
to turn over a heap of <hi>Books</hi> to find
out <hi>Quotations</hi> in which neither the
<hi>Church,</hi> nor myself were any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned?
Not concerned, J say, though
they had been <hi>Opinions</hi> or <hi>Actions</hi> even
of <hi>Popes</hi> themselves, being assured that
at least, never any <hi>Pope,</hi> how wicked
soever, ha's brought any <hi>Heresy</hi> into
the <hi>Church.</hi> It is to me all one whether
all his <hi>Allegations</hi> be true or false, as to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49053:98"/>
any advantage he can make of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> unless the
<hi>Doctour</hi> will undertake to demonstrate,
That it is unlawfull, or but considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
dangerous to be a Member of a
<hi>Church</hi> where any persons doe, or have
lived, who have been obnoxious to <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi>
or guilty of <hi>ill Actions:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>171. Yet J must acknowledge that
in one regard a <hi>Book</hi> written in such a
<hi>Stile</hi> as the <hi>Doctour's</hi> is, may have an
influence on the Whole <hi>Church,</hi> and,
against his intention, produce a good
effect in it. For it may be hoped that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
of the present Age will serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider the horrible consequences of
seditious, licentious and otherwayes
unwarrantable <hi>Doctrins</hi> and <hi>Practises</hi>
of a few <hi>Catholicks</hi> in former times,
which have not only been pernicious to
the <hi>Authours</hi> themselves, but by the
<hi>Scandalousness</hi> of them have exposed the
<hi>Church</hi> her self, how innocent soever,
to the detestation of such who are <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:</hi>
For <hi>Sins,</hi> when <hi>Scandalous</hi> are an

               <p>172. Hoping therefore that by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the <hi>Doctours Book</hi> such a <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi>
may accrew to his <hi>Catholick Readers,</hi>
as to render them more watchfull over
themselves to prevent hereafter the like
<hi>Scandals,</hi> J think my self obliged in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall,
seriously to advise him touching
the dangerous State he is now in, as to
his <hi>Soule,</hi> in regard likewise of <hi>Scandall.</hi>
He would laugh at me if I should tell
him that this danger proceeded from his
not being a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Catholick
Church.</hi> It is not that therefore that I
now mean: though <hi>Woe</hi> unto him, if
in the day of <hi>Iudgment</hi> he be found sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from <hi>our Lords Mysticall Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>173. Not to hold him in suspence:
J take leave to admonish him, that
since the world sees that he manifestly
professes himself a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-Protestant
Church</hi> established by
Law, his <hi>Mind</hi> must either answer to
his <hi>Profession,</hi> or he must be a shamefull
<hi>Hyppocrit.</hi> Now in case he be not an
Hypocrit, he is desired as a <hi>genuine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-Protestant</hi>
to cast his eyes on, and
to examine severall of the first <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:49053:99"/>
of his <hi>Church:</hi> there he will find an
<hi>Excommunication</hi> denounced <hi>ipso facto</hi>
against all such as shall (in the manner
there expressed) openly oppose any
thing contained in the <hi>Nine and-thirty
Articles,</hi> in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Common Prayer</hi>
and of <hi>Ordinations</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi>
&amp;c. Which <hi>Excommunication</hi> is there
declared to remain in force, till <hi>the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
repent</hi> (not of his boldness and
disrespect, but) of <hi>his Wicked Errour,</hi>
which he ought to revoke.</p>
               <p>174. After he has considered this,
he may please to reflect on his Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Irenicum</hi> (not to mention his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
during the late Rebellion:) and
so comparing together the said Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
ratifyed with an Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and his own Book, let him ask
his conscience whether he has not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
this Excommunication, of the
Legality and Validity whereof, he,
being now supposed a declared <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
cannot, nor ought to doubt (though
J humbly conceive, J may.) Now his
fault, in case he be guilty having been
publick and notorious, and no <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
no <hi>retractation</hi> appearing (unless
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49053:100"/>
perhaps he thinks that the accepting a
thousand pounds yearly in <hi>Preferments</hi>
is vertually a <hi>Retractation</hi>) and much
less any <hi>Solemn Absolution</hi> having been
given him (unless perhaps also he thinks
that the <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> reaches to
<hi>Heaven,</hi> discharging the conscience,
and dispensing <hi>in foro interno</hi> from an
obligation of demanding <hi>Absolution</hi>
either from <hi>Bishops,</hi> or from the <hi>Civill
Magistrat,</hi> who, according to his <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi>
has received the <hi>Power of the Keyes,</hi>
and can <hi>Excommunicate</hi> and <hi>Absolve</hi> as
well as any <hi>Bishop:</hi>) matters, J say,
standing thus, J must needs tell him that
all <hi>Prelaticall Protestants</hi> can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
look upon him, but as one (J doe
not say, <hi>traditum Satanae,</hi> but) <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated</hi>
and separated from <hi>Christs Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Body.</hi> And therefore J coniure him
that he would take care of his <hi>Soule,</hi>
which must needs be in great danger,
even though in his heart he believes
such <hi>Excommunications</hi> to be <hi>bruta fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
For in that case also he will conclude
himself at least guilty of <hi>most damnable
Hypocrisy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>175. It will now be seasonable, with
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49053:100"/>
this <hi>Act of Charity,</hi> to him, to take my
leave of him, and putt a period to this
my <hi>Answer,</hi> which truly I think suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
though perhaps he will impute
my telling him so, to an ungrounded
confidence or presumption.</p>
               <p>176. I have onely one thing more
to say to him, which is this, that I
with reason enough may accuse him
that in writing his <hi>Book</hi> he has prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with his <hi>Superiours.</hi> For whereas
in his <hi>Preface</hi> he tells his Readers that
<hi>He was by command publickly engaged in
the Defence of so excellent a cause as that
of the Church of England against the
Church of Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Preface pag. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>even of that Church of
England,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 22.</note> which, vpon the greatest enquiry
he could make, he esteems the best Church
of the Christian world;</hi> I desire no other
<hi>Iudges</hi> but the <hi>Prelats</hi> of his own <hi>Church</hi>
whether by examining his <hi>Principles</hi> J
have not demonstrated how that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Command</hi> and his <hi>publick enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement,</hi>
he has been so far from <hi>defending</hi>
her, that he has <hi>betrayed</hi> the <hi>cause of</hi> his
<hi>Church</hi> to all the <hi>Fanatick Sects</hi> which
have separated from her, and with most
horrible cruelty sought <hi>her</hi> destruction,
and with her the ruine of <hi>Monarchy:</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:49053:101"/>
Whereby he has left her in a most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
condition, tottring upon founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and <hi>Principles,</hi> which to my cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
knowledge were not extant at least
not known in <hi>England</hi> thirty years
since: In so much as if those who <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
him to <hi>defend</hi> her, will still
avow him her <hi>Champion,</hi> there will not
be, nor ever was, a <hi>Prelaticall</hi> Church
so miserably devested of all <hi>Authority.</hi>
And therefore let any indifferent <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
judge between us two, <hi>Whether with
better Success He has defended the cause of
the Church of England against the Church
of Rome, or I, the cause of his own Church
against himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>177. To conclude, nothing can be
more irrationall then for the <hi>Doctour,</hi>
holding to his <hi>Principles,</hi> to profess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a <hi>Controvertist,</hi> till he can demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
that he has the <hi>Gift of seeing into mens
hearts.</hi> For since he <hi>allowes all Sober En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

to be for themselues Iudges of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of Scripture in necessaries, and Iudges like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
what Points are necessary,</hi> till he can
disprove the allegations of any Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
<hi>Catholick, Protestant</hi> or <hi>Fanatick,</hi>
by demonstrating that they have either
<hi>not enquired</hi> at all, or <hi>enquired unsoberly,</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:49053:101"/>
and that none besides himself <hi>enquires
Soberly,</hi> it will be most unreasonable in
him to condemn, or but trouble any
<hi>Dissenters</hi> from him.</p>
               <p>178. But alas, the misery is, None
are more eager in usurping a <hi>Magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi>
and <hi>Tyrannicall Power</hi> over other
mens consciences, then such as renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
all <hi>Authority internally obliging</hi> in the
<hi>Church:</hi> Because having no tye upon
mens consciences, or security in their
Subiects <hi>Obedience,</hi> they find <hi>externall
violence</hi> the only <hi>Mean</hi> to support them.
Which surely argues a horrible <hi>depr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <head>A Post-script to the Doctor.</head>
            <p>IF this short <hi>Treatise</hi> shall after more
then half a years strugling haue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to break through all hazards, and
arriue safe to the <hi>Doctors</hi> hands, the
<hi>Authour</hi> of it will presume, in concluding
it, to offer to him a few <hi>Requests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, That, unless he do indeed
think himself obliged in conscience, by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all Rules of Piety and humanity, to do
all manner of despight to his <hi>Catholick fellow-Subiects,</hi>
he would, hereafter at least, please
to abstain from reviling and blaspheming
<hi>Gods Saints,</hi> or traducing the most <hi>Divine
exercises of contemplative</hi> soules, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
practised only in <hi>Heauen.</hi> Jt argued
certainly a heart brimm full of the <hi>Gall of
bitternes,</hi> that to oppose only one single line
of his <hi>Adversary</hi> (pag. 31.) in which all that
he sayes is, the mentioning <hi>new Sects and
Fanaticisms,</hi> he could allow one hundred
and twenty Pages in a senceless and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
recrimination: not considering, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perhaps too much considering and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that such a recrimination should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49053:105"/>
with great disparagement on the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Protestant Church,</hi> In whose <hi>Calendar</hi>
severall of those <hi>Saints</hi> to this day possess a
place. Truly in all reason his <hi>Attempt</hi> by his
<hi>Socinian Principles</hi> of depriving the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>
of that <hi>Church</hi> of all <hi>Anthority,</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by her <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> ought
to haue suffised him, without traducing
her as a <hi>Canonizer of Fanaticks.</hi> What excuse
he can make for this I cannot imagine,
unless perhaps his tenderly scrupulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
dictates to him that the <hi>Scottish Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
requires all this and more from the
obligation whereof the <hi>Bishops</hi> cannot it
seems and his <hi>Brethren Presbiters</hi> will not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
him. If so, his zeale methinks should
incite him yet further, and particularly to
make use of the power and high esteem he
has by his late <hi>Book</hi> gotten in his <hi>Vniversity
of Cambridge,</hi> to become a <hi>Godfather</hi> in reba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing
and giving a <hi>New Name</hi> to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and famous <hi>Colledge</hi> there, which at
present has <hi>two Names</hi> both of them extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely
inconvenient and prejudiciall to the
<hi>Design</hi> of his beloued <hi>Book</hi> being called not
only <hi>S. Benets,</hi> but likewise <hi>Corpus Christi-Colledge:</hi>
For as long as these names conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
neither will <hi>S. Benedict</hi> pass there for
a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> nor the <hi>Reall presence</hi> be esteemed
aground of a <hi>worse then Pagan Idolatry.</hi> But
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49053:105"/>
I believe he will scarce be able, with all his
<hi>Rhetorick,</hi> to obtain from them such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
or even perswade his own <hi>Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
to renounce <hi>Heaven,</hi> except <hi>S. Gregory S.
Benedict, S. Francis,</hi> &amp;c. be excluded thence.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second Request</hi> is, that since, to his great
credit, order has been taken by his friends,
more solicitous for him then their own
<hi>Church,</hi> to render his <hi>Book unanswerable,</hi>
he would hasten his zealous Huguenot Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the <hi>Savoy</hi> (iust such <hi>Defenders</hi> of
the <hi>Church of England</hi> as himself) to enlarge
his conquests through France also by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
abroad their <hi>French Translation</hi> of his
formidable Book, <hi>the Rationall Account.</hi> There
will be no need to fear any <hi>officious Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi>
nor the least obstruction to their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persing
their ware in <hi>France,</hi> for there <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
are so confidently secure of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
<hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> that <hi>the
King</hi> himself not only permits, but invites,
yea and expressly commands the subtillest
of the <hi>Huguenot Ministers</hi> to write and
publish freely whatsoever they are able to
say in defence of themselves, or against
<hi>Catholick Doctrines.</hi> Now it is manifest
that the <hi>Doctours friends,</hi> the zealous <hi>Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and murderers</hi> of all <hi>Answers</hi> to his
<hi>Book</hi> do not believe that he has any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49053:106"/>
at all either in the truth or hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
of his <hi>cause.</hi> And iust reason they
have: since it is a <hi>cause</hi> evidently destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
both to the <hi>English Church</hi> and <hi>state,</hi> as
hath been demonstrated. And if themselves
had any regard at all either to their <hi>Church</hi>
or the <hi>Civill state</hi> and peace of the <hi>kingdom</hi>
(all betrayed by him) they would see and
acknowledge that their vigilance would
have been much better employed in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the birth of so deformed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
a monster.</p>
            <p>My <hi>third Request</hi> is indeed, J fear, too
reasonable to expect it should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by an <hi>Adversary</hi> of the <hi>Doctors</hi> temper.
It is this. His design beeing to deterr all
<hi>English-men</hi> from <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church</hi> from a consideration of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practises</hi> in it, he is
requested, that hereafter he would not
abuse the world by fathering on the
<hi>Church</hi> Exotick opinions of particular <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and by representing the <hi>Churches
Doctrines</hi> lamely, falsely and dishonestly.
His enormous faultiness in this regard (in
mitation of <hi>Doctor Taylor</hi>) committed in
his last <hi>Book</hi> through every one of the
<hi>Points</hi> mentioned by him, may be visible
to all heedfull <hi>Readers,</hi> and irrefragable
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49053:106"/>
               <hi>Proofes</hi> here<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fare in a readiness to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
if his busy friends the <hi>Searchers</hi> could
be perswaded to rest in their beds in the
night time. He cannot complain of any
difficulty to find out all necessary <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
in which <hi>Catholicks</hi> universally agree
(as we may for <hi>Proteflant Doctrines.</hi>) The
<hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> alone will sufficiently
furnish him. Or if he think fitt to have
recourse to the interpretations of its <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions,</hi>
in all reason and conscience he ought
to content himself with such as seem to him
most moderate and rationall; <hi>Christian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
and <hi>love of Peace</hi> requiring this from
him. But I fear his <hi>unconformity</hi> hereto
must be pardoned. For his principall <hi>voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
now being to be a <hi>Controvertist,</hi> to
which, it seems, he is by <hi>Superiours</hi> enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and to which employment <hi>Preaching,
Sacraments,</hi> and all must yield: it will be
impossible for him to write volumes of
<hi>Controversy</hi> his way, if he be confined to
matters only which are pertinent, or to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which are <hi>Logically</hi> concluding.
For how could he then delight <hi>profanc
Readers</hi> with ridiculous <hi>stories,</hi> or give
scope to his own more <hi>profane Fancy</hi> in
descanting irreligiously on the actions of
<hi>Saints,</hi> or fill up many sheets with nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49053:107"/>
occurrents raked out of dunghills, and
charging them on the <hi>Church,</hi> which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrs
them more then himself. How could
he, I say, thus play the <hi>Controvertist,</hi> if he
were to assault the <hi>Church</hi> only in her <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> exhibited
in her <hi>Councills?</hi> I must therefore, I fear,
prepare my self with patience to receive a
<hi>Refusall</hi> to <hi>Requests,</hi> though in my opinion
very reasonable, and which I here sett
down, because J believe they will be
esteemed such by ingenuous and judicious
<hi>Readers,</hi> who surely will not judge the
cause of <hi>Catholicks</hi> prejudiced by the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
confutation of <hi>a Church</hi> no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<hi>in rerum naturâ,</hi> except in his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
<hi>Fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, he is desired to consider that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God</hi> commands us <hi>to loue Peace and
Truth</hi> (Zach. 8. 19.) both these: For <hi>Peace</hi>
alone, without <hi>Truth,</hi> is a conspiracy in
<hi>Errour:</hi> and an imprudent zeale for <hi>Truth</hi>
may be more pernicious then <hi>Errour.</hi> Both
these therefore ought to be loved together.
And to <hi>Hate</hi> both <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> seems a
depravation scarce consistent with <hi>Human
nature,</hi> or any <hi>Rationall Agent</hi> besides the
<hi>Devill</hi> himself. Since therefore the <hi>Doctor</hi>
by demolishing all <hi>Tribunalls in Gods Church</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:49053:107"/>
which might peaceably end <hi>Controversies,</hi>
has endeavoured, as much as in him lyes,
to banish <hi>Peace</hi> eternally from among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:</hi>
it is iustly to be expected from him,
that, being now become by Profession a
<hi>Controvertist,</hi> he should give some better
testimony to the world, that he is at least a
<hi>Seeker</hi> and <hi>Promoter</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and that his
<hi>Design</hi> in writing, Preaching, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
is to conquer the iudgments of
<hi>Dissenters</hi> to a belief of that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
pretends to be <hi>Truth.</hi> But can any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
man imagine that he had so much
as a desire to convert <hi>Catholicks</hi> (who alone
seem to be esteemed by him <hi>Dissenters</hi>) by
such a <hi>Book</hi> as his last is, which they cannot
read without trembling at the blasphemies
of it, and without a horrible aversion from
one who would make their <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>Faith</hi> odious for <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practises</hi>
which the said <hi>Church</hi> is so far from owning
that she condemns them; and would more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
persuade them to forsake an esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Communion, without being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
whither to betake themselves? These
proceedings are so unreasonnable, that it
seems manifest he had not so much as a
thought of convincing their iudgments: so
that he will have small reason to wonder
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49053:108"/>
that not one single person can be found,
whom he looks on as an enemy, who has
given him occasion to erect a <hi>Trophey:</hi> yea
moreover, though perhaps he will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, that a considerable number have,
against his will, had their eyes opened by
him, to see the desperate state of that cause,
which seems to seek its last refuge in the
Protection of <hi>such an Advocat.</hi> A strange
fate certainly this is of a <hi>Book</hi> so boasted of,
and to which such conquests have been
promised. Therefore any sober <hi>Reader</hi> who
shall heedfully reflect on the <hi>Doctor's</hi> abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
will hardly be perswaded to believe
that he intended his last should be a <hi>Book</hi> of
<hi>Controversy,</hi> but rather an <hi>Engin</hi> raised by
him, to work, during the space of a few
months, some considerable mischief against
the persons of innocent <hi>Catholicks,</hi> at a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as he thought, proper for his purpose,
when he conceived thereby the whole
Kingdom might happily be incensed against
them: Which holy design if he could effect,
it would afterward be indifferent to him
whether his <hi>Book</hi> were confuted, or not.
However, our hope is, that <hi>Dominus iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabit
pauperes populi, &amp; bumiliabit Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatorem.</hi>
