            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I know Madam, that this Play in it self is not at all calculated to the humour of the present times, the Subject being too grave, and the Lines too modest; nor is it (to speak Modishly) showish enough. Yet what makes it unfit for others, adapts it the more for your view, whose Vertues are so great, and whose Judgment so clear, that as the first sway you against the present humour which delights the World, so the last defends you from being carried away only with vanity and show.</p>
            <p>And the assurance I have of this, gives me the confidence to add, That the contrivance (though it be but one single Plot) is so neat and curious, and the contest between Love and Nature main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained every where to that height, that I cannot doubt but you will find some Divertisement in it, so far as Monsieur <hi>Quinault,</hi> whose it was in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, had a part in it: and as for the English it speaks, I must wholly leave to your Ladyships Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: with the same submission that I subscribe my self</p>

                     <l>The Princess did his sight with scorn reject;</l>
                     <l>And having met me here, he do's suspect</l>

                     <l>That I shall die, if ere I se here more.</l>
                     <l>Thy Brothers blood cannot suffice his rage,</l>
                     <l>But to his blooming youth he'll add my age.</l>

                     <l>You in my heart do bear the highest sway,</l>

                     <l>Something allays the trouble of my mind:</l>
                     <l>Though I all service have refus'd from you,</l>

Not for my dangers it may disengage;</l>
                     <l>I neither fear the Tyrant's love nor rage:</l>
                     <l>But all herein that precious seems or good,</l>

                     <l>Since in my heart your love did get this sway,</l>

                     <l>The worst of Chances cannot then deter,</l>
                     <l>Whilst to your pleasure I my life prefer:</l>

                     <l>Your unjust Rival I with you condemn;</l>
                     <l>'Tis fit that flame should fatal prove to him:</l>

When what we love craves to be understood,</l>

                     <l>Even all those Gods themselves would Bugbears be,</l>

                     <l>Not to be so, was to be Father here;</l>

                     <l>Of grief and anguish do's my sences shroud:</l>
                     <l>A secret voice within my breast I find,</l>

                     <l>My heart at once raging and calm appears,</l>
                     <l>And all my thoughts are become Mutineers.</l>
                     <l>When first 'twas told me that the King did love,</l>
                     <l>Hate and disdain in every vein did move;</l>

                     <l>Suppress'd my rage, and did withhold my arm:</l>
                     <l>That very object did my hate controul,</l>
                     <l>And all my rage flew trembling from my soul.</l>
                     <l>My heart respected in that Tyrants face</l>
                     <l>Those features did my lov'd <hi>Agrippa</hi> grace:</l>
                     <l>A Fathers grief had surely else prevail'd,</l>

                     <l>Madam, I all this trouble did foresee;</l>
                     <l>Therefore no sooner gain'd I liberty,</l>
                     <l>But fearless of the Tyrants threats, I came</l>

                     <l>Who sees what sorrow on my soul has don,</l>

                     <l>Could not from the discovery refrain.</l>
                     <l>For blood, like love, will those transports obey,</l>

                     <l>Their brests with hate and emnity inspire,</l>

                     <l>Your self can tell what ways I did invent</l>
                     <l>To gain the heart of every discontent;</l>

                     <l>Fondly sermise that he is still my Son,</l>
