            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and inſected with ſtench and faetor in the Grave, perfumes the World with the Odours of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleaſing remembrances fit as well for the delight, as uſe of the Living.</p>
            <p>That the worthy Sr. <hi>Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey</hi> left ſuch a Name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, needs not the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this Narrative; there is no place where ever he had a mention, but is ſcented with it.</p>

            <p>His Father (by ſeveral Wives) had a Numerous Iſſue, no leſs than Ten Sons, Our Sir <hi>Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> being the Sixth by a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Venter: yet though the Father himſelf was but a youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Brother,</hi> the <hi>Grandfather</hi> left ſo plentiful an Eſtate to him as ſerved to afford ſufficient allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to his Children; None of them but with what was left them, beſides the laudable improvements they made to it by Trade and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, lived plentifully and in good repute.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi> had in his youth beſtowed upon him an Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuitable to his Birth and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, being firſt put to <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> School (that Prime Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Pae dagogie of Tyronick

Learning,) where in a little time by the ſtrength of his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Parts he arrived to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency as to be ſent to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in order to his maturati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Studies of an higher Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Having continued there for ſome time a diligent and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Student in thoſe parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which afterwards qualified him for great and worthy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; he was afterwards ſent over to Travel in Foreign parts, to advance the Theorie of his ſpeculative acquirements by Obſervation of <hi>Men</hi> and Manners, and became thereby the better qualified to diſcharge himſelf in thoſe publick Places to which he was afterwards called.</p>
            <p>During the time of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, he kept himſelf (by the aids of the Divine Grace) as well free from the contagion of the <hi>Immoralities</hi> as the (equally dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous)

            <p>For by thoſe ſound Principles of Religion and Vertue which he had imbibed by the means of his careful Parents and Inſtructors, he was ſufficiently antidoted againſt both; returning home ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther informed than corrupted; like the laborious Bee extracting the Hony of uſeful Experience and Obſervations from the worſt of things.</p>

            <p>But the reaſon of his ſo ſoon leaving the Societie was a ſenſe he had in himſelf of a defect in his Hearing, or a kind of Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which (though not very great) was alwayes Natural to him, and was judged by himſelf and Friends might be an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to him in the nice and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult practice of Pleading, where the circumſtances of debated Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

            <p>Amongſt whom he diverted himſelf for ſome time: but his generous Soul being too active to be confined to the retirement of a private Solitude and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, could not long reſt in this inert and uſeleſs Capacity, but put him upon ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, wherein he might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the activity of his induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit for the good of himſelf and others; <hi>Idleneſs</hi> being alwayes a burthen to him to whom <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> never was ſo; the fatigues

            <p>And Providence was ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious to him in theſe generous deſignments, as in a ſhort time to offer him a fair occaſion of putting them in Execution, by means of an intimate Friend and Relation of his, who had loſt a great part of his Eſtate by reaſon of his Services for the King in the late Wars; and having reduced the reſt into Stock, reſolved to improve the ſame in way of Trade by taking a Wood-yard, and Buying and Selling Wood

            <p>Sir <hi>Edmonbury Godfrey</hi> being a younger Brother, and what Eſtate he had, conſiſting in Moneys to the value of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, was adviſed (as a fair way of improvement) to join Stocks with the aforeſaid Gentleman, and to come in a Partner with him, in managing the Trade of a Wood-wharf, which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did; ſetling themſelves firſt at <hi>Dowgate,</hi> within the City of <hi>London;</hi> where in a few Years that they continued Trading to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it pleaſed God ſo to bleſs their honeſt induſtry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, that they advanced their Stocks to a very conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe &amp; advantage; ſo indulgent is

Providence commonly to the honeſt endeavours of induſtrious Perſons, that the more laborious they are in the Employments they are called to, the more they thrive and are bleſſed in them.</p>
            <p>How may the Example of theſe two Trading Gentlemen, reproach the unthrifty humours of too many of the Gentry of theſe Dayes, who ſtudy no other Arts but that of ſpending, and waſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to conſume the Patrimonies, that their careful Fathers had gathered for them, in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive Modes of Luxury and Riot? and while they ſcornfully diſdain thoſe laudable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and means of Thrift by which they might be <note n="*" place="margin">Quis eſt iſtorum qui non malit Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. turba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri quam co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ſuam, qui non ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitior ſit de capitis ſui decore quam de ſalute, qui non compti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or eſſe malit quam hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtior? <hi>Senec.</hi> de Provid.

            <p>Having thus by their joint Trading (as I have ſaid) acquir'd conſiderable advantages to their particular Eſtates, in a few Years that they dealt together; It after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards happened that Mr. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s Partner, altered his Condition by Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a near Relation of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondbury</hi>'s; the other continuing ſtill, and to the Day of his Death in the ſtate of Coelibacy: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were upon this account, the Family being too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged for their commodious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation; or that their Stocks being likewiſe ſo much inlarged, there might be a neceſſity (as was the caſe once between <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Lot)</hi> of a Separation, I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108904:12"/>
know not; but theſe two Partners having firſt fairly and juſtly ſtated the Accounts betwixt each other, agreed upon a parting: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi> (reſolving ſtill to follow the ſame Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) having found out a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Houſe and Yard fit for his purpoſe at the other end of the Town, at <hi>Hartshorn-Lane,</hi> near <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> removed thither; And having furniſhed his Yard with a good Stock of Wares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan now to Trade for himſelf: And found the ſame Providence that had hitherto been propitious to him, to ſucceed his induſtry and endeavours in this his new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, with a ſuitable Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The Arts he uſed as means (ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Divine Providence) of his Thriving in the World, were no other than thoſe of an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous induſtry and unreproveable Integrity, the two beſt and moſt ſolid Baſes of a proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108904:12"/>
He being in his private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as ſtrict an Obſerver of the Rules of Commutative Juſtice, as he was afterwards of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive, when called to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of a more publick Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>And it was not long that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this private way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Trading; but that the great Abilities both of Eſtate and Parts of one ſo near reſiding to the Court being repreſented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty (who as of his piercing Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he is moſt able to judge of; ſo of his Native Clemency and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is moſt ready to prefer ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to Places of Truſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, wherein they may become ſerviceable to himſelf and People) It pleaſed his Majeſty to admit him into the Commiſſion of the Peace, as one of his Juſtices for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and City of <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> in which

Place he faithfully ſerved him, till ſuch time, as for the laſt Services wherein he performed the greateſt act of Loyalty to his Prince and Countrey, that lay in the power of a Subject to do, he was by the malice of his, and our impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies, the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> taken from us.</p>
            <p>We are now therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him in his more publick Capacity as a Juſtice of the Peace, in which place as he ſpent many and the laſt Years of his Life, we may remark more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly thoſe Graces and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which alwayes did illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his moſt imitable Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>

            <p>And was ſo well ſatisfied in his choice of him, that in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his approvement, He [that ought to know beſt (ſayes the Learned Doctor in his <hi>Threnodia)</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edm.

            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:108904:14"/>
What greater Teſtimonies, than theſe of ſo judicious a Prince, and ſo Learned a Prelate, could be expected or deſired to Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Merits of a worthy and deſerving Magiſtrate?</p>
            <p>But if we may Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Royal Theme, it will be worth our while to conſider thoſe Excellencies apart which rendred him capable of ſo great a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. And here we may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly take the opportunity to give you in brief the Character of this Excellent Perſon, both as to his Natural and Moral Indowments; by which it may be eaſily judged, how well qualified he was as well for the Honour as Truſt of that Eminent Place in which he ſerved.</p>
            <p>As to his Perſon, the Graver hath furniſhed you in the Frontiſpiece with a Copy (not much diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108904:14"/>
to the Life) of his come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and graceful Countenance; in which, as if Nature had caſt him into a Mould fit for the purpoſe of his future Office, we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a duly compoſed Feature equally mixt with gravity and ſweetneſs, a becoming mien that carried as well Authority as ingenuity in it, and commanded at once both awe and love from the beholders.</p>
            <p>The gracefulneſs of a Mans preſence (in the Fancies of ſome) adds much of reſpect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Perſons, eſpecially where their Characters require it or deſerve it. And therefore <hi>Howell</hi> treating of the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Embaſſadors, gives this for one: <hi>That being to repreſent</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Howels</hi> Treatiſe of Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors.</note> 
               <hi>the Perſon of his Prince, he ought to be a comely and graceful Perſon.</hi> And ſuch an one was Sir <hi>Edmondbury;</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:108904:15"/>
his Stature was elevated ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above the common Size of ordinary tall Men: the habit of his Body ſpare, far from Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie; but well ſet and exactly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned. He was indeed (as moſt tall Men are) ſomewhat inclined to ſtoop in his going, which might be occaſioned by the Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his muſing Head, moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly working upon ſome good and generous Deſigns in the way of his Buſineſs. His diſpoſition and humour were ſuch as obliged love and reſpects from all that knew him, being Naturally of a kind, courteous, and affable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, free of acceſs, and ready to hear the meaneſt Perſons, that in way of complaint, or buſineſs, had any thing to do with him; and this accompanied with a facete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pleaſancie of humour, that was no leſs Natural him, rendred his Converſation lovely
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108904:15"/>
and delightful to all Perſons.</p>
            <p>If it may not ſeem imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, I will give you one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for all of the Urbanity of his temper. That he being one Night attending at the Council Table at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> till it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what late, and being then to go to the <hi>Temple</hi> upon Buſineſs, called a Coach at the Court Gates; and perceiving a Gentleman ſtanding there, whom he had obſerved likewiſe attending upon Buſineſs at the Board, was pleaſed cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly to enquire of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his way lay towards the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> underſtanding which, he was pleaſed, though a Stranger, to take him into the Coach with him, and gave him his paſſage thither.</p>
            <p>Civility and Courteſie were the Flowers and Ornaments of that excellent temper; the ground
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108904:16"/>
of which conſiſted of an exact Juſtice and Compleat Charity; both theſe were Eminent in this Worthy: None more punctual and exact as to the Commutative parts of Juſtice than he; in his dealings, in the keeping of his Accounts, in performance of his promiſes, rendring to every Man his right, and diſcreetly looking to his own. And for his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he was Naturally indued with a large and bountiful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo the expreſſions of it were Viſible in ſuch circumſtances and inſtances, as may perhaps be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd by few Men of this Age, if we reſpect either the Charity of his Mind, or the Charity of his Hands.</p>
            <p>And as to the Firſt, how free was he from a cenſorious Spirit; the unhappy temper of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this Age; and no doubt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108904:16"/>
the main ground of our preſent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences both in Church and State? when Men not content to enjoy the ſatisfaction and liberty of their own perſwaſions, do injuriouſly cenſure and perhaps maliciouſly deſpight thoſe that are of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: But this Good Man was none of that Leaven; he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a Sound and Orthodox perſwaſion and principles; yet cenſured none that differed from him in leſſer Circumſtances not material to the Eſſence and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Religion; but honoured many ſuch for the Characters of a ſolid goodneſs appearing in them from whom he differed in his own private Judgment and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: though he was moſt ſtrict in reproving and puniſhing groſſer Enormities; yet he could chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably bear with the leſſer infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of ſuch in whom a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling Vertue did more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108904:17"/>
prevail. In fine, though he had a ſevere regard to himſelf, and his own actions; yet he could bear with others for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er miſcarriages than he allowed in himſelf: though he alwayes frown'd upon the frontleſs Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; yet (ſuch was his candour) that he would rarely put a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Tranſgreſſor to the Bluſh.</p>
            <p>As to the Charity of his Hands, it muſt be a labour (though a delightful one) to any that ſhould go about to enumerate thoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Love, thoſe Offices of a true Chriſtian Charity in which he abounded.</p>
            <p>It may now be lawful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the World, that which in his Life he moſt laboured to conceal; for indeed his Charity was ſo truly Chriſtian and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick, that in the expreſſions of it,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108904:17"/>
his left Hand was a Stranger to what his right Hand did: few have more merited applauſe in this kind than himſelf, none ſought it leſs; being co<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ted to have done his duty, expecting his reward from his Heavenly Father, and leaving the fame of it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent notice of a poſthumous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</p>
            <p>It is now known which durſt not before be mentioned, how kind he was to a Religious, but ſuffering Family in the City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> allowing them Ten Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> towards their ſupport, and this Annuity he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to them for ſeveral Years together.</p>
            <p>But this was but one Family of many that were in the like nature, though in different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, relieved by him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:108904:18"/>
Although he was ever ſevere againſt idle Beggers and Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, ſuch as refuſing the honeſt wayes of Induſtry and Labour to maintain themſelves, lived altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Alms of others; yet he was ſo much a friend to thoſe that were neceſſitatedly poor, and whoſe poverty was neither occaſioned by ill Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, nor continued by idleneſs, that ſuch ſhould never want his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but he would either ſet them on Work, or otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them by ſome charitable donation.</p>
            <p>Although, as I have ſaid, it was the Chriſtianity of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to do his Alms in ſecret, there are many Hundreds of living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that are able to give in their Teſtimonials to this part of his Character, that he was a truly charitable Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:108904:18"/>
And as he arrived to this grade of the <hi>beatifying Scale</hi> of being <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 9.</note> ſo he declared himſelf to be a true <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Child of God by aſcending another; he was a Peace-maker, one that coveted not ſo much the Triumph of the Lawrel as the ſhadow of the Olive-bough: Moderation and Peace were the proper Elements of his Nature. If he obſerved any differences to ariſe betwixt any of his Friends or Neighbours, how induſtrious would he be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them! nor would he reſt, whatever pains he was expoſed to, till he had accompliſhed his ends.</p>
            <p>The reputation of his Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making humour occaſioned him much trouble by ſuch as deſired the benefit of it, by putting him frequently upon Arbitrations and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108904:19"/>
compoſing of differences: which province as by reaſon of his great judgment and experience, he was very capable to manage; ſo he rarely declined it, though it were a great hindrance both to his Publick and Private Buſineſs; it is well known by the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood amongſt whom he lived, how much of his time and pains were laid out in ſuch friendly Services.</p>
            <p>Thus was he as a Man: take him as a Chriſtian, and a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Man; and I cannot give you his Character more truly and fully than is mentioned by the aforeſaid <hi>Learned Prelate</hi> in his Funeral Sermon: one who as by reaſon of his intimacy with him, he had the greateſt opportunity; ſo by his faculty was moſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge of him in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.

And yet he was conſtant in all the Acts of Gods worſhip, as well out of Judgment as Affection. And though the compaſſion that he had for all Men that did amiſs, extended it ſelf to all manner of Diſſenters, and amongſt them he had a kindneſs for the Perſons of many <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks: yet he alwayes declared a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hatred and deteſtation of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi> I ſay this on purpoſe to be remembred (becauſe ſome would have him a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined

            <p>A right and ſound Integrity of Mind, the golden Vein that ran through the whole body of his Actions, and all the parts of it, not to be corrupted by gifts, bribes, or penſions (the common taint of Juſtice) nor to be warp'd or byas'd by any ſiniſter Intereſts, but plain and upright, unintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and regularly conformable to the exacteſt rules of Juſtice and Honeſty, in all the particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of his Province, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well known, as to any partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his actings, to be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector of Perſons.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108904:23"/>
been given in our days.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall in the firſt place give you one Inſtance which (with due Allowance to the unuſualneſs of the Practice) may give ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof of the greatneſs of his Mind, in daring to be juſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (Juſtice as well as Charity beginning at home,) in a caſe wherein a Sneaking Softneſs or Complyance might have betray'd him to the ruining advantages of a Sconc'd and Inſulting Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Having a conſiderable Debt owing to him from a Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at Court, to whom he had made many and often applications for the Payment of it, without any other ſatisfaction than that of fair promiſes, from time to time, and nothing performed: Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-Bury</hi> well knowing the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Perſon, and that his pretences were but ſo many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal delays to deferr the Payment
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108904:23"/>
of that which (though juſtly due) he knew (by reaſon of his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) he could not in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe of Juſtice be troubled for, reſolved however to ſue him at Common-Law, (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſaid Priviledge) and rather to caſt himſelf upon His Majeſties Clemency, for infringing the Priviledge of his Houſhold, than to ſuffer himſelf to be unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of his due Debt, by one that would make ſuch a Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>Aſylum</hi> to that Injuſtice, which he knew His Majeſty would never patronize or allow of.</p>
            <p>Accordingly after all other fair ways, unſucceſsfully attempted; he got the ſaid Courtier Arreſted by vertue of the Kings Writt, and a Warrant thereupon granted by the Sheriff: and the Defendant was thereupon taken into Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, till ſuch time as he ſhould give in ſufficient Bail to anſwer
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108904:24"/>
the Action, inſtead of which the Defendant inſiſting upon his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge: ſent to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and got an Order for the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury,</hi> for breach of Priviledge, upon which he was taken into Cuſtody, and ſo remained for the ſpace of ſix days a Priſoner, and was ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till ſuch time as he ſhould diſcharge the other of the Arreſt, which Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury</hi> would not conſent unto, but rather ſuffered the ſeverity of that uneaſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, than to gratifie his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſtubbornneſs with a too eaſie compliance:</p>
            <p>His Majeſty being then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Circumſtances of the Caſe, was pleaſed graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to Order Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfreys</hi> diſcharge; and taking notice, in his Princely Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of that Magnanimity and Heroick diſpoſition he ſhewed, in hearing the brunt of this trouble,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108904:24"/>
was pleaſed not only to pardon the Miſdemeanour; but by this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take ſuch farther notice of him, as to conferr upon him the Honour of Knighthood: and as a more ſpecial token of his Grace and Favour, to admit him again into the Commiſſion of the Peace, out of which he had, by means of his Adverſary, been then lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrucken out.</p>
            <p>But a more noble inſtance than this to prove the fortitude of his mind, as well in daring dangers, as bearing troubles, appears in his ſtaying in Town in the time of the laſt great Sickneſs, when the two great Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were in a manner deſerted by their Inhabitants, and few left but ſuch of the poorer ſort who wanted Mony or Friends to remove themſelves farther; when the Arrows of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty were ſcattered abroad in every corner: when almoſt every
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108904:25"/>

In fine when death and danger filled all places, and turned the whole Town into one univerſal Scene of Miſery and Mortality: then it was that this worthy Magiſtrate ſhewed the greateſt proofs of a true Chriſtian Courage and Reſolution, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing to ſtay for a Publick
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108904:25"/>
Good in all the greateſt heats of this dangerous Contagion. The famous <hi>Roman, Curtius,</hi> is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in Hiſtory for his unexem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Courage, in that for the love of his Country, and to evert a great Judgment then upon them, he fearleſly rode headlong into a vaſt devouring Gulph, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo the Sacrifice of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. The action was full of Gallantry and Bravery, ſuitable to the Heroick temper of a true <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Spirit: but Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury,</hi> from a better Principle, of a truly Chriſtian Zeal, at leaſt equalliz'd his Courage in this great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; wherein death in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeveral appearances, ſeemed ready to devour him, if his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telar Angel (conſigned by the Divine Providence) had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd him to greater purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>It was no unadviſed forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or injudicious temerity that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108904:26"/>
put him upon an exploit ſo hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous as this was to his life and ſafety, neither any deſigns of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it, but a Juſt and Conſcientious regard to his Duty in that place wherein he knew he might (in the abſence of thoſe his fellow Magiſtrates that were fled from the danger) be inſtrumental as well to preſerve the Lives, as Properties, of ſuch as ſhould be expoſed both to the danger of the Contagion, and the Rapine of ſome ill minded people, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently take the advantage of ſuch Publick Calamities to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves with the ſpoils of the miſerable Deceaſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the only ends he had of his ſtaying in Town, for a <hi>Publick Good,</hi> and was therefore eſteemed by the Inhabitants of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as their Guardian Genius; as the <hi>Aſylum</hi> and Sanctuary of their diſtreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>

            <p>His Juſtice was no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable then his Charity, when there was any need of it, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times there was, to right the Dead, as well as to relieve the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a notable inſtance whereof, we ſhall give you in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Narration.</p>
            <p>A Profligate Wretch that had taken up a new way of Thieving, (yet 'tis ſaid too much Practiſed in thoſe times) of Robbing the Dead, notwithſtanding the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror that is naturally concomitant
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108904:27"/>
to ſuch Actions, had in the dead time of the Night uſed to Invade the Cemeteries and Church-yards that were now more Peopled then the places they belong'd to; and there breaking up the mournful Clods, would Sacrilegiouſly ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack the Graves, and pillage them with as much freedom, as Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do the bodies of their vanquiſht Enemies in the Fields of War, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from them their Dying Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, the Sheets and other Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen in which they were Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and decently covered, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Poor Carcaſſes inhuman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Naked.</p>
            <p>This Trade he followed ſo long till he furniſhed a Ware-houſe with the Spoils of the Dead; and had gotten into his Poſſeſſion (ſome ſay) to the number of a Thouſand Winding-ſheets: when by ſome means being at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, information of theſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Actions being given in to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108904:28"/>
Sir <hi>Edmnud-bury,</hi> he condiſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go himſelf with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables Guard, to the Place where (he was informed) the Good, were Harboured, and Seized them. In the mean while the <hi>Criminal</hi> having got notice of the deſign againſt him, was fled; and being hardned againſt the fear of Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his too much familiarity with the Dead, had taken Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary in the <hi>Peſt-houſe,</hi> where he thought himſelf ſufficiently ſecu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red againſt the Attacques of any that ſhould purſue him; for who ſhould venture upon ſo imminent a danger, as to ſeize a <hi>Malefactor</hi> in that place, where poſſibly they might run upon their own Deaths? And indeed, the <hi>Officers</hi> to whom Sir <hi>Edmund-bury</hi> had directed his Warrants to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, were too faint-hearted to do it, and declined the Service; But then the <hi>Noble Knight</hi> himſelf (as a Pattern of unpreſidented Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity)

out of his Zeal to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ventured in his own Perſon to go unto that Fatal Place (made Sacred againſt all Approaches by the danger of it,) and there with his own hands Seized and carryed off the <hi>Offendor,</hi> then delivering him into the hands of the Officers to be ſecured, in order to be at a convenient time Examined about the Fact.</p>
            <p>And upon due proofs made out to him by ſeveral Witneſſes, the Criminal being Convicted, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-Bury Godfrey</hi> in reſpect to Juſtice, and to make ſo great a <hi>Villain</hi> an Example for the future to all that ſhould be tempted to any ſuch execrable deſigns, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced this <hi>Sentence</hi> upon him, as moſt ſuitable to the nature of his <hi>Crime,</hi> That he ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the <hi>Church yard,</hi> the place where he had perpetrated his Nefandous Villanies, and there to be ſtrip'd naked to the Waſte, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108904:29"/>
by the Beadle belonging to the Pariſh, to be ſeverely ſcourged round the place; which Sentence was accordingly Executed upon him, in the preſence of a great number of Spectators, who were aſſembled out of Curioſity to ſee ſo remarkable an Execution: <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui non Mordent,</hi> it is proverbial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid; but one that durſt ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venture to ſpoil their paſſive Carkaſſes, found an active revenge inflicted on him, for ſo doing, in the very proſpect of their injured Relicks; yet neither the ſmart, nor ſhame of his puniſhment could mollifie the hardned wretch to any kind of relentings for his notorious Villanies; but rather excited in him a Spirit of Revenge againſt the Authors of it: which he eſpecially deſigned againſt the worthy Sir <hi>Edmond Bury,</hi> by whoſe Sentence it was inflicted, ſo that turning his Covetous deſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dead, into a malicious
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108904:29"/>
Revenge againſt the Living, he vowed and reſolved upon his death whenever he ſhould find an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for it:</p>
            <p>And in purſuance of ſuch his Deviliſh reſolves, being one time late at night, unhappily befrien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with an occaſion of meeting Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfrey,</hi> in the Street going homewards towards his own Houſe, the Barbarous Villain, in an inhumane manner, aſſaults him with a Cudgel that he carryed about him (perhaps for that purpoſe) and had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brained him, if Sir <hi>Edmond-Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> perceiving his deſign, had not prevented it by a timely defence, which he did by drawing out his Sword, and therewith Warding the blows that were aimed at him, yet without any offenſive violence or hurt to his Adverſary, but only to defend himſelf, which he did till ſuch time as Company coming by, and taking notice of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108904:30"/>
the Out-rage, Reſcued him from the Aſſault, and ſeized upon the <hi>Ruffian,</hi> who was thereupon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the next Seſſions of the Peace holden for <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex,</hi> at the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> and there (beſides for this) ſeveral other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments comming in againſt him for Felony, he was Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and received Sentence to dye; but by the mercy of the Court he was only Tranſported into ſome Foraign Plantation, where perſiſting ſtill in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courſes, not withſtanding theſe ſeaſonable warnings, being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of ſome Criminal Fact, that by the Laws of the Country deſerved death, he had Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death accordingly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon him, and was Hanged.</p>
            <p>During all the time of this great and dreadful <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfrey,</hi> (as we have ſaid) continued his <hi>Station:</hi> and did
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108904:30"/>
worthily, that while, ſupply the defect of thoſe that out of a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimous <hi>Phil-auty,</hi> had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Charges to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; such ſelfiſh Principles as theirs were abhorrent from his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and Publick Spirit, who durſt attend his Duty in the Face of the greateſt difficulties and dangers. And it pleaſed God (as an incouragement to others in the like diſcharge of their Duties) to reward his faithfulneſs with a ſingular Protection, preſerving him from thoſe imminent Perils, that he was (by his forwardneſs to be uſeful) continually expoſed to, that he might continue to be farther ſerviceable to his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> in better times.</p>
            <p>And many years after this it pleaſed God to continue him to us for a Publick Bleſſing: in which time, though we cannot note any great remarkables of him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> yet remarkable it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108904:31"/>
is, and worthy note, that he was ſtill the ſame; the ſame <hi>Good Uſeful man</hi> that he always was; none of the Fleeting <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> that aſpire at <hi>Names,</hi> and to be made the Diſcourſe of the <hi>World</hi> by their fluctuating and giddy Changes, he kept his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and contented himſelf with a private and retired acting in that Sphere, wherein he had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity enough of doing Good, and being Uſeful to the <hi>World,</hi> the greateſt thing that he ever aſpired to.</p>

Having been by the conſtant Fatigues and Labours of his Buſineſs, reduced to a ſicklineſs of Body, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers growing upon him, he was adviſed by the <hi>Phiſicians</hi> to go to <hi>Montpellier</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the Air of that Country being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted very Reſtorative to waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and decaying Conſtitutions; according to whoſe advice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108904:31"/>
ſetled his Affairs in <hi>England</hi> for the ſhort time of his intended ſtay, he went over thither, and took, together with, the benefit of that Salutiferous Air, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſeveral remarkable Places in that <hi>Kingdom;</hi> eſpecially of a Great Work that the <hi>French King</hi> was then undertaking, in making a <hi>Navigable River</hi> through thoſe Countries into the <hi>Levant.</hi> He continued for ſome months in that Country (in which time it having pleaſed God to reſtore him to a good meaſure of Health, (the end he went for) he returned again to bleſs his own Country, and Relations, with his much long'd-for preſence.</p>
            <p>And not long after his return it was, that the <hi>late</hi> (I fear we have too much reaſon to ſay the <hi>preſent) Helliſh and Damnable Plot</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> broke out in <hi>England.</hi> An unhappy <hi>Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:108904:32"/>
in which his laſt actings, that concluded the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of his worthy Life, expoſed him to an untimely and cruel Death, by the hands of thoſe bloudy-minded <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts;</hi> the <hi>Proto-Martyr</hi> of thoſe Innocents that were deſigned by them to a mercileſs deſtruction; but bleſſed be <hi>God,</hi> his Death, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever maliciouſly deſigned by them, occaſioned a prevention of the ill effects of their Malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others, by awakning the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and generally the whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi> by this early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Treachery to a more narrow watchfulneſs of them and their proceedings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Diſcovery of this <hi>Plot,</hi> is ſo generally known, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ſo many <hi>Narratives</hi> and <hi>Informations</hi> Publiſhed of it, that it were needleſs for us to ſay much of it, or more than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to let you know how far
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108904:32"/>
Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury</hi> was concerned about it.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Reputed the firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer of this <hi>Plot,</hi> having been beyond the Seas, and here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a long time Converſant with the Managers of it, as being Liſted one of their Party, and privy thereby to all their Deſigns and Managements, Was reſolved to make his <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of this <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> and the Intrigues of it, upon the firſt fair opportunity that offered it ſelf to him. And having got into ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> a Worthy and Learned Perſon, who had lately before Tranſlated a Book, Intituled the <hi>Jeſuits Morals,</hi> into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the ſaid Book reflecting ſo ſeverely upon that <hi>Brood of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> exaſperated them to that height, that nothing would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them but his blood (the uſual Alloy of their mercileſs Revenges) and Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> then a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108904:33"/>
of that Party muſt be the man (injoyned thereto by their <hi>Provincial Whitebread)</hi> that ſhould diſpatch him. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> could do no leſs than accept the ſervice, but (as it never was in his purpoſe) was ſo ſar from Executing what he had promiſed that after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time of acquaintance with the <hi>Doctor,</hi> he Diſcovers to him not only what they had deſigned againſt his own life, but the <hi>Plot</hi> in General, with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Eſtabliſhed in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and looking upon the <hi>Doctor</hi> (as he was) as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of approved Truſt and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, did at the ſame time Communicate to him the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Heads of this multi-form <hi>Treaſon,</hi> with the names of the <hi>Actors</hi> concerned it it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:108904:33"/>
But the buſineſs being of ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Conſequence, and Mighty Oppoſition and Difficulty ſuppoſed to be met with upon the Diſcovery of it; it was conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between them, what fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſhould pitch upon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Majeſty with it.</p>
            <p>And accordingly they agreed upon <hi>Collonel Kirby,</hi> a Perſon of known Fidelity to the <hi>King,</hi> and Zeal to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt; the <hi>Collonel</hi> chearfully undertakes the Service, and taking a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient opportunity of meeting the <hi>King</hi> walking in St. <hi>James's Park,</hi> begs his Attention, and informs him ſome heads of the <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and particularly, of the Deſigns of the <hi>Papists,</hi> to take away His Sacred Life, and that <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> beſides others, were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to Attempt it in that very place of His Receſs; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was much Surpriz'd, to hear of a Danger, (that by reaſon of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108904:34"/>
his Native Innocency and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) he needed not to have feared, but graciouſly accepting at the hands of his Loyal Subject, this ſeaſonable Notice, was pleaſed thereupon to Order him, together with Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> to wait upon <hi>Him</hi> that Evening at <hi>White-hall</hi> with the <hi>Informations,</hi> which they accordingly did; delivering to him an <hi>Information</hi> conſiſting of Forty three Articles, drawn up by Dr. <hi>Oates:</hi> the Origional of which, (this being but a Coppy) he kept in his own hands His; <hi>Majesty</hi> graciouſly received the Papers, but being to go the next Morning to <hi>Windſor,</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to order them to be left in the hands of a great <hi>Lord</hi> and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> whom His <hi>Majeſty</hi> would intruſt as well for the ſafety of them, as his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in the Affair, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were left with him, and several Attendances were ſpent
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108904:34"/>
upon his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with other Matters relating to the Concern.</p>
            <p>In the mean while Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> diſcovered himſelf to <hi>Collonel Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> who had not had all this time any acquaintance with him; and gave him in ſome further Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as namely, of the coming to Town of the <hi>Provincial White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, Bedingfield</hi> a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and others of that Gang and that they having by ſome means got intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Diſcovery, had him in Suſpition for it; And had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to prevent his Progreſs therein, by making him away: this they thought in their deviliſh Policy the likelieſt way to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their Deſigns, by firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving ſuch Perſons out of the way as ſhould be likely to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in the intended Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
            <p>This they then attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Dr. Oates,</hi> and this they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108904:35"/>
Executed upon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury,</hi> who was not ſo lucky to eſcape their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Hands, as he was. For the <hi>Doctor</hi> more than miſtruſting their Deſignes againſt him, had the good luck to avoid the brunt of their Revenge againſt him, by a timely flight; the particulars of which, he related to Dr. <hi>Tongue:</hi> and that now having thus got himſelf looſed from his Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Company, he was reſolved to caſt himſelf upon the Mercy and Protection of his <hi>Majeſty;</hi> which <hi>Reſolution</hi> of his, Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> very well approved, and till ſuch time as they could meet with a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient opportunity of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, did kindly invite him to continue with him (as a good place of Safety and Retirement to him,) at his Lodgings at <hi>Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During which time, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> wrote over fair Copies of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108904:35"/>
and upon the <hi>King's</hi> Return to <hi>White-hall,</hi> Notice was one day given to Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> and Collonel <hi>Kirby,</hi> That it was his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Pleaſure, that they two ſhould Attend him the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Councel,</hi> to be Examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that great Preſence, about the Particulars of their Informations.</p>
            <p>In Order to which, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that their ſeveral Copies ſhould be Sworn to, to render them the more Authentick when they ſhould be delivered into the <hi>Councel;</hi> And Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury,</hi> as a Perſon of known Loyalty to his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> was the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate whom they choſe to be Sworn by, and to intruſt with this great Secret.</p>
            <p>A Loyal, but unhappy piece of Service to this poor <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who having with Horror and Aſtoniſhment peruſed the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, and taken their Oaths of the truth of them (which they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108904:36"/>
Swore to before him) would needs deſire a Copy of them, to be left with him, that he might in his own Loyal and Judicious thoughts take them upon an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter view into a more ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and ſo be the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to Act in that Province he was in, if need ſhould be, for the prevention of the growing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            <p>Little dreaming (Dear Soul) at that time, that his Loyal Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein, ſhould expoſe him to that Malice of his Enemies (who too well knew the honeſty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of his mind, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at it) that ſhould be the occaſion of his Death; the ſad and doleful Narrative of which, as it was by this means occaſioned, we ſhall preſently give you:</p>
            <p>The Two Informants having thus ſworn to their Informations, went with them before the King and Councel, who afterwards ſent
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108904:36"/>
for Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and they were all Three ſeverally Examined before them, and their Services herein ſo well accepted, that to ſecure them from the Malice of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, His Majeſty (out of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive clemency and goodneſs) was graciouſly pleaſed to take Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> into his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Protection, and to order them Lodgings in his Pallace at <hi>White-hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Plotters</hi> (that had Spies in every Corner to obſerve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of their Deſigns, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of them) were now ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprized, that the ſcent was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and that we were already in purſuit of the game, before they were aware of it; They dreaded the <hi>Rumour</hi> of it more then any particular Informations; They knew that Information had been given in and Sworn to; They knew who it was that gave them their Oaths, and that he had Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108904:37"/>
of the Informations; They knew ſo Loyal a Perſon, ſo True a Proteſtant, would be more then a Speculative or idle Obſervator up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Treaſonable Subjects, they knew his Place, they knew his Parts, they knew his Power, they knew his Intereſt at Court; his free acceſs to the King, his eſteem amongſt the People, and were not ignorant how able, how ready he might be to improve all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to the ruine of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes: They knew his Integrity, that there was no hopes of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, and therefore reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to deſtroy him; that by ſuch an Execrable inſtance of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful temper they might deter all other Loyal Magiſtrates from intermedling with their Affairs, and to render their <hi>Arcana inferna</hi> Sacred againſt all ſuch intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings <note place="margin">Flectere ſi uequerunt ſuperos A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheronta movebunt.</note> by the danger of their Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. His <hi>Murther</hi> now is fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſov'd upon, and ſeveral perſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to effect it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:108904:37"/>
The Perſons principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned were <hi>Father Girald,</hi> and <hi>Father Kelly,</hi> two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſts, <hi>Robert Green</hi> Cuſhion-man to the Queens Chappel, <hi>Laurence Hill,</hi> Servant to Dr. <hi>Godden</hi> Treaſurer of the ſaid Chappel, <hi>Henry Berry</hi> Porter of <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe; Mr. <hi>Miles Prance</hi> a Goldſmith in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden,</hi> and Captain <hi>William Bedloe,</hi> who though he was not an actor in the Deſign, yet was made privy to it, and afterwards made his diſcovery of it: beſides there were others that were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe privy to it, as namely, one <hi>Lawſon</hi> a Prieſt, and <hi>Phillip Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natti</hi> (belonging to the Lord <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſis)</hi> who afterwards fled, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, Le Fair, Welch, Kains,</hi> and others; theſe laſt Five being all <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vernatti</hi> and the Prieſts were the Perſons (it is believed) that firſt undertook the Deſign, and then drew in firſt <hi>Green, Hill</hi> and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108904:38"/>
               <hi>Berry</hi> (the actual Murtherers) and afterwards Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with them in this Helliſh Conjuration.</p>
            <p>The Scene of the contrivance was the <hi>Plough-Ale-houſe,</hi> near the <hi>Water-gate</hi> by <hi>Somerſet-houſe:</hi> the time upon a Sunday after Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-prayer, when the ſaid Preiſts coming from the Chappel met with Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> there, and upon confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with him, told him, That Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey was a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Perſecutor of Catholicks, and a particular Enemy to her Majeſties Servants,</hi> (of whom Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> counted himſelf one, as being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to work in work of Gold and Silver for Her Majeſty: and <hi>that he had</hi> very lately Examined <hi>People againſt them, and got Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to fix baſe Crimes and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals on their Religion, and that Catholicks would be ruined unleſs he were taken off; and therefore it was neceſſary, for the Glory of God and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108904:38"/>
good of the Church, that it ſhould be done:</hi> And when Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſeemed to ſcruple at what they propoſed to him to ingage him in the Murther, the two Prieſts <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> told him, It was a meritorious work, and no ſin, but a work of Charity—How cruel are the very Mercies of the Wicked! How impious the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of ſuch unſanctified Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots!</p>
            <p>They prevailed with him, at leaſt he ſeemed to be prevailed upon, to ingage himſelf in the Deſign, and ſeveral conſultations were afterwards had about the management of it.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>October, Lawrence Hill,</hi> one of the Conſpirators (as they had laid their deſign) was imployed to go to Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s Houſe in the Morning about the time of his ſtirring, to ſpeak with him, but what his Errand
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108904:39"/>
was, is unknown: afterwards the ſaid <hi>Hill</hi> meets with <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Green,</hi> and they three together way-lay Sir <hi>Edmonbury</hi> at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, which was about Ten or Eleven a Clock (the uſual time of his ſetting out) being <hi>all alone;</hi> they follow'd him and watched him all that day from place to place, till about Six or Seven a Clock in the Evening: And then theſe <hi>that lay in wait to ſhed Blood,</hi> having lodg'd their innocent prey at a place where they ſaw him enter, ſent their fellow <hi>Green</hi> (while they in the mean watched his forth-coming) to Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> to ſummon him with all ſpeed to haſten to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet-houſe</hi> Water-gate leading down to the <hi>Thames,</hi> where <hi>Kelly</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> the other two deſigned Executioners were to meet him, in order to accompliſh the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</p>
            <p>Theſe three Aſſaſſinates abided
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108904:39"/>
for ſome hours the Horrors of the Night, with a deviliſh impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of ſeeing their expected prize; when about Nine a Clock their companion <hi>Hill</hi> comes with <hi>cruel</hi> haſt to inform them he was coming: and now for a Gin wherewith to intrap him into their bloody Hands, it is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived, That <hi>Kelly</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ſhould begin a ſeeming quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; and in the mean while <hi>Hill</hi> that watched for that purpoſe, was to ingage Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi> at his coming by, to come down and uſe his Authority for the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When Theeves fall out</hi> (it is ſaid) <hi>honeſt Men come by their Goods;</hi> when <hi>Murtherers</hi> feignedly do ſo, it appears ſuch Men may loſe their Lives.</p>

the Publick, ſoon after comes by, when <hi>Hill</hi> (the <hi>Judas</hi> in the Plot) having treacherouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated himſelf into ſo much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him as to be known by him; meets him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his approach, in a ſeeming great earneſtneſs and counterfeit concernedneſs, <hi>Intreating him for Gods ſake to come in, for there were two Men a quarrelling, and he was afraid there would be blood ſhed:</hi> Murther be ſure there was, as it was by this artifice deſigned and executed; his preſence (as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate) was urged as a likely means to chill the heats of their fury, and to make them quiet. Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi> was unwilling to ingage himſelf, eſpecially at that ſeaſon of the Night; but the other by his importunity in a manner forced him to it, <hi>Hill</hi> leading the way, and Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> following him through the Gate leading down toward the place;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108904:40"/>
               <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> were watching near by, and obſerving the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, immediatly fell in after them; Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> as ſoon as Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi> was entred the fatal limits, goes down to ſecure the <hi>Water-gate,</hi> that no Body ſhould enter that way to diſturb their proceedings; and <hi>Berry</hi> at the ſame time (that the Scene of their miſchiefs might be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inacceſſible) was to watch the Stairs and Paſſage by the <hi>Chappel;</hi> but firſt <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> the pretended <hi>Quarrellers</hi> ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Rails by the <hi>Queens</hi> Stables; and as Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi> went down towards them, (ſweet Soul whoſe Thoughts were only then affected with generous deſigns of hindring the Effects of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Outrage, and little dreaming that himſelf was the deſigned Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it) that Villa in <hi>Green</hi> ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threw a twiſted Handkerchief about his Neck, and forthwith
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108904:41"/>
all four of them pulled him down and throtled him, drawing between them the ends of the ſtrangling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument ſo hard, that at laſt his pure and innocent Soul, after ſome Convulſive ſtruglings againſt the violences of ſuch an unnatural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, was diſlog'd from the Body, and convey'd by Angels to the place where bleſſed and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr'd Saints lye under the Altar, crying out their <hi>Quouſ<expan>

            <p>

            <p>There were ſome unhappy O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of this Tragedy which Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi> himſelf had conceived <note place="margin">Vide Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative <hi>of the Tryals of</hi> Green, Berry <hi>and</hi> Hill.</note> (it ſeem'd in his ovvn mind) ſome time before the Execution of it, which he not long before declared to Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> after he had received the Informations; <hi>That he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Affronts from great Perſons, for being ſo zealous in that buſineſs of the diſcovery of the Plot;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> (being threatned by <hi>ſome great Men of the</hi> Popiſh <hi>party) he went in fear of his life by that party, having been dogged by them

with a dark Lanthorn to the ſaid place (Dr. <hi>Goddins</hi> Lodgings,) where alſo Captain <hi>Bedloe</hi> came, who had not hitherto before ingaged himſelf in any actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al performance with them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> there amongſt the reſt, took ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108904:43"/>
miſtake) called out to them, and diſcovering who he was, they went back together, and carried the Body into the little Room where it was firſt placed.</p>
            <p>And now to perfect their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany to the heighth of malice, (that they might as well <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Reputation</hi> as they had done his <hi>Perſon,</hi> a thing more than once by them attempted) the two <hi>Prieſts, Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> adviſed to carry him out into the Fields, and there to leave him, run through with his own Sword, in ſome obſure place; where (upon diſcovery) he might be ſuppoſed to have murther'd <hi>himſelf;</hi> and therefore his Money, Rings and ſuch other things of value as he had about him, were all to be left with him.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Bedloe</hi> had before the Murther been acquainted by them with the deſign, and fain they would have ingaged him to have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108904:43"/>
aſſiſted them in the Execution; for which they told him there was 4000 <hi>l.</hi> to be given by a great <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Party;</hi> and acquainted him with the time when they intended to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him, then deſiring his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but he honeſtly failed them; which made Monſieur <hi>Le Faire</hi> (one of the Undertakers) very angry with him; but meeting him on the <hi>Munday</hi> following, told him that the buſineſs was done without him; and having ſhewed him the Body (as we have before told you) would then have ingaged him to aſſiſt them in carrying it off, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their laſt mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; and bound him to it upon the <hi>Sacrament</hi> he laſt took (a pretty knack of prophane Conjuration, by which they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally adjure their Parties to Truſt and Secrecy) Captain <hi>Bedloe</hi> promiſed to meet them at Twelve

a Clock that Night to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as judging that the fitteſt time for ſuch deeds of Darkneſs to be tranſacted in; but failed them again, and came no more at them; but inſtead thereof taking a journey to <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> where ſome time after, the horror of this fact had made ſuch impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on him, that thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on changing his mind as well as he had done his Company, he ſent up to one of the Secretaries of State, in writing, together with a diſcovery of other matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Plot, an Account (ſo far as he knew) of this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But in the mean while the aforeſaid <hi>Complices</hi> being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated of his aſſiſtance, went about the work themſelves; to which end they had procured a Sedan, into which (though with ſome difficulty, by reaſon of its ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) they crouded the Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108904:44"/>
               <hi>Body;</hi> this was done about Twelve a Clock (the Hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,) <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Girald</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him out at the great Gate, the Door of which <hi>Berry</hi> the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opened to them; having (to avoid their taking notice of the action) invited the Souldiers who uſed to attend there, to his Houſe, and there treated them with Drink and Tabacco, till ſuch time as they had conveyed away the <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>breaſts</hi> beſides thoſe of theſe hardned and cruel <hi>wretches,</hi> would not have quiver'd with the <hi>horror</hi> of ſuch <hi>inhumane</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? to deal ſo <hi>familiarly</hi> with the Carkaſs of a <hi>murder'd</hi> perſon, a perſon murdered by their <hi>own</hi> hands, and whoſe <hi>blood</hi> they could not but think at the ſame time cryed loud for vengeance upon their heads!

Natures to the force of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Impreſſions!</p>
            <p>Yet neither the horror of the Fact, nor yet that of a dark night, could ſcare them from their hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous purpoſes; but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with their dead Burthen (carrying it in the <hi>Sedan</hi> by turns between them) till they came to <hi>So-hoe Fields,</hi> near the <hi>Grecian Church</hi> there lately built; and there <hi>Hill</hi> attended with an Horſe ready for their purpoſe, upon which they placed the Body before <hi>Hill,</hi> who held it from falling; (Oh horrid Boldneſs!) Mean while the reſt conveyed the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> into an Houſe that was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but unfiniſht, that ſtood near by, to remain there till they came back: And then <hi>Girald</hi> the Prieſt ſaid, <hi>I wiſh we had an hundred ſuch Rogues as ſecure as we have this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> then becauſe he was an Houſe-keeper, took his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108904:45"/>
leave of them and returned home, and the other four went away with him, one leading the Horſe, <hi>Hill</hi> riding and holding the <hi>Body,</hi> and the other two walking by.</p>
            <p>They carried him into an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure place, about two miles out of Town, towards <hi>Hamſtead,</hi> near a place called <hi>Primroſe-Hill,</hi> and there in a ditch they left the <hi>Body,</hi> after all theſe harraſings to its quiet repoſe; this was the Grave they had prepared for him; but before they left him (as a token of their malicious deſign) <hi>Girald</hi> runs Sir <hi>Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s own Sword through him, laying the Scabbard together with his Gloves on the bank, at a ſmall diſtance from the Body.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Sir <hi>Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s Servants, and then his Friends, and then the whole Town were not a little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his abſence; and there was once a <hi>Proclamation</hi> order'd to

diſcover him, but countermanded, by reaſon of falſe Informations ſpread about by ſome of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Party, that he was living and well: And there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons that went deſignedly up and down to <hi>Coffee-houſes</hi> to ſpread <hi>falſe Reports</hi> upon this Subject; as that he was gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Countrey to be married to a certain Lady, whom they took upon them to name, and that they ſaw him in ſuch and ſuch places.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the twelfth of <hi>October,</hi> the very Evening that Sir <hi>Edmundbury</hi> was Murthered; Father <hi>Harcourt</hi> the Jeſuit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Executed, ſent away a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Father <hi>Ewers</hi> a <hi>Prieſt</hi> at the Lord <hi>Aſtons</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> wherein were theſe words; <hi>This Night is Sir</hi> Edmondbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey <hi>diſpatcht.</hi> This Letter was received there on the <hi>Monday,</hi> and ſhewn to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> as he

            </p>
            <p>But as <hi>Murther</hi> the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Divine Juſtice,</hi> does moſt unſeldom eſcape Diſcovery; but that the Murther is detected, and the Murtherer by ſome means brought to light; God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Providence ſo to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, that the Murther of this good Man (the miſs of whom had cauſed great Thoughtfulneſs of Heart (I may ſay) all the Kingdom over) was in a fevv days after Diſcovered.</p>
            <p>For upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Day of <hi>October,</hi> which was the next Day after they had left him in his <hi>uncover'd</hi> Grave, two
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108904:47"/>
Men by chance paſſing over the Fields, ſpied the Gloves and Scabbard, and upon further ſearch diſcovered the Body it ſelf ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Ditch, with the Sword run through it, in ſuch manner as his <hi>Murtherers</hi> had left it; beſides that they found about him, his Rings, Watch, and ſome Moneys both Gold and Silver, all which the Covetouſneſs of his Enemies diſpenſed with the loſs of, to gratifie a more unjuſtifiable end thereby, of a malicious Slander, which they thought might be thereby occaſioned, of being his own Murtherer.</p>
            <p>Theſe two honeſt <hi>Diſcoverers</hi> well weighing the circumſtances of what they had ſeen, and that there was no Blood any where appeared, upon the Wounds made by the Svvord run through him, concluded it vvas ſome Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſe, and thereupon one of them fetching a Conſtable and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108904:47"/>
ſome others to aſſiſt them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd the (yet reſtleſs) Body to an houſe, vvhere he lay not long before upon the rumour the Body vvas, knovvn to be the Relict of the much <hi>deſired</hi> and <hi>wanted</hi> Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Coroner</hi> of <hi>Middleſex</hi> vvas then ſent for (as is required in ſuch Caſes of unnatural Deaths) to inquire of the Death of this perſon; who by the Oaths of a Jury of ſubſtantial Credits, found that Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> vvas murthered, (not murthered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the deſign vvas laid) and the Verdict vvas recorded. But yet the Felons concerned in the Murther, could not be yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty being graciouſly inclined to be concerned as vvell as others in the loſs of this good man and faithful Subject; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that vvhat vvas feared vvas novv certainly proved, that he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108904:48"/>
vvas Murthered, vvas pleaſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the twentieth day of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> following to iſſue out his Royal Proclamation; <hi>Commanding all his Subjects and Officers to uſe their utmoſt Diligence to find out and Diſcover the Murtherers of Sir</hi> Edmondbury, <hi>graciouſly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> 500 l. <hi>reward to any that ſhould make ſuch Diſcovery; and if any one of the Murtherers ſhould Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the reſt, he ſhould not only be Pardoned, but likewiſe have the ſame Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Royal Offer could not prevail with them to come in for the preſent, (guilty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies are aw'd as well by the Clemency as Juſtice of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate) but they ſeem'd more hardened in their Wickedneſs by its Succeſs.</p>
            <p>For it was not above a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night afterwards, that they drew up a Narrative of this ſo meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Act of theirs in killing a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108904:48"/>
Proteſtant Magiſtrate, in writing, which <hi>Vernatti</hi> read in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting manner at a meeting they had at the <hi>Queens-Head</hi> at <hi>Bow,</hi> where he declared that the ſame was drawn up to be ſhewed to one of the <hi>Popiſh Lords</hi> (now in the <hi>Tower)</hi> and other great Perſons that were the Original Deſigners and Promoters of the buſineſs, for their Satisfaction, by whom it might poſſibly be ſent to <hi>Rome;</hi> and there no doubt it would find a great approbation and acceptance.</p>
            <p>The Murther we ſee is found out, but the <hi>Murtherers</hi> yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, notwithſtanding his <hi>Majeſties</hi> gracious <hi>Proclamation,</hi> with promiſes of reward (beſides Pardon) to the Diſcoverer: Captain <hi>Bedloe</hi> had (as we have told you) ſent up a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, but not being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preſent at the <hi>Murther,</hi> could not give a particular account
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108904:49"/>
of thoſe that were actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it: So that the Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates for about ten weeks had lull'd themſelves into a fond Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, becoming almoſt as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as they were graceleſs: But the <hi>Keeper</hi> of <hi>Iſrael, that neither ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth,</hi> and from whom no Secrets are hidden, was then pleaſed (to make the Triumphs of his own <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> the more Illuſtrious, when all <hi>humane</hi> attempts to that end ſeemed in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated) to work out a <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> by ſuch unthought-of means, as plainly ſhewed it was <hi>Digi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Dei</hi> and the <hi>Lords own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

            <p>We have before informed you that Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> was drawn into the curſed Combination, and how far he Acted in it; vvho as he was bound by the Tyes of Secrecy to a ſinful Silence, had hitherto concealed the Fact: But there

happening ſome miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt him and a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his, the latter knowing Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> to be a Zealous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, and having underſtood by ſome of his Servants that one time about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> then laſt, he had abſented himſelf two or three nights from home; an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination came into his Head, that Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> might be concerned in Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; although indeed, ſuch his abſenting was a fortnight before Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi>'s <hi>death,</hi> not upon the account of that, but ſome others more dangerous to him; The Proclamation being then new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iſſued, prohibiting all <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Popiſhly affected</hi> perſons from ſtaying in <hi>Town;</hi> about which time, when the Plot was firſt noiſed abroad, <hi>Fenwick, Ireland,</hi> and others of the Conſpirators were ſeized, whom he was ſo Zealous to defend in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108904:50"/>
Coffee-houſe; that for ſome Words then ſpoken, he was threatned by ſome perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be Proſecuted; and upon that account only lay from home the ſaid two or three nights, (as he was able to prove by credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witneſſes) till ſuch time as the buſineſs might be compoſed; However, this <hi>Neighbour</hi> of his, upon the bare ſuſpition, took out a <hi>Warrant</hi> againſt him to appear before the <hi>Council;</hi> which Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> readily obey'd, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Mr.</hi> Prances <hi>Narrative,</hi> pag. 20, 21.</note> him not able to prove any thing againſt him upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

            </p>
            <p>The next day being the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> he made his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, (the Narrative of which is ſince by Licenſe of <hi>Authority</hi> Printed, and thereby charged the before named <hi>Dominick Kelly, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Green, Henry Berry,</hi> and <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Hill,</hi> as Confederates in this Murther; of whom the three laſt were apprehended, but the two firſt Eſcaped; the Subtil Prieſts, according to the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb of thoſe that <hi>have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luck,</hi> ſhifting for themſelves, and leaving thoſe whom they had <hi>drawn in</hi> to anſwer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

but underſtanding <hi>Pran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> being taken, got out upon Bail (hired by him for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) before he was known to be <hi>Kelly,</hi> though afterwards the ſame was Diſcovered; the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which, becauſe it is not ſo pertinent to our preſent <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> we ſhall here Omit.</p>
            <p>The 24<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> was Examined before the King and Council, and having given in the particular Circumſtances of the Murther, and in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Rooms and places the Body was kept as aforeſaid, ſeveral <hi>Lords</hi> were ordered to go with him, to ſee if there vvere ſuch Rooms as he had deſcribed, and whether he could readily go to them; which he did to their full ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>But ſome time after, remaining in <hi>Priſon</hi> without any aſſurance of his Pardon, he was ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed vvith, to retract by vvord

deny that they killed Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondbury Godfrey;</hi> for that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Note the ſincerity of Popiſh principles, where ſuch Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of to juſtify the greateſt Villanies.</note> to their Divinity, and what the ſaid Prieſts had So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declared, was <hi>no Sin</hi> or Crime, and conſequently they might all in ſuch their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Sence ſtill be innocent: Yet this he muſt acknowledge, he ſomewhat doubted, becauſe he never was at Confeſſion nor received <hi>Abſolution</hi> ſince the Fact committed; which all the reſt (as ſome of themſelves had declared) had done, and ſo might more peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſt (as they did) in averring themſelves to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; and he does ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly declare, that had he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Abſolution,</hi> 'tis his Fear he ſhould never without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Difficulty have been brought to any acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Theſe Circumſtances together

with a great <hi>Diſtemper</hi> of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, contracted by the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of Confinement, want of Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> occaſioned that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain revolt of his Reaſon and Duty, under that perplexity of Spirit; but as ſoon as he had done it, Conſcience ſlew in his Face, and would no longer be laid aſleep with any deluſive Popiſh Charms. When he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to recollect himſelf, the power of <hi>Truth</hi> diſperſed all theſe Temptations of Intereſt, Fear and Superſtition: If it were true, that he might hazard his Life and loſe his Trade if he did perſiſt in the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Murther, it was as true, and he found it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that he never ſhould have peace of Conſcience if he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyed it.</p>
               <p>And therefore, he was no ſooner returned from the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> (which

            <p>Thus far the words of Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> own Narrative, which we have thought pertinent to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted: The peruſal of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative it ſelf, may ſerve not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Readers Satisfaction in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108904:54"/>
this, but as vvell to inform him of the ſeveral notorious Villanies of a great number of <hi>Popiſh Prieſts,</hi> therein by name expoſed; to vvhich as a very confirming cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance vve may add, that fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very dangerouſly <hi>ill</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he then vvhen he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a certain Proſpect of approaching <hi>Death</hi> before his Eyes, declared and aſſerted to divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons his firſt Confeſſion to be true in all points; and alſo aftervvards as ſoon as he had recovered his health, he repeated the ſame vvith all <hi>Stedfaſtneſs</hi> before the <hi>King</hi> himſelf, and the Lords of the Council: whereupon his Majeſty was moſt graciouſly pleaſed to grant him his Pardon.</p>
            <p>From all which it is moſt plain, that all the noiſe which the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have made about this matter is but empty Air, as good as nothing, and the juſt <hi>Truth</hi> thereof is become
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108904:55"/>
Evident to any ingenious perſon that will but impartially look into theſe tranſactions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them as they are, and not as they are Repreſented by their falſe Perſpectives.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have given you (according to the moſt exact accounts that have been hitherto produced) a <hi>Narrative</hi> of the Diſcovery of this moſt Horrid and Execrable Murther, and by what ſtrange and unthought of means it pleaſed God to effect it.</p>
            <p>In Order of Hiſtory, we ſhould before this have acquainted you with the Paſſages of his Funeral; It was fit ſo <hi>good a Man,</hi> ſo <hi>Loyal a Subject, ſo great a Sufferer</hi> for the publick Intereſt, ſhould not goe without <hi>Honour</hi> to his Grave.</p>
            <p>After his <hi>Relicts,</hi> ſo long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by his reſtleſs Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, had been View'd by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner,</hi> and then quietly depoſed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108904:55"/>
into the Hands of his <hi>Relations,</hi> care was taken that he ſhould have a Burial ſuitable to that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Eſteem that all perſons had of him; which accordingly upon 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> next after the time of his Murther, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by his ſaid <hi>Relations</hi> in a moſt decent and becoming man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without any Pomp or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantries of Oſtentation (that which in his Life-time he was moſt averſe to, and no man ever declined more than he did:) The <hi>Body</hi> being firſt carried to <hi>Old Bridewell,</hi> a place agreed upon for that purpoſe; as being for its amplitude moſt fit to receive the numerous Congreſs of Perſons, that out of the City and other places adjacent, came thither to pay their laſt reſpects to this <hi>Martyr'd</hi> Worthy.</p>
            <p>From thence accompanied with great numbers of perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, eminent Citizens, Miniſters
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108904:56"/>
and others, that were all hearty Mourners upon this ſad occaſion: He was carryed in a Solemn manner through <hi>Fleet-ſtreet</hi> and the <hi>Strand,</hi> to the Pariſh <hi>Church</hi> of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the <hi>Fields,</hi> and there decently Interred: The Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sermon upon this occaſion being then Preached by the late Reverend and Learned Prelate Dr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> then Incumbent there, and ſince by him Publiſhed; a Diſcourſe ſo Sympathiſing with the Subject, and ſo excellent in all its parts, as deſerves better than a tranſient Mention.</p>
            <p>WE have hitherto given you a Summary of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Life, Tragical Death, and laſtly the Diſcovery of the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of this <hi>worthy Gentleman:</hi> It remains now (and it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the <hi>Reader)</hi> that we give ſome Account of the Trial
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108904:56"/>
and Execution of thoſe <hi>Villains</hi> that were concerned in the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have heard before, how that upon the diſcovery made thereof by Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and of the Actors in it, Three of them, <hi>viz. Robert Green, Henry Berry,</hi> and <hi>Lawrence Hill,</hi> were taken and committed to the common Gaol, in order to their <hi>Tryals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> ſitting about that time, were pleaſed to take ſuch notice of the fact (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what relation it had to the Plot, about which they were then ſedulouſly inquiring) that it was Order'd by the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> that Sir <hi>John Earnly</hi> a Member of that <hi>Houſe,</hi> ſhould immediately carry an Addreſs from them to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> That his <hi>Majesty</hi> would be pleaſed to iſſue out a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> for the Tryal of the aforeſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors:</hi> Which Addreſs his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:108904:57"/>
graciouſly accepted, and was pleaſed to ſay, That a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould forthwith be iſſued out for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Which was accordingly done; and upon Wedneſday the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Green, Berry</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> were brought to their Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als at the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Barre at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where before the <hi>Judges</hi> there ſitting, they were ſeverally Arraigned, and pleaded <hi>Not Guilty</hi>—And a Rule of Court entred for their being brought to Tryal on <hi>Friday</hi> the tenth of the ſame Month; and then a Jury of able and worthy perſons (being Impannel'd by the Sheriff) were Sworn to trye the fact: Their Names were as follow, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> (the principal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) according to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations he had before given in to the <hi>Council,</hi> declared the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the whole matter from firſt to laſt, according as is before related, but declared that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Conference with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108904:58"/>
Captain <hi>Bedloe</hi> in his life, before he was committed to Priſon.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſwears, that a little before the Fact, <hi>Le Fair, Prichard</hi> and <hi>Keynes,</hi> three of the Confederates and ſome others of them, (all of them <hi>Prieſts)</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd him about <hi>killing a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cain Gentleman,</hi> whom they would not name: and incouraged him with the promiſe of a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Gratuity to be aſſiſtant to them; and then directed him to inſinuate himſelf into Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondbury Godfreys</hi> acquaintance. Which in complyance to their Wicked humours, (which he durſt hardly refuſe to do) he did: and did under ſeveral ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences inſinuate himſelf into an Acquaintance with Sir <hi>Edmondbury,</hi> (who was never hard of acceſſe to any) but made not that advantage of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that they maliciouſly had deſigned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:108904:58"/>
But he informed the Court, that the very day Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> was murther'd, <hi>Le Fair</hi> (at a Tavern near <hi>Temple-Barr)</hi> told him there was a Gentleman to <hi>be put out of the way,</hi> (that is, in their Popiſh ſence,) to be <hi>murther'd,</hi> that Night; and would engage his aſſiſtance: And that there would be 4000 <hi>l.</hi> reward given by a Great <hi>Lord</hi> of the Popiſh party to recompence the Undertakers: For (ſaid theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Polititians) ſhould not this Gentleman be cut off, things would be <hi>diſcovered</hi> to that degree, that they ſhould not be able to bring their deſigns to paſs; they knew what a <hi>Remora</hi> the activity of his Loyal Spirit would be to their proceedings: To prevent which, they requeſt <hi>Captain Bedloe</hi> to meet them at <hi>Somerſet-houſe</hi> near the Cloyſters that Evening, being the place in which they deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act the Tragedy. This he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108904:59"/>
promiſed to do, and (as we have ſaid before) he durſt do no leſs; but knowing againſt whom their deſigns were intended, he wilfully failed them. That on the <hi>Munday</hi> following, <hi>Le Fair</hi> again meeting with the ſaid <hi>Captain Bedloe,</hi> charged him with breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and appointed him to come to <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> about Nine of the Clock that Evening; where he told him he had done <hi>ill,</hi> in that he denyed to aſſiſt them in this buſineſs, but if he would help to carry him off, he ſhould ſtill have part of the before mentioned reward: <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid the Witneſs (as ſurpriz'd at the News of it) <hi>is he murther'd?</hi> Yes, replyed <hi>Le Fair.</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Witneſs askt if he might not ſee him? which was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>Le Fair</hi> led him through a dark Entry into a Room where there were ſeveral people, that had no light but a dark Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108904:59"/>
amongſt them, and were conſulting together how to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him off: When one of the company throwing off the Cloth with which the body was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, <hi>Captain Bedloe</hi> had a View of his face and preſently knew it to be Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s, with whom (by the inſtigation of theſe Murtherers,) he had been ſo well acquainted as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remember him. The <hi>Captains</hi> advice to them was, to tye weights to his Head and Feet, and throw him into the River: but this they did not think fit to do, but ſaid they <hi>would put it upon himſelf.</hi> And to that end reſolved to put him into a Chair (or Sedan) the Porter <hi>Berry</hi> being to sit up to let them out at the <hi>Court-gate,</hi> and at Twelve a Clock that night was the hour appointed to carry him off; <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bedloe</hi> promiſing to them, upon the Sacrament which he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108904:60"/>
had took the Sunday before, to return again to them, and help them; but being got from them, never came at them more.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſtable</hi> that View'd the body in the Ditch, gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how he found it with the Sword <hi>Sticking</hi> through it, but no <hi>blood</hi> appearing upon the ground. And that he found a great deal of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> in his pockets.</p>
            <p>The two <hi>Chyrurgeons</hi> moreover Swore, that they verily believed the <hi>Sword</hi> was run through him <hi>after</hi> he was <hi>dead</hi> and Cold; but that he died of <hi>Suffocation</hi> and breaking of his Neck, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the bruiſes on his Breaſt.</p>
            <p>To confirm Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they had been ſeveral times at his houſe, inquiring for him, and that <hi>Hill</hi> (as he and the reſt told <hi>Prance)</hi> was there on the morning of that day in which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108904:60"/>
he was murther'd, there was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one <hi>Elizabeth Curtis,</hi> that at the ſame time dwelt with Sir <hi>Edmondbury,</hi> his menial Servant; ſhe Swore directly that <hi>Green</hi> had been at her Maſters about a fortnight before her Maſter was killed, and talked with him about a quarter of an hour in <hi>French:</hi> And that <hi>Hill</hi> was there that very <hi>Saturday morning on which he was murthered,</hi> and ſpake to him before he went out, and was there a good while in the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> with him, but could not tell what his buſineſs was: That the night before, there was a ſtrange man brought a Note to her <hi>Maſter,</hi> which ſhe gave to him, and the man ſtaying for an Anſwer, <hi>Prethee</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondbury Godfrey) tell him I do not know what to make of it:</hi> But this was none of the three perſons at the Bar, but ſuppoſed to be one of their Fraternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:108904:61"/>
As for <hi>Hill, ſhe was ſure he was there on the ſaid Saturday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> by the ſame token he had then on the ſame Cloaths as he now had at the Bar; though now he denyed he was there, yet he acknowledged he had not changed his cloaths, but wore the ſame Suit ever ſince before that time.</p>
            <p>The man at the <hi>Plow Alehouſe</hi> (where Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſwore the Murther was conſulted) and his Servant, did both Swear, that <hi>Prance</hi> did uſe to come thither with <hi>Hill, Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly,</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times within five weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Murther. The relation that Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> gave of the meeting at the <hi>Queens-head</hi> at <hi>Bow,</hi> is confirmed by a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> that they ſent for a Gentleman living about a Mile from that place, to come to them.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Southwell</hi> depoſes, that Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> having related
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108904:61"/>
theſe things to the <hi>Council,</hi> and being to attend the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> and the <hi>Earl of Oſſery,</hi> to ſhew them the places he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>He readily went to them,</hi> and they appeared to be all ſuch as he had deſcribed them; only as to the Room in the upper Court, where the Body was laid one Night, having never been there but <hi>once,</hi> and that in the dark too, he ſaid he could not poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſign it, but pointed to ſome <hi>Rooms,</hi> and ſaid he was ſure it was thereabouts, and this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs the <hi>Court</hi> obſerving did give more credit to the reſt of his Evidence. For a perſon that right or wrong will Swear any thing, will ſtick at nothing.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It was proved that <hi>Berry</hi> the <hi>Porter,</hi> pretended Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders given him, that he ſhould Suffer no Strangers or perſons of Quality to come into <hi>Somerſet-houſe</hi> on the twelfth, thirteenth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108904:62"/>
and fourteenth days of <hi>October,</hi> the firſt being the day on which Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> was Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and the two days fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the time that he lay there; and that <hi>Prince Rupert</hi> coming in there within that time, was denyed entrance.</p>
            <p>Theſe were ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal heads of the Evidence that were given in againſt the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which, notwithſtanding the directneſs of the circumſtances to prove the Fact upon them, they had all the Stoutneſs to deny. And it was no wonder that men of ſuch profligate Conſciences that would not ſtick at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrating ſuch Villanies, ſhould not boggle at the denying of them.</p>
            <p>The defence they made for themſelves was very <hi>Strained</hi> and unconvincing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hill</hi> would needs except againſt Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> Teſtimony, becauſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108904:62"/>
he once formerly denyed it (the reaſon of his ſo doing you have had before related, from the words of his own <hi>Narrative.)</hi> But this exception the <hi>Court</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily over-ruled, for that beſides the before mentioned reaſons that induced him to it, he had now affirmed the truth upon <hi>Oath,</hi> and his denying of it was but his <hi>bare ſaying,</hi> and ſo he could not be now Perjured upon that ſingle aſſertion, nor the credit of his now Evidence be any wiſe the more miſtruſted, conſidering the circumſtances he was then under.</p>
            <p>And further, the ſaid <hi>Hill</hi> to Evade, offers ſome Witneſſes of his own Religion, to aver he was never from his Lodgings after nine a Clock at night. But theſe did it ſo <hi>nicely</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that no Streſs could be laid upon them, it being proved that they had <hi>ſeveral Keys</hi> to the

So unhappy were they in their Calculations of the time they were brought to ſpeak to.</p>
            <p>The Evidence that <hi>Berry</hi> gave in to the <hi>Court</hi> were the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who were placed Sentinel at the Gate. They ſay they ſaw a <hi>Sedan</hi> come in, and ſo far they agree with the Kings Evidence, but then they confidently aver that they <hi>ſaw none go out all night.</hi> But what was this to matter of Fact? or what did it relate to the Murther Committed, ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively in all its circumſtances Sworn to by the Kings Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? The Sentinel might be from his Poſt, and 'tis moſt probable he was ſo: For Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> had before informed the Court that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108904:63"/>
               <hi>Berry</hi> had inveigled the Sentinel in to drink, and ſo not being in the way at the time of doing it, he might truly ſay without any diſcredit to the Evidence of the other ſide, That he did not ſee the <hi>Sedan</hi> go out, it might be morally impoſſible he ſhould; At leaſt the Sentinel knowing he had committed a dangerous fault by ſo doing, might be ſo wiſe for his own ſafety as to conceal it. Yet theſe poor and ſlender <hi>Evaſions</hi> were the beſt defence theſe Wretches could make for themſelves; which beſides their own weakneſs being oppoſed with ſo many undeniable Arguments of <hi>truth</hi> and certainty by the Witneſſes of the other ſide, found ſo little Credit with the <hi>Jury,</hi> that after a little time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, they brought them in all three <hi>Guilty of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the eleventh of

               <hi>February,</hi> they were brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the <hi>Bar</hi> in Order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Sentence, which (after a grave and ſeaſonable Speech made to them upon that occaſion by Mr. <hi>Juſtice W<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>According to which Sentence <hi>Robert Green</hi> and <hi>Lawrence Hill</hi> were Executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> on the twenty eighth day of the ſame Month. At the place of <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> they behaved themſelves with the Courages of true <hi>Romans</hi> of the new Stamp, denying the Crime they Suffered for, with that their formal Evaſion of being <hi>Innocent as the Child un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born;</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:108904:64"/>
that is as no body. A Child unborn may be a <hi>Non ens</hi>—Had it been as a <hi>Sucking Child,</hi> I queſtion whether their dying Conſciences could ſo well have diſpenſed with the Expreſſion. But what other might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Conſciences ſo charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as theirs was, by the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticating Juggles of their <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,</hi> ty'd up by ſo many Oaths and Sacraments to conceal that truth which by the divulging muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily turn to the Scandal of the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi>—whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples will rather admit the blame and puniſhment of a Crime than the ſhame of it.</p>
            <p>And that there were ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns contrived to oblige them to ſuch a <hi>prophane</hi> concealment (in ſo ſolemn a caſe as dying I can give it no fitter an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet) is evident by one notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Circumſtance: That when <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> were Hang'd and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108904:65"/>
dead, Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> the Keeper of <hi>Newgate,</hi> with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, ſaw the Executioner (amongſt other things) take a Paper out of <hi>Hill</hi>'s Pocket, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting to be the form of the <hi>Speech</hi> that he ſhould uſe to the People at the Gallows, which being penn'd in a ſingular way of expreſſion, I ſhall take leave to inſert <hi>Verbatim,</hi> as followeth.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Am come now to the fatal place where I muſt end my Life, and I hope with that Courage that may become my Innocence. I muſt now appear before the great Judge who knows all things and Judges rightly; and I hope it will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for me a Sinner, that I am thus wrongfully put to Death. I call God, Angels and Men to Witneſs that I am wholly Ignorant of the Manner, Cauſe, or Time, of the Death of</hi> Juſtice Godfrey; <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108904:65"/>
on that account by the Malice of wicked men brought to this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death, which I hope will give me a ſpeedy paſſage to Eternal Life. In this hope I dye chearfully becauſe of mine Innocence, and the benefit of the precious wounds of my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, by whoſe Merits I hope for Salvation. I dye a</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick, <hi>deſiring all ſuch to Pray for me: And I beſeech God in his Juſtice to diſcover this horrid Murther, with the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thereof, that my Innocence may appear. And though from my Heart I forgive my Accuſers, Yet I</hi> Cite <hi>all ſuch as have a hand in this bloody Contrivance, before the great Tribunal of Gods Juſtice to anſwer for the wrong they have done the Innocent; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord</hi> Chief Juſtice, <hi>and the Brothers of Sir</hi> Edmondbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, <hi>with Jury, Witneſſes and all their Partakers.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dying words</hi> ought to have their juſt allowances of credit, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing men, if ever they dare ſpeak the truth, will do it then when they are within an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate proſpect of a ſudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before the <hi>Omn<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But when the <hi>truth</hi> has been once determined (as in this caſe) by no leſs than a Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, ſome of them unknown to the other, yet all of them har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly agreeing in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtances of the Fact; and the <hi>Fact</hi> it ſelf ſufficiently proved on all hands by perſons that proſeſs ſuch a <hi>Religion</hi> as gives no allowances to lying or diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>When on the other hand the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:108904:66"/>
               <hi>truth</hi> ſo proved ſhall be denyed by perſons inſtructed in ſuch falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as theſe; to deny the truth when the ſecular Intereſt of their Idoliz'd as well as Idolatrous Church ſhall be indanger'd by it; to invert the moral nature of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> and to account thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and things good, vertuous and meritorious, which in their own nature (beſides the expreſs commands of <hi>Gods Word)</hi> are <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> and <hi>ſinful;</hi> No wonder if ſuch perſons upon ſuch <hi>principles</hi> ſhould deny or conceal the truth, eſpecially when they can make ſuch unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py diſtinctions betwixt the <hi>form</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> of a Fact; as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the crime of <hi>Murther</hi> when they know themſelves to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>killing</hi> a perſon, killing in their ſence being ſometimes no more <hi>Murder</hi> than it was for the Prieſts of old to kill a Sacrifice, or for the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſlaughter the reprobated <hi>Amalekites,</hi> they arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108904:67"/>
to themſelves the ſame <hi>dominion</hi> over the lives and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>Hereticks</hi> (as we are accounted by them) that the <hi>Jews</hi> (that priviledged people) of old had over the execrated <hi>Pagan</hi> Nations; ſo that in their ſence, <hi>Killing is no Murder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which conſiderations it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> eaſie for any impartial man to judge how much credit ſuch <hi>dying atteſtations</hi> may admit of, againſt ſuch clear and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proofs as were brought againſt them.</p>
            <p>And it is more than probable, that the words of the aforeſaid Paper were not <hi>Hill</hi>'s own words, but dictated for him in that form by thoſe of his party that were afraid of a Confeſſion, and durſt not truſt the reputation of their cauſe to the hazard of any <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary</hi> expreſſions, that the conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>death</hi> might extort from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:108904:67"/>
Wherefore otherwiſe might not a verbal expreſſion of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency (if he were minded to declare it) be lookt upon as more credible from one in his dying circumſtances, than a ſet and Studyed form of Speech cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the purpoſe?</p>
            <p>But they feared either the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of death would force him to a plain Confeſſion, or that the power of truth fortified with ſuch awful Sentiments, would over-bear his Tongue in ſome circumſtance; or at leaſt that he would not deny the Fact ſo <hi>reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi> and in ſuch a <hi>taking</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as might fix a Suſpicion and <hi>odium</hi> upon the <hi>Witneſſes, Judge</hi> and <hi>Jury</hi> in the minds of the People, which was the great thing they aimed at.</p>
            <p>No doubt therefore this form of what he ſhould ſay at his Execution, was drawn up for him by ſome of the <hi>Religion,</hi> that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108904:68"/>
every word might be according to their mind, and to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of their deſigns, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſoever it were to his thoughts or the truth.</p>
            <p>And no Wonder it is that they ſhould inſtruct their Proſelytes to make Speeches juſt as they ſay Prayers, reſting in the <hi>Opere Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato,</hi> without any underſtanding or attention, or conſent of mind to the words they uſe, when a bare doing or a bare ſaying can excuſe an intention.</p>
            <p>To conclude, It is evident that the words were framed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for him to <hi>Con by heart,</hi> and not of his own doing, by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable circumſtance, that he never had <hi>Pen, Ink</hi> nor <hi>Paper</hi> all the while he was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and his Wife being Examined about it, teſtified that it was not of his hand-writing, nor did ſhe ever ſee it before, or know how he came by it; yet he began his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108904:68"/>
Speech with theſe very Words, and repeated as much thereof as his memory under ſuch confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed circumſtances would ſerve him to do.</p>
            <p>In the Speech it ſelf we may obſerve the great <hi>Charity</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> of it (whoever he were) in citing all ſuch as had any hand in his Death, before the great <hi>Tribunal of Gods Juſtice,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey's Brothers,</hi> with the <hi>Jury, Witneſſes,</hi> and all their partakers—And yet, but in the words juſt before, he declares <hi>that he does from his Heart forgive his Accuſers.</hi> We may ſee by this Paſſage of what nature ſuch mens Forgiveneſs is; ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Pardon, when at the ſame time they cry out for Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon their Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts (for the ſtill bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter colouring of the buſineſs) have commonly reported that <hi>Berry</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:108904:69"/>
was alwayes or at least dyed a Proteſtant, which is notoriouſly falſe, having been known to be a Papiſt for many years; indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereto (as he confeſſed to the <hi>Ordinary)</hi> out of Lucre, and to get an imployment; And <hi>though he did not believe many things</hi> (as he declared a little before his Execution) <hi>which the Romiſh Doctors</hi> teach as neceſſary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith (which is no more than many other Papiſts will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm) Yet the ſaid <hi>Berry</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before nor at his Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would ever diſown the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church,</hi> nor in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not have theſe laſt Paſſages thought altogether an (at leaſt impertinent) digreſſion from our <hi>Subject,</hi> the deſign of their rehearſal being chiefly to Evidence the <hi>truth,</hi> againſt the ſubtil Deſigns of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to ſuppreſs it, which they have
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108904:69"/>
managed not only by ſuborning (if I may ſo ſay) or at leaſt ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their miſchievous <hi>Agents</hi> to perſiſt to the very death in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what they did: But (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing upon juſt grounds of the ſucceſs of that Impoſture, ſo ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to detection) they have ſince by their malicious ſlanders endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to remove the <hi>Charge</hi> of the fact from thoſe that were the <hi>real</hi> Actors, and from all their own party, to thoſe that were moſt <hi>clear</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And perceiving that the Belief of their deſigns and actings againſt the Life of this <hi>Innocent Gentleman,</hi> was in the length of time not only the more confirmed, but that the credit of it had a fatal influence upon their further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, they were ſo effrontleſs in their Villanous Proſecution, that they ſtuck not to commit a <hi>ſecond Murther</hi> upon the <hi>good Name</hi> as well as they had before done upon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108904:70"/>
the <hi>Perſon</hi> of this worthy <hi>Martyr</hi> for his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Countrey,</hi> by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to charge the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> upon <hi>himſelf,</hi> a brief account of which, to ſhut up this Tragical diſcourſe, I ſhall now give you.</p>
            <p>But by the way it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from this laſt account of <hi>Hills</hi> Confeſſion, that he or his Party had at that time no thoughts of fixing ſuch a ſlander upon him, of his being <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> but did own it as a Murther committed upon him by others (though <hi>Hill</hi> would have ſhifted it off from himſelf) as appears by the words of his Confeſſion—<hi>I beſeech God in his Juſtice to diſcover this Horrid Murther:</hi> The manner of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion may ſufficiently evince that he meant it not of his being Murther'd by himſelf, but others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> which by the goodneſs of the divine Providence was hitherto prevented in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108904:70"/>
by <hi>ſurprizing</hi> diſcoveries, was forced to ſhift its Scenes, and aſſume new forms of Enterprize, upon the defeats of the former: And now a new Inſtrument of theirs is brought upon the Stage: One <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> lately Executed for Treaſon; who upon his firſt Arraignment before the <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> did offer upon a private Examination to diſcover to them ſome perſons (before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known) who were inſtrumental in the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> himſelf (by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) being one that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, and ſo had the better opportunity to know the reſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe Examinations were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in private, and therefore what the Effects of them were, and who the perſons particularly were that were thereby accuſed, Time (the Parent of Truth) may hereafter diſcover.</p>
            <p>But whether the Accuſation of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108904:71"/>
ſome perſons mentioned in the Informations might provoke them to it; or that the Revival of this new Evidence might Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate the malicious party to the undertaking, a new deſign is contriv'd to fix this Murther upon the <hi>Murther'd Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was one of their <hi>Sham-plots;</hi> many of which they have ſet up with an irrefragable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, by ſuch Methods (if poſſible) to amuſe us into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of the <hi>real</hi> one, then and yet in Proſecution.</p>
            <p>They never want Inſtruments to effect their <hi>Villanies,</hi> when they have once contrived them; and had one at this time fit for their purpoſe, an <hi>Iriſh-man, Mac-gar</hi> by name, a Zealous <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and one of a ſuitable reputation; who coming lately over from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and judged by them to be a man fit enough for the purpoſe of an ill deſign, they engage him to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108904:71"/>
ſpread about reports up and down the Town, that Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> had Murthered himſelf; but that to ſave his Eſtate from a forfeiture, by reaſon of his ſo doing, <hi>His Brothers</hi> had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him (the <hi>Informant)</hi> to run Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s own Sword through him, and ſo to leave him in that Condition in which he was found in the ditch upon the firſt Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>This Tale could get little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit amongſt the Towns-men—who were upon juſt grounds more apt to <hi>abhorr</hi> it than believe it; ſo that not ſucceeding with the <hi>mobile</hi> (as the <hi>People</hi> by the wits of this time are finely termed) it is reſolved that he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to perſons of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er note and influence. And to that purpoſe <hi>Mac-gar</hi> is next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to apply himſelf to a <hi>Great Perſon</hi> then a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> to whom he ſends
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:108904:72"/>
word, that he had ſuch a matter to inform him of concerning this murther. But the other refuſed to have any diſcourſe with him about it, till he had acquainted the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of the <hi>Tower</hi> with it; who upon notice thereof came and Examined <hi>Mac-gar</hi> about what he had to ſay of the buſineſs; he formally relates the Story as aforeſaid: But the <hi>Conſtable of the Tower</hi> judging it to be a matter of too great importance to be ſlightly canvas'd; reſolved to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Privy Council with it, and <hi>Mac-gar</hi> was carryed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them to be Examin'd about the particulars—He there gives in the ſame Information, and obſtinately perſiſts in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting of the truth of it; but that <hi>Honourable</hi> and <hi>Judicious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,</hi> though ſufficiently convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in their own minds of the maliciouſneſs of this Calumny, yet the better to find out the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108904:72"/>
depth of the deſign of it, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the ſaid <hi>Mac-gar</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into a Meſſengers hands, in order to a further Examination at ſuch time as he ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed again to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            <p>While he continued thus in Cuſtody, being conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well of his Crime, as of the likelyhood of its Diſcovery, and the diſgrace that thereupon would fall upon him and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he contrives with himſelf how to acquaint his <hi>Imployers</hi> with his condition, and to deſire their further direction and Aſſiſtance, either to carry on the deſign, or to bring him off (as to what he had already acted) <hi>impunè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe he gets leave of the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> (in whoſe Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he was) to have <hi>Pen, Ink</hi> and <hi>Paper,</hi> in order to writing to one of the <hi>Secretaries</hi> of <hi>State</hi> ſome things that he had in his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:108904:73"/>
mind about the preſent buſineſs; which favour being granted him, he Seals up a Paper directed to one of the <hi>Secretaries</hi> as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but withall, at the ſame time had written a Letter to M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Celliers</hi> the <hi>Popiſh Midwife,</hi> (ſo notoriouſly infamous for her contrivances and actings in the <hi>Popiſh Plot)</hi> acquainting her with his Proceedings, and what kind of ſucceſs he had met with; that if ſhe and the reſt of the Friends that ingaged him in the deſign, would not now ſtand by him, the <hi>Cauſe</hi> muſt periſh and he too.</p>
            <p>The aforeſaid Letter to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,</hi> was but a colour to make way for the paſport of this; ſo having gotten a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the former (which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him) he ſlips the <hi>latter</hi> (directed to M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Celliers)</hi> into his hands, expecting no doubt but it would be delivered, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108904:73"/>
to have a certain return of it.</p>
            <p>But his confidence failed him, for the wary Meſſenger part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowing his Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and knowing what a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Celliers</hi> (to whom the Letter was directed) was; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of carrying it to her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd it to <hi>White-hall</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed by the <hi>Council,</hi> who upon conſideration of the particulars of it, perceiving the Intriegues of the deſign, were reſolved to take it into a more ſtrict Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And to that end Order'd <hi>Mac-gar</hi> (at a time appointed) again to be brought before them; when at firſt taking no notice to him of the ſurprized Letter, they began to Interrogate him about the points of his former Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which he ſtill ſtiffely ſtood to the Juſtification of, ſo far as Lying and Diſſimulation would help him, but at laſt perceiving his Incorrigible Obſtinacy, they

produced the aforeſaid Letter againſt him, the Autography of which he had not then Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough to deny, but by the irreſiſtible Convictions of his now over-powered Conſcience was forced to Confeſs both the Writing of that, and (upon Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions put to him) to Diſcover the whole Deſign; upon what account it was contriv'd, and who were the Contrivers of it; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying all his former Evidence, as falſe and Forged, without any grounds of truth.</p>
            <p>So it pleaſed the Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, alwayes propitious to the Innocent, to detect this new up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart Villany; which if it could have met with any hopeful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, muſt have been both a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond fate to the Reputation of that Martyr'd worthy whom they themſelves had Murther'd, and to the repute of thoſe worthy and honeſt Gentlemen his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;

            <p>Thus we have given you ſome ſhort (yet we hope, not unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory) accounts of the moſt imitable Life and Tragical Death of this <hi>Excellent</hi> perſon; taken off by the hands of his bloody Enemies in the ſix and fiftieth Year of his Age, and in a time of our greateſt expectations from him: Gods Providence Suffer'd it, though wicked men contrived it, and our ſins deſerved it, that he muſt then <hi>dye:</hi> There was ſuch a ſinful neceſſity for it, as was once pronounced by <hi>Caiaphas</hi> againſt the Life of our Redeemer; he was too much a Friend to Religion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:108904:75"/>
and goodneſs, too much an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Irreligious men and their Practices, to be ſuffered to live by ſuch men: had he been leſs good, leſs uſeful, leſs juſt, he might have lived unto this day. But had he lived (they thought) their cauſe muſt have dyed, their Treaſons would not have proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd; they knew he was firm and fixed to his duty; <hi>They could not ſcare him from it, they could not Bribe him, but they could Kill him.
