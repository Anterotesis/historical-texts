         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF
NATHANIEL FIENNES,
Late Colonell and Governour of the

Before a Counſell of VVar held at Saint Albanes,
during nine daies ſpace in December laſt, touching his Coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Vnworthy, and Traitorly ſurrendring of the ſaid City and
Caſtle to the Enemy, before he was necesſitated thereto; not one
of the out-Forts thereof being ſo much as taken,
nor the City or Caſtle walls once battered or aſſaulted
by the Enemies, who beſieged it not full
three whole dayes.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>ATHANIEL FIENNES having unexpectedly, if not ambitiouſly
procured the Government, and moſt cowardly, unworthily quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the poſſeſſion of the famous <hi>City and Caſtle of Briſtoll,</hi> (the
chieſe Magazine and Bulwark in the weſtern parts) by ſurrendring
them beyond all expectation to the enemy, when no waies neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
thereunto, was yet of that tranſcendent boldneſſe as to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this his Ignoble Act; Firſt by a ſolemn premeditated <hi>Speech</hi> in the Houſe of
Commons, after that by a printed Relation, and a Letter to his Excellency; and
the better to evade a Parliamentary Tryall for that fatall Blow he had given to the
whole Kingdome, in the yeelding up of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> (which ſadded the hearts of all,
exaſperated the ſpirits of ſome well-affected to the Parliament and Republique;)
he cunningly deſired in the cloſe of his Speech and Relation,<note n="*" place="margin">Page 13.</note> 
               <hi>that the truth of his
Narration might be examined in a Counſell of Warre, and he either cleared or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:159182:6"/>
thereby:</hi> To which purpoſe he obtained an Order of the ſaid Houſe, when
as yet he had no other Accuſer but his <hi>owne conſcience,</hi> which (if we beleeve the
Proverb) is <hi>a thouſand witneſſe:</hi> This his unexpected audaciouſneſſe to juſtifie
an action ſo univerſally condemned by the ſuffrages of all ſorts of men, provoked
Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> (after ſome diligent inquiry into the truth of this diſguiſed buſineſſe)
in his booke entituled, <hi>Romes Maſter-piece,</hi> (printed by Authority of a Committee
of Parliament) pag. 35. to ſtile that action (formerly cenſured in ſundry printed
Mercuries both at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Oxford) The moſt cowardly and unworthy ſurrender of
Briſtoll, a fit inlet for the Malignant Welch Papiſts, and Iriſh Rebells (lately landed
there in great multitudes) to cut all our throates:</hi> and withall obliged Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> in
point of duty, as a Deputy Lieutenant and Committee of Parliament in thoſe parts,
to publiſh in print, <hi>An Anſwer in confutation of the ſaid Relation,</hi> thereby to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Truth, and let the Parliament ſee, they had not employed ſuch a man as
would palliardiſe Lies, and become a pander unto Falſhood.</p>
            <p>Now had <hi>Fiennes</hi> beyond his expectation gotten two adverſaries whom he muſt
needs ſeemingly call into the Liſt, leſt (before the Counſell of Warre) he might be
thought to fight only with his own ſhadow: preſuming therefore more upon the
ſtrength of his friends then goodneſſe of his Cauſe, he reſolved to make theſe two
Gentlemen the ſubject of his Triumph; he had loſt one victory for his Country,
but would gain another for himſelfe, and lead <hi>Truth</hi> captive; ſhe ſhould have been
the Trophy to his Victory as well as <hi>Briſtoll</hi> was to the Cavalliers, and he ſhould
ſtill be reputed <hi>a Man of Honour:</hi> The better to compaſſe this Conqueſt, the buſines
was projected by him in manner following.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> muſt be privately dealt withall by Mr. <hi>Sprigge,</hi> the Lord <hi>Sayes</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor,
to retract his former Paſſage, as ſcandalous and diſhonourable to Colonell
<hi>Fiennes,</hi> and his <hi>Noble Family,</hi> though neither of them are named or perſonated in
in it; which he refuſed to doe,<note n="*" place="margin">By Mr. <hi>Sprig</hi> Mr. <hi>Beck,</hi> and others.</note> adviſing Col. <hi>Fiennes,</hi> as his friend, to reſt quiet, for
feare he loſt his head, and ſubjected himſelfe to a legall as well as a popular cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
aſſuring him, that if the buſineſſe came to a publike examination, if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
any Law or Martiall Diſcipline, it could not but prove capitall to him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> continuing thus inflexible, proteſting he would never betray the
truth, his Country, or the Honour of the Parliament, which had licenſed his <hi>Maſter-piece,</hi>
to palliate an unworthy action in any his deareſt friends; and Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>
being too ſtout to recant thoſe <hi>Truths</hi> he had publiſhed in his Reply; there was
now no other remedy left this man of Armes to preſerve his Head and Honour
(now at ſtake) but theſe enſuing policies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he endeavours all he could to take off, and diſingage the Parliament from
any avowed publique proſecution and examination of this unworthy ſurrender;
to keepe his Perſon exempted from all reſtraints, to continue himſelfe a Member
of the Houſe, and have free recourſe thereto without the leaſt ſuſpention, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to buoy up his ſunck Reputation, and deterre his Proſecutors from articling,
all Witneſſes from appearing againſt him, remaining ſtill a Member; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by his ſubſequent exceptions to our Impeachment preſented to the Houſe,
as an high breach of Priviledge, equall to that of the five Members.</p>
            <p>Nex, ſince Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> and Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> had loſt the beſt part of their Eſtates in

            <p>This Petition by reaſon of other occaſions, though daily and earneſtly ſollicited,

(though not ſo intended, and Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> his own expreſſion in a paper to Mr. <hi>Pryn;</hi>)
others of them, pretending the <hi>Articles</hi> of Impeachment annexed to the Petition,
were as great a breach of the priviledge of Parliament, as that Impeachment againſt
the five Members (though done only in purſuance of the Colonels owne motions,

to heare this cauſe in a Roome adjoyning to the Town-Hall; Dr <hi>Doreſla</hi>
Judge Advocate of the Army, there demanded of them, whether they had any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Impeachment drawne againſt Colonell <hi>Fiennes?</hi> To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that he being a Member of the Houſe of Commons, they had exhibited their
Articles to that Houſe, who by Order had ſent a Copy of them to his Excellency,
upon which they were to proceed. Which the Advocate thereupon acknowledging,
my Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> Preſident of the Councell of warre, commanded him to read the
ſaid Order and Articles ſent together with it; as ſoone as the Order was read, Mr
<hi>Prynne</hi> tendred a copy of the Articles of impeachment under Mr <hi>Walkers</hi> and his
owne hands, agreeing with thoſe delivered to the Houſe, which he averred they
were there ready to make good in each particular, deſiring the Councell to proceed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:159182:10"/>
upon them, becauſe the other was but a copy which they had not ſubſcribed,
but this they now tendred an originall; which was aſſented to.</p>
            <p>Upon this Dr <hi>Doriſla</hi> the Iudge Advocate was commanded to read the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles;
but Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> then perceiving the doores kept cloſe, contrary to expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and all Perſons, Auditors, but themſelves alone, excluded; and fearing
that by this meanes a doore would be opened to Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> and his party
to miſreport the proceedings of this Triall, as they had done the Relation of
the ſiege and ſurrender of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> before the reading of the Articles made this
requeſt to the Councell, that this hearing might be as publike as the cauſe it ſelfe,
and as that place could afford; the doore ſet open, and none excluded; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe himſelfe and Mr <hi>Walker</hi> (being no chalengers, but chalenged) were
engaged in this Proſecution, not in their own particular intereſts, but the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,
and that by ſpeciall Order of Parliament (the repreſentative body of the

conceived to be a free and open one, agreeable to the proceedings of Parliament
and all other Courts of Iuſtice in the Realme; which ſtand open to all, and
from whence no Auditors are, or ought to be excluded.</p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> oppoſing this motion, in a ſycophanticall way alleadged,
that we ſuſpected the integrity of that Court, as appeared by this requeſt for an
open triall, and our endeavours to appeale therefrom by ſeverall Petitions to the
Parliament, for a triall before the Houſe in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> whereas hee
had caſt himſelfe freely and cleerely upon their Iuſtice (which hee no wayes
ſuſpected) to whom the cognizance of ſuch Cauſes properly belonged; and
therefore deſired the hearing might be private, according to the proceedings
uſed in ſuch Courts. Upon which Dr <hi>Doriſla,</hi> Iudge Advocate, intervening,
told the Proſecutors and Councell, that it was againſt <hi>the ſtile and courſe of
a Court Martiall to be publike</hi> and open: therefore it might not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon any tearms.</p>
            <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replied, that he no wayes diſtruſted the Iuſtice or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of this Honourable Councell, for then he would not have appeared before
them at this place and time to crave Iuſtice from them: That he was a Common
Lawyer, and by his Profeſſion, his late Proteſtation, and <hi>ſolemn Covenant,</hi> bound
to maintain the fundamentall Laws of the Kingdom and Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
That the Members of this <hi>Honourable Councel</hi> as well as himſelf, had not only
taken the like ſolemn Proteſtation and Covenant, but alſo put themſelves in Arms
to maintain and defend the ſaid Laws and Liberties of the Subject to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt:
That by the Lawes and Statutes of the Realme, all Courts of Iuſtice ever
have beene, are, and ought to be held openly and publikely, not cloſe, like a
Cabinet Councell; witneſſe all Courts of Iuſtice at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and elſewhere,
yea all our Aſſizes, Seſſions, wherein men, though indited but for a private Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
Murder, or Treſpaſſe (which nothing neere concerns the Republike ſo
highly as this diſhonourable ſurrender of <hi>Briſtoll</hi>) have alwayes open trialls:
and if ſuch petty Cauſes, then much more this of moſt Generall Concernment
to the whole Realme, recommended to <hi>a faire Triall</hi> by the Parliament it ſelfe,
ought to be as open and publike as poſſible, to ſatisfie both the Parliament and
People; That not only in Courts of Common Law, but in the Admiralty it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:159182:11"/>
ſelfe,<note place="margin">Wee read in Scripture that among the Iewes, the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſate openly in the City gates, the moſt publike place of all.</note> and all other Courts proceeding by the rules either of the Civill or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law, the proceedings have ever beene publike, the Courts open. And even
in late proceedings by martiall Law before a Councell of war, the trials of Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
in <hi>England</hi> have been publike, as appears by the trials of <hi>Yeomans</hi> and <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi>
at <hi>Briſtoll</hi> before Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> himſelf, which were publike; and by the
triall of Mr <hi>Tomkins, Challoner,</hi> and others ſince, before a Councell of warre at
the <hi>Guild hall</hi> of <hi>London</hi> in preſence of both Houſes of Parliament and the whole
City, no Commers being thence excluded. Wherefore this caſe being of
the ſame publike nature, and as much or more concerning the Kingdome as
theirs, ought to receive as publike a triall as theirs did.</p>
            <p>To which <hi>Doriſla</hi> anſwered, that himſelfe proteſted againſt the open triall of
<hi>Tomkins</hi> and <hi>Challoner,</hi> as a breach upon the Councel of wars priviledges; but
was over-ruled therein, to give the Parliament and City content; adding, that all
Councels of warre in forraigne parts were ever private, and ours now uſed not to
be guided by Common or ſtatute Laws, or the courſe of other Courts, but by their
own Orders; and this being a Councell, it was againſt the nature and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of it to be publike.</p>
            <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> rejoyned. Firſt, that there was as great cauſe to give
the Parliament, City, and Kingdome ſatisfaction in this, as in the other fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
caſe, it being of as publike concernment. Next, that we of <hi>England</hi> are
not to be guided by forraigne Lawes or Preſidents, but by our own domeſtick:
That the Common Law, the Statutes of the Realme, and conſtant practiſe of all
our other Courts of Iuſtice, ought to regulate the proceedings of the Councell
of war, not the Councell of wars to repeale and controule them: eſpecially in
an Army which hath taken up armes, and are waged by the Parliament of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to defend the Fundamentall Lawes and Subjects Liberties, not to thwart
them: That it was both againſt the Laws and Subjects Liberty (as he humbly
conceived) to deny any Proſecutor or Subject an open Triall, and thus to
chamber up or reſtraine Iuſtice <hi>intra Privatos Parietes,</hi> in any, much more in
this publike cauſe. That the Judge Advocate could produce no one Preſident
for ſuch a cloſe triall within our Realme in any former age; and therefore hee
ſhould make no ſuch new Preſident now. That all caſes of this nature, touching
the cowardly ſurrendring of Townes and Caſtles, were in former times tried
only in full Parliament, as appeares by the caſes of <hi>Gomines, Weston,</hi> the Biſhop
of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and others; and that upon very good reaſon, ſince caſes which
concern all, are fitteſt to be determined in that Higheſt Court which repreſents
all the Realm. That this Councell of Warre had a double capacity and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
Firſt, as a Councell of Warre only, to deliberate of things neceſſary for
the regulating and managing of Military affairs; and in this regard it ought to be
ſecret in all ſuch debates, and not communicate their councels: but in this capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
wee were not now before it. Secondly, as a Court of Iuſtice, to proceed
criminally againſt Malefactours; and in this reſpect it ought, (as hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved)
to be publike and open to all commers. To put this out of doubt, he
would inſtance only in one example: The high Court of Parliament is both the
<hi>ſupreameſt great generall Councell</hi> for peace and warre, and the <hi>higheſt Court
of Iuſtice</hi> in the Realme: as it is a Councell to conſult, debate, or deliberate of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:159182:11"/>
the Military or Civill Affaires of the Kingdom, ſo it is alwayes private, none but
the Members and Officers of either Houſe being admitted to their conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or debates. But as it is a Court of Juſtice to puniſh Malefactors, ſo the
Proceedings of both or either Houſe are alwayes open and publike, as appeares
by the Late Tryall of the <hi>Earle of Strafford</hi> in <hi>Weſtminister Hall,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
other Preſidents of Antient and preſent times. If then this ſupreameſt
Councell of all others as it is a Court of Iuſtice, ſtands ever open unto all, and the
proceedings of it be alwayes publike, without any infringment of its Priviledges
as a ſupream Councell of Warre and Peace; then certainely this Honourable
Councell of Warre (inferiour to it both in Power and Iuriſdiction) as it is now
a Court of Iuſtice, may and ought to hold their Proceedings and Seſſions Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likly
in this common cauſe, without any violation of its Priviledges as a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.
What therefore the Peeres in Parliament once anſwered the Prelates in a
caſe of <hi>Baſtardy,</hi> hee hoped this Honourable Councell would now anſwer the
Advocate in this caſe of our Impeachment;<note n="*" place="margin">Stat. Merton 20. H. 3. c. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Nolumus leges Angliae mutare, quae

both the Parliament and People, whoſe eyes are fixed on it; elſe if it ſhould be

<hi>London</hi> and the Parliament, being but a <hi>corner</hi>) ſo much exceptions was taken
in the Houſe againſt our Petition. In fine, he alleadged, that Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
who had made ſuch publike profeſſions of his innocency, both before the
<hi>Houſe of Commons, His Excellency,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> in printed <hi>Speeches, Relations,
Letters,</hi> had moſt cauſe to deſire, and leaſt reaſon to decline an open triall, <hi>ſince
Truth and Innocency ſeek no corners:</hi> and his Honour, his Honeſty now openly
charged, could not otherwiſe then openly be diſcharged; no triall being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
enough for him who preſumes his Innocency able to endure, and profeſſeth
a deſire to bring it to the touch, that it may be cleered. And if he ſhould now
decline an open triall, after ſo many publike <hi>Bravadoes</hi> in <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere,
it would draw upon him a juſt ſuſpition of guilt in moſt mens opinions, ſince no
man<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn 3. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>fleeth the light, but he whoſe works are evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this, the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> demanded of Mr <hi>Prynne,</hi> what he meant by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
triall? whether only the reading of the Articles, Anſwers, producing of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and managing the evidence to make good the Articles? or elſe, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
private debates of the cauſe among themſelves after the hearing? To which
<hi>Mr Prynne</hi> replied, that he meant only the former of theſe, the Iudges debates
many times in caſes of difficulty being private after hearings, till they come to
deliver their reſolutions in publique. Hereupon all were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to withdraw;
and then one of the Councell, after a ſhort debate, was ſent to his Excellency to
know his pleaſure, whether the Triall ſhould be publique, as the Proſecutors deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or private? who returned anſwer, that is ſhould bee private; with which
reſolution the Proſecutors (being called in) were acquainted.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> upon this anſwer deſired, that he might put in writing the Reaſons
he had ſuddenly offered to the Councell for an Open Triall, that ſo they might
be preſented to his <hi>Excellency,</hi> for that (as he conceived) he had not been made
acquainted with them, who upon conſideration of them, might happily
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:159182:12"/>
alter his Reſolution. Upon which motion, the Councell ordered the Iudge Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
and <hi>Proſecutors</hi> to repaire to his <hi>Excellency</hi> to acquaint him with the
former Reaſons by word of mouth, which they did very briefly: But the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
informing his <hi>Excellency,</hi> that it was againſt the priviledges of the Councell
that the triall ſhould be open, he anſwered, that he would not infringe the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Councell, whom he thought we ſeemed to diſtruſt by demanding
a publike triall; which diſtruſt we utterly denied, being confident of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
Iuſtice. Upon returne of this Anſwer to the Councell by the Advocate, we
(only as over-ruled herein) choſe rather to ſubmit to a private triall of ſo publike
a cauſe, then to have it reported by <hi>Fiennes</hi> and his maſters of calumny, that we
declined a triall, becauſe we were unable to make good our Impeachment. And
we do freely acknowledge (and ſo muſt Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> himſelfe) that both we and
he had a very full, Patient, Iuditious, Honourable faire hearing (ſcarce paralell
in any Age or time) which continued nine dayes ſpace, when as <hi>Briſtoll</hi>
was loſt in leſſe then three, moſt of the Councell diligently taking notes of what
ever was pertinently alleadged on either ſide.</p>
            <p>The manner of the Triall being thus ſetled, our Articles of Impeachment were
firſt read, and then his Anſwer delivered in writing unto them, which he had
time to prepare from their firſt reading in the Commons Houſe (where he took
a copy of them) till this day of Triall. The <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Anſwer</hi> to them here

2. <hi>Item,</hi> That the ſaid Colonel, ſoone after hee became Governour of the

ſome chiefe Citizens thereof; Namely, Maſter <hi>Yeomans,</hi> Maſter <hi>Butcher,</hi> and

thereof, contrary to his former truſt, promiſes, duty, and the honour of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
moſt diſhonourably, cowardly, and traiterouſly delivered up the ſaid City

without, and againſt the conſent of the Parliament, or his Excellency their

ſaid enemies, both by Land and Sea: and that upon very diſhonourable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
to which hee was no wayes neceſſitated, and had no care to ſee them pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
performed by the enemy, when complaint thereof was made to him for

ſouldiers there.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Item,</hi> That the ſaid Colonell, without the privity or conſent of any generall
Councell of War, did of his own head, ſend out for a parley with the enemy,
when divers Officers and ſouldiers adviſed and perſwaded the contrary, and
would have repulſed the enemies, and defended the ſaid City and Caſtle to the
utmoſt; That the ſurrendering up of the ſame was principally occaſioned by
the earneſt perſwaſion, advice, and cowardice of the ſaid Governour, contray to
his truſt and duty to keepe the ſame: And that the ſaid Governour, when as
the Councell of warre unanimouſly voted upon the parley, that it was neither
ſafe, nor honourable for them to depart the Towne, unleſſe they might march
thence with halfe their Armes at leaſt, and with their Colours; thereupon, after
ſome private conference with Col. <hi>Gerrard,</hi> one of the enemies Commiſſioners,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:159182:13"/>
in the Garden; without the privity, and contrary to the Vote of the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
did make and inſert the laſt Article, that they ſhould leave all their Canon
and Ammunition, with their Armes and colours behinde them, and returning
to them out of the Garden, told them plainly, that they muſt now deliver up
all to the enemy, but what was expreſſed in the Articles he then produced, and
leave their Armes and Colours behind them, to the ſaid Councells and ſouldiers
great diſcontent; And whereas by thoſe very Articles, the ſaid Town and Caſtle
were not to be delivered up till nine of the clocke the next morning, nor the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to enter them, till the ſouldiers, and other Gentlemen were marched out,
the ſaid Governour was ſo over-haſty to ſurrender up the ſame, that hee delivered
them up to the enemy above one houre or more before the houre agreed on; and
ſuffered the enemies to enter and poſſeſſe them before the ſouldiers were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out; whereby many of the ſouldiers were pillaged in the caſtle and towne,
and divers of the Inhabitants beſt affected to the Parliament, plundered before
the houre of ſurrender came, to their great loſſe and undoing.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Item,</hi> That he the ſaid Colonell, during the three dayes ſiege of the ſaid City
and caſtle, did not give any ſuch incouragement to the ſouldiers and Officers
(who bravely defended the ſame, and ſlew neere one thouſand of the enemies beſt
men, by his own<note n="a" place="margin">See p. 7. and his Letter to his Excellency</note> printed Relation, with the loſſe onely of eight perſons) which
much diſcouraged them, as his duty and place required, and they expected; And
that when a ſmall number of the enemies, not two hundered (who gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for loſt,) had entred the Line of Communication at the weakeſt place,
which was worſt guarded, on Wedneſday morning the 26. of Iuly laſt (being
bravely repulſed by the Souldiers with great loſſe in all places elſe;) he the ſaid
Colonell for two houres ſpace or more (during which time no more Enemies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
or approached the ſaid Breach) both neglected and refuſed to command or
incourage the Officers, and Souldiers, who offered to beate them out in due time,
as he was adviſed and preſſed to do by Captain <hi>Bagnall,</hi> Livetenant Colonell
<hi>Dauiſon,</hi> and divers others, who would have undertaken that ſervice; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of incountering the ſaid Enemies (againſt whom the very women offered
to go on with their children to dead the Canon, if the Souldiers were afraid,
rather then the City and Caſtle ſhould be yeelded) called off the Souldiers and
Officers from the Line and Out-works (that the Enemies might the better
enter them without reſiſtance) upon pain of death, much againſt their wills;
who ſhould and would have hindered and repulſed the Enemies; and diſcouraged
and hindered ſuch as were forwards to have cut them off, ſounding a parley when
the Enemies were ſo beaten, that they<note n="b" place="margin">See his own Relation, p. 8.</note> threw down their Armes and cried for
quarter: inſomuch that divers of the Souldiers and Inhabitants, cryed out they
were betrayed, and ſome of the Souldiers brake their Armes in diſcontent, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
they would ſerve the Parliament no more.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Item,</hi> That the ſaid Governour, notwithſtanding his promiſes to defend
the ſaid City and Caſtle, and diſpute it to the laſt, had yet a reall intention to
deliver up the ſame to the Enemies before ever they were beſieged by them, and no
thought at all to defend them to the uttermoſt, or till they might be relieved by
his Excellency, as appeares by the premiſed Articles, by the ſaid Governours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall

to ſend the Priſoners formerly taken out of the ſaid Caſtle, before the Enemy
approached, when moved to it, by Sir <hi>William Waller;</hi> ſaying to him and others,
that he would detain thoſe priſoners ſtill there, to make his owne Conditions
and Compoſition the better with the Enemies, if they came before it; by his
commanding Maſter <hi>Haſſard</hi> the Maſter Gunner there, to lay aſide a Reſerve
of Thirty Barrells of Powder, with Match and Bullet anſwerable, to which
when he was reduced he would then Treat with the Enemy, (which he did long
before he was reduced to this large Reſerve;) by other ſpeeches to the like effect,
And by his moving Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> to depart from Briſtoll, before it was
beſieged, who otherwiſe would have adventured his life in its defence.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi>Item,</hi> That he the ſaid Governour, when he ſurrendred the ſaid Caſtle
to the Enemy, had at leaſt ſixty Barrells of Power therein (beſides what was
in the City and Forts) being above twenty more then were in Glouceſter when
it was firſt beſieged, Five hundred Canon ſhot, fifty great Granadoes, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred weight of Match or more, great ſtore of Musket Bullets, and Tin
to make more, A Match-make, a Bullet-maker, with materialls to make
Match and Bullets, and all manner of proviſions and Victuals, ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
one Thouſand men for three or four moneths ſpace at leaſt, Eleven Canons
therein Mounted, (beſides 44. Canons mounted in the City and Forts;) All
which were ſurrendred to the Eenmy before any battery or aſſault made againſt
the ſaid Caſtle (though he had men more then enough by his own<note n="†" place="margin">Page 9. and his Letter to his Excellency</note> Relation to
defend it) contray to his promiſe made to divers Inhabitants of the ſaid City, beſt
affected to the Parliament, to defend the ſame to the uttermoſt, and to diſpute
every foot thereof with the Enemy, and to keep it, or to lay his bones therein;
who thereupon ſent their Eſtates, with proviſions for them and their families,
for three months ſpace or more, into the ſaid Caſtle, where the ſaid Colonell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to ſecure and defend the ſame, moſt of which their Eſtates, were there
ſeized on by the Enemy to their undoing; by reaſon the ſaid Colonell admitted
the Enemies into the ſaid caſtle, and delivered up the keyes thereof unto them,
before the houre agreed on in the Articles, ſuch was his extraordinary haſte to
quit the ſame.</p>
                        <p>9 <hi>Item,</hi> That the ſaid Colonell, to aggravate this his diſhonourable action,
hath preſumed to juſtifie the ſame, not onely before the Honourable Houſe of
Commons, by word of mouth; but likewiſe before the whole Kingdome and
world in Printed<note n="*" place="margin">Relation p 9. his Letter to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and Reply to Mr <hi>Walker.</hi>

great Blemiſh both upon the Honourable Houſes of Parliament, and his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> their L. General, by publiſhing in Print, that had he man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
held out the ſaid city and caſtle to the laſt, yet he could not have expected
any reliefe from them in ſix or eight weekes ſpace at the leaſt; when as Gloceſter
ſince Beſieged with far greater force then Briſtoll, was yet relieved by them in
leſſe then halfe the time (as Briſtoli doubtleſſe might and would have beene)
and held out a full moneths ſiege or more, as Briſtoll might have done: though he
the ſaid Colonell to add to his former offence, and hinder or anticipate the relief
of Gloceſter, that it might be loſt as Briſtoll was, gave out in ſpeeches to ſome
Members of the houſe of Commons and others, and namely to Maſter <hi>Samuel
Browne,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Iohn Sedgwick,</hi> that he would loſe his head, or be hanged,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:159182:14"/>

                        <p>10 <hi>Item,</hi> That the ſaid city and caſtle were ſo cowardly and unworthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

unto him Col. <hi>Thomas Eſſex,</hi> who at that time commanded a Regiment in that
city, and as hee is well aſſured that his <hi>Excellency</hi> had very good cauſe to ſend
that Order to him, although he knew nothing before it came unto him; ſo hee
did not put it in execution, but upon <hi>mature deliberation and advice with</hi>

for the ſecurity and preſervation of that city, <hi>which in all probabilities could not
otherwiſe at that time have beene ſecured.</hi> And he doth further deny, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
or at any time after, he did ſeek or deſire the Government of that city for
himſelfe: But on the contrary, that he did ſeek and endeavour to be freed from
that employment, and that not in complement, but really, earneſtly, frequently,
as hee is ready to make good by proofe. And laſtly he doth deny, <hi>That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                           <hi>he diſcovered</hi> and defeated a wicked conſpiracy plotted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
divers Inhabitants of the city of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> and ſome of the Officers of

Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and other common Enemies of the Kingdom and Parliament;
and thereupon apprehending and impriſoning divers of the Conſpirators, and
thereby diſappointing the deſign of the Enemy, hee was a meanes under God
at that time of preſerving that city, for which he received publike thanks by a
Letter from both Houſes of Parliament, which he hath to ſhew; and after by
vertue of a Commiſſion from his Excellencie by Order of both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
he called a Councell of Warre, whereof himſelfe was appointed Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the ſaid Commiſſion, and by that Councell of Warre divers of the
Conſpirators after due try all were condemned, and the ſentence of death paſſed
upon them, which ſentence Col. <hi>Fiennss</hi> did forbeare to put in execution till ſuch
time as he had acquainted the Houſe of Parliament, and his Excellencie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,

to a Vote of the Houſe of Commons, hee did execute two of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall

it to the end, had the Souldiers upon their Guards done their parts as well as hee
did, but returning into the Garden with this reſolution, many of his Officers
following him, and it being free for any to enter, openly and before the Mayor
and divers of his Officers, hee began to inſiſt upon his former propoſitions for all
his Armes and Colours; whereupon they yeelded that our Troopers ſhould have
their horſes and ſwords, and then Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> deſcended to the propoſitions of half
Armes and our Colours, but being not able to obtaine it, hee yeelded ſo farre
to the entreaty of the Mayor and Citizens, that hee would not break upon that
point of his own head without the advice of his Officers; and thereupon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
into a room, with all his Officers that were there preſent, he debated the
matter a good while with them, and could not bee brought to yeeld thereunto,
till ſix or ſeven of his Officers came out of the Town and told him, that they
could not get ſix men a piece of their Companies together, and that they ran was

content to yeeld to that condition, for fear of putting our ſelves into a farre worſe
condition; and after calling in the Commiſſioners of the Enemy, we fell to ſet
down all the Articles in writing, there being liberty left to any man to take his
exception upon the penning of them: At which time Captain <hi>Birch</hi> comming in, &amp;
deſiring a more cleare expreſſion for the Citizens and Inhabitants to have liberty

the laſt Article was no new Article inſerted at the latter end, but only a cleere
expreſſion of what was before agreed upon and fully conteyned in the firſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
as by the Article it ſelfe doth appeare. And laſtly, Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> doth deny,
that hee was ſo over-haſty to ſurrender up the Town and Caſtle, that he delivered
them up to the Enemy one houre or more before the time agreed, or that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the Enemy to enter and poſſeſſe them before the Souldiers were marched
out. But on the contrary, that he gave order to all his Officers that came to him
for Orders, to keepe their Souldiers upon their Guards, untill one houre before
we were to March out of the Town; at which time having given order to his
Captaine Lieutenant <hi>Stokes</hi> with his Company to ſtay in the Caſtle, and to keep
it till Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> ſent to demand it, and then to deliver it up unto him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Articles, hee gave order to the reſt of his Officers to draw their men
into the Marſh, whether he did repaire unto them, and about nine of the clock
marched out with the greateſt part of them to the Gate which leadeth to <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
where hee ſtayed within the Town for an houre or two after: <hi>But the
Enemy did enter the Town</hi>
                           <note n="y" place="margin">Through his own default, feare and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</note> 
                           <hi>contrary to their faith, and the Articles agreed upon
an houre or more before nine of the clock, about the time that wee were drawing off
to a Randevous, and fell upon our men, diſarming, diſmounting and pillaging them,

his printed <hi>Relation,</hi> and that the Enemy having entred in one place on wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
morning the 26. of Iuly, were valliantly repulſed in all places elſe with great
loſſe; but doth deny, that to his knowledge any women made any ſuch offer as in
the Articles is expreſſed, or that he ſhould have thought it a fit meanes to dead
the Cannon bullets, or that any ſuch ſpeeches were given out, or any ſuch Actions
done by any Inhabitants or Souldiers to his knowledge, as that they brake their
Armes, and ſaid they were betrayed; or that he would have ſuffered them unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
if he had heard or known any ſuch thing: And for the reſt of the Article
he denyeth it in the whole, and in every part thereof; and on the contray affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and is ready to prove, that during the whole ſiege, hee did bot by his words
and actions encourage the Souldiers and Officers to doe their duty, thanking
ſome, prayſing others, ſtirring up others, ſending them bread, wine, victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
and giving them monyes, and promiſing them further rewards, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
by his owne Example, going conſtantly the round at all houres of the
night, ſometimes in the beginning of the night, and ſometimes in the latter end
thereof, and repairing upon all occaſions to the places of moſt danger, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moſt uſually with his Troop in the place of greateſt danger, and by all other
wayes and meanes that could be expected from any Governour. And he further
affirmeth, that the place where the Enemy entred, was not a likely place for the
Enemy to enter by was weaklieſt aſſaulted; could not have bin better guarded
without drawing forces from other places, which were in more apparent danger
and more ſtrongly aſſaulted, was more ſtrongly guarded then ſome other places

might and ought to have done, and could only well doe it. And he further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes,
that when the Enemy firſt entred they were at the <hi>leaſt two hundred;</hi> that
ſoone after they dug downe the Rampiert of earth all flat for their horſe and

they could, that Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> ſo ſoone we as had notice of the entry of the Enemy

got thether, his men were come<note n="†" place="margin">By his ſpeciall command upon paine of death.</note> off the lines for halfe a mile together, and his

of the City, the ſafe-guard of his Souldiers, and for the repulſing of the
Enemy, but divers of his Souldiers did diſobey, and other of his Souldiers and

as otherwiſe it might have been, and with better ſucceſſe then it was, although
when it was made, it was performed with ſuch reſolution that it gave a ſtop to
the Enemy, who otherwiſe had in all probability entred the reſt of the Town
by force, being already poſſeſt of two of the greateſt Workes thereof; and
Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> did not cauſe any parley to be ſounded till ſuch time as his men were
beaten back again with freſh Regiments of foot and horſe brought down upon
them, but was ſtill ready to have ſeconded them with his own Company, had

                        <p>To the ſeventh, he anſwereth, that notwithſtanding he declared that he could
not keep the Town with the force he had in it, yet hee denyeth that he had a

by them, or that hee had no thought at all to defend it to the uttermoſt, or till it
might be relieved by his Excellency, or that he refuſed to ſend the Priſoners for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
taken out of the Caſtle before the Enemy approched, or that he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Mr <hi>Haſard</hi> the Mr Gunner, to lay aſide a reſerve of thirty barrels of powder
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:159182:17"/>
with a purpoſe to retreat when he was reduced thereunto, or that he moved Sir
<hi>William Waller</hi> to depart from <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> or that Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a dventured his life in its defence; or that it doth appeare by any of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Articles, or any ſpeeches of his concerning the priſoners, or a reſerve of
powder, or Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> departure from <hi>Bristoll,</hi> or any other ſpeeches of
his, that he had not a reall intention to keep the towne and caſtle to the uttermoſt,
that in honour, wiſdome, and faithfulneſſe, unto thoſe by whom he was intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
he ought to have done: but that the contrary doth appeare by very many
deeds and ſpeeches of his, and by thoſe very particulars inſtanced in, ſo far, and
in ſuch a manner as they were ſpoken and done by him. And he further affirmeth
that he did often move Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> to free him from the care and danger
of ſo many priſoners, but could never obtaine it; but when he thought neither
towne nor caſtle ſafe enough to keep them, he ſpake to him to ſend them away to
a place of more ſafety, but neither ſhewed him the meanes how to doe it, nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to take any of the moſt conſiderable with him, although he had an abſolute
command over them at all times, whenſoever he pleaſed to ſignifie his pleaſure
concerning the diſcharge or diſpoſall of them, as he did diſcharge Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Bret,</hi> and divers others (whereof ſome led on thoſe that aſſaulted us at <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll.</hi>)
That <hi>Colonell Fiennes</hi> ſpoke to Sir <hi>Arthur Haſterigge,</hi> when he took leave
of him, to take ſome of the priſoners away with him in the ſhip, but he refuſed
it: that he ſpake to Captaine <hi>Birch</hi> (who ſeemed forward to undertake ſuch a
matter) to ſee if he could find means to ſend them away ſpeedily and ſafely by ſea,
and that he would contribute his beſt aſſiſtance thereunto, but he alſo gave it
over: That he commanded <hi>Hazard</hi> the Maſter Gunner, when the enemy was
approaching the towne, to lay apart a reſerve of thirty barrels of powder, and to
keep it private, that every man might be carefull to husband that which appeared,
and to make no waſte thereof; and that in caſe he was forced to retreat into the
caſtle before he came to treaty, he might have wherewith to defend himſelf: but
Mr <hi>Hazard</hi> did ſo over-doe his command, that though afterward at ſeverall
times he commanded him to give a perfect account of all his Ammunition to his
brother Colonell <hi>John Fiennes,</hi> who was to have the chief care thereof over him,
<hi>yet he did</hi>
                           <note n="a" place="margin">This is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable flory which manifeſts both himſelf, and his brother to be negligent, indiſcreet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, not fit for ſuch a charge: Orrather ſhews that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed their flores from the Councel of war, to induce them to ſurrender the Town upon this miſinformation.</note>

advance towards <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> how he would diſpoſe of himſelfe and his horſe; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that he muſt retreat: And it is evident in many reſpects, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for him to draw out of the towne; for it is moſt likely, that had he not
done it, the town would have been left<note n="a" place="margin">Note what aſperſions be here caſt upon Sir <hi>William.</hi>

and that he was ſo farre from declaring that <hi>Gloceſter</hi> could not hold out three

doe well enough, and hold out till reliefe came to them; but oft he feared they
might be ſtrained therein, as having good cauſe to know it, for had he not ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with 10 barrels of powder, and had they not had two or three more out
of <hi>Barckly</hi> caſtle, which he ſent thither but a week or two before, the towne had

<hi>Bristoll,</hi> and publiſhed in print to all the World in publike: But ſince he denied
theſe particulars, he would eaſily make them good againſt him.</p>
                           <p>For the firſt, it is cleare that Colonell <hi>Eſſex</hi> was both acknowledged and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, that the made out his Warrants, commands, and ordered all things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
for the cities defence and fortification, as Governour, having the command in
chiefe of the citie, caſtle, forces there, as abſolutely as any Governour whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, that in the booke, intituled, <hi>A full Declaration of</hi> Colonell Fiennes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                              <hi>his march to, and proceedings at</hi> Briſtoll, compiled and publiſhed by himſelfe, or

is both acknowledged and ſtiled <hi>Governour of Bristoll,</hi> and that by himſelfe in his
owne printed Letter to his Father to juſtifie his removall, and the depoſitions
which he took and publiſhed againſt him, atteſt him to be Governour: therefore
he muſt even bluſh to deny all theſe pregnant evidences, and to put us thus to
prove that only now, which he ever confeſſed before.</p>
                           <p>Whereupon Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> much appalled, ſaid in a ſhuffling manner, <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
he was a Governour</hi> de facto, <hi>but not</hi> de jure.</p>
                           <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replied, Firſt, that he was ſent thither, and placed there,
by his Excellencies ſpeciall command, and the Parliaments approbation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was as much Governour <hi>de jure</hi> as himſelfe or any other. Secondly, that
he was obeyed as a rightfull Governour till he ſent him thence, and ſo eſteemed
by the Parliament, his Excellency, the Garriſon, City, and Committee. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if he was not Governour <hi>de jure,</hi> then all his commands and acts there done,
during his government, were injurious, unwarrantable, which he preſumed the
Defendant durſt not affirme.</p>
                           <p>Then he replyed, that Colonell <hi>Eſſex</hi> had no commiſſion, and therefore was
no rightfull Governour.</p>
                           <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> rejoined, Firſt, that for ought he knew he had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
Secondly, that his Excellencies ſending of him thither, to take in, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the citie, and his confirming him there as Governour, with the Parliaments
conſent, was a commiſſion ſufficient to make him Governour <hi>de jure.</hi> Thirdly,
that if his Excellency commanded an Officer by word of mouth alone, without a
commiſſion under ſeale, to lead any Brigade out upon ſervice, or to take in any
towne or caſtle, (as he had lately commanded Major <hi>Skippon</hi> to take in and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:159182:20"/>
                              <hi>Newport-pannell</hi>) this was Warrant enough to make him Governour both
of the Brigade, Towne, Fort; and if he ſhould betray, or baſely deliver up that
Brigade, Towne, or Fort, when taken in, he ſhould be condemned for it by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
Law as a Traitor, and the want of a commiſſion would be no excuſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
him from being a Governour, and betraying his truſt.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> that he removed and ſent away Colonell <hi>Eſſex</hi> from <hi>Briſtoll.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Mr</hi> Prynne <hi>proved it, firſt, by his owne printed Letter, and the depoſitions
publiſhed by his direction, in</hi> A full Relation, <hi>&amp;c. page. 4 6, 11, 12. where he
uſeth theſe expreſsions: Colonell</hi> Fiennes (<hi>writes his Major</hi> Langriſh) who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
unto me an order that he had received from his Excellency, whereby he
was enjoyned to ſend <hi>Colonell Eſſex</hi> to <hi>Windſor,</hi> or the Parliament, in caſe<note n="*" place="margin">Nota.</note> he
ſaw cauſe for it; and having given me reaſons, to ſee and know that there was cauſe
ſo to doe, he asked me, whether I would aſſiſt him in the executions of it or no? the
which ſeeing cauſe for, I promiſed to doe. But it will be neceſſary here to annexe
the reaſons that cauſed <hi>Colonell Fiennes</hi> to put in execution the Order given him
by my Lord Generall, to ſend up <hi>Colonell Eſſex</hi> from <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> not as an accuſation
againſt <hi>Colonell Eſſex</hi> in this place, (let that be followed by thoſe to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains,)
but by way of vindication of <hi>Colonell Fiennes,</hi> that he had done nothing
herein, but what the truſt repoſed in him, and the ſafety of that important place did
require him; and that the rather, becauſe it begins ſo far to reflect upon <hi>Colonell
Fiennes,</hi> as if he had done him injury, and there had been no plot at all, but a plot to
put himſelfe in the Governours place. The Malignants in the Towne taking up
this, and ſpreading it, and adding ſtrength to it by <hi>Colonell Eſſex</hi> his own ſpeeches
and carriages, it will be a great injuſtice to him, who hath done his duty, and
therein no inconſiderable ſervices, to be requited with calumny, <hi>&amp;c. Beſides,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
Fiennes <hi>writes thus in a printed Letter to his Father:</hi> My Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſent a
Letter long enough, and full enough of particulars, concerning <hi>Colonell Eſſex,</hi> and
which I thinke were ſufficient to ſatisfie any man, that it was neceſſary be ſhould be
removed from hence, before the Towne could be put in any poſſibility of ſecurity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had not been touched in the point of his fidelity; his being here,<note n="*" place="margin">Nota.</note> I found
inconſiſtent with the good and ſafety of this city; and though there were no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
proofe-of his falſhood, which I never affirmed, yet there were ſhrewd grounds
of jealouſie, as may appeare by the depoſitions, whereof I have ſent your Lordſhip a
copy together with this Letter. For my part, ſo my Lord Generall and the World
be ſatisfied, that<note n="*" place="margin">Nota.</note> I had good reaſon to ſend him away from hence, according to his
direction, I would not have things proſecuted too hard againſt him, although I am
very much deceived if many a Governour of a Towne hath not been called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
in point of his Fidelity, upon weaker grounds then thoſe that I have ſent.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, by his owne expreſſe conſeſſion, in the letter end of his <hi>Anſwer to
the ſecond Article,</hi> though he denies it in the beginning, that he did it not upon
any <hi>pretended cauſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To the third, <hi>That himſelfe was never Governour of Briſtoll,</hi> Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That it ſeemed he had carried himſelfe ſo diſhonourably in that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he was now aſhamed or afraid to confeſſe himſelfe Governour, for
ſearche ſhould ſuffer for it, elſe he could not have the impudence to deny it. But
ſince he thus denied himſelfe Governour, he would quickly prove him ſo.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="31" facs="tcp:159182:20"/>
Firſt, by his owne Warrants during his Government, wherein he ſtiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                              <hi>Governour of Bristoll.</hi> Secondly, by his acceptance of that title from his
<hi>Officers, Souldiers,</hi> the <hi>Committee,</hi> and all others. Thirdly, by the Parliaments,
his Excellencies, and owne Fathers entituling of him, <hi>Governour of Briſtoll,</hi> in
their Letters and directions to him. Fourthly, by his exerciſing all the authority,
and receiving the pay of a Governour. Fiftly, by the full <hi>Declaration</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his March to <hi>Bristoll,</hi> ſet forth by his <hi>Major Langriſh,</hi> who in his Letter
from <hi>Briſtoll, March 6. 1643. pag.</hi> 3, 4, 6. ſtiles <hi>Colonell Fiennes, Our Governour,</hi>
and, <hi>Now Governour of Briſtoll,</hi> three ſeverall times, long before he had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to be Governour there. Sixthly, <hi>by his owne draught of an Ordinance
preſented to the Houſe of Commons by the Lord</hi> Say, for the ſettling of a ſufficient
<hi>Garriſon at Briſtoll,</hi> printed by himſelfe in his <hi>Relation made to the Houſe of
Commons concerning the ſurrender of the City of Briſtoll, pag. 17 to</hi> 22. in which
we finde this Gentleman no leſſe then eight ſeverall times expreſly ſtiled, <hi>Colonell
Fiennes Governour of Briſtoll:</hi> And are you not aſhamed ſo confidently to deny
that here in the preſence of this honourable Councell, which your ſelfe have ſo
lately publiſhed to all the world? <hi>Oportet mendancem eſſe memorem.</hi> Seventhly,
in the very Articles of the ſurrender of the city and caſtle of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to the enemy
he intitled himſelf <hi>Governour,</hi> witneſſe the title of them: <hi>Articles agreed on at the
City of</hi> Briſtoll, <hi>between Colonell</hi> Nathaniell Fiennes <hi>GOVERNOUR of
the ſaid city on the one party, and Colonell</hi> Charles Gerard <hi>and Captain</hi> William
Teringham, <hi>for, and on the behalfe of Prince</hi> Rupert, <hi>on the other party, Iuly</hi> 26.
1643. And Article 1. <hi>That the Governour Colonell</hi> Nathaniel Fiennes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Certainly if he were not Governour before to keep, yet theſe very Articles prove
he was then Governour to ſurrender it. And now (Sir) take your choice; If you
were not Governour, then you had no power to treat or ſurrender the City or
caſtle, and ſo muſt be condemned (by your owne confeſsion) as a betrayer of
them: If you were Governour of them then, you ſhew your ſelfe moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
your birth and breeding in denying it now; eſpecially ſince you have given
an account in a printed <hi>Relation,</hi> of your proceedings and ſurrender of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi>
which is in Law a confeſsion of this truſt. To conclude, his <hi>Excellencies</hi> owne
Proclamation, poſted up at <hi>Westminſter</hi> by the Defendants procurement, and
ſummoning us to give information againſt him, doth no leſſe then three ſeverall
times together ſtile him, Colonell <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes late Governour of Briſtoll:</hi>
and therefore eternally concludes him to deny it.</p>
                           <p>The Colonell confounded with theſe unanſwerable ARguments, (which Mr
<hi>Prynne</hi> informed the Councell he preſſed the more earneſtly, becauſe his <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourſhip
of Briſtoll,</hi> was the foundation of the impeachment, which would fall to
the ground if not fully proved,) confeſſed at laſt, <hi>that he was Governour of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll,</hi>
all the Councell exceedingly wondring, and ſeeming aſhamed of him, that
he denied it ſo ſtiffely, till thus neceſsitated to acknowledge it: yet forgetting
himſelf, through feare or guiltineſſe, he ſoon after denied againe twice or thrice
over, <hi>that he was Governour,</hi> till he was forced to a new confeſsor.</p>
                           <p>Being thus driven from theſe ſhamefull ſhifes, he next denied in the fourth
place,</p>
                           <p>That he was ever Governour of the Caſtle of Bristoll,<note place="margin">Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> his 4. and 5. evaſions</note> though he was of the

                           <p>To the firſt whereof Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replied,<note place="margin">

<hi>Iohn Fienne,</hi> as commander in chiefe, and all other Officers under him, in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Caſtle. Thirdly, that he onely gave order for the fortifying, victualing, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoning
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of it. Fourthly, that he laid up the Stores and Magazines of the City
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> there, diſpoſed of all the Lodgings in it, intending to make it the place of his laſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> retreat: therefore certainly he was Governour of it. Fifthly, that though <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll</hi>

and being no part of the Citie, yet ſince Queen <hi>Annes</hi> entertainment at
<hi>Bristoll,</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> at her requeſt gave and united the Caſtle to the Citie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it part thereof, and ſo it continueth to this day: Wherefore ſince he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
he was Governour of the Citie, he muſt neceſſarily be Governour of the
Caſtle too, it being now parcell of the City, and having no other Governour
that had charge of it in chiefe but himſelfe alone, and his brother under him.</p>
                           <p>To this the Defendant in the ſixth place replied,<note place="margin">Col. Fiennes <hi>ſixth evaſion.</hi>
                              </note> that he had no charge of it as

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> needs have the Government of it as a Fort, not as a houſe. Secondly, himſelfe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> eſteemed it the ſtrongeſt Fort in and about the Citie, beſtowed much coſt in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
it, laid up his Magazines in it, kept a ſpeciall Garriſon there, made it the

                              <note place="margin">Evaſion 7.</note> Fiennes <hi>replied,</hi> That the Castle was not mentioned in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,

                           <p>Which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> preſently laying hold of,<note place="margin">The Reply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> rejoined: Firſt, my Lords, we have
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> now a cleare confeſsion that Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> had a commiſsion to be Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> the fifth thing he even now denied. Secondly, though the
Caſtle be not particularly named as a Fort in his Commiſsion, yet this will not
help him, for it is therein included as part of <hi>Briſtoll.</hi> This I ſhall undeniably
evidence by a caſe or two: Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> by virtue of his Commiſsion hath
built ſeverall Forts and Sconces about <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> without, not within the Cities li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
though adjoining to it, as we have done the like about <hi>London;</hi> theſe Forts
are properly no part of the City, as the caſtle is, nor are they mentioned or inc'u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within his commiſsion, being built for the moſt part ſince the commiſsion
granted; yet no man will doubt but if Colonell <hi>Fiennes,</hi> or any other Officer, had
treacherouſly or cowardly delivered up any of theſe Out forts to the enemy,
though no part of the City, it had been Treaſon in him, and he ſhould have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for it: So had he in like manner yeelded up or betrayed any one houſe in
the city or caſtle, were it fortified or not fortified, to the loſſe or hazzard of the
city, it had been treaſon by the Lawes of War, many cities and caſtles having
been loſt, betrayed by the loſſe or yeelding of one houſe or poſterne; much more
then muſt he ſuffer for ſurrendring ſuch a conſiderable Fort as <hi>Briſtoll</hi> caſtle to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:159182:21"/>
the Enemy, without any battery, aſſault, or neceſsity, though he found it not
ſpecified in his Commiſsion, which extends to the whole City, and ſo to every
houſe, Fort, and parcell of it, though not particularly mentioned in it.</p>
                           <p>The Colonell,<note place="margin">Evaſion 8. The Reply thereto.</note> thus forced from all theſe feeble ſhifts, with much diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
retyred to this falſe poſtern to make an eſcape, <hi>That hee had no Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to be Governour of</hi> Briſtol, <hi>and by conſequence was not Governour of it.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replied: Firſt, That ſince hee undertook the Charge of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the Town and Caſtle, as Governour, it mattered not much whether he had a
Commiſsion or not; for he writ, and carried himſelfe as Governour, even from
the ſending away of Col. <hi>Eſſex,</hi> till the ſurrender of the Town and Caſtle, which
he ſurrendred as Governour.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That himſelfe had formerly unawares confeſſed, that hee had a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Commiſsion to be Governour, and that he was ſtiled Governour by <hi>Langriſh</hi>
and others even in<note n="a" place="margin">A full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>p.</hi> 4. 5. 6.</note>

                           <p>Thirdly, he ſhould prove hereafter, that himſelfe ſent one Captaine <hi>Bagnall</hi>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

Commiſsion,</hi> from his Excellency that ſo hee and his Garriſon might not bee
ſubject to Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> commands, (which Captaine <hi>Bagnall</hi> afterwards
atteſted upon Oath, &amp; that he ſpent ſixteen pounds in theſe two Journies, to obtain
this Commiſsion, which the Colonell out of his liberallity never yet paid him)
and the Colonell himſelfe confeſſed afterwards to the Councell upon <hi>Bagnals</hi>
teſtimony, he ſent for and received <hi>an Independent Commiſsion;</hi> that ſo <hi>he and
his Garriſon Souldiers might not bee liable to Sir</hi> William Wallers <hi>commands, as
they formerly were.</hi>

                           <p>
                              <hi>The Colonell thus entangled and caught in his own ſnare,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Evaſion 9.</note> 
                              <hi>thought to help
himſelfe at a dead lift with an abſurd diſtinction; and hereupon told the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi>
That he ſent for this Commiſſion, not to Guard the City againſt the Enemy as
Governour of it, but only to keep his Souldiers in order, who when they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on any ſervice grew mutinous, and would ſtill be calling on him to ſee his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
for which he gave an inſtance in Col. Pophams Regiment; who diſobeyed him
when they returned from the taking of Sherborne: <hi>And this made him to ſend for a</hi>
Commiſſion, only to order his Souldiers, and keep them in obedience; but he never had
not ſent for any Commiſſion to keep the Town or Caſtle.</p>
                           <p>To which M. <hi>Prynne</hi> Replyed,<note place="margin">The Reply thereto.</note> That this was the moſt abſurd, irrationall, if
not unſoldierly diſtinction, that ever was heard of in the world, and that hee
might bee aſhamed to propound it before Souldiers in ſuch an honourable
Councell of Warre as this: for what need was there either of a Garriſon or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> or of ſuch a Commiſſion to keep his Souldiers there in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and order, but only to preſerve the City? This was the only end why
he and his Garriſon were there placed, maintained by the Parliament and his
Excellency to keep the City, which elſe would have as well or better kept it
ſelfe without them.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That hee was confident his <hi>Excellency</hi> never granted any ſuch
Commiſſion to any Governour (nor any other Prince or Generall in the world)
only to keep his Garriſon in order, but not to defend the Garriſoned place,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:159182:22"/>
whereof hee was Governour; ſuch an abſurd Commiſſion was never yet heard
of, nor ſuch a nonſence diſtinction made by any Souldier, and thereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the Commiſſion might bee produced, to the end it might appeare, whether
it warranted this diſtiction, That it was only to diſcipline his Souldiers, but
not to hold the Town <hi>againſt</hi> the Enemy.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, That their Lordſhips now ſaw, the true reaſon why Col. <hi>Fiennes,</hi> ſo
ſoone delivered up <hi>Bristol</hi> to the Enemy: he pleads, he had, (or would have) no
Commiſſion to keep it, therefore it was he thus ſurrendred it up to the Enemies
almoſt as ſoone as they came before it: who doubtleſſe would keep it better,
defend it longer then he, though they wanted a Commiſſion for it.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, That this pretended diſobedience of Col. <hi>Pophams</hi> Regiment was
long after his Commiſſion received, and that upon this occaſion: Col. <hi>Fiennes,</hi> and
his cowardly plundring Major <hi>Langriſh,</hi> would have taken from Col. <hi>Pophams</hi>
Regiment that little plunder they had gained at <hi>Sherburn,</hi> with the hazard of
their lives, at the Countreys charge without any direction from <hi>Fiennes,</hi> who
ſent them not on that ſervice: which injurious avaritious act of his, they juſtly
oppoſed by ſtanding on their guard, and ſo kept that booty he would have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
from them into <hi>Briſtol</hi> Caſtle. This occaſion then being ſubſequent to his
Commiſſion could not bee the ground of its procuring, but rather that which
himſelfe unawares confeſſed; his deſire of <hi>independency</hi> and exemption from Sir
<hi>William Wallers</hi> commands.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The Colonell thus drive to the wall and worſted on every hand,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Evaſion 11.</note> 
                              <hi>uſed two
pleas more for his laſt reſerve; Firſt,</hi> That hee received his Commiſſion only
upon this condition and with this intention, to keep his Souldiers in order, but not
to make good the Town and Caſtle: therefore he could be no further chargeable by
it then as hee received it.</p>
                           <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replyed:<note place="margin">The Reply thereto.</note> Firſt, That every Governour muſt receive his
Commiſſion at his perill, as it is granted and intended by him that granted it,
(as Tenants doe their Leaſes, and Donces in taile their Lands) and hath no
power to annex any conditions thereunto: his Commiſsion then being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
<hi>to keep the Town for the Parliament,</hi> that being the ſole uſe, and end thereof,
his conditionall accepting of it being repugnant to it, was voyd and idle.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, that the<note n="a" place="margin">Littleton, ſect. 378. 379. <hi>See</hi> Cookes <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes on it,</hi> fol, 232, 233. 234.</note> 
                              <hi>Common</hi> and Martiall Law of the Realme annex this
condition to every Governour and Officer of truſt, that he ought to diſcharge
his truſt and Government, and keep that ſafe which is committed to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody
to his utmoſt power, though it bee not expreſſed in his Commiſſion; And
therefore it pretended conditionall acceptance, directly againſt his truſt and
Government, was moſt ridiculous.</p>
                           <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Evaſion 12.</note> he alledged, <hi>That he never ſought after the Governouſhip of</hi> Briſtoll,
but really deſired not to accept it, and to be acquitted from it: to which end hee
produced and read divers Letters of his own to the Lord <hi>Say</hi> his Father, and
one or two to his <hi>Excellency,</hi> which took up neare two houres time in reading,
and tyred all the Councell, who with much patience heard them, all read, though
Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> to husband time, excepted againſt them, as no evidence at all, nor
ſitting to be read: And in the reading of theſe Letters, the Colonell caſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the Councell to obſerve, that many of them were written before he had his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:159182:22"/>
Commiſſion for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which was not till the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1643.</p>
                           <p>This Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> taking preſent hold of, deſired their Lordſhips in the firſt
place to obſerve, his voluntary confeſſion with a ſpeciall <hi>Nota,</hi> of that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which at firſt he ſo obſtinately denyed.</p>
                           <p>To theſe Letters read (many of them being printed with his <hi>Relation</hi>) Mr
<hi>Prynne</hi> gave theſe ſhort Anſwers:</p>
                           <p>Firſt, That all theſe Letters were either his own or his Fathers, and not above <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
two or three of them proved true Coppies, and that by Mr <hi>Sprig</hi> the Lord <hi>Say</hi>'s
Secretary; Therefore no evidence at all to juſtifie or excuſe him, himſelfe and his
own Letters being no compotent witneſſes in his own cauſe; and his Father but
<hi>tests Domeſticus</hi> at the beſt, if preſent.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That the ſubſtance of the chiefe Letter to his <hi>Excellency,</hi> was only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
a modeſt excuſe of his own inſufficiency for that charge; a common complement
in every ingenious mans mouth, that is preferred to any great place of truſt:
who in words at leaſt pretends inſufficiency for that place which he perchance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:
juſt like our Biſhops uſuall anſwer, <hi>Nole, nolo,</hi> to <hi>vis Epiſcopari?</hi> now uſed
as a formality, for faſhions ſake only, even when they come to be conſecrated;
when in truth they make all the friends and meanes they can to compaſſe that
Biſhopprick, which for faſhion ſake (out of a diſſembling modeſty) they pretend,
and twice together anſwer ſolemnly (when demanded openly before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation)
that they deſire by no meanes to accept of: Therefore this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his can bee no proofe, that he was unwilling to undertake this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
ſince his ſubſequent acceptance and actions diſprove this pretended
refuſall.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, he obſerved, that in one of his Letters dated the 4 of <hi>April,</hi> he writ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
earneſtly to his Father, <hi>To procure and ſend him his Commiſſion:</hi> Therefore he was
ſo farre from refuſing, that he ſought the Government, and ſent Captain <hi>Bagnall</hi>
twice to his Excellency to procure his Commiſſion, as was after atteſted upon
Oath.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, That by divers of his Letters then read it clearly appeard, himſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
was the chiefe informer againſt Col. <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and the chiefe Actor in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall,
to intrude himſelfe into his place; ſo that wee had now his own hand
againſt his words and Anſwer.</p>
                           <p>Fiftly, that the ſcope of all his Letters was only to complain and cry out to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Parliament for more moneys from <hi>London,</hi> or to get more Authority to raiſe
moneys in the Countrey, to pay the Garriſon, without which moneys he writ, he
could not long hold the Town; But there is not one clauſe in all the Letters, that
he wanted Armes, Ammunition, powder, men, proviſion, or that the Town or
Caſtle was not tenable: If then he complained only of default of moneys, with
which if hee were furniſhed, hee made no doubt of keeping the Town; and it
is cleare he loſt not the Town for want of money (for he hath not hetherto either
in his printed <hi>Relation,</hi> Letters, or anſwer, affirmed, that hee ſurrendred the City
or Caſtle for want of money,) then by his own confeſſion, hee muſt ſurrender
them either out of treachery or cowardize, they being tenable, and furniſhed
will all other neceſſaries for a ſiege but money.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, He obſerved that Col <hi>Fiennes</hi> did never refuſe the place of Governour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
                              <pb n="36" facs="tcp:159182:23"/>
as he ſhould have done had he been unwilling or unable to diſcharge it; That his
importunity to quit, it, in caſe he could get no money, was with no intent to
leave the place, but only to haſten the ſupply of moneys, it being the argument
and retorick of moſt other Commanders in their Letters to the Parliament, to
cry out for moneys, elſe all would ſoon be loſt, and they muſt disband.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, That hee took on him the power and place of a Governour long
before he had a Commiſſion, that hee drew and ſent out Ordinances to paſſe the
Houſe to enlarge his power and territories for twenty miles ſpace round <hi>Briſtoll,</hi>
and to ſettle himſelfe in an abſolute Government there. That he both earneſtly
writ and ſent up twice to his Excellency for a Commiſsion by a ſpeciall Agent,
that ſo he might be <hi>Independant;</hi> that hee accepted of the Commiſsion when it
came, <hi>Yet never acquanted the City or Committee of Parliament with it,</hi> doing all
things in a high imperious manner for the moſt part, of his own head, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their privity or adviſe, That hee held his Commiſsion without ſurrendring
it till hee ſurrendred the Town and Caſtle to the Enemy, ſo unwilling was hee
to depart with his Governorſhip. From all which he concluded, it was apparent
he was ſo farre from refuſing, that he did ambitiouſly affect, if not injuriouſly
uſurp this Government for his own private luchre, to the prejudice of the
former Governour, and irreparable dammage of the whole Realm.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>In fine,</hi>

                              <hi>Col.</hi> Fiennes <hi>deſired Mr</hi> Prynne <hi>to prove: Firſt,</hi> That he ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to his Excellency or the Parliament to make good the City or Caſtle, and not
to ſurrender the ſame to the Enemy without their conſents: <hi>Which hee thrice
denyed in his anſwer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered:<note place="margin">The Reply.</note> That the very Law it ſelfe and common reaſon
informes us, that every Governour of a Town, or Fort is to make them good, and
not to ſurrender them, to the Enemy without the conſent of thoſe who committed
their cuſtody to them, elſe very Governour might betray his truſt at pleaſure;
This therefore being a condition in Law annexed to all Governours and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and he confeſsing himſelfe to be Governour, (and that by a Commiſsion
which no doubt enjoyned him to make good and keep the place in manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid)
needs no other proofe at all; the Law reſolves it, and therefore none
muſt doubt or contradict it.</p>
                           <p>With this debate the proofe of the firſt Article was concluded.</p>

had formerly uſed this kinde of proceeding in the caſe of Col. <hi>Eſſex,</hi> againſt
whom he had not only taken, but printed divers paper teſtimonies in things which
might have proved capitall if the proofe had been full. That himſelfe in this very
caſe had ſued forth a Commiſsion to examine Witneſſes on his behalf, without our
privity, before we took forth any Commiſsion, who did but imitate him therein,
and that by the Iudge, Advocates own adviſe, who directed us to this courſe,
which hee affirmed to be both Legall and uſuall: That in the Civill-Law (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in Courts Martiall) tryalls were as uſuall <hi>Teſtimoniis,</hi> as <hi>Teſtibus viva
voce:</hi> That in the <hi>Admirality,</hi> (a Civill Law Court) as likewiſe in the <hi>Chancery,
Star-Chamber</hi> and Engliſh Courts, formed after the Civill Law, they proceed
uſually by way of Depoſition: That even at the Common Law in ſome caſes,
Depoſitions taken before the Coroner, and Examinations upon Oath before the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:159182:24"/>
chiefe Iuſtice, or other Iuſtices, are uſually given in evidence even in capitall
crime: That the high Court of Parliament hath upon juſt occaſion allowed of
Paper-depoſitions in ſuch caſes: That in all Courts Martiall, both in <hi>England</hi>
and elſewhere, they have been conſtantly allowed, and particularly in the late
famous caſe of <hi>Tomkins, Chaloner,</hi> and other <hi>London. Conſpirators,</hi> whoſe Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
were read, and given in as evidence one againſt the other; upon which
they were condemned and executed. Beſides, there was both very great reaſon
and neceſſity that ſuch Depoſitions ſhould be admitted in this caſe, and in all
Martiall proceedings of this nature, becauſe divers of our materiall Witneſſes,
being Officers or Souldiers now in actuall ſervice, and diſperſed upon ſeverall
occaſions into divers Brigades, and parts of the Kingdome remote from Saint <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi>
could not without great danger, diſ-ſervice to the State, inconvenience to
themſelves, and exceſſive coſts to us, (who had loſt our eſtates, and proſecuted
onely for the publike on our owne expences) be drawn together perſonally to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this Triall, which had been ſo frequently adjourned, not onely from week
to week, but place to place: That we ſeverall times petitioned both the <hi>Commons
Houſe</hi> and his <hi>Excellencie,</hi> that the Councell appointed for this Tryall might be
held at a certaine day and place, within <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> before our Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
were diſperſed, and where we could with leſſe trouble and expence to our
ſelves and them, have produced all or moſt of them <hi>viva voce;</hi> but yet we could
not (through the Defendants procurement, as we conceive) obtaine this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
requeſt: Therefore himſelfe being both the cauſe and preſident of theſe our
<hi>Depoſitions,</hi> and of removing the Triall to this place, for our greater incommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and expence, <hi>ought not to take advantage of his owne wrong,</hi> againſt a Maxime
of Law, the conſtant practice of the Court Martiall, and his owne leading exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which we did but imitate. Which point the Councell (cauſing us to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw)
did upon ſolemne debate among themſelves clearly over-rule againſt the
Defendant, upon the premiſed Reaſons.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond Exception,<note place="margin">Anſwer 2.</note> concerning Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
proteſted for himſelfe to the Councell, that it was a moſt falſe and maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſlander; That neither Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> nor his <hi>Ladie,</hi> nor any other in
their behalfe, did ever directly or indirectly excite, adviſe, or encourage him in
this proſecution; that the Delinquent himſelf was the onely man who unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
put himſelfe upon this Triall, as appeares moſt evidently to all the World
by the cloſe of his printed Relation in the Parliament Houſe, where Pag. 13. <hi>he
deſires the Houſe of Commons, that they would be pleaſed to let the truth of what he
had then affirmed to them (concerning the ſurrender of Briſtol) be examined at a
Councell of Warre, that ſo he might be cleared or condemned as they ſhould finde the
truth of falſhood of what he had delivered;</hi> By <hi>his and his Officers Petition to his
Excellencie,</hi> and his <hi>Excellencies Proclamation</hi> upon their Petition, poſted up at
<hi>Westminſter</hi> and the <hi>Exchange,</hi> wherein he ſummoned Mr <hi>Walker</hi> and Mr <hi>Prynne</hi>
by name, in the moſt publike manner that might be, and after that by private
Notes, and ſundry other publike Adjournments, to be his Proſecutors: Which
thankleſſe office he was not altogether unwilling to undertake, when thus open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaged by the Defendant, not out of any private malice to the Delinquent,
whom he formerly honoured, and to whom he never bore any particular ſpleen,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:159182:24"/>
having never received the leaſt injury from him; much leſſe out of any degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
reſpects, inſtrumentally to wrecke the private malice or revenge of any
others upon him, (it being below his ſpirit, and moſt averſe to this <hi>genius,</hi> his
conſcience, to be ſubſervient or inſtrumentall to any mans malice or revenge
whatſoever,) but meerly out of a reall deſire to doe his Countrey faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and vindicate the truth of this unworthy ſtate-ruining Action, under
which the whole Kingdome now lay languiſhing, from thoſe falſe diſguiſes
which the Defendant in ſundry printed Papers had obtruded on the World, to
ſalve his owne irreparable diſhonour. The proſecution therefore proceeding
thus meerly from himſelfe, as all the premiſes infallibly demonſtrate, he had
laid a moſt ſcandalous imputation upon Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> (a noble well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Gentleman then abſent,) and on himſelf, in the forementioned exception,
for which he demanded juſtice againſt him from that honourable Councell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he could make good this calumny, for which he was moſt certaine the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
had not the leaſt ſhadow of proofe, the teſtimony of <hi>Dowet</hi> (the ground
of this aſperſion) referring not to him, but onely to Mr <hi>Walkers Relation,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
long before any Impeachment of, or proſecution againſt the Defendant:
which charge Mr <hi>Walker</hi> himſelfe there preſent, was ready to anſwer as to
that particular.</p>
               <p>Hereupon Mr <hi>Walker</hi> informed the Councell, that he acknowledged in the
<hi>Epiſtle to his Anſwer to the Defendants Relation, that it was but a collection out
of the ſeverall reports of divers Gentlemen and Commanders in that ſervice, before
and whom</hi> Briſtoll <hi>was beſieged:</hi> which when he had drawn up, having occaſion
to goe to <hi>Southampton,</hi> he left it in the hand of a friend, deſiring him to ſhow it
to whomſoever he ſhould think fit, (and eſpecially to thoſe Gentlemen out of
whoſe mouths he compiled it) to ſee if he had hit their ſenſe aright; and that this
party (as hee was ſince informed) ſhewed it to Sir <hi>William Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</hi>
He ſaid further, that the written copy was ſhewed to the <hi>Defendant</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and therefore he doth not wonder if it were ſhewed to Sir <hi>William Waller:</hi>
and that Sir <hi>Williams</hi> objected ſpeaking to his Officers, <hi>onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what they knew touching that buſineſſe, with reference ſimply to his Anſwer,</hi>
could not be intended either malice, or combination, or proſecution of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
not then ſo much as though of; nor any prejudice to the truth, ſince
no man can know a falſhood, becauſe it is a <hi>non-entity,</hi> and can be no object of
mans knowledge: That therefore this could be no juſt exception to Sir <hi>William</hi>
as a <hi>Commiſſioner,</hi> the rather, becauſe Colonell <hi>Carre</hi> (a man indifferent) was
joyned with him; much leſſe any legall exception to any Officers or Souldiers
teſtimony then under his command, who did but teſtifie what they knew for
truth. Beſides, Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> added, that <hi>Colonell Fiennes</hi> himſelfe had examined
divers of Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> Officers by commiſſion, before we examined any
of them, and ſome of thoſe whom we examined; and why we ſhould be deprived
of the benefit of their Examinations for the Kingdomes advantage, when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
had examined them onely for his private defence, there could be neither
reaſon nor equity alledged, it being a meere artifice, to deprive us of our moſt
materiall Witneſſes, and to ſuffocate the truth.</p>
               <p>To the third,<note place="margin">Anſwer 3.</note> of his wanting notice to joine in commiſsion, and croſſe examine
our Witneſſes, Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:159182:25"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that himſelfe had begun the Preſident, in taking forth ſeverall commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to Sir <hi>William Wallers,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Mancheſters</hi> Army, to examine
witneſſes there, without our privity or conſent, who neither had any the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the commiſſions to join in them, nor of any the Witneſſes names, till the
hearing, nor had not, nor could not croſſe examine them, nor ever yet ſaw their
depoſitions: And why our depoſitions, being Proſecutors, ſhould not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as well as his, being not taken ſo publikely before the <hi>Iudge Advocate,</hi> as
moſt of ours were, he ſaw no reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that we could not enforce <hi>Col. Fiennes</hi> to croſſe-examine any Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
or to joine with us in their examination; therefore if he neglected to doe it,
or went before us in his commiſſions, as he did, by virtue of which he might have
examined all our Witneſſes if he would, before we had taken their teſtimonies
againſt him, the default was his, not ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That we left all our depoſitions, and the Witneſſes names with the Iudge Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
to whom he oft repaired, and from whom he might have received the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of them, to croſſe examine them, if he pleaſed; which ſince he neglected
to doe, after ſo many adjournments, and taking no exceptions till now he came
before the Councell, of purpoſe to evade his Triall, and to clude both them, us,
the Parliament, and people, whoſe eyes are on the iſſue of this buſineſſe, there
was no reaſon to allow theſe frivolous exceptions: All which the Councell, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhort debate, over-ruled againſt the Defendant, reſolving, that the teſtimonies
ought to be uſed, unleſſe ſome particular juſt exception could be alledged againſt
any of them.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſtacles, by which the Defendant though to have ſhifted off his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
being removed, Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> then proceeded to prove the fourth Article,
which he did,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, by the Defendants owne Anſwer thereunto, wherein he doth confeſſe
the whole Article in ſubſtance; yea, more then it chargeth him withall, as
namely,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>That he never undertook to make good the City or Caſtle, or either of
them, againſt the enemy, declaring that he would not, nor could not undertake it:</hi>
Which is in plaine Engliſh as much as to confeſſe, that he had never any thought
or reſolution to hold them out to the utmoſt extremity, as he ought to have
done in honour, and duty; but a profeſſed purpoſe to ſurrender them to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
traiterouſly or cowardly, as ſoon almoſt as they came before it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>That ſoone after the enemy entred the Line</hi> (with a very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
number, not above 150 at firſt, and three or foure hundred in all at laſt, as
the Witneſſes atteſt) <hi>he had ſurrender the Towne and Castle, with all the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Cannons, Ammunition, Artillery, Military Proviſions, Magazines, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
and part of the Armes,</hi> (all but the Horſe-mens Swords, moſt of which
were likewiſe taken from them ere they departed the Towne) <hi>before the enemy
had taken any of the out-forts about the ſame, or had made the leaſt aſſault or
battery upon the walls of the City, or of the Castle, or any Myne or breach into
the chiefe Fort thereof, (and that before the Towne had been three whole dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged,</hi>
which he denieth not, and therefore granteth by his Anſwer:) which
whether it were not a moſt cleare conteſſion and demonſtration of a treacherous
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:159182:25"/>
and cowardly ſurrender in the ſuperlative degree, he humbly ſubmitted to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Councels judgement, and the determination of all men endued with
common reaſon and yet the Defendant hath the confidence, in the ſame branch
of his Anſwer, to deny <hi>that he did deliver them up traiterouſly, cowardly, or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
or contrary to his former promiſes,</hi> (to diſpute every inch of the Town, from
the Line to the City-gates, and from thence to the Caſtle-walls, which he would
defend to the utmoſt, and there lay his bones if he could not keep it, and make his
Flag of Truce his Winding-ſheet, proved by<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr</hi> Powell, <hi>Col.</hi> Stroode, <hi>Col.</hi> Stephens, <hi>Mr</hi> Haſſard, <hi>Capt.</hi> Bagnall.</note> divers Wineſſes,) <hi>or contrary to his
truſt and dutie:</hi> And the impudence to affirme, <hi>that he did defend the Towne and
Caſtle to the utmoſt point, not onely of dutie, but alſo of honour, that any Souldier
could or might have maintained the ſame:</hi> Which whether it were not the greateſt
Pardox and contradiction, that any Military man in his right ſenſes durſt ever
affirm before a Councell of experienced, valiant Commanders, he referred to the
reſolution of all there preſent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he confeſſeth, that though <hi>neither any of the Out-works were taken, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the Town wals once battred or aſſaulted, when the enemy entred the Line, yet as things
then ſtood</hi> (in reference to the Governours knowne valour and fidelity) <hi>neither
the Forts, nor caſtle, ought to have been kept, to the prejudice of the city and garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
(the prejudice of the whole Kingdome, which hath felt the ſmart of it, is
cautiouſly here omitted:) <hi>but ought to have been ſurrendred together with the city,
as they were, by the conſtant practice and policie of War in all places, the prniciples of
justice and honeſtie, and the rules of wiſdome and diſcretion</hi> (all of this grand ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
owne making,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> but none others:) And he further addes in the clauſe of his
Anſwer to the eighth Article, <hi>That he doth affirme and will juſtifie, that if the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
had been tenable</hi> (mark it) <hi>yet neither by the conſtant practice and Maximes of
War in all places, nor by the Rules of honeſtie and Chriſtianity, he ought to have held
the ſame.</hi> A riddle, which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> profeſſed tranſcended the limits of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
to enucleate, if no<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of all mens elſe, but the Defendants; and a paſſage
which carried <hi>Treachery and Cowardice</hi> engraven with Capitals in its very Front,
proclaiming openly to all men, that had the Out-ſorts and caſtle been never ſo
ſtrong and tenable againſt the enemy, yet he was ſo far from reſolving to keep
them for the Kingdoms and Parliaments ſecurity, that he profeſſeth, <hi>he ought not
to have held the ſame, neither by the conſtant practice and policie of War, nor Rules
of Piety or Chriſtianity</hi> (preſcribed him by Dr <hi>Ferne,</hi> no doubt, in his <hi>Reſolving
of Conſcience) But ought to have ſurrendred the ſame with the Towne.</hi> Certainly
this Gentleman was either reſolved to loſe his head when he penned this Anſwer,
or elſe intoxicated with the panick feare that ſurpriſed him at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> (which
hath made his pen and brains to ſtagger ever ſince) elſe he durſt not put in ſuch an
Anſwer in writing to this Impeachment.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he ſaith, <hi>that this ſurrender of the city, caſtle, forts, with all the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Cannon, Magazines, Armes,</hi> (but Troopers Swords,) <hi>Priſoners, Ships,

                  </gap>ely in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and the <hi>Enemies) in reſpect to the eſtate HEE</hi> (not the

the Kings forces have forcibly taken him Priſoner, for that the King had excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:159182:26"/>
him out of the <hi>Pardon</hi> mentioned in his Anſwer to the third Artcle: And
therefore out of baſe feare and ſelf-reſpects he would rather redeeme his head, and
buy his peace with the voluntary ſurrender of a place of ſuch conſequence to his
Majeſty, then hazzard his life in defending it to the utmoſt. And withall he
addes, <hi>that this ſurrender was for the honour, profit, and beſt advantage of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and Parliament, by whom he was intruſted:</hi> which when he ſhall be able to
demonſtrate, or make the Parliament and Kingdome beleeve, I ſhall profeſſe
this honourable Councell may in juſtice acquit him; till then (I hope) you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but condemn him, even out of theſe ſeverall paſſages of his own Anſwer, and
divers others of this nature, over-tedious to recite.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> from his Anſwer I ſhall deſcend to our proofs, which extend to all
the enſuing Articles as well as this: where we proved by the depoſitions of our
Witneſſes hereafter printed,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that the Defendant wanted neither men nor Ammunition, nor any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of proviſion, to defend the City and Caſtle againſt the enemy: Not men, for
he had neare 2000 foot and 300 horſe, beſide Voluntiers, to defend the Town;
and he might have raiſed at leaſt 6 or 8000 able men more in the City, if he had
wanted men, which were as many, or more, as beſieged it. Proved by the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of Colonell <hi>Stevens, Anthonie Gale, Arthur Williams, Able Kelly, Iames
Powell,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that they wanted not Ammunition, for we proved there were 60
(nay 70 double) barrels of Powder in the Caſtle, with Match and Bullet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable,
beſides what was in the City and Forts, and might have been made
weekly in the Towne, if held out againſt the enemy, and that by the depoſitions
of Mr <hi>Edward Bainton,</hi> (atteſted afterwards by Captain <hi>Buſhell</hi> himſelfe to divers
of the Councell of War at Saint Albans) <hi>Arthur Williams, Ioan Batten,</hi> Major
<hi>Wood,</hi> and others: Beſides, himſelfe confeſſeth in his Relation 50 barrels in the
Caſtle onely, when ſurrendred, Mr <hi>Haſſard</hi> depoſeth 50 at leaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that they had all manner of proviſion both in the City and Caſtle,
for three months ſpace or more, the particulars whereof will appeare in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of <hi>Nicholas Cowling, Able Kelley, Iames Powell, Dorothie Haſſard, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Smith,</hi> and others: That<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of col.</hi> Strode, <hi>Col.</hi> Stephens, <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> Bagnall, <hi>Mr</hi> Powell, <hi>Mr</hi> Cowling, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> Wood, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Linpon, Ed Watlin, <hi>Mr</hi> Haſſard.</note> himſelfe and others deemed the City and Caſtle
ſtrong and tenable; that he promiſed to hold the ſame to the utmoſt; to diſpute
every inch of ground with the enemy, to retire into the Caſtle when he could
hold the City no longer; to lay his bones there rather then yeeld it, and make
his Flag of Truce his Winding-ſheet. If then the place were ſo ſtrong and tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and he wanted neither men, nor Ammunition, nor Victuals, to defend the
City and Caſtle, his ſurrender of them muſt of neceſſity be adjudged <hi>Traiterly,</hi>
or <hi>Cowardly</hi> at leaſt, if not both: for what elſe but <hi>treachery,</hi> or <hi>cowardice,</hi> or
both conjoyned, could move him to this ſurrender, in leſſe then three dayes ſiege,
before utmoſt extremity, contrary to the Lawes and Ordinances of War, when
as he wanted nothing neceſſary for a brave defence.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> we proved that the Towne and Caſtle were not beſieged three
whole dayes; for the ſiege it ſelfe began but the Monday morning, and the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of ſurrender were agreed on before Wedneſday night, and the ſurrender exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
before 9 of clock the Thurſday morning: as Col. <hi>Stephens,</hi> Col. <hi>Strode,
Abbe Kelley,</hi> and others teſtifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:159182:26"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> that the Enemies were generally repulſed on all quarters of the city,
with extraordinary great loſſe of men, neare 700 of them being ſlaine, and as
many wounded, with the loſſe only of ſix or eight of our men: and that but 150
of them, or 200 at moſt, entred the Line the Wedneſday morning before ſunne
riſing (neare three of the clock) and were ſo afraid of being cut off, that they
gave themſelves all for dead men, and might have eaſily been cut off, none of
their owne party knowing of their entrie till two houres after they entred, nor
ſending them any reliefe: atteſted by <hi>Arthur William, Ioſeph Proud, Iames Coles,
Marie Smith,</hi> Serjeant <hi>William Hill, Stephen Radford, Michael Sparks,</hi> and others:</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that Major <hi>Langriſh</hi> and his horſe Troops, which had the guard of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
that place, and two other Captains of horſe under him, never once offered to
charge the enemy, whom they might eaſily have cut off, but retired into the City
without charging them: That <hi>Langriſh</hi> (very intimate with the Defendant) had
been formerly complained of to him, by Lievtenant <hi>Clifton,</hi> Col. <hi>Stephens,</hi> and
others, for his extraordinary cowardice and negligence, who deſired he might be
caſheered to walk the ſtreet, as unfit for any charge, yet the Defendant continued
him in his place, and ſet him to guard that very weak place where the enemy was
likelieſt to enter. Proved by <hi>Ioan Battin,</hi> Col. <hi>Popham,</hi> Col. <hi>Stephens,</hi> and Captain
<hi>Nevill.</hi> Lievtenant <hi>Clifton,</hi> Captaine <hi>Husbands,</hi> and Captain <hi>Vaughan, (Fiennes</hi>
owne Witneſſes) upon croſſe Examinations before the Councell.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that the day before the enemy entred, one <hi>Thomas Munday,</hi> a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
under Captaine <hi>Henrie Lloyd</hi> (as both their Depoſitions witneſſe) pointing
with his finger to the very place where the enemy entred the next morning, told
Major <hi>Langriſh</hi> in the hearing of Colonell <hi>Fiennes;</hi> Captain, <hi>Yonder is a very ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious
place, not fully fortiſied, and it is verie doubtfull, unleſſe you ſet an hundred
Musketiers more there, it being but weaklie manned, the enemies will there make
their firſt breach:</hi> Whereupon Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> for this his good advice in an
angry manner asked him, <hi>What? doth he prate?</hi> and called him <hi>Sawcie Knave:</hi>
and <hi>Langriſh</hi> having the guard thereof, ſuffered the Enemy the very next morning
to enter the Line at that ſame place, from which he retired with his horſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any charge or reſiſtance, when as he might eaſily have repulſed and beat them
off, yet the Defendant never queſtioned nor complained againſt <hi>Langriſh</hi> for
this his cowardice and treachery, which was the onely reall occaſion of ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the City, but countenanced and juſtified him all he could, affirming in
<note n="*" place="margin">Reply to Mr <hi>Wallers</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> print, that he was acquitted by a Councel of war of cowardice, which was falſe;
and endeavoured to lay the blame of not charging upon one Lievtenant <hi>Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
who was ſo far from being guilty of this fact, that ſeeing <hi>Langriſh</hi> with his
Troop quit the breach without charging, he called him <hi>Coward,</hi> and with three
or foure Musketies onely marched up to the enemy, and made good the breach
for a time, till he received ſo many wounds (whereof he after died) as forced
him to retreat for want of ſeconding; he affirming that if he had been ſeconded
by the horſe, or with 20 Musketiers more, he could eaſily have repulſed the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and made good the breach; yet this dead man muſt thus be traduced before
the Councell to ſave <hi>Langriſh</hi> his credit, though Captain <hi>Husbands</hi> (one of the
Defendants owne witneſſes) confeſſed, that <hi>Langriſh</hi> his cowardice, in not char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
was the loſſe of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and that he told him ſo openly to his face, at a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:159182:27"/>
meeting in <hi>London,</hi> ſince the ſurrender; yet the Defendant had the boldneſſe to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie,
and produce him as a competent Witneſſe, <hi>viva voce,</hi> at the hearing before
the Councell, where the Proſecutors articled againſt him for this and other acts
of cowardice, and would have proſecuted him with effect, had they ſeen any fruits
of the ſentence againſt Col. <hi>Fiennes,</hi> but ſuch as juſtly diſmayed them from all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
proſecutions of this kinde.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, that for two or three houres ſpace at leaſt, the few enemies who firſt
entred had no reliefe nor ſupplies ſent to them, neither indeed could have, the
enemy being bravely repulſed with great loſſe in all other places, ſo as they reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in diſorder to their Quarters, and one whole Regiment of their horſe retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as far as <hi>White-church,</hi> foure miles from <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> with a reſolution never to
come on againe, had not the meſſage of the unexpected Parley, and hopes of the
Cities ſurrender thereupon, drawne them back to their Quarters: And that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viers
of the Enemies confeſſed, if they had then been repulſed or beaten out of
this breach, they had raiſed their ſiege, and never come on againe. Serjeant <hi>Hill,</hi>
Major <hi>Wood, Iames Coles,</hi> depoſe all this, and the Defendants witneſſes confeſſed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, that from three in the morning, when the Enemy entred, till about
10 or 11 a clock at leaſt, there was no charge at all made, except onely by
<hi>Rouſwell,</hi> and after by Capt. <hi>Nevill,</hi> who charged them downe hill onely with
twenty horſe an houre or more after their entry, and could have then beaten them
out, as he verily beleeved, and atteſted upon Oath, had he been ſeconded with 30
or 40 horſe or Musketiers. A very ſtrange neglect, to ſuffer the Enemy to lodge
ſo long within the Line, ere they were encountred.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, that upon the Enemies entry Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> in ſtead of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the next Guards and Companies then at the Out-works, to fall upon and
beat them out, as he was preſſed to doe by Lievtenant <hi>Daviſon,</hi> Major <hi>Wood,</hi>
Captaine <hi>Bagnall,</hi> Mr <hi>Deane,</hi> Serjeant <hi>Hill,</hi> and others, commanded all the
Souldiers upon paine of death, by his Lievtenant <hi>Clifton,</hi> to draw off the Line
and Works on that ſide of the City the Enemy entred, and to retire into the
City with all ſpeed to the Market-place, full ſore againſt their wills: whereat
divers of the Souldiers<note n="*" place="margin">Ioan Battin, Wil. White-horne, <hi>Serjeant</hi> Gale, <hi>Captaine</hi> Bagnall, Tho. Munday.</note> 
                  <hi>were verie much diſcontented and diſcouraged,</hi> and many
of them ſaid, <hi>They were betraied.</hi> Whereupon they retreated from the Line and
Out-workes in great diſorder, many of them leaving not onely their Swords,
Muskets, Powder, Bullets, but their very Cannons behinde them, which might
with eaſe have been eaſily drawne off being downe the hill, and many Halliers
horſes ready at hand for that ſervice; at which the Gunners were ſo diſcontented,
that ſome of them ſpiked and nayled up the touch-holes, to make their Cannons
unſerviceable to the Enemy, and the City-Garriſon too, in caſe they had returned
to the Workes and Line, which by this ſtrange Souldiery were left naked of all
defence neare two miles ſpace together, ſo as the Enemy might have entred the
Line where they pleaſed, in ſundry places of greater advantage, nearer to the
Citie, Caſtle, Suburbs, by much, then where they had made their firſt entry.
Which ſtrange deviſe and unmilitary policie, if it favoured not of apparent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
yet at leaſt it cannot be excuſed from extreme folly, and want of skill in
Martiall affaires, which made Major <hi>Lewis,</hi> and other of the beſt experienced
Souldiers (who adviſed not to draw off the Line into the City, but to fall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:159182:27"/>
on the enemy from the Line it ſelfe, which was the nearer, beſt, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt
way) exceedingly diſcontented.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, that when the Souldiers were thus haſtily and confuſedly called from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
the Line into the Market-place,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Capt.</hi> Bagnall</note> they there ſtood idle, looking one upon another,
without any command to make a fally, or doe any other ſervice to ſecure the
City; whereupon, for want of command and imploiment, divers of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
who had been upon duty at the Line foure or five dayes and nights together,
departed from their Colours, ſome to the Taverne, ſome to the Ale-houſe to drink,
others to their beds to ſleep, ſo as their companies were broken, and not halffull,
whereas if they had marched orderly from the Line againſt the Enemies when
they firſt entred it, which was far the beſt and ſhorteſt way; or made a ſally
as ſoone as they retreated from the Line, theſe inconveniences had been preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Souldiers kept in heart, the enemies cut off, or beaten out, the breach made
up, and the City preſerved.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, that when the ſally was made, not before, but much about eleven of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
the clock,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Major</hi> Wood, Wil. White-horne.</note> it conſiſted not of above 200 men, and that of thoſe called off the
Line, the freſh men at the maine Guard, and <hi>Captaine Stokes</hi> his company pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
kept for a Reſerve, with the Garriſon ſouldiers in the caſtle, (who were not
in the fight at the Line, and might have made a preſent ſally, without calling any
from the Line) being not imployed on this ſervice.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, that when the enemies upon the ſally, though late, were driven from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
houſe to houſe, and ſo beaten, that they let fall their Armes, and cryed for Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and when the women were ſo couragious, that they profeted to goe with
their children unto the Cannons mouth, to dead the bullets, in caſe the Souldiers
were afraid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Serieant</hi> Gale, Ioan Battin, Mrs Haſſard, Thomas Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>Serieant</hi> Gale.</note> rather then the City ſhould be yeelded, and thereupon encouraged
both the Gunners and Souldiers to fight, working in the very face of the enemy,
and ſtopping up <hi>Froome-gate</hi> with a very thicke worke (made with earth and
Wooll-ſacks) where the Enemy ſhould have entred the citie; yet ſuch was the
Defendants extraordinary cowardice, that he even then ſent twice out to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
for a Parley, whereas the Souldiers generally deſired and offered to fight it
out to the utmoſt; which ſo much diſcontented divers ſouldiers, that they ſaid
they were betrayed, and in very anger brake their Muskets, Swords, Pikes, leſt
the Enemy ſhould gaine them, ſwearing they would never ſerve the Parliament
more, and taxing the Governour for his Parley and cowardice.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, That the Caſtle was ſurrendred, the Priſoners releaſed, the Enemy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
admitted into into the Towne long before the houre agreed on,<note place="margin">Maior <hi>Wood,</hi> Col. <hi>Stroode,</hi> and others.</note> through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants

he took no care to ſee them righted, but left them to the ſpoile, neglecting to take

                  </note> the Kings Generall, and the Governour,

haſte to quit the Towne, that he left Captaine <hi>Blake,</hi> and Captain <hi>Husbands</hi> in
<hi>Brandon</hi>-hill and <hi>Prior</hi>-hill Forts behinde him, never giving them notice of the
Articles, nor any Warrant under his hand to ſurrender them to the Enemy, to the
endangering of their lives and liberties.</p>
               <p>13. That Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> being moved to ſend away the Priſoners before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>

the ſiege, refuſed, ſaying, <hi>He would keep them there to make his owne conditions the

That he told<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes</hi> depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Mr <hi>Talboies,</hi> that he ſhould not be in <hi>Briſtoll</hi> for ought he
knew at Saint <hi>Iames</hi> tide then next enſuing, and uſed ſuch expreſſions to him, as
made him believe he meant to ſurrender the Towne by that time, (as he did the
very next day after Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his feaſt) who thereupon left the City, as intended
to be ſurrendred by the Governour: That he commanded Mr <hi>Haſſard</hi> to lay by a
Reſerve of 30 barrels of Powder, with Match and Bullets proportionable, to
which when he was reduced he would treat:<note n="*" place="margin">Rich. Butlers <hi>teſtimony.</hi>
                  </note> That there were about 140 Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado's
in the caſtle, and one new Morter-piece, and that <hi>Iohn Warden</hi> one of the
Gunners of the caſtle did often importune the Defendant to give him leave to
make a ſhot at the Enemy out of the ſaid Morter-piece, but the Defendant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him under paine of death not to make any ſhot at them; whereat the
ſaid Gunner was ſo grieved, that he oft complained the Towne was betrayed:
All which Granado's, with the Morter-piece, were <hi>ſurrendred</hi> to the Enemies,
and not one of them ſhot againſt them, though they ſhot many Granado's at the
Towne and Garriſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> 14. That the caſtle and forts were very ſtrong and tenable, if not the Towne;
that the Defendant himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> Stephens, <hi>Col.</hi> Strode, <hi>Mr</hi> Powell, <hi>Major</hi> Wood, <hi>Captain</hi> Bagnall, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Munday, Rich Lindon, Ed.

Sparks, <hi>and others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt this.</hi>
                  </note> the Towns-men and Souldiers reputed them ſo;
that they might have been held divers moneths, yea to this very time, had not
they been <hi>ſurrendred;</hi> that the Enemy could not have taken them by force, even
by their owne confeſſions, nor all the Devils in hell have taken the caſtle, had not
the Defendant beyond their expectation ſurrendred them baſely into their hands,
and beſtowed them upon them; for which ſurrender the very enemy called him a
<hi>baſe Coward,</hi> and ſaid he deſerved to be hanged for delivering up ſuch a Town and
Caſtle as that to them ſo eaſily, for which they might thank <hi>Fiens,</hi> elſe they could
not have won them by force, had not he beſtowed them on them beyond their
hopes. From all which particulars (fully proved by the enſuing teſtimonies) we
concluded, <hi>That the Town, Caſtle, Ammunition, Cannons, Armes, &amp;c. were moſt
diſhonourably, cowardly, and treacherouſly delivered up to the Enemy, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
and againſt the Parliaments or his Excellencies previous conſents, who abhorred
the fact, and never gave the leaſt way thereunto, being executed before they had any
thought or tidings of it, and before the City and Caſtle was reduced to any extremity.</hi>
And thus we concluded the ſecond dayes worke.</p>
               <p>The Defendant (who ſpent not three full dayes in defence of the City) waſted
the three next whole dayes in defending himſelfe againſt the firſt charge in the
third Article onely; and no leſſe then one dayes ſpace in ſhewing the weakneſſes,
defects, and intenability of the Caſtle, on whoſe fortification he hath beſtowed
much money and paines, onely to yeeld it up to the Enemy, before one ſhot was
made againſt it, as a Fort not tenable then, though before that time a place almoſt
impregnable, in his own and others opinions, which he ſelected for his Magazine
and laſt refuge, reſolving to hold it againſt the Enemy, and to lay his bones
therein, rather then yeeld it up againſt his truſt. In this his defence (to ſpin out
time) he led us in perambulation through all the Works, Forts, Dikes, Rampires,
Walls, about the City or Caſtle, proving the heigth, length, depth, breadth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:159182:28"/>
ſtrength, defects and weakneſſes, of all and every inch of each of
them, before the Councell by his Officers onely, (who were parties, and invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with him for the moſt part in the guilt of this ſurrender) which were ſcarce
ever meaſured and conſidered by him or them before; and diſcovering ſo many
weakneſſes and imperfections in them all, not formerly obſerved, as clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,
that either his Engineers and he were extremely ignorant and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
in putting the Kingdome, Citie, Countrey, to ſuch vaſte expences, in
making ſuch inconſiderable weak fortifications, (which yet the Enemy did not,
could not force, with all his ſtrength and ſtorming, loſing one hundred men to
one of ours in the aſſault, ſo ſtrong and tenable were they till ſurrendred;) or
elſe that theſe defects and imbecillities were but <hi>fine</hi> new <hi>devices,</hi> found out ſince
the <hi>ſurrender,</hi> (as in truth they were) to palliate, or extenuate the treachery and
cowardice of the Defendant; who left no ſtone unmoved, no turfe unturned, no
dike unfathomed, no Cannon or Bullet unweighed, (for we had proofe of each
of theſe) to ſave his head from the blocke, of which he had far more care then of
the City or Kingdome, and took us up about ſixe whole dayes in the debate of
this one Article.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of the Defendants tedious defence, conſiſted of the enſuing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
to every of which, for brevitie and perſpicuity ſake, we ſhall ſubjoine the
diſtinct Replies then given, not in a continued Speech, as they were uttered, (the
whole three dayes firſt defence being made intirely together, and then the <hi>Reply,
Rejoinder,</hi> and <hi>Surrejoinder</hi> thereunto) but in parcels, as each part of the <hi>Reply,
Rejoinder,</hi> and <hi>Surrejoinder</hi> was applied to each particle of the Defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Allegation 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the Defendant denied,</hi> that all the Armes were ſurrendred to the Enemy,
for it appeareth, by the firſt Article of the ſurrender, that all the Officers of horſe
and foot were to march out with their full Armes, and the Troopers with their ſwords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which Mr</hi> Prynne <hi>anſwered,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> That by the first and tenth Article of ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all the common foot Souldiers were to march out without Armes, and the Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
onely with their Swords, leaving their other Armes, together with all their
Cannons, Ammunition, and Colours, behind them; <hi>therefore ſince</hi> all the Armes of
<hi>the foot,</hi> all <hi>the Troopers Armes but their ſwords, (which were not many nor
conſiderable) with</hi> all the Cannons, Ammunition, Colours, <hi>were thus ſurrendred,
the words of the Article of Impeachment,</hi> that all the Cannons, Ammunition, Arms,
&amp;c. were ſurrendred, <hi>were ſufficiently and literally proved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> that <hi>All,</hi> both in Scripture, Law, and common parlance, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
taken for <hi>the greateſt part,</hi> or <hi>well nigh all;</hi> as <hi>Matth. 2. 3. Herodwas
troubled and all Hieruſalem with him: Matth. 21. 10. All the City was moved,
ſaying, who is this?</hi> All <hi>men thinke ſo,</hi> All <hi>affirme it; They have taken</hi> all <hi>their
Armes, Baggage,</hi> and the like: where <hi>all</hi> is taken for the <hi>greateſt part,</hi> or <hi>all in

ſwords, in reſpect of all the other Armes there left, were not conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> moſt of all the Officers Armes and Troopers ſwords were taken from
them by the Enemy, as the Defendant confeſſeth in his<note n="*" place="margin">Page 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Relation,</hi> Anſwer,
and we have proved; and if any eſcaped with their Armes by chance, yet all their
Armes were quite loſt as to the State, which had no benefit by, nor account of
them: therefore in this regard the Article is moſt true.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:159182:29"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Allegation 2</note> 
                  <hi>he denied</hi> he ſurrendred the City and Caſtle againſt the Parliaments
and his Excellencies conſents, <hi>though it is true</hi> hee did it without their previous
conſents.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replied,<note place="margin">Anſwer:</note> that this was a very frivolous diſtinction: For
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, Chriſt himſelfe by this ſpeech, * <hi>He that is not with me is againſt me,</hi> reſolves,
that what is done without the Parliaments and his Excellencies conſents (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if they diſlike and diſavow it afterwards) is done <hi>againſt their conſents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 30.</note> and
that in ſtrict propriety of ſpeech: Hence, if a mans ſervant, cattell, without his
privity or approbation commit a Treſpaſſe in his neighbours ground, or if one
caſually tread upon anothers toe, he uſually ſaith in theſe and ſuch like caſes, <hi>It
was againſt my will or againſt my liking and conſent: Briſtoll</hi> therefore being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
ſurrendred not onely beyond, but contrary to the Parliaments and his
Excellencies expectations and deſires, was certainly ſurrendred againſt their wils
and conſents, as well as without them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Parliaments and his Excellencies expreſſe will and intention was,
that <hi>Briſtoll</hi> ſhould be kept to the utmoſt extremity, and not ſurrendred to the
Enemy, this being the end wherefore they placed a Governour and Garriſon
there, and made Works about it; the ſurrendring therefore of it, contrary to
both their expreſſe wills and directions, muſt needs be not onely without, but
againſt their wills and conſents. This all the world knowes, unleſſe the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
can ſhew their expreſſe conſents thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Houſes and his Excellencies former opinions of, and calling him
to an account heretofore, and now into judgment for this ſurrender, as directly
contrary to his truſt, and their directions, is a ſufficient proofe it was not onely
<hi>beſides,</hi> but <hi>againſt</hi> their conſents; and to thinke or ſpeak otherwiſe, is but to lay
a grand imputation on the Parliament and his Excellency, in making them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
to this diſhonourable, trayterly action, which hath almoſt loſt the
Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Allegation 3</note> he alledged, that foure dayes before the fiege he ſent one <hi>Scotten</hi>
with a Letter to his <hi>Excellency,</hi> to acquaint him with the weakneſſe of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
that he had not above 900 men beſides Citizens, as likewiſe to ſee the
eſtate of his Army, and crave ſpeedy ſuccours from him: That he found his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
had but 4000 Foot able to march, many of his men being then ſick, and
not in a marching condition to relieve him; <hi>that it was cleare</hi> (as he averres in
his<note n="*" place="margin">Page 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Relation,</hi> and then alſo affirmed, to the Parliaments and his Excellencies
diſhonour) <hi>they could not expect, nor have had any reliefe in ſixe or eight weekes
time:</hi> And to juſtifie this diſpaire of timely ſuccours, he produced a Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by his Excellency to the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> his Father, to this effect; <hi>That he was
ſorry</hi> Briſtoll <hi>was in ſo much danger, as by Colonell</hi> Fiennes <hi>his Letter to him it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be; and that himſelfe at that preſent was not in a fitting poſture to relieve it,
which troubled him the more, for that his Lordſhips ſonne was ingaged there:</hi>
(which Letter being read, Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> inquiring the date thereof, found it dated
the 28 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> two dayes after the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> which was on the 26 of
that <hi>Iuly.</hi>) From all which the Defendant inferred the neceſſity of ſurrendring the
Towne and Caſtle, for want of ſuccours, which had they been neare, he could
have made a ſhift to have held out three or foure dayes longer, and would have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:159182:29"/>
done it; but being hopeleſſe of reliefe, he could not in point of ſouldiery or policy
have held it longer then he did.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replied,<note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> firſt, that he did but his duty in ſending thus to

2000 Foot and 300 Horſe, beſides Voluntiers, which were neare 200 more:
and Major <hi>Allen</hi> atteſted, that he brought neare 200 men well armed from
<hi>Malmſbury,</hi> but a day or two before the ſiege; ſo as his 900 were encreaſed to
2500 men, or more; and he might have raiſed (as Mr <hi>Powell,</hi> his owne Witneſſe,
atteſted) at leaſt ſixe or eight thouſand able men more, to beare Armes in the
City, had he wanted men: Therefore the want of men was but a pretence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
had he needed onely men, why did he adviſe Sir <hi>William Waller to march
out with at leaſt 500 Horſe-men, leſt they ſhould have helped to have ſpent the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of Briſtoll,</hi> as he confeſſeth in his <hi>Relation</hi> page 12? Certainly, either he
thought the Towne tenable with the men he had, till all the proviſions in it
were ſpent, and ſo the Garriſon ſtrong enough to defend it whiles they had Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
or elſe he deſired rather to ſpare the Victuals for the Enemy, (to whom
they were ſurrendred) then for Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> men, who (had they ſtayed
in the City) would have made up his Garriſon 800 Horſe, beſides 2000 Foot,
and in all probability have preſerved the City, which was partly loſt (as<note n="*" place="margin">Relation p. 7</note> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

when they entred, whom they might eaſily have cut off, had they but char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them, as they might and ſhould have done. In briefe, the Defendants owne
<note n="*" place="margin">Page 6. hee writes he raiſed about 1000 or 1110 men, and procured as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arms within 5 dayes, which added to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Garriſon of 900 makes 2000 foote, beſides thoſe that came from <hi>Malmeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and his horſe. And p. 11. hee writes, hee thought to have ſaved a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of 300 horſe, and 1500 foot to the State by the ſurrender: Ergo he had ſo many, beſides Citizens and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that would ſtay behinde.</note> 
                  <hi>Relation</hi> and <hi>Letter to his Excellency</hi> informe us, that his Garriſon conſiſted of
at leaſt 2000 Foot, and 300 Horſe, and was ſo ſtrong and ſufficient, that when the
Enemy ſtormed the Towne on every ſide with all their Forces, they were vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
repulſed, with the loſſe of neare a thouſand of their beſt men, beſides 700
wounded; whereas he loſt not above ſixe or eight men at moſt, and had very few
or none wounded: If then the Garriſon were thus ſufficiently ſtrong to repulſe
the Enemy with ſo great loſſe, when their Army was ſtrongeſest and beſt in heart,

loſſe of ſixe or eight onely of the Garriſon, the Aſſailants being much weakned,
and Defendants as ſtrong, or ſtronger, and more couragious, by reaſon of their
good ſucceſſe, then they were at firſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to his deſpaire of ſuccours in ſix or eight weekes time, by reaſon of
the weakneſſe or ſickneſſe of the Army, it was anſwered, firſt, That as hope is

Deus adjuvat,</hi> the Chriſtians: his cauſleſſe deſpaire then of timely reliefe from
God or man, the Parliament or his Excellency, argued not onely want of <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi>
but <hi>Faith</hi> too, both in God and men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> valiant <hi>Maſſie</hi> (if this plea might be admitted) had far more cauſe
to deſpaire of timely reliefe then the Defendant: for both <hi>Fiennes</hi> and <hi>Clifton</hi>
his Lievtenant profeſſed openly, after the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtoll, that they would be
hanged if</hi> Gloceſter <hi>could hold out two dayes, if the Enemy came before it:</hi> and
Colonell <hi>Pury</hi> and Captaine <hi>Parry</hi> depoſed, <hi>that the Walls and Works about it
were weaker then</hi> Briſtols, <hi>their Garriſon not above 1500, Club-men and all, their
Powder not above 32 ſingle barrels, beſides what they made during the ſiege, their
proviſion not ſo plentifull as</hi> Briſtols, <hi>their Cannon but ſeven or eight,</hi> whereas
<hi>Briſtoll</hi> had 55 Canon, beſides Sir <hi>Francis Pophams</hi> Peeces; the Enemies before
<hi>Gloceſter</hi> almoſt<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes</hi> Relation of that ſiege p. 1.</note> 10000 more then thoſe that beſieged <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and likewiſe
accompanied with the Kings perſonall preſence. Beſides, his Excellencies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
by reaſon of ſickneſſe, was now far weaker, and more unable to relieve
<hi>Gloceſter,</hi> then it was when it ſhould have marched for <hi>Bristols</hi> reliefe; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all theſe diſcouragements, and the great dammage and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
the ſudden unexpected loſſe of <hi>Bristoll</hi> ſtrucke into all mens ſpirits,
<hi>Maſſie</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter</hi> men did not baſely yeeld up the Towne to the Enemy, as
ſoone almoſt as they came before it, but relying on Gods providence, and the
Parliaments care to the uttermoſt, received timely reliefe from both in leſſe then
three weeks after they ſent for ſuccours; as <hi>Briſtoll</hi> doubtleſſe would have done,
had Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> had ſo much true <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Valour</hi> as <hi>Maſſie</hi> had. Now
that <hi>Briſtoll</hi> would have been relieved far ſooner then <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably
proved by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe my Lord Generals Army was in a far better condition almoſt
by halfe, to march when <hi>Bristoll</hi> was beſieged, then it was at the ſiege of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>
the number of it being much decreaſed by ſickneſſe in the interim, and
their courage, ſpirits, much daunted by <hi>Briſtols</hi> unexpected ſurrender in ſo ſhort
a time, upon ſuch diſhonourable termes, which hee doubted at all the whole
Councell preſent could experimentally atteſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Parliament, his Excellency, London, and the whole Kingdome,
looked upon <hi>Briſtoll</hi> as a place of the greateſt conſequence of any in England,
next to <hi>London,</hi> as the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> Key, Magazine of the Weſt, which would
be all indangered, and the Kingdome too by its loſſe: as a Town of infinite more
conſequence then <hi>Glocester;</hi> by the gaining whereof the Enemy would be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with all manner of proviſions, and Ammunition by land, with a Navie and
all Merchandize by ſea, and enabled to bring in the ſtrength of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:159182:30"/>
for their aſſiſtance: therefore being of ſo great concernment, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
his Excellencie, <hi>London,</hi> and the Kingdome, would have been far more
carefull to relieve it in due time, then they were, or would have been to relieve
<hi>Gloceſter,</hi> of which they had yet a ſpeciall care.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Briſtoll</hi> was a Towne of far greater commerce with <hi>London</hi> then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> many <hi>Londoners</hi> having a great part of their Trading and eſtates too
in it: Therefore this particular intereſt would have made the <hi>Londoners</hi>
more forward to march to relieve <hi>Briſtoll</hi> then <hi>Gloceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> and the Citizens of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> had more powerfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
active friends in both Houſes, and about his <hi>Excellency,</hi> (as his Letter to the
Lord <hi>Say</hi> imports) to ſolicite and expedite their reliefe, then <hi>Maſſie</hi> or <hi>Glocester</hi>
had; therefore though the Parliament and his <hi>Excellencie</hi> were very ready to
have ſent timely reliefe to both, yet in all probability, <hi>Bristoll</hi> in theſe reſpects had
been ſooner relieved (had it held out) then <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was or could have been; the
rather, becauſe the loſſe of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> made many men fall off from the Parliament,
more to ſtand as Neutets, and damped the activity and ſpirits of moſt men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it was anſwered, that the Defendant produced no proof of his deſpaire,
but onely his <hi>Excellencies</hi> Letter, written and ſent to the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> not to him,
and dated two dayes after the ſurrender made; this therfore could be no ground,
no cauſe at all of the ſurrender, which ſo long preceded it. To ſupply which
over-ſight and defect, Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> next day produced a Witneſſe, to prove,
that the day before the ſurrender there came one into <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> who reported that
the Lord Generals Army was very weak, and in no poſture to march; but who it
was, or whence he came, or how he came in thither, the Towne being beleague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or whether the Governour ever had any certaine information of this report,
there was not the leaſt ſhadow of proofe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It was replyed, That if a Govournours groundleſſe ſurmiſe of an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
improbability of timely ſupplies, might be a good excuſe to ſurrender a Town, the
ſtrongeſt, beſt furniſhed Townes and Forts in the Kingdome might be betrayed,
ſurrendred to the Enemy in a moment under this pretence: Col. <hi>Maſſie</hi> might
have then upon farre better grounds have ſurrendred <hi>Glocester</hi> to the King
the firſt day; the Earle of <hi>Stamford, Exeter;</hi> and <hi>Col. Warnlow, Plymmouh</hi> the
ſecond day they were beſieged; then the Defendant <hi>Bristoll</hi> on the third
day, ſince there was a farre greater improbability of relieving any of theſe in
time, then of <hi>Briſtoll:</hi> And by this reaſon, had Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> been furniſhed with
men, Ammunition, Victuals, to have kept the Town, five, or ſeven weeks
longer, yet by this way of arguing, hee would certainly have ſurrendred it
when hee did, (in leſſe then three dayes ſpace) and not have kept it to the
fifth or ſeventh weeks end; becauſe he conceived an improbability of reliefe in
eight weeks time, out of a pannick feare, or out of a meere deſign to colour
his ſurrender: Hee ſhould have therefore held it to the uttermoſt extremity, and
God or ourvigilant Parliament (no doubt) by that time would have ſent reliefe,
as they did to <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> or if none had come; hee had then diſcharged his
duty, and been excuſed: But ſince hee kept it not to the laſt, but prejudged
Gods, the Parliaments, and his Excellencies care to relieve him in due ſeaſon,
his fault is inexcuſable and capitall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:159182:31"/>
Fourthly,<note place="margin">Allegat. 4.</note> He alledgeth, <hi>That he did not ſurrender the City, Caſtle, Armes, &amp;c.
Trayterouſly,</hi> and that no treachery was proved againſt him.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> Anſwered:<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Firſt, that though there were no direct
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> proofe of any correſpondency or intelligence with the Enemy; yet if they
were ſurrendred before uttermoſt extremy, the very Law it ſelfe, and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Ordinances for warre, <hi>reſolve this to bee Treaſon.</hi> And being thus
<hi>treaſon,</hi> even in point of Law, he needed no other proofe, that it was <hi>trayterouſly</hi>
ſurrendred, but the <hi>Law</hi> and Fact it ſelfe: And wee ought to charge it in the
Impeachment, that it was <hi>Trayterouſly ſurrendred,</hi> as the Law reſolves it to be,
elſe the impeachment was not good in Law, neither could Iudgement bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on it. Hence by the Rules of the Common Law, if a man be indicted of any
crime which is Treaſon, Felony, or Burglary by the Law, the Indictment muſt
runne, that he committed the cryme, <hi>Proditoriè, Felonicè,</hi> or <hi>Burglariter,</hi> elſe
the Indictment is vitious and defective. Therefore by like reaſon, the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of any Fort, before utmoſt extremity <hi>being Treaſon,</hi> it ought to bee
charged in the Articles, <hi>That it was Treaſonably ſurrendred,</hi> and for this end,
he inſerted the word <hi>Treaſonably</hi> into the Articles: <hi>The Check to the Checker
of Brittanicus</hi> hath taken great hold of this paſſage, in his two laſt pages, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeven Witneſſes (if need bee) to prove it, and all to juſtifie, yea, acquite
Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> from Treaſon. But if it be any honour to him to bee thus guilty
of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> and to deliver up <hi>Briſtoll, Trayterouſly,</hi> in this ſence Mr
<hi>Prynne</hi> then gave of it, before extremity (for which he was adjudged to looſe his
head) there is no man will envie him this new Garland to crown his condemned
Pate withall, which is freely yeelded him without further proofe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It was Anſwered, That feare and cowardize were the moſt tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
paſſions of all others: Theſe have cauſed many to betray their own reaſon,
ſenſes, Liberties, Lawes, Eſtates, Truſts, Friends, Countreys, Kingdoms, Soules;
whence we finde the<note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note>

                  <hi>exploded out of Gods temporall and ſpirituall Militia.</hi> Therefore if he
ſurrendred them out of feare or cowardize only, though without any trayterly
compact with the Enemy, the ſurrender is properly ſtiled <hi>Traiterous,</hi> as well as
<hi>Cowardly,</hi> even in reality and Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It was Anſwered; (which the <hi>Check to the Checker</hi> might have
taken notice of) that though there were no direct Treachery charged or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the fourth Article, yet there were vehement preſumptions, ſuſpitions of
it (which oft times caſt and condemne Felons, Murthers, Traitours, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

up together: Firſt then, his own frequent confeſſions in his Anſwers, <hi>That
he never undertook to keepe or not deliver the City or Caſtle to the Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Parliaments and his Excellencies previous conſents: That they neither in
honour nor juſtice could expect ſuch a promiſe from him: That hee ought not
to have kept the. Caſtle when the Enemy had entred the Line, but ought to have
ſurrendred the ſame, (although tenable) to the Enemy, together with the City,
by the principles of honeſty and juſtice, the Rulers of wiſdome and diſcretion, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:159182:31"/>
Coupled with his wilfull <hi>miſinforming of the Councell of warre;</hi> when they met
about a parley, <hi>that there was</hi>

Mr <hi>Haſſard</hi> depoſeth, there were 50 Barrels of powder, at and leaſt 1400 waight

that morning (as <hi>Arthur Williams</hi> and <hi>Ione Batton</hi> depoſed) and 140 bundels as
Captain <hi>Buſhel</hi> affirmed; of purpoſe to draw the Councell to a preſent parley and

of <hi>Captaine Loyde</hi> and <hi>Thomas Munday,</hi> that the Defendant called <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
ſaucy knave, when he informed him and</hi> Langriſh <hi>of the danger and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the very place, where the Enemy the next morning entred, refuſing to
ſtrengthen the Guards there as he was adviſed by him,</hi> and appointing Major <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griſh</hi>
(a noted coward formerly complained of to him for his cowardize and
negligence) to guard this weakeſt place, who never once offered to charge the
Enemy, but gave them leave to enter, and yet he never queſtioned him for this
treachery, but countenanced him by his favour, juſtified him in print, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
him before the Councell as a competent Witneſſe: With his refuſing to
ſend away the Priſoners in the Caſtle before the ſiege, upon Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi>

reſpite a Delinquents payment of a ſumme of moneys till St <hi>Iames-tide</hi> then
enſuing;) That <hi>he knew not whether he ſhould be at Briſtoll at St Iames-tide, &amp;c.</hi>
which made Mr <hi>Talboyes</hi> then preſently conceive he intended to ſurrender the
City about that time, (as hee did the next day after St <hi>Iames</hi> day, <hi>viz. Iuly</hi> 26
1643) whereupon Mr <hi>Talboys</hi> preſently removed and left the City: With his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting

which made him ſay <hi>they were betrayed:</hi> All theſe particulars laid together, and
coupled with Captain <hi>Ropers</hi> depoſition, that <hi>the Lady Newport told this</hi> as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

               <p>Before he came to make this good by proofes and arguments,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> he firſt excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt our Witneſſes to prove the <hi>ſurrender cowardly,</hi> becauſe ſome of them
were Women, others Enemies, who were not competent Witneſſes, and were
ready to ſlander their oppoſites.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replied,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1. 2.</note> Firſt, that ſome of the Witneſſes onely were
Women,<note place="margin">2.</note> and thoſe ſeconded by men. Secondly, that they declared not their own
weak opinions, but the judgements of men; yea of the Enemies owne Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in private ſerious conference among themſelves, as well as in open diſcourſe
to others.<note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, that theſe Women-witneſſes, and other Females in the City,
ſhewed more true courage, undauntedneſſe, then the. Defendant and ſome of his
Officers, working boldly in the face of the Enemy, where they durſt not appear,
oppoſing a Parley when he ſent out twice for it, and offering to goe in perſon
with their children into the very mouth of the Cannon to dead the bullets, if the
Souldiers were afraid, rather then the City ſhould be ſurrendred: Being then ſuch
maſculine Females as theſe, he thought them meet Witneſſes to prove the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<hi>Cowardly.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note> Fourthly, to the teſtimonies of the Enemies he anſwered,
that it was in this caſe the beſt and ſtrongeſt of any other, it being the naturall
diſpoſition of every Souldier that takes any ſtrong Fort or City, to extoll the
Enemies valour and difficulties of winning it as much as poſſible, the more to
advance their owne proweſſe. It's no great honour in any mans judgment to
conquer a Coward, or place not tenable; therefore thoſe who detract from their
Enemies valour or ſtrength, derogate moſt from their owne Honour, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
Proweſſe, and as much diſparage themſelves as their enemies thereby:
Since then the enemies both in private diſcourſes themſelves, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with others,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Mary Smith, Ethelred Huddy, Ioane Battin, Ioſeph Proud, Mich. Sparke, Nich. Collins.</note> ſo frequently cenſured this ſurrender as <hi>cowardly, taxed the
Defendant for a Coward, and confeſſed they could not have taken the Towne, nor
all the Divels in Hell the Caſtle, had the Defendant held them valiantly out
againſt them, and not cowardly ſurrendred them beyond their expectation:</hi> their
teſtimonies backed with the premiſes, muſt be a moſt convincing evidence in
this particular.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> he objected, that Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> had been tampering with ſome Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and urging them to teſtifie againſt him: for which he produced two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flances:
The firſt was, that Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> urged Mr <hi>Haſſard,</hi> who kept the ſtores
in <hi>Briſtoll</hi> Caſtle, to atteſt there were more then 50 barrells of powder therein
when it was ſurrendred; inſomuch that Mr <hi>Haſſard</hi> told him, he would not goe
againſt his conſcience. Secondly, that he meeting with Lievtenant Colonell
<hi>Daviſon</hi> in the Street, offered him a quart of Wine, preſſing him to goe to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne,
and to ſet down what he could atteſt touching his adviſing Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi>
to ſally out upon the Enemy as ſoone as they entred, and his diſlike of drawing
his men from the Line, and his refuſing to follow this advice: which he denying
to do, Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> told him that he was engaged to give in his teſtimony, becauſe
<hi>Col. Fiennes</hi> had given him the <hi>Lye</hi> in print, in his <hi>Reply to</hi> Mr <hi>Walker;</hi> and for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:159182:32"/>
proofe hereof he produced two Witneſſes, that <hi>Daviſon</hi> told him this Story in
his chamber in <hi>Arundell<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> houſe, in the preſence of the Lord <hi>Say</hi> his, Father.</p>
               <p>To which unexpected falſe caſumny,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> returned this anſwer, which
he was ready to atteſt on his Oath: Firſt, that being ſummoned by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
himſelfe to appeare before a Councell of War, to make good what he had
written concerning the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> he did thereupon repaire to Mr
<hi>Haſſard,</hi> and other Witneſſes preſent at the ſiege, to deſire them to witneſſe the
truth onely of what they knew touching that action; which he might lawfully
doe: and becauſe Mr <hi>Haſſard</hi> kept the Magazine, he deſired him to informe him
how many barrels of powder there were in the Caſtle when it was ſurrendred;
who thereupon anſwered, there were 50: upon which he demanded, whether
there were not more then fifty? for he had ſundry Witneſſes to prove that he
confeſſed to Captain <hi>Birch</hi> and <hi>Arthur Williams,</hi> that there were 60; and to
Major <hi>Wood,</hi> that there were 70 barrels left when it was ſurrendred: and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Buſhell</hi> (then a priſoner) affirmed he found no leſſe then 70 barrels there:
if then there were more then 50, he ſhould doe well to declare the utmoſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
which he certainly knew to be there: To which he anſwered, he did thinke
there were more then 50 barrels, but how many more he could not certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and therefore he would rather teſtifie leſſe then there were, in ſetting down
fifty generally, without adding this Negative to it, <hi>and no more,</hi> which he durſt
not ſweare, for then he was ſure not to wrong his conſcience. To which Maſter
<hi>Prynne</hi> replied, that he deſired him by no meanes to wrong his conſcience in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
more then the truth, but to keep a good conſcience, in witneſſing the
full truth, and not concealing any thing to ſmother truth. At laſt Mr <hi>Haſſard</hi>
ſaid, that he was not willing to appeare againſt Colonell <hi>Fiennes,</hi> for he had
loſt moſt of his eſtate in <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and that there were arreares of pay due unto
him, for paiment whereof the Colonell had lately given him a Bill under his
hand, and if he ſhould loſe his arreares it would go hard with him. Whereupon
Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> then anſwered, hee would not preſſe him to any thing to
his prejudice, and ſo left him, he promiſing to give in his depoſition in writing
to the Advocate, which he never did. And whether this were <hi>tampering with
Witneſſes,</hi> or who had <hi>tampered</hi> moſt with <hi>Haſſard,</hi> he or the Defendant againſt
whom he was unwilling to teſtifie the truth, or all the truth, he humbly ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their honourable judgments.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> for Lievtenant <hi>Daviſon,</hi> Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> proteſted, he never ſaw the
man till he came voluntarily to him in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, and told him freely,
without any inducement on his part, that he was in the ſiege of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
<hi>Fiennes,</hi> and after that in the ſiege of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> from whence comming
lately to <hi>London,</hi> he met with a printed booke, writ by Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of Mr <hi>Walker,</hi> wherein he had given him the <hi>Lye,</hi> and a <hi>baſe Lye</hi> in the
margin, to his diſhonour; whereupon being ſenſible of this open injury, he
repaired to Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> to <hi>Arundell</hi>-houſe, and there in the Lord <hi>Say</hi> his
preſence, challenged him for giving him the <hi>Lye</hi> in print without cauſe; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to give him publike ſatisfaction, or elſe he would take ſatisfaction
himſelfe, for he would not take the Lye from any man in <hi>England:</hi> and withall
told him to his face, that he did adviſe him not to draw the Souldiers from the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:159182:33"/>
Line, but to fall upon the enemies preſently, and cut them off, as they might
have done with eaſe; but he rejecting his adviſe, called off the men, and ſo not
making a timely ſally, loſt the Towne. Whereupon the Lord <hi>Say</hi> anſwered,
Sonne you muſt take heed how you wrong any Gentleman of quality, eſpecially
in print, and if you have wronged this Gentleman you may doe well to right
him: Vpon which Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> confeſſed before his Father, he did give him ſuch
adviſe, and that hee had done him wrong in putting the <hi>Lie</hi> over againſt his
name; but it was much againſt his will through his boyes negligence; for after
he had ſent the copy of his <hi>Reply</hi> to the preſſe, wherein the <hi>Lie</hi> was written in the
margine againſt his name, he remembring this miſtake, ſent his boy purpoſely
to the Printer to charge him to blot it out and not print it, which it ſeemes his
boy (or himſelfe rather when he read the printed proofe and reviſe, where he
might have expunged it had this tale beene reall) then neglected; but he would
ſee it put out in the next Edition (a pretty flamme, ſavouring both of a lying and
cowardly ſpirit, baſely to confeſſe that to be a truth in private, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
to be a Lie in print;) Whereupon I ſeeing his freeneſſe with me, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his teſtimony material, told him that the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was now brought
into queſtion before a Councell of warre by Mr <hi>Fiennes</hi> himſelfe, whom I and
Mr <hi>Walker</hi> were ſummoned to proſecute; and therefore we ſhould deſire his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
as a witneſſe there, and ſo we parted then. Soone after the Councell of
warre was adjourned, and then meeting with Lieutenant <hi>Daviſon</hi> (who made
the ſame Relation to above twenty more in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, as he had done to
me) he told me he was going ſuddenly out of Town to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> I deſired him to
teſtifie his knowledge touching the premiſes before the Advocate ere he departed;
Whereupon hee told me, that the Lord <hi>Say</hi> was his very good friend, and had
promiſed to help him to his arreares, and therefore he was loath to appeare in
the buſineſſe, there being other witneſſes ſufficient. To which I anſwered, I would
have the Iudge Advocates warrant to bring him in as a witneſſe, and then no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
could be taken; which warrant when I had procured, I comming from
the Advocates caſually met <hi>Daviſon</hi> on horſe-back above <hi>Ludgate</hi> near the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
lodging in Pauls Church-yard, where asking of him how long he ſtayed
in Town, he anſwered that hee was to depart to <hi>Glocester</hi> the next morning;
whereupon I told him, I had a warrant to bring him in as a witneſſe from the
Advocate who was then in his lodging, which was cloſe by; and therefore ſince
he was to depart ſo ſoone, I deſired him to goe with me then to the Advocate,
to ſet down his teſtimony upon oath: which he excuſed ſaying, he had promiſed
to meet ſome friends to drink a quart or two of wine with them before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture;
and ſo we parted without more diſcourſe: And was this a tampering,
only to deſire a witneſſe to ſet downe what he voluntarily informed me, before
the Advocate, when I had a warrant to examine him? As for offering him a
quart of wine, or inviting him to a Taverne to drink, I proteſt I never did it, and
am ſo averſe from ſuch a courteſie, that to my remembrance, I have never theſe
eighteene yeares ſpace gone into any one Taverne in London or elſewhere, to
give or receive one quart of wine, but only to eat a Breakfaſt or Dinner, and
therefore it is very improbable I ſhould proffer this courteſie unto him, who
as I diſcovered then by his diſcourſe had drunk ſufficiently before, and was going
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:159182:33"/>
(as he told me) to drink more. But admit I proffered him a quart of wine, and
that in the open ſtreet, was a quart of wine, think you, ſo conſiderable a thing as
to tempt or corrupt a witneſſe of that quality? or the open ſtreet a fit place for
ſuch a purpoſe where ſo many ſaw and over-heard us? Certainly if this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
were ſo ignoble as to be corrupted with ſo poore a courteſie as a quart of
wine in the open ſtreet; I am certaine his arreares of pay in Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> owne
private Chamber in <hi>Arundell</hi> houſe, where hee had faire promiſes to receive
them, are farre more prevalent temptations to corrupt, and keep him back from
appearing here in perſon, whither the Defendant might have brought him to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
my tampering with him, had he pleaſed, he being ſtill in <hi>London,</hi> and under his
command, though he will not appeare upon our ſummons to teſtifie the truth: But
if he be ſuch a one, as Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> would intimate him, (though I have a better
opinion of the Gentlemans honeſty) that a quart of wine will biaſſe him more
them truth, I ſhould rather want his teſtimony, then put him to his oath, were
he now preſent: But being neither examined by us, nor yet intended to bee,
this impertinent cavill ſounds more of Calumny then Iudgement.</p>
               <p>But becauſe Col.<note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>Fiennes</hi> hath now given me this juſt occaſion, I ſhall in the
third place (which otherwiſe I ſhould have concealed, but that his aſperſions
have provoked me to alleadge it by way of juſt defence) truly informe your
Lordſhips: Firſt, how Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> and his Agents have tampered with, affronted,
threatned, and abuſed our witneſſes: Secondly, what advantages, obligations, and
engagements he hath upon his own witneſſes, which may probably ſway them to
over much partiality in their teſtimonies, of which we are wholly deſtitute in
reſpect of ours. Firſt, moſt of the materiall witneſſes in this cauſe were the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants
owne Officers and Souldiers, from whom they expect not only fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
preferments, but their arreares of pay, which they were in danger to loſe if
they ſhould either appeare againſt him, or he miſcarry in this caſe. Vpon this
ground not only Mr <hi>Haſſard,</hi> as you heard, was unwilling, and <hi>Daviſon</hi> refuſed
to give in his teſtimony, but one Captaine <hi>Oland</hi> (as appeares by Captaine <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringtons</hi>
depoſition) with ſundry other materialll witneſſes, denied to ſpeak
what they knew: and ſome of his Officers ſince they came hither to witneſſe
for him have ſaid, that if the cauſe went with him, (as they made little queſtion
but it would) they ſhould have all their arrears paid, elſe they ſhould loſe them;
Now whether the promiſe of arrears bee not a tampering with, and the loſſe of
them a threatning or terrifying of witneſſes, we leave your Lordſhips to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.
Beſides Mr <hi>Sprigge</hi> (Secretary to the Lord <hi>Say</hi>) went to a Noble
Knights lodging at Saint <hi>Albanes,</hi> produced as a witneſſe by the Defendant,
that ſame morning he was to give in his teſtimony, with this ſtrange prologue
to an evidence, that Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> preſented his reſpects to him, and deſired him
to come that morning to the Councell of warre to give in his teſtimony for him;
and that his Lord likewiſe deſired to be remembred to him, and to let him know
that 200 pound (of the 500) due unto him was ready for him at <hi>London</hi> upon
his returne, and the reſt of the mony ſhould be ready for him as ſoon as it could be
provided: which Captain <hi>Harington</hi> then preſent in the Knights chamber heard
and depoſed; nor could nor did <hi>Sprig</hi> deny he delivered ſuch a meſſage, but ſaid he
had ill intentions in it. To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replyed, that whatever his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:159182:34"/>
were, the words ſpoken at that ſeaſon, and upon that occaſion, tended more
to corrupt a witneſſe, then his offring a quart of wine in the open ſtreet did (had
he offred it as he did not) which was ſo much inſiſted on; And though he knew
the Knight ſo well, that no offers whatever could corrupt him; yet how ſuch
ſpeeches might work on other witneſſes who expected debts and arrears from
the Col. he could not divine; and thoſe who durſt uſe ſuch tempting ſpeeches ſo
openly in St. <hi>Albanes</hi> during the Triall, would probably make uſe of the like or
worſe temptations in private to witneſſes, to corrupt or take off their teſtimony.
However the Court by this might clearly diſcerne, which ſide was moſt guilty of
tampering with witneſſes. Thirdly, that ſome of our witneſſes ſent for thither by
the Defendant, had beene openly abuſed, affronted, quarrelled by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
and his witneſſes, even in the Councels preſence and elſewhere; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Captaine <hi>Bagnall;</hi> who though an extraordinary friend to the Defendant,
(for whom he took two journeyes to <hi>London</hi> for a Commiſſion at his own charge,
and raiſed a Company to defend the Towne) yet meerly for teſtifying the
truth impartially, was ſtrangely queſtioned and affronted by the Defendant
himſelfe, abuſed with ill language, taxed with perjury, quarrelled by <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
who gave him the Lye in the Councell Chamber before your Honours
were departed thence, challenged, ſcorned, reviled, threatned to be miſchieved,
(for all which affronts we crave your juſtice.) And if our witneſſes be thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted,
menaced, abuſed in your very preſence, how think you were others
dealt with behinde your Honours and our backs, to ſtrangle truth? A vehement
argument all hath not been rightly carried on that ſide.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider the great difficulties on our parts to procure, the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to ſuborn the witneſſes we produce. Firſt, all our witneſſes for the moſt part
are meere ſtrangers to us, all of them better known and more obliged to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
then to us: they are perſons diſ-intereſted, diſ-engaged, who neither
gaine nor loſe by the Triall, however the ſentence goe; they were never under
our ſervice, power, or commands, moſt of them were ſuch who ſerved the State
gratis, and were no mercenaries in that ſervice. We are no wayes allied to
them, have no command over them, no arrears or debts to pay them, no rewards
or preferments to beſtow upon them, no engagement to allure or enforce them;
Whereas on the contrary, the Defendant hath all the advantages and bonds that
can be tending to partiality over his witneſſes. Many of them are <hi>teſtes dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtici,</hi>
as his brother, kinſmen, ſervants, foot-boyes; moſt of the reſt his Officers and
Souldiers, againſt whom we excepted as incompetent; Firſt, becauſe they were
parties in this caſe, joyning with the Defendant in a Petition to his Excellency
for this Triall, which was granted at their requeſt as the Proclamation of his
Excellency atteſts. Secondly, becauſe they were Confederates and equally
guilty with him in this Treaſon of ſurrendring <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> moſt of them being of
his Councell of warre, and conſenting to this act; which if it prove capitall and
criminall in him, will likewiſe be ſo in them; In ſwearing therfore to acquit him
of this Treaſon in which themſelves are involved, they doe in verity ſweare to
acquit themſelves, and one to juſtifie and excuſe the other, which ought not to
be admitted; for then the fowleſt treachery that is, might and would be excuſed,
yea the greateſt Traytors acquitted, if one might teſtifie for the other in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:159182:34"/>
that particular crime whereof they all ſtand guilty.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe they all depoſe, as for their owne lives and ſafeties, ſo likewiſe for
their own honour, reputation and repairation; ſome of them in their ſpeeches
now, and moſt of them in their Petition to his <hi>Excellency,</hi> demanding reparation
in their honour from us by this very Triall: and ſo are both parties and witneſſes
in this reſpect, very unequall to be admitted.</p>
               <p>4. Some of them have carried themſelves as paſſionately in this caſe, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in menacing and abuſing our witneſſes, and our ſelves too, threatning no leſſe
then hanging to us for queſtioning this ſurrender, if the Defendant be acquitted;
and can ſuch be competent witneſſes?</p>
               <p>5. He hath very ſtrong obligations upon moſt of them, the bond of conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity
and alliance; they are his kinſmen: of ſuperiority and command; they
were his Officers, Souldiers, Servants, advanced by him at firſt, and preferred,
or promiſed preferment by him ſince; the bond of ſundry debts and arrears due
to them from him, which they are promiſed to receive if he be acquitted, and
expect to loſe if once condemned. And what ſtrong engagements, what great
advantages all theſe are to tempt or corrupt witneſſes on his part, and ſilence
them from teſtifying ought againſt him on our part; and how farre forth ſuch
witneſſes who appeare thus to be parties ſhall be allowed of in this caſe (eſpecially
ſuch as are <hi>Participes criminis</hi> (adjudged incompetent by all Lawes) and guilty
of the ſame ſurrender, we ſhall humbly referre to your juſt conſiderations.</p>
               <p>3ly.<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> The Defendant endeavoured to anſwer an objection made by Mr <hi>Prynne;</hi>
To wit, that it muſt needs be cowardly ſurrendred, becauſe the Enemies that
very morning were valiantly repulſed in all places (but that one where only an
hundred and fifty of them entred) with the loſſe of 700 mens lives, and as many
more wounded, whereas the Garriſon then loſt not above 3, or 4, and had ſcarce
any one man dangerouſly hurt in the aſſault; So as the Enemy by this great
loſſe was farre weaker, the Garriſon much ſtronger, and more couragious then
before; Whereto he briefly anſwered, that the ſlaying of 700, and wounding
700 more, was not ſo great a loſſe and diſcouragement to the Enemy, as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the Line was an encouragement.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replied,<note place="margin">Anſwer:</note> Firſt, that thoſe who entred the Line, by their
owne confeſſions were ſo farre from receiving encouragement by it,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Atteſted by</hi> Nicholas Collins <hi>and</hi> Mich. Spark Senior.</note> that they
gave themſelves all for dead men, and had no other hopes but to be quite cut off.
Secondly, their companions diſcouraged with the generall repulſe in all other
places,<note n="†" place="margin">See <hi>Serieant Hills</hi> Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> knew not of their entry in two full houres ſpace, during which time
their powder was quite ſpent, that they might have beene all cut in pieces had
the Defendant done his duty. Thirdly, a<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Nich. Collins</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> whole Regiment of their horſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
foure miles off, with a reſolution never to come on againe; therefore
the entry of ſo ſmall a party, compared with their great loſſe, could be but a very
poore encouragement, ſince they might have beene ſo eaſily repulſed at the firſt,
and ſent back by weeping Croſſe unto their retreated Companions.</p>
               <p>After this he deſcended to his Arguments, to prove the ſurrender <hi>not cowardly;</hi>
the chiefe whereof are publiſhed in print (by himſelfe or his Agents) in <hi>The
Check to the Checker</hi> of <hi>Britannicus,</hi> with the ſubſtance of his whole defence, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted

               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:159182:35"/>
His firſt Argument was this,<note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note> That he was no coward, as appeared; Firſt, by
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his apprehending and ſending away Col. <hi>Eſſex:</hi> Secondly, by his apprehending and
executing the Conſpirators at <hi>Briſtoll</hi> in the midſt of the City, even at noone
day: Thirdly, by quelling the Malignants, and diſarming the Traine-Bands of
the City: Fourthly, by his valiant behaviour at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where hee and his
brother, when the Forces were there routed, were ſome of the laſt Officers that
came off the field: Fifthly, by his charging at <hi>Keinton</hi> Battell, one of the
next to Sir <hi>William Belfoure</hi> up to the very Cannon of the Enemy, when the
horſe killed the Canoneers, as they lay under the Carriages; and by other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
particulars: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he did not cowardly ſurrender <hi>Briſtoll.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which Argument, Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> Replyed:<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> Firſt, in generall, That they did
not charge him in the Articles, <hi>to be a coward,</hi> which was not now in iſſue; nor
yet, that hee had ſhewed himſelfe cowardly in all Actions ſince he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Briſtoll;</hi> But only, <hi>That he had cowardly ſurrendred Briſtoll:</hi> And,
<hi>in hoc individuo</hi> he did and might deale <hi>cowardly,</hi> though he might be valiant
in other particulars. This is that miſtaken Paſſage the <hi>Check to the Checker</hi>
much triumphs in; let him in Gods name make his beſt advantage of it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, That the Argument was a groſſe <hi>Nonſequitur,</hi> for as a very
coward, may now and then doe valiantly upon occaſion, and yet be no valiant
man; (as ſometimes <hi>deſperatio timidos fortes facit,</hi> an experimentall proofe
whereof we finde in <hi>Timerous Staggs,</hi> who runne away at the barking of the
ſmaleſt curre, yet will encounter both dogges, horſes, men in extremity when
they are at a bay, and can runne no further;) ſo a valiant man may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
commit a cowardly action, and yet be no habituall coward. To put this out
of queſtion, We have a memorable example in the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who though
he were of a bold reſolute ſpirit, and no doubt the ſtouteſt of all the Apoſtles; as
appeares by his adventuring (at Chriſts command) <hi>to</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 14. 28. to 32.</note> 
                  <hi>walk out of the ſhip
upon the Sea it ſelfe in the midst of a ſtorme,</hi> (which hee though the Defendant
with all his faith and valour would ſcarce have adventured to doe,) his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
telling our Saviour<note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 26. 33. 34. 35. Ioh. 13. 37. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>That though all elſe ſhould be offended and forſake
him, yet he would not; And though hee ſhould die with him, yet he would not deny
him (which all the other Apoſtles likewiſe proteſted each for himſelfe.) By</hi>

                     </gap>. Iohn 18.</note> 
                  <hi>his
reſolute drawing out his ſword to reſcue Chriſt when he was apprehended by the
High. Prieſts ſervants, his cutting off</hi> Malchus <hi>eare therewith</hi> (which is more then
appeares the Defendant yet did to any Enemy,) <hi>his not putting up his ſword, nor
giving over fighting till Chriſt commanded him; and by his following our Saviour
into the very High-Prieſts Hall, when the other Diſciples forſooke him and fled:</hi>
(all acts and Arguments of extraordinary courage:) yet after he ſaw Chriſt
brought into queſtion for his life, hee ſuddenly degenerates ſo farre from his
former magnanimity, through a puſilaminous feare then ſeiſing on him, that at
the very <hi>voice of a ſilly maide, and a High-Priest ſervant, he no leſſe then thrice
denyed the knowledge of his Maſter Christ, and that with bitter Oathes and
Execrations;</hi> Should <hi>Peter</hi> in this caſe argue:</p>
               <p>I was valiant when I walked on the Sea, in the Chamber when I told Chriſt I
would rather die then deny him, in the Garden, where I fought for him, and in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:159182:35"/>
following him into the High-Prieſt Hall, whether the other Diſciples durſt not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
me: Ergo, <hi>I did not cowardly nor unworthily, in thus denying him
thrice with Oaths and Curſes in the High-Prieſts Hall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly, this were a moſt irrationall falſe Argument, becauſe courage in ſome
Actions, is no negation or extenuation of cowardize in others, almoſt in the ſelfe-ſame
nick of time. Yet this is Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> objected Argument; I have ſhewed my
ſelfe couragious, (as well as <hi>Peter</hi>) in ſome Actions; in removing Col. <hi>Eſſex,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting
the Delinquents, diſarming the Malignants of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> in the fights at
<hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Edgehill;</hi> yea, altogether as valiant as <hi>Peter,</hi> in my vaunting words
and promiſes<note n="a" place="margin">See the Depoſitions of Col. <hi>Stroude, 11. Powell,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Bagnall,</hi> Mr <hi>Haſſard</hi> and others.</note>. <hi>That I would diſpute every foot of ground with the Enemy to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
who ſhould winne it from me by inches; that my Flag of Truce ſhould bee
my winding ſheet: that I would keep the City, or it ſhould keep me, or I would lay
my bones therein?</hi> (Oh brave vaunting <hi>Peter!</hi>) yea, I was pretty full of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
during the ſiege, till the Enemy entred the Line, and then I was juſt like
<hi>Peter</hi> entring the High-Prieſts Hall; I <hi>followed the Enemy</hi> a far off, and fell from
<hi>fighting,</hi> to <hi>Parling;</hi> from <hi>defending,</hi> to <hi>ſurrending</hi> the City and Caſtle; before
any Out-Fort taken, or one ſhot or aſſault made againſt City or Caſtle: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
I did not cowardly or unworthily ſurrender them now, having ſhewed my
ſelfe ſo valiant in deeds before.</p>
               <p>But ſince <hi>Peters</hi> Priſtine valorus acts, ſpeeches, did no wayes mitigate nor
extenuate, but aggravate his ſubſequent cowardly denyalls of Chriſt, ſo will the
Defendants his ſurrender.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, his forementioned valorous exploits have no relation at all to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
ſurrender of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> being of a different nature from them, his proweſſe therefore
in the one, can never expiate, nor diſ-affirme this cowardize in the other,
the only thing we now charge and prove, theſe other objected Actions being not
here in queſtion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He gave this Anſwer to the objected particulars; ſo farre forth only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
as they were applyed to <hi>Briſtols</hi> ſurrender: Firſt, That the ſudden ſurpriſall of
Col. <hi>Eſſex,</hi> being done at a<note n="b" place="margin">See the full Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 4. 5.</note> private houſe out of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> when the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
had his Troops about him, and Col. <hi>Eſſex</hi> only three or foure ſervants
neare him; was a greater act of prudence then courage, and a man not really
valiant would have done as much: Secondly, That when hee apprehended the
Conſpirators, he had the abſolute Command of the City and Caſtle, a ſtrong
Garriſon in both, and the major part of the City and Countrey ſiding with him:
It was therefore no great argument of extraordinary valour to apprehend them
being but few in number, weak in power, and ſuddenly ſurpriſed at unawares.
And when he executed them, all the Malignants were diſarmed, the whole City,
Country generally incenſed againſt them for their horred Treachery, and their
party unable to make the leaſt reſiſtance, ſo as a childe might have put them to
death as ſecurely as the Defendent. Therefore this could be no convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his courage: Thirdly, That the Malignants were quelled by the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the Plot; and the diſarming of the Traine Band, to arme his own
ſouldiers, and beſt affected Citizens, was by the generall conſent of the Mayor,
Sheriffes, and moſt part of the Citizens, after the conſpiracy detected without
any the leaſt reſiſtance; <hi>Ergo</hi> no act of courage, but rather of diſcretion or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:159182:36"/>
Fourthly, That at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> all the horſe were routed and fled, and his
own and brothers Troops among the reſt, is no great Argument of their valours,
which received ſome blemiſh by that action: And that hee and his brother
were ſome of the laſt Officers of horſe who there came off the Field, it might
be, as well becauſe they were in the reare of all the horſe, and ſo could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
flie out of the field before the reſt, as by reaſon of any extraordinary valour
in them more then others, and ſo no convincing proofe of valour in them. Fifthly,
That his valiant charging in Sir <hi>William Balfoures</hi> Regiment at <hi>Edgehill</hi> where
every man did valiantly, and none turned their backs in all that Brigade, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he principally glories, and the <hi>Check to the Checker,</hi> moſt tryumpheth in) can be
no ſpeciall proofe of his courage, ſince every coward will charge in Company
where no man turneth his back, and where there is greater danger in flying
then charging: However admit it were good evidence, yet this is a very ill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell
if put into a logicall forme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Col Fiennes charged valiantly with Sir William Balfoure at Edgehill: Ergo,
he did not cowardly ſurrender Briſtoll.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond Argument to prove the ſurrender not cowardly,<note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> was his not quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> immediatly upon Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> defeat at the <hi>Deviſes,</hi> and
his raiſing of men, armes, and perfecting the works even after that to defend it,
when many of the Countrey Gentlemen left the Town, and marched to <hi>London,</hi>
with Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered:<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> Firſt, that hee did but his duty in all this,
which was rather an Argument of his deligence then courage.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> That it had been the greateſt treachery and cowardize in the world
upon Sir <hi>Williams</hi> bare defeat, to quit a City of ſo great conſequence, which hee
was charged to keep by his Commiſſion, and in fortifying whereof hee had ſpent
ſo great coſts, before the Enemy came before it: who might probably, as things
then ſtood, have no reall intention preſently to beſiege it, upon that defeat.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> Extraordinary diligence in fortifying, is the greateſt Argument of
feare and cowardiſe if<note n="c" place="margin">Hence as <hi>Plutarch</hi> (writes the <hi>Spartians</hi> would not wall about their City, placing their ſafety in their Armes, not walls.)</note> not ſeconded with anſwerable proweſſe in defending
what is fortified: a coward will ſooner provide Armour of Proofe, then a truly
valiant man; ſince therefore the City was no longer defended, when fortified
and manned, this reaſon will rather convict then acquit him of cowardize.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The true reaſon why ſo many Gentlemen then diſerted the City, was
(as themſelves have confeſſed) not for that they deemed it untenable; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they feared and diſcerned, the Denfendant intended not to keep it to the
laſt,<note place="margin">4.</note> but to ſurrender it to the Enemies hand; which he hath clearly enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
in his Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> This Argument in verity, is no more in effect, but a Governour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
Armes, Souldiers, Canons, Ammunition, to defend a Town of importance,
or to encounter the Enemy, and then ſurrenders it (as he hath done) in leſſe then
three dayes ſiege; or runs away after he hath ſtood a charge or two; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he did
not cowardly herein, becauſe he provided men and Armes, whoſe valiant uſe,
not diligent preparation, is the only proofe of valour.</p>
               <p>His third argument was;<note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> No man could have expected leſſe ſafty of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then himſelfe, he only being excepted out of the generall pardon offered
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:159182:36"/>
to the Souldiers and Citizens; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he ſurrendred it not cowardly.</p>
               <p>To which was Anſwered:<note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> Firſt, That it is probable his ſpeedy, unexpected
ſurrender of the Town and Caſtle, before extremity, proceeded either from a fear
to loſe his life in holding them out till the laſt, or a deſire to purchaſe his Peace
and Pardon out of which he was formerly excepted from the King, with ſo rich
a prize of conſequence as <hi>Briſtoll</hi> was, which would moſt certainly procure it,
with infinite advantage to the King, and greateſt prejudice to the Parliament.
Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> That if he could have expected leſſe ſafty of conditions then any
other, for the reaſon alledged, this ſhould have rather engaged him, to hazard his
life in defending it to the utmoſt extremity; then to yeeld it upon any termes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
to his own ſecurity, which is firſt provided for in the Articles.</p>
               <p>His fourth was,<note place="margin">Argum. 4.</note> That he could never have undergone more danger in the Caſtle
had he held it, then he did in the Guards, which he diligently viſited; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he
ſurrendred it not cowardly.</p>
               <p>To which was Anſwered:<note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> He received no hurt at the Guards, and loſt but 6, or 8
men at moſt in the ſiege. <hi>Ergo,</hi> if he might with as little danger and loſſe have
held out the Caſtle, his crime and cowardize was the greater in ſurrendring it
ſo diſhonourably without ſtroke, or once retiring to it.</p>
               <p>His fifth,<note place="margin">Argum. 5.</note> Was from his cariage when the Enemies entred, to prevent whoſe
taking the City, he had only two meanes left. The firſt was, to fire the Suburbs,
for which hee iſſued out a Warrant (as his univerſall witneſſe for every occaſion
Lievtenant <hi>Clifton</hi> affirmed, a meere party and Delinquent, who adviſed the
Parley, ſurrender, and called all off the Line upon paine of death:) which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
was not executed,<note place="margin">See the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note> but revoked for want (as he alledged) of men to fire
them: The ſecond, was to fire the City behinde them, and ſo to retreat into the
Caſtle; which he could not poſſibly doe without the death of many innocents,
men, women, children; and ruining of many mens Eſtates: A fact ſo horrid,
that his tender conſcience would no wayes permit its execution, hee being loath
to begin ſo ill a preſident, which would have infinitely redounded to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
diſhonour: Beſides, the Caſtle being not large enough to containe halfe
his horſe and foot, and the ſtreets very narrow, he could not have retyred into
it, without great difficulty and danger of being cut off by the Enemy, and thoſe
horſe and foot which could not be received would have been utterly loſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the Enemies cruelty. Upon which conſiderations only, not out of any
cowardize, he did by <hi>Cliftons</hi> adviſe call a Councell of Warre, and propound
a Parly, whereupon the ſurrender enſued. Therefore it was not cowardly.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replyed: Firſt, That it is apparent by this Argument, that
if the Suburbs had been fired, the City, Caſtle might have been ſaved, and the
Enemies beaten out when lodged in the Surburbs: Therefore he ought in this
caſe both by the<note n="d" place="margin">9. E. 4. 35 b. 12. H. 8. 16. b. Br Treſpas 406. Dyer 36. b.</note> 
                  <hi>Common and Marſhall Law,</hi> to have fired the Suburbs to
preſerve the City, Caſtle, and muſt anſwer his negligence in not doing it; his
want of men to fire the Suburbs being a frivilous excuſe, ſince he had at leaſt
2300 Garriſon Souldiers; and Mr <hi>Haſſard</hi> the Gunner (as he acknowledged to
divers,) and <hi>Major Wood,</hi> with others offered to beat, or fire them out of the
Suburbs but could not be permitted, though it might have been done with eaſe,
the houſes being combuſtible, moſt of them built with Timber, and that part of
the Suburbs not very large.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:159182:37"/>
Secondly, That between the part of that Surburbs and body of the City, there
was a Key on the weſtſide of <hi>Froome-bridge,</hi> unfordable by horſe or foot every
Tyde, by reaſon of the waters, and at low-water too, through the deepneſſe of
the mudde, being ſo deep in moſt places, that men muſt ſtick faſt in it (as ſome
as the Conſpirators did upon the diſcovery of the conſpiracy, who were taken
<note n="e" place="margin">Atteſted by Col. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pham</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> 
                  <hi>ſticking in the mudde;</hi>) That there is no matching over the Key in File or
Rank, but only one by one, in confuſed order. That on the Key ſide next the
City, there is a wall of ſtone neare 8 or 9 foot high above the mudde, which no
horſe can enter nor no foot ſcale, unleſſe at a ſlip or two, which are but narrow,
and ſtand 4 or 5 foot above the water: That there are houſes all a long the Key,
which commanded the Colledge ſide where the Enemy entred in ſuch ſort, that
none of them could offer to wade over the Key, but they might be cut off with eaſe,
that two or three Pieces of Ordnance planted at the head and lower end of the
Key, would ſo ſcouer all that paſſage, that none could have paſſed over without
loſſe of life, and the paſſage, there, would have been ſo difficult, that one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men would eaſily have kept out ten thouſand, all which was atteſted by Col.
<hi>Popham,</hi> Lievtenant Col. <hi>Paleologus,</hi> Major <hi>Wood,</hi> Lievtenant Col. <hi>Andrewes,</hi>
Cap. <hi>Bagnall,</hi> and ſome of his own witneſſes upon croſſe examinations: therefore
there was no danger of the Enemies entry there. For <hi>Frome-gate</hi> it ſelfe, it had a
new <hi>Percullis,</hi> and after the Enemies entring the Line, and late ſally on them,
the very<note n="*" place="margin">Ioan Battin, <hi>Mrs</hi> Haſſard.</note> Maides and Women, in the face of the Enemy, made a Barracado and
Bulwork againſt it 15 or ſixteen foot thick with earth and ſacks of Wooll, to keep
them from entring there, being their only <hi>paſſage</hi> into the City from that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs;
That above the Gate was the River <hi>Froome</hi> (which runnes under it) with
a Wall and Houſes between the City and it, ſo as the Enemy might eaſily have
been kept from entring the body of the Towne, and could not have entred it,
without infinite loſſe and diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> that had they gotten over the Key, or <hi>Froome</hi> River into the
body of the City, yet the ſtreets were ſo narrow and diſadvantagious to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
that their paſſage might have eaſily been hindred, the ſtreets blocked up
with caskes, carts, ſleids, ſtooles, and a Piece of Ordnance or two placed at the
head of every ſtreet, and the houſes lined with Musketers would have ſo ſcoured
and ſecured it, that the Enemy muſt have ſuſtained extraordinary loſſe, at leaſt 50
or an 100 men for one of ours, as they loſt before in the ſtorming. Beſides, they muſt
have all marched up the hill, in paved ſtreets which are ſo ſlippery, that the foot
could have hardly ſtood to charge, and the horſe would certainly have ſlipt and
fallen: in regard of which diſadvantages, our men having the hill, flankers, the
ſhelter of houſes, and charging downwards, muſt needs have repulſed them with
extraordinary loſſe had they forcibly entred, and made a moſt ſafe retreat into
the Caſtle at any time when they ſaw juſt cauſe, without any ſuch difficuly or
danger as was ſuggeſted.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> Admit they had taken the body of the Town beyond the Key, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
to the Caſtle, which they could not have done without exceſſive loſſe
and great difficulty, yet all that part of the Town being commanded either by the
Caſtle, or other Forts and Out works all in our profeſſion (as <hi>Clifton</hi> himſelf with
other of the Defendants Witneſſes confeſſed, and Major <hi>Wood</hi> proved) they could
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:159182:37"/>
not poſſibly have held it long, and would have been in worſe condition with in
it then before, and ſo no abſolute neceſſity of firing it, had not his courage and
conſcience ſerved him to doe it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> For his horſe and foot, incontainability in the Caſtle, in caſe he had
been forced to retire into it, there were ſundry other places to beſtowe them in,
beſides the Caſtle: As firſt, the body of the City adjoyning to the Caſtle, which
would have billited them all till the Enemy had forced it: Secondly, that part of
the Suburbs, under the command of the Caſtle next to Lawfords Gate, diſtinct
from the body of the City if taken, and very defenſible, the Caſtle, and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
then remaining ours: Thirdly, the Out-Forts, where the Guards might
have been doubled or trebled as there was cauſe, eſpecially now when he had an
overplus of men that he know not how to beſtow: Fourthly, that part of the
City beyond the bridge in Sommerſet-ſhire ſide, which was very capacious, able
to containe all his ſupernumerary foot and horſe, though the other Suburbs
and body had been taken; which part (the bridge being broken down or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended)
had been inacceſſible, ſtrong, and tenable for a long time againſt all his
Majeſties Forces, we having then all the Out-Forts in poſſeſſion which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
other parts of the Town, and <hi>Ratcliff</hi> Church, <hi>Tower-Harris,</hi> and the
Caſtle (three extraordinary ſtrong Forts) commanding and ſecuring that part
beyond the bridge; which being fenced with extraordinary ſtrong Out-works,
and deep watrey Dikes, <hi>Tower-Harris,</hi> and <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> Church on the one ſide,
with the River, and Caſtle on the other ſide, and ſtrongly garriſoned with the
Souldiers retired from other parts, had been almoſt impregnable, and might
have held the Enemies play for ſundrey Moneths, had the Defendant reſolved
to hold it to the utmoſt. Having therefore ſo many ſeverall ſafe retreats, and recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles
for his horſe, foot, and not making uſe of any of them, though hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to diſpute every inch of ground with the Enemy (as he might have done
with honour and great advantage) his pretence is falſe, his ſurrender cowardly
beyond all excuſe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6.</note> He hath oft inculcated this to your Honours, that the Citizens were
generally very malignant, and diſaffected to the Parliament; and we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the<note n="*" place="margin">Iames Powell, Abel Kelley, William Deane, <hi>Mrs</hi> Haſſard, <hi>and others.</hi>
                  </note> moſt of the beſt affected, had carried their eſtates and three months
proviſion into the Caſtle, where their perſons and goods were by the Defendant
promiſed to be ſecured. His forbearing therefore to fire the City in caſe he had bin
neceſſitated to it, proceeded not from any publike care he had of the Parliaments
friends or Kingdoms ſafety, but from his private reſpects to the perſons and eſtats
of Malignants; which he would rather carefully preſerve to enrich, encourage,
and ſtrengthen the Enemies, then fire or endanger to preſerve the Parliament and
Kingdome: Mercy and compaſſion are doubtleſſe commendable vertues in a
Govournour, who ſhould not uſe cauteries or firing till the utmoſt extremity:
But when ſuch an exigency happens, that a City might be fired, or both it and
the Kingdome loſt or hazarded, it is fooliſh cruelty not Chriſtian mercy, to bee
over-pitifull in ſuch a caſe. It is a cruell deſtructive mercy to ſave a City (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Malignant one, as this is averred then to have been) to deſtroy a Kingdome,
yea, our Religion, Lawes, and Liberties with it: Better the greateſt part of the
City had been turned into Aſhes to preſerve the Caſtle and others parts of it to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:159182:38"/>
Parliament, and ſecure the Realme, then to ſurrender the whole ſo cowardly
ſo unexpectedly, to the loſſe of the Weſt, and Kingdome in all probability.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7.</note> the Defendant well knew of what extraordinary concernment the
loſſe of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> would be to the Kingdome, of what infinite advantage to the
Enemy, as is evident by his owne Letter to my Lord <hi>Say</hi> (dated March 20
1643. before it was fortified or fully garriſoned) publiſhed in his printed <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
pag. 13. where thus he writes.</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip to underſtand firſt the importance of this City of
<hi>Briſtoll,</hi> &amp;c. The Enemy hath lately caſt his eye upon it, prompted by the witty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of our Malignants, to eſpye his advantage: If he poſſeſſe this City, he will reap
theſe benefits by our loſſe. 1. He will get much Money, Armes, and Ammunition
in a more cheap and leſſe hazardous way, then he can have them out of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countreyes;
all which he will pay for with Monopolies, and engroſments of Trade,
things with which the great ones of this Towne have beene well acquainted, and are
therefore Malignant. 2. If hee gaine this Town, he will<note n="*" place="margin">It himſelfe or ſome of his had been Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of it.</note> ſoone ſubdue <hi>Gloceſter,</hi>
and become maſter of all the Tract between <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and the <hi>Lyzards point</hi> in
<hi>Cornwall,</hi> a Quarter ſo plentifull, as his plundering Army yet never ſaw. 3. He
will become maſter of all the Traffick of that Inland Sea the <hi>Severn,</hi> and make all
the ſhipping both of the <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts his owne. 4. His Neighbourhood
to <hi>Wales</hi> will from time to time ſupply him with a body of foot. 5. Wee ſhall loſe a
great Port Towne very important for the ſervice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Fit to give Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rebels of that place, or any other Enemy. <hi>Since therefore hee
knew this City to be of ſo great importance to the Kingdome, and the loſſe of it
ſo extraordinarily advantagious to the Enemy, he ſhould in this reſpect have
held it out to the utmoſt extremity, and rather hazarded the firing of it by the
Enemy which would not have done it, (eſpecially being Malignant) or himſelfe,
then quitted both it and the Caſtle to, with all the Ammunition, Canon, Armes,
Proviſions, Colours, Ships, Merchandize, Wealth therein, upon ſuch poore diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
termes, before any Out-fort taken, or one ſhot made againſt the
City or Caſtle walls; he wanting nothing but courage to defend them, the Enemy
having loſt ſo many, and himſelfe ſo few in the former ſtormings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſixth Argument was,<note place="margin">Argum. 6.</note> that he ſtood in places of greateſt danger with his
Troop, neare Alderman <hi>Iones</hi> his houſe, where a Granado falling into the midſt
of his Troop, and hurting no man, he thereupon encouraged his ſouldiers, ſaying,
<hi>that God did protect them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which was anſwered,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 1. That not one of his Troop (for ought appeares)
was ever hurt in that or any other place where he ſtood with them; therefore
the danger was not very great. 2. That this place under Alderman <hi>Iones</hi> his
houſe, was more then Canon proofe, and moſt ſecure againſt the Enemies ſhot,
which the houſe and Garden walls guarded off being between the Enemy and
his Troop; therefore no place of danger but ſecurity. 3. That this Granadoes
falling in among the Troop at that time, was meerly caſuall; and hurt not any
though it frighted many, and made the Defendant and his Troop preſently to
remove from thence, as his owne witneſſes depoſed. 4. Himſelfe never charged
the Enemy in perſon with his Troop after their entry within the Line; his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
therefore with them in this ſecure place before the entry, was no great proof
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:159182:38"/>
of his valour, much leſſe that the ſurrender was not cowardly.</p>
               <p>His ſeventh Argument,<note place="margin">Argum. 7.</note> to prove the ſurrender not cowardly, was, That the
Parley and Surrender were both agreed on by the Councell of warre; Ergo
not cowardly.</p>
               <p>To which was anſwered,<note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> That himſelfe was both the<note n="*" place="margin">See Col. <hi>Stroodes</hi> Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and Remonſtrance</note> firſt mover, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwader
of this Parley, this ſurrender, and the principall man that advanced it,
drawing on the reſt to conſent to it, and not making the leaſt oppoſition againſt
it. 2. That the Councell of war wherein the Parley was firſt propounded, was not
generall, as it ought to have been, but private, few of his Officers or the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
there, having notice of it, till a Parley was concluded, and a Drummer
diſpatched twice to the Enemy before they would take notice of it. At this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
no Countrey Gentlemen were preſent, but Sis <hi>Iohn Horner,</hi> who gave no
vote and<note n="a" place="margin">Col. <hi>Stroods</hi> Depoſit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Sir <hi>Iohn Horners</hi> teſtimony.</note> Col. <hi>Stroode</hi> who voted againſt it, and not above ſix or ſeven Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
of which Lievtenant Col. <hi>Daviſon,</hi> and Major <hi>Holmes</hi> were two, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the Parley; as for Mr <hi>Edward Stephens</hi> (whom Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> averred in
<note n="b" place="margin">Relations p. 9</note> print to be preſent at it) he denies upon oath, <hi>that</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">See both their Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> 
                  <hi>he had ever any notice
of it;</hi> and ſo doth Col. <hi>Stephens</hi> to. Being therefore ſuch a private Conventicle
and no generall Councell, and theſe thus voting againſt the Parley, it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
evidence then diſproofe of a Cowardly ſurrender. 3. The Defendant and his
brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> to circumvent the Councell, and draw them on both to a Parley
and ſurrender, miſinformed them, that <hi>there were but 20 barrels of Powder, and</hi>
400 <hi>weight of Match left:</hi> as he confeſſeth in his Anſwer to the eight Article,
<note n="d" place="margin">See Maior <hi>Dowets</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> commanding Mr <hi>Haſſard</hi> (who kept the ſtores) to affirme <hi>there was no more,</hi>
when as you have heard it proved there was above three times as much more then
in the Caſtle. His miſ-information therefore being the chiefe motive to ſway the
Councell to this Parley and ſurrender, their conſents will not excuſe but aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
his Cowardize and trechery in ſeducing them. 4. If the Town and Caſtle
were tenable, ſufficiently provided with all neceſſaries for a defence, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to extremity, as we have proved, the ſurrender by a Councell of warre
will not make the Cowardlineſſe and trechery leſſe but greater; and ſubject
the whole Councell to cenſure, as appeares by the Caſes of<note n="e" place="margin">See the <hi>Doom of Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Weſton, Gominyes,</hi>
and others adjugded in Parliament: Otherwiſe, if this plea ſhould be admitted
for a juſtification, a Governour and his Officers might ſafely without danger
betray any Fort or place through Cowardize or trechery by voting it in a
Councell firſt, and then putting it in execution.</p>
               <p>His eighth Argument was,<note place="margin">Argum. 8.</note> That when he ſent to the Enemy for a Parley, and
their Hoſtages came to <hi>Froome-gate</hi> which was barracadoed up, they ſwore,
<hi>God damne us, we will come in at Froome-gate</hi> (which was the neareſt way) <hi>or
have no Parley at all;</hi> whereupon he ſent them this reſolute anſwer, <hi>that they
ſhould not come in there, but at Newgate,</hi> which they were enforced to doe after
much conteſt; Ergo the ſurrender was not Cowardly.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 1. That at that time <hi>Froom-gate</hi> was<note n="f" place="margin">See the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of <hi>Ione Battin</hi> and Mrs <hi>Haſſard.</hi>
                  </note> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racadoed
up with a Bulwark of earth and wooll-ſacks 15 or 16 foot thick to
keep out the Enemy, made by the very women and maids, with the help of a
few men, in a ſhort ſpace; and when the Hoſtages came to that gate, the work
was raiſed ſo high, that Captaine <hi>Taylor,</hi> the Defendants owne witneſse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:159182:39"/>
                  <hi>he could not ſee nor conferre with them over it, but was enforced to goe to ſpeak
with them through a window, when he received their God-damne-me meſſage,</hi> that
<hi>they would come in at that gate, or elſe returne:</hi> from which window likewiſe he
returned the Governours anſwer to them. Now to demoliſh ſuch a Barracado
as this, to let in theſe peremptory Hoſtages, and the Enemy too, who might then
have cleare paſſage into the City, had been ſuch an undiſcreet and cowardly Act,
as was not only below the ſpirit of a Governour, or ſouldier, but of a ſucking
childe, and would have argued the Defendant (if condiſcended to) a man utterly
deſtitute, not only of courage but common diſcretion. 2. This braving unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
requeſt argues plainly, that the enemies had a very meane conceit of the
Defendants valour, elſe they would never have preſumed to ſend him ſuch a
diſdainfull meſſage, which an Heroick ſpirit would have ſo far reſented, as not to
brooke a Parley upon any termes; and his not yeelding to it, is no greater an
evidence that the ſurrender following was not Cowardly, then that the building
of <hi>Tinterton Steeple</hi> was the cauſe of the encreaſe of <hi>Goodwin ſands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ninth Argument was his courage and ſpeeches at the Parley,<note place="margin">Argum. 9.</note> wherein he
confeſſed, 1.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See his Letter to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,</hi> p. 3. 10. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Counceil of warre, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them our condition, and beſides laid open unto them our ſmall ſtore of Ammunition, &amp;c.</note> That the motion of the Parley proceeded meerly from himſelfe.
2. That the Parley was concluded on before ever the Maior repaired to the
Councell. 3. He ſaid, <hi>the Maior was extraordinary fearfull, and preſſed earneſtly
for an agreement with the Enemy.</hi> 4. That when the Enemies Commiſſioners at
the Parley, upon the motion of Captain <hi>Birch,</hi> that the Citizens might have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to carry away their eſtates if they pleaſed, ſtuck at this demand, hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
roſe up, and with great earneſtneſſe proteſted, that he would break off the
Parley, and rather loſe his life, AND HOLD AND PUT IT TO THE
UTMOST EXTREMITY, then not provide for the ſecurity of the Citizens
eſtates: which ſpeeches he proved by the teſtimonies of Captaine <hi>Birch,</hi> and Mr
<hi>Prickman.</hi> Ergo he did not cowardly ſurrender the Town and Caſtle.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>Mr Prynne</hi> replied;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 1. That the motion of the Parley proceeding
originally from himſelfe before any ſollicitations from the Maior or Citizens, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
that himſelfe was more fearfull then the Maior, though thus extraordinary
timorous; and that both the Parly &amp; ſurrender proceeded from his exceſſive fear.
2. That we had here <hi>confitentem reum,</hi> that he held not the Town till utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
as his duty bound him. For he told the Commiſſioners, if they would
not yeeld to ſecure the Citizens goods (whom he frequently brands for deſperate
Malignants) <hi>he would then venture his life, and put and hold it to the utmoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:</hi>
therefore he held it not by his own confeſſion till ſuch extremity; and ſo by
the very Articles of War, and conſtruction of Law, is guilty of a Cowardly, and
Traytorly ſurrender, for which he ought to dye. And here obſerve the ſtrange
temper and guilt of the Defendant: My Lords, hee was conſtituted Governour
of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> not by the Maior and Citizens, but his Excellency and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to preſerve it from the Enemies hands, rather for the Kingdomes ſafety,
then ſecurity of the Malignant Citizens goods. He had formerly oft proteſted to
the beſt affected Souldiers and Citizens, that<note n="*" place="margin">Iames Powell, Col. Strood, Capt. Bagnall, Abel Kelley.</note> 
                  <hi>hee would diſpute every inch of
ground with the Enemy, from the Out-works to the gates, from thence to the Caſtle,
whither he would make his laſt retreat, and there lay his bones, making his winding
ſheet his flagge of truce,</hi> and the like, for the Common good and ſecurity of them and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:159182:39"/>
the Realm. But now alas, as ſoone as the Enemy entred the Line, <hi>Heu quantum
mutatus ab illo?</hi> he became a quite other man, and forgetting all former valiant
promiſes, heroick reſolutions for the Republicke, he preſently ſent for a Parly, and
diſputes not ſo much as one inch of ground with the Enemy neare the Gates or
body of the City, retires not one foot towards the Caſtle, &amp; inſteed of adventring
his life to preſerve the City for the Parliaments and Kingdomes ſafety againſt
the Iriſh Rebels, and Welch Malignants incurſions, hee hath not ſo much as
one word or thought tending that way: but all publike engagements ſet aſide,
he now only lookes after the ſecurity of his own perſon, and of the Malignant
Citizens perſons, Eſtates for the Enemies future advantage, and rather then theſe
ſhall not be ſaved, he now proteſts he will loſe his life, and put all to utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.
Had hee really intended to make good this his proteſtation for the
Citizens benefit and ſafety, in caſe the Enemies had denied his demand in their
behalf, (which I much doubt of, ſince notwithſtanding his foreſaid Proteſtations,
he would not doe it for the publike;) I humbly conceive hee ought much more
in point of honour and duty to have executed it for the whole Kingdomes
preſervation and utility; which ſince he did not really perform nor intend to do it,
you have here <hi>confitentem reum,</hi> an evidence dropping from his own mouth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to condemn him: And therefore my humble motion to your Honours is, that
his perſon may preſently be ſecured as by Law it ought. The rather, becauſe it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears by all the cariages of the Defendant from the enemies firſt entry till his
return to <hi>London,</hi> that this ſurrender proceeded meerely from timidity and cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
at the beſt, as I ſhall evidence by theſe particulars.</p>

was cowardly and unworthily ſurrendred, was firſt raiſed by Mr <hi>Prynne,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor,
in his Book intituled <hi>Romes Master-Piece,</hi> p. 35. publiſhed (as he ſaid)
the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1643. within five dayes after the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and
that before the publiſhing of this Book, it was not ſo reported, reputed
by any.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replyed:<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> That this was a moſt falſe calumny without
the leaſt ſhadow of truth; For firſt, though the Title of his <hi>Romes Master-Piece,</hi>
was written and licenſed for the Preſſe by a Committee of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Houſe (who earneſtly, deſired him to tranſlate and publiſh the Letters
and Plot therein compriſed, with ſuch obſervations as he thought meet, and they
ſhould approve) on <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 1. 1643, yet the Book it ſelfe was not compiled,
nor fully printed off till the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> or after, the publication being neare
a Moneth ſpace after the licence; before which time, not only <hi>Mercurius Auli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
had enformed the world in Print; <hi>That Nathaniel Fiennes</hi> (by name, whom
I named not) <hi>had beſtowed Briſtoll on the King, &amp;c.</hi> (which words were read out
of <hi>Aulicus;</hi>) but likewiſe many <hi>London Mercuries</hi> (and namely, that from Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the 31 of <hi>Iuly</hi> till <hi>Aug.</hi> 7. p. 17) had divulged in Print, <hi>That Briſtoll was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
delivered to the Enemy; that if Col. Maſſey had been Governor in his place
it had not been ſurrendred at all, but held out ſtill, &amp;c.</hi> And in truth the ſurrender
thereof to the Enemy in ſo ſhort a ſpace, was ſo far beyond all mens thoughts or
apprehention, that the very firſt tydings of it, made moſt men openly aver in every
place, it was moſt cowardly and unworthily at leaſt, if not treacherouſly ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to the Enemies. This was not only <hi>Vox Popult,</hi> in <hi>London, Westminster,</hi> and
elſewhere; but <hi>Vox Parliamenti,</hi> the opinion of the Commons Houſe (if not
the Lords too) who were much dejected at the newes; which the Defendant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:159182:41"/>
ſelfe taking notice off upon his very firſt euery into the houſe after his return
from this noble exploit; where every one looked ſtrangly on him with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
aſpect, and few or none of his deareſt friends once moved their hats unto
him, (as they uſually doe to all other members, upon their arrivall from any
publike ſervice after ſome time of abſence;) and ſome of them minded him of
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr</hi> Samuel Brown.</note> 
                  <hi>Gomineys</hi> and <hi>Weſtons</hi> caſe; whereupon he conſcious to himſelfe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
generall ill opinion of this action, to avoid their examination and cenſure,
was enforced to make his Apology for it oprnly in the Houſe, <hi>August</hi> 5. 1643.
in the cloſe whereof (conteining his bare Relation, no wayes ſatisfactory,)
he deſired<note n="a" place="margin">Page. 13.</note>, <hi>That what he had affirmed might bee examined at a Councell of
Warre, that ſo he might be cleared or condemned according as they ſhould finde the
truth or falſhood of what hee had declared.</hi> Which paſſage of his, publiſhed in
Print long before <hi>Romes Maſter-Piece,</hi> is a pregnant evidence and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement,
that the very Houſe of Commons conceived this ſurrender pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
either from his cowardize or treachery; elſe there had been no need of
any long Apology, or ſuch a reference as this <hi>to a Councell of Warre:</hi> And indeed
his owne printed <hi>Relation,</hi> is ſo full of palpable ſhifts, and<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>See p.</hi> 8. 9. 10. 11. &amp; Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,</hi> p. 3. 4. &amp;c.</note> expreſſions of a
timorous ſpirit, that the very reading of it, confirmed me and others in this
opinion, That the <hi>ſurrender was cowardly or treacherous;</hi> and my paſſage in
<hi>Romes Maſter-Piece</hi> concerning the inconveniences of <hi>Briſtols</hi> ſurrender, with
reference to the <hi>Welch, and Iriſh Rebels,</hi> were taken <hi>verbatim</hi> out of his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Relation,</hi> p. 13. where thus he writes, <hi>If the Enemy poſſeſſe Bristol, his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berhood
of Wales will from time to time ſupply him with a body of foot. We ſhall looſe
a Port Town very important for the ſervice of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and fit to give landing
to the Rebels of that place or any other.</hi> By all which it is clear, that I was not the
firſt raiſer of the Report of its cowardly ſurrender, but that himſelfe and others
then in print had raiſed this report, before I publiſhed any thing to this purpoſe.
Secondly, To put this out of queſtion; Firſt, it evidently appears by the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of Mr <hi>Edward Stephens, Thomas Munday, William Deane, Ioan Battin,
Abel Kelly, Arthur Williams, Miſtriſſe Haſſard, Richard Butler, Mary Smith,
Ethelred Huddy, Ioſeph Proud, Ieremy Holway, Anthony Gale,</hi> and others, That
<hi>both the Souldiers and Citizens of Briſtoll were much diſcontented with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
Parly and ſurrender when it was but in agitation, &amp; openly ſaid, they were
betrayed;</hi> and that not they only, but the very Enemies, <hi>concluded the ſurrender
to be cowardly, before we had any tidings of it;</hi> Secondly, Sir <hi>Iohn Horner</hi> (his own
witneſſe) depoſeth; that in their comming up to <hi>London,</hi> before we had any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, (they being the firſt who came thence &amp; brought tidings of it,) two or
three Miniſters ſpake againſt it,<note n="†" place="margin">Yea, himſelf by the way told Mr <hi>Powell</hi> and others, he would not come to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but paſſe into <hi>France</hi> to avoyd the ſhame of this action.</note> 
                  <hi>as cowardly and unworthy;</hi> Thirdly, Major <hi>Allen</hi>
atteſteth, that he and ſome other Officers preſent in the ſiege, concluded it ſo in
their private diſcourſe, as they retreated from <hi>Briſtol</hi> before they came to
<hi>London;</hi> Fourthly, it was generally reported cowardly or traitorly both in
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminſter</hi> upon the firſt notice of it; and ſome women in the ſtreets
openly called the Defendant <hi>a coward,</hi> for this unworthy action; which his
own<note n="*" place="margin">Mr <hi>Hodges,</hi> and Mr <hi>Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb,</hi> can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt this.</note> Ladie Mother condemned, and would not believe at firſt (affirming, that
her Sonne was of a more valorous ſpirit and honourable extraction, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up a place of ſuch conſequence as <hi>Briſtol</hi> in ſo ſhort a time, where he had
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:159182:41"/>
promiſed to ſpend his life and lay his bones, rather then quit it; and all this
before I took any ſpeciall notice of it. Whereupon having ſome relation to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll,</hi>
in and neare which I had divers friends, I made a more particular enquiry
into this action from ſuch Souldiers and Citizens preſent in the ſiege, who could
give me the beſt information; and upon due examination of what was alleaged
on either part, I found the ſurrender ſuch as I publiſhed it to be in <hi>Roomes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterpeece,</hi>
by approbation of a Committee of the Commons Houſe, who both
authorized the Book, and concurred with me in this opinion. From all which
it will appeare, that I was not the raiſer, nor firſt inventer of this bruit, <hi>That
Bristoll was cowardly and unworthily ſurrendred,</hi> it being publiſhed in print
by divers, and the common received opinion of all men in City and Countrey,
before I gave my cenſure of it, which I have here made good.</p>
               <p>His tenth Argument was,<note place="margin">Argum. 10.</note> That both the City and Caſtle were untenable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Enemy; Therefore the ſurrender not cowardly, nor unworthy. Their
intenability he endeavoured to prove;</p>
               <p>Firſt, from the weakneſſe and inſufficiency of the Lyne, Outworks, Walls,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Fortifications doth of the City and Caſtle, in demonſtrating whereof he ſpent
neere three whole dayes at firſt, and two or three dayes more in his reply to our
Evidence in diſproofe of his Allegations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the want of a ſufficient Garriſon to defend the Town, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
which, he alleaged; that he had not above two thouſand foot and horſe to
guard the place, which were not halfe enough, the Works being neere five miles
in compaſſe, and divided by a River, ſo as his men ſtood very thin upon the Lyne,
and had no reſerves at all, unleſſe for ſome particular places; by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
his Souldiers in moſt places continued foure or five dayes and nights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon duty without reliefe. And to prove the Garriſon inſufficient, hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
firſt, on the Letter printed in his Relation, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. complaining of the
<hi>weakneſſe of the Garriſon of Bristoll, and deſiring an augmentation of it.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
on his Excellencies opinion, <hi>Ibid. pag. 16. who thought it neceſſary this
Garriſon ſhould conſiſt of three Regiments of foot, two Troops of horſe, and one
company of Dragoones.</hi> Thirdly, on a <hi>draught of an Ordinance</hi> preſented to the
Houſe of Commons by the Lord Say; for <hi>the ſetling of a ſufficient Garriſon
at Bristoll (ibid. pag.</hi> 17.) wherein <hi>he propounded, that the Garriſon might conſiſt
of three Regiments of foot, the first conſiſting of 1200. the ſecond of 1000. the
third of 800. men, and of two Troops of horſe, and one company of Dragoones;</hi>
with leſſe then which he could not poſſibly (as he ſaid) maitaine the City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Enemies forces that came then againſt it, who had few leſſe then ſeventy
Colours of foot (<hi>as Lieutenant Clifton</hi> affirmed, who told them) on <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>-ſhire
ſide, which <hi>Captaine Husbands</hi> telling them with his Proſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe,
multiplied the colours to one hundred.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from his want of Powder and Ammunition,<note n="*" place="margin">See his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>p.</hi> 9. 10. and his Letter to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</note> 
                  <hi>he having no Match <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
at all, and but fifty barrels of Powder left, which would not have ſerved them
above two dayes;</hi> which he endeavored to prove by the proportion of Powder
they ſpent in two dayes before, and by a Letter from <hi>Colonell Warnloe</hi> from <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth</hi>
(atteſted by Maſter <hi>Nichols</hi>) who writ, that they ſpent forty barrels of
Powder there in one day, when they beat the Enemy out of their works.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:159182:42"/>
The City and Caſtle being therefore untenable in all theſe reſpects; and no
ſuccours neare to relieve them in due ſeaſon, his ſurrender could not be deemed
cowardly, but diſcreet and honourable, to preſerve both the Citizens goods,
and the Garriſon (conſiſting of above 1500. foot and horſe) to ſerve the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
(which then wanted men) in other places of advantage.</p>
               <p>To which particulars Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> gave theſe enſuing Anſwers.<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Firſt, that the
works about the City and Caſtle were very ſtrong, defenceable, tenable againſt
all the enemies power, which he proved; Firſt, by the judgement and opinion
of the Defendant himſelfe, who never once complained of the weakneſſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency
of the Works or Caſtle till the ſurrender, but oft affirmed the Works
to be very ſtrong, ſufficient, and tenable, before the ſeige, and that he doubted
not to make them good againſt all the enemies power, as Colonel <hi>Stephens,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Strood,</hi> Captaine <hi>Bagnal,</hi> Maſter <hi>Powel,</hi> with others depoſe. And he
publikly confeſſeth in his printed <hi>Relation, pag.</hi> 10. that <hi>himſelfe (and ſome others
too) had a great opinion of the ſtrength of the Caſtle,</hi> before it was ſurrendred;
though now upon a ſudden, he would make your Honours beleeve and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to prove it, the weakeſt moſt untenable peece in the world, having ſpent
one whole dayes time in demonſtrating its ſeverall weakneſſes, or rather in
them his own, who notwithſtanding all theſe imbicilities had ſo <hi>great an opinion
of its ſtrength;</hi> And indeed did not the Defendant deeme the works ſufficient,
the City and Caſtle ſtrong, he muſt diſcover himſelfe guilty, either of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
folly, in putting the Parliament, Countrey, City, to ſo great coſts to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie,
garriſon, furniſh the City and Caſtle with all neceſſaries to hold out a
ſiege, if it were not really tenable, and of no conſiderable ſtrength at all, in
the upſhot: Or elſe of extraordinary treachery, if he knew it not tenable, and yet
gave it out to be very defenſible, on purpoſe to induce the Gentry and Countrey
in thoſe parts to bring their money, plate, eſtates, proviſions thither, as to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſtrength and ſecurity, as we know they did, upon his promiſes to defend
them to the laſt, that ſo they might become a prey to the enemies, who had all the
Ammunition, Proviſions, Armes of thoſe parts delivered into their hands at
once, which they could have never gained, had not the Defendant fortified the
Town, Caſtle, and affirmed them to be ſtrong and tenable; Beſides, his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
liberall promiſes to defend the Caſtle to the utmoſt, in caſe he was forced to
retreat into it, and there to ſecure the beſt affected Citizens and their goods, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
its tenability in his owne apprehenſion. Secondly, as the Towne, but
Caſtle eſpecially, was tenable in his owne judgement, ſo likewiſe in the opinion
of others. Firſt, of the Gentry and Countrey who repaired thither, as to a moſt
ſecure ſanctuary againſt the enemy, towards whoſe fortification and defence
they liberally contributed. Secondly of the Citizens, who all deemed the
Towne, but the Caſtle eſpecially (to which they carried their eſtates, and above
three moneths proviſions) to be defenſible againſt all the enemies power, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the Depoſitions of <hi>Iames Powel, Able Kelly, William Deane,</hi> Miſtris
<hi>Haſſard,</hi> others, and by <hi>the Tragedy of Briſtoll,</hi> lately publiſhed by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Birch,</hi> Mr. <hi>Powell,</hi> and other Citizens of it; who write thus of the Caſtle,
<hi>pag. 5. The Caſtle being ſtrongly fortified and victualled, as being the laſt place
to retreat unto, if the Towne ſhould be taken; being ASSVRED we ſhould
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:159182:42"/>
be able to keep it (till reliefe came,) as a ſanctuary for the perſons and estates of
ſuch as were moſt active for the Parliament; divers of us accordingly brought in
our goods, with proviſions for our ſelves, and to help victuall the Souldiers that
were to be entertained in it, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, by the opinion of divers Souldiers of our owne party, as Colonel</hi>
Stephens, <hi>Colonell</hi> Strood, <hi>Lieutenant Colonels</hi> Paleologus, <hi>and</hi> Andrewes,
<hi>Major</hi> Wood, <hi>Major</hi> Allen, <hi>Captaine</hi> Bagnall, Nicholas Cowling, <hi>Mr.</hi> Haſſard,
Richard Linden, Edmund Wathorne, Thomas Munday, <hi>and</hi> Richard Butler
<hi>atteſt. Fourthly, by the ſpeeches of the enemies owne commanders, who view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Works of the ſaid Caſtle, ſoone after its ſurrender,</hi> ſwore, God damme
them, all the Devils in Hell could not have taken the Caſtle, it was ſo fortified
had not the Governour cowardly ſurrendred it, that they might thank <hi>Fiennes</hi>
for it, and that they could not have taken the Castle, had it not beene yeelded up
to them beyond expectation: <hi>as</hi> Mary Smith, Ethelred Huddy, Ioane Battin,
Thomas Thomas, <hi>and</hi> Michael Spark ſenior <hi>witneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas he alleaged,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>that Sir</hi> William Waller, <hi>and Sir</hi> Arthur Haſlerig,
<hi>deemed</hi> Briſtol <hi>not tenable, which he endeavoured to prove by this paſſage in
their Letter to him dated</hi> Iuly 1. 1643.—(<hi>atteſted by Mr.</hi> Iohn Aſh, <hi>and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his</hi> Relation, pag. 27.) We think the enemy will fall on this night, if not, to
morrow morning; and if ſo, what good will this Regement doe Briſtoll if we
periſh? It is a wonder to us, to ſee our friends delay help where there is ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr.<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered. 1. That this letter declares not their opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the intenability of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> but their importunity to have ſpeedy ſupplies
from thence. Secondly, it expreſſeth that <hi>Briſtols</hi> greateſt ſecurity conſiſted in
their Armies ſucceſſe, there being no danger of a ſiege as long as their Army
were maſters of the field. Thirdly, it proves nothing, that either the City or
Caſtle might not have held out till reliefe ſhould arrive from his Excellency, or
that it could not hold out above three dayes longer. Fourthly, the Defendant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
that had Colonel <hi>Pophams</hi> Regiment continued in the Towne, it had not
beene loſt, and that his ſending of them to Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> was the loſſe of
the Towne; therefore the Caſtle and Towne in reſpect of the fortifications
were both tenable, and had no want at all but of Colonel <hi>Pophams</hi> men, which he
ſupplied by his new raiſed Regiments, before the ſiege.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Object.</note> whereas he alleaged, that divers Gentlemen left the Towne, and
went away with Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi> becauſe they
deemed it not tenable.</p>
               <p>It was anſwered,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> that the reaſon of their departure (as themſelves have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed)
was, the feare and aſſurance they had, the Defendant would not hold it
out to the laſt; whereas Colonell <hi>Strood,</hi> Colonell <hi>Stevens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr</hi> Talboye<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> and others who had
his promiſe to hold it out, to the utmoſt, continued with him ſtill.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it was anſwered, that the objected weakneſſes and defects of the
works and Caſtle, were meere inventions of the Defendant ſince the ſurrender,
not thought or ſpoken of before, nor once propounded at the Councell of Warre
when the Parley was in agitation; where the debate of this particular of the
Tenabilitie of the Towne and Caſtle was never diſputed, for if it had, the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:159182:43"/>
Towne would have beene held ſome foure dayes longer, whiles this point had
beene debated, which hath taken up foure dayes here. As for the Caſtle, the
Defendant himſelf confeſſeth, and his Lieutenant <hi>Clifton</hi> with Major <hi>Holmes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
* <hi>that in the whole debate of the Parley and Surrender,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nota.</note> 
                  <hi>the Caſtle was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
mentioned nor thought on:</hi> therefore the weakneſſe and untenability of it was
no ground of its ſurrender, as is now pretended. Finally, the Defendant in his
printed Relation, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. 10. and in his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> affirmes; <hi>that the cauſe why the
Caſtle was not tenable againſt the enemy, was for want of Match and Powder,</hi>
not inregard of its inconvenient ſituation, and weake fortification, the onely
cauſes now inſiſted on; therefore this is but a meere pretence invented ſince the
ſurrender.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond pretence of wanting a ſufficient Garriſon to hold it;<note place="margin">Anſw. 2.</note> Maſter
<hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered, 1. That that Defendant had two thouſand foot beſides two
hundred voluntires, and three hundred horſe and Dragoones at leaſt, which were
ſufficient to defend the Towne againſt all the enemies power, as is infallibly
evident by the repulſes every where given to the enemies when they ſtormed it,
and the great ſlaughter of hundreds of their men, with the loſſe but of three or
four of ours, atteſted by his own witnes, and publiſhed in his owne <hi>Relation</hi> and
<hi>Letter to his Excellency.</hi> And if the Garriſon were ſufficient thus to repulſe the
enemy in his greateſt ſtrength and aſſaults at the very outworks, then certainly
they were abundantly able to defend the Towne and Caſtle after the ſlaughter,
and wounding of above 1700 of the enemies, had they beene diſcreetly and
couragiouſly commanded by him; but doubtleſſe they were more then enough
to have defended the Caſtle, the body of the City, and that part beyond the
Bridge after the Suburbs entred, and the Lyne wholly quitted on <hi>Gloceſterſhire</hi>
ſide. Secondly, if the Garriſon had beene too weak, he might have raiſed ſixe
or eight thouſand able men more in the City, or retained<note n="*" place="margin">See his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> five hundred of Sir
<hi>William Wallers</hi> Souldiers, whom he ſent out of the <hi>Towne to ſave the expence
of proviſions.</hi> Thirdly, the Garriſon Souldiers that were in it, would have
fought, and held the City and Caſtle out againſt the enemy, thinking themſelves
ſtrong enough to doe it, but the Defendant would not permit them, as ſundry
witneſſes atteſt; the want therefore of a ſufficient Garriſon is but a meere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
Fourthly, a Garriſon muſt be judged to bee ſufficient or inſufficient to
defend a place, onely in regard of the enemies ſtrength that comes before it;
that Garriſon being ſufficient to defend a Towne againſt ſeven or eight thouſand
beſeigers, which perchance is inſufficient to guard it againſt twenty thouſand.
Now, we confidently affirme, that the Garriſon then in it, was ſufficient to
guard it againſt all the power then before it, as appeares by the enemies ſeverall
generall repulſes with extraordinary loſſe to them, and none to the Garriſon: by
the enemies paucity, not being above ſeven or eight thouſand at moſt; (moſt of
them horſe) and their Quarters divided with an unfordable River, ſo as they
could not come to reſcue or releive one the other. And whereas he pretended the
enemy was neere fourteene thouſand ſtrong, becauſe they had about ſeventy or
one hundred foot Colours onely upon <hi>Durdham Downe;</hi> this is a moſt fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Argument: becauſe every puny Souldier knowes, it is a common policy in
warres, to carry and diſplay a multitude of Colours more then there are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paines,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:159182:43"/>
a farre off, at a diſtance, of purpoſe to amaze or terrifie the oppoſites,
and make themſelves appeare more numerous then in truth they are; which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
was now uſed. And whereas Captaine <hi>Husbands</hi> affirmed, that he told one
hundred foot colours on <hi>Durdham Downe;</hi> he ſaith, that it was but with his
proſpective glaſſe, (an uncertain inſtrument to tell colors with) which multiplied
the colours more then they were, Leiutenant <hi>Clifton</hi> telling not ſeventy at moſt.
And how full theſe companies under thoſe colours were, we ſhall produce onely
the teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Savidge,</hi> a late Souldier in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who depoſed <hi>Viva
voce; that he was in</hi> Briſtoll <hi>within two dayes after its ſurrender, when there was
a Generall Muſter of Prince</hi> Ruperts <hi>foot in the Marſh there, at which both
Prince</hi> Rupert <hi>and</hi> Mawrice <hi>were preſent, where he told (to his beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>)
52. <hi>but for certaine above 42. of the enemies Colours, which had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi>
1400. <hi>Souldiers at the moſt belonging to them, for he particularly told and
tooke ſpeciall notice of them; Whereupon he demanded of one of the Officers on
the place, why they had ſo many Colours, and ſo few men? Who anſwered, that
they had many of their men ſlaine and wounded in the ſeige:</hi> ſo as by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
they had more foot in the City by ſeven or eight hundred when it was
ſurrendred, then Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had without it, whoſe forces were moſt horſe;
and therefore a ſufficient Garriſon to defend it againſt ſo ſmall a force. Beſides,
it appeares <hi>by the Relation of Gloceſter</hi> ſeige, <hi>pag.</hi> 1. (atteſted by Mr. <hi>Pury</hi> to be
true,) that <hi>there were about nine thouſand men more before Gloceſter then there
were at Briſtoll ſeige;</hi> if then <hi>Gloceſter</hi> Garriſon, conſiſting at the moſt but of
1500. men were ſufficient to guard it againſt 9000. more then were before <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll,</hi>
then <hi>Briſtoll</hi> Garriſon of above 2000. foot, and 300. horſe, muſt needs be
abundantly ſufficient to defend it againſt 9000. enemies leſſe then were before
<hi>Glocester.</hi> And whereas the Defendant alleaged his Letter of complaint for
want of a ſufficient Garriſon; this was in <hi>March</hi> 20. 1643. when he had but
<hi>one compleat Regiment of foot, and but two Troops of horſe, not at the ſiege,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
when he had above twice double the number. Sixthly, for his Excellencies op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and his owne propoſitions, <hi>that the Garriſon ſhould conſiſt of three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of foot, and three Troops of horſe and Dragoones.</hi> It was anſwered, that
he had above that number of horſe, and almoſt his full number of foot at the
ſiege, and might have raiſed more had he pleaſed; therefore a competent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
according to his owne deſire. But that which quite takes off this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is, That ſuch a large Garriſon as this, was not deſired by him, or thought
meet by his Excellency, onely to defend <hi>Bristoll</hi> againſt a ſiege, <hi>but likewiſe to
defend Bath, Barkly Caſtle, and the Countrey round about for twenty miles ſpace,
and to ſuppreſſe inſurrections, if any ſhould happen in the Weſterne parts;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by his Excellencies Letter, and his owne propoſitions. Therefore this
pretence, that he had not a full Garriſon to defend the Towne, becauſe he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome of his number of foot, which ſhould have defended <hi>Bath and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
twenty miles round about,</hi> is but an impertinent plea. Seventhly, for his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
want of reſerves to releeve his men, himſelfe confeſſed, that reſerves might have
well been drawn from the main guard and Caſtle Garriſon, who were not in any
fight or action during the ſiege; that he had ſome few reſerves for ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularplaces,
as there was occaſion; that Captaine <hi>Stokes,</hi> whoſe Company was a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:159182:44"/>
meere reſerve, ſtanding in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> Church-yard, when the enemy entred,
though not imployed to repulſe them at the firſt, nor afterwards in the ſally. If
then he had reſerves for ſome ſpecial ſervices, he had no doubt a competent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
it being unuſuall to have a whole reſerve, and a vaſt unneceſſary expence
to maintaine a double Garriſon in any place. Eighthly, whereas he alleaged, that
his men for want of reliefe and reſerves would have quite been tired out in three
or foure dayes more, having been neare five dayes on duty without reliefe; &amp; that
a man might die of a lingring Conſumption well as of a Feaver. It was anſwered,
That the Garriſon of <hi>Glocester</hi> had no reſerves at all, and were conſtantly upon
duty without * relief above thirty five dayes and nights together,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lime</hi> hath done the like for ſixe weeks ſpace.</note> yet held it out
couragiouſly, without dying of a Conſumption; and why <hi>Briſtol</hi> Garriſon might
not have done the like (being furniſhed with good ſtore of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> milk, ſtrong
wines and waters) with as good ſucceſſe, had the Defendant put them to it, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially
having ſome reſerves to relieve one another) he could ſee no reaſon, but
only his willingneſſe to yeeld up the Town to the enemy, for feare of a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of which none are willing, or uſe to die till nature be totally ſpent: Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there was then no ſicknes at al in the City, no want of proviſions or neceſſaries;
no loſſe but of eight men at the moſt when yeelded, how then the City, Caſtle,
could be ſurrendred upon this pretence of an impoſſibility to keep them longer,
for want of a ſufficient Garriſon, we cannot conceive; eſpecially ſince the women
with their children proferred to go unto the Cannons mouthto dead the bullets.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Anſwer 3. Ione Battin, Arth. Williams, Maior Wood.</note> to the pretended want of Match, Powder, Ammunition (for a
ſufficiency of all other proviſions and victuals was akcnowledged) it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
Firſt, that we had proved there were 1400. weight of Match, (beſides a
Dray load more of Match) in the Caſtle it ſelf, when ſurrendred; and a Match-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
with materials to make more Match in the Caſtle as faſt as they could ſpend
it, beſides much Match in the City: and he might as ſoone have alleadged want
of water in the river <hi>Avon,</hi> as of Match in <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> which makes Match and
cordage for all the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> and other parts. Secondly, for Powder, we
have proved by ſome witneſſes, that there were at leaſt ſixty barrels in the Caſtle
only, beſides as many more in the City, Forts, and what was weekly made in the
Towne: yea ſome witneſſes prove there were ſeventy double barrels in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
left to the enemy. Captaine <hi>Husband</hi> confeſſeth he had two barrels of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in his Fort, <hi>Arthur Williams</hi> atteſteth there were ſixty barrels in the Towne
and Major <hi>Allen</hi> brought nine Barrels more from <hi>Malmeſbury:</hi> And by his own
printed <hi>Relation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 9. 10.</note> there muſt be at leaſt 90 Barrels left; <hi>For he therin confeſſeth</hi>
(a) <hi>that he found 45 Barrels of Powder in the Town, when he firſt entred upon
the Charge thereof: after which he received 30 Barrels more from London,</hi> 126
Barrels from <hi>France,</hi> beſides ſix or ſeven Barrels weekly made in the City, all the
powder taken out of Shops, Ships; and the nine Barrels from <hi>Malmeſbury:</hi> all
which (admit the Barrels out of <hi>France</hi> ſingle) amount to 210 Barrels; but to
336 Barrels, if thoſe from <hi>France</hi> were double, as they were: Of theſe he ſaith,
Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> had about 60 Barrels, and that he ſpent about 60 more
in the ſiege: deduct then 120 Barrels out of 336, there remained no leſſe
then 216; or 120 out of 210, there were left 90 Barrels at leaſt by his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
allowing him all that was made or found in the City and Ships meerly for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:159182:44"/>
waſt and Muſters. And whether there were a neceſſity of ſurrendring the Town
for want of powder when ſo many Barrels remained only in the Caſtle; beſides
what was in the Forts and City, let all men judge: there being 60 Barrels more
then Col. <hi>Maſſey</hi> had when <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was firſt beſieged.</p>
               <p>But his grand pretence is, That this powder would have laſted them only
two or three dayes at moſt; whence this Pordigall of his powder, not blood or
coyne, writes thus in his <hi>Relation,</hi> page 9. 10. <hi>That which made it evident, Wee
could not hold out the Caſtle above two or three dayes,</hi> was, <hi>becauſe we had Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
for no longer time, having only 50 Barrels of Powder, and no Match,
at all: (No Match for himſelfe, he meanes</hi> for cowardice, elſe there was Match
enough,) <hi>and according to the proportion of Powder, we had ſpent the dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this would not have ſerved us above two dayes, and it is cleare wee ſhould not
have had any reliefe in ſix or eight weeks.</hi> A pretty prejudicating fancy, not
to be admitted on any termes: For by the ſame Argument he ſurrendred it
up now when he had 90, or admit but 50 Barrels left; he would have then yeelded
it had he 500 remaining: For thus hee would have argued, 500 Barrels after
the rate of 50 Barrels we ſpent the two firſt dayes, would have laſted us but
twenty dayes at moſt: and wee could have no ſuccour in ſix or eight weeks,
therefore I was neceſſitated to render the Town for want of powder to hold out
till reliefe might come: Nay, if he had a 1000 Barrels then left, he would by
this reaſon have yeelded the Town up, for want of powder, for he argued
thus; Col. <hi>Warnſlow</hi> at <hi>Plimmouth</hi> ſpent 40 Barrels in one day: <hi>Ergo,</hi> I ſhould
have ſpent ſo many every day at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and by this computation a 1000
Barrels would have laſted me but 30 dayes, and I had no hopes of relief in fourty
or fifty dayes at neareſt; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I was neceſſitated to yeeld for want of powder
to ſerve me till relief might come. Had valliant <hi>Maſſey</hi> argued thus at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi>
he might have ſurrendred it to the King on this pretence the very firſt day and
houre he came before it. He might have alledged (with better reaſon then Col.
<hi>Fiennes</hi>) wee have but 30 Barrels of powder in all to defend the Town with,
and theſe will not laſt above one day; for Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> ſpent 30 Barrels a day
as <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and Col. <hi>Warnſlow</hi> 40 in one day at <hi>Plymmouth:</hi> Therefore our 30
Barrels againſt a farre greater Army of Enemies, will not laſt above one day, and
we lawfully may and ought in true Millitary policy to ſurrender <hi>Gloceſter</hi> to the
Enemy the firſt houre they come before it for want of powder, ſince Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi>
ſurrendred <hi>Briſtoll</hi> for this very cauſe, when he had twice aſmuch powder as wee.
Had <hi>Maſſey</hi> done or argued thus, what had become of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ere this? But ſince he made no ſuch anticipating Argument, but with his little
ſtore of powder (farre leſſe then was in the Caſtle of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> only) maintained
the ſiege for 31 dayes, and preſerved) the Town when he had more cauſe to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
of reliefe then Col. <hi>Fiennes,</hi> Why the Defendant might not, ſhould not
have done the like at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> I cannot yet conjecture. Indeed, he ſaith, in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the eight Article, <hi>That he was leſſe able to defend the Town foure, or the
Caſtle fourteen dayes, then</hi> Maſſey <hi>was to defend Gloceſter 24 dayes with the ſame
proportion of Powder.</hi> Certainly, if it were poſſible for <hi>Maſſey</hi> to defend <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
againſt a farre greater Force then was at <hi>Briſtoll</hi> with 50 Barrels of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for 31 dayes: It was more poſſible for the Defendant to have defended the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:159182:45"/>
Caſtle of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> of leſſe circumference by three parts then it, with 90 ſingle
or 70 double Barrels (which he ſurrendred) for three times 30 dayes, and till
ſuccours had arrived. But to exclude all fond pretences to palliate treachery or
cowardize, Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> affirmed, that there muſt the ſame Rule and Law bee
obſerved in caſe of powder, Ammunition, and men, as there is in caſe of victuals:
And what that is the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> and his <hi>Excellencies</hi> Articles of Warre
(newly reprinted) define, <hi>to wit, a preſent and abſolute want of Victuals, and
all edible things to ſuſtaine nature:</hi> And ſo a preſent abſolute want and expence
of all powder and Ammunition; elſe any Fort may bee betrayed upon remote
pretended neceſſities. A Governour muſt not argue thus, It may bee I may
ſpend 50 Barrels of powder in two dayes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> 50. being all my ſtore, I will
preſently ſurrender before I put it to the hazard, and yeeld up my preſent ſtores
to the Enemy before the two dayes expire. For then what place can be ſecure,
or will hold out to reall extremity? But on the contrary, hee muſt thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve,
I have thus much powder yet left, and by good husbandry it may laſt
much longer then I apprehend; the Enemies Ammunition, for ought I know,
may faile before it, who knowes not how ſmall our ſtores now are; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is better I ſhould ſpend that little I have left againſt the Enemy,
rather then yeeld it up to ſupply their wants and annoy our friends, Therefore
I will, yea, I ought in reaſon and duty to be reduced to a preſent, reall, not a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
poſsible want of powder, before I will yeeld up the Fo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, committed to
my truſt, to the whole Kingdomes prejudice. This was Col. <hi>Maſſey</hi> his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
this ought to be the concluſion of every Governour whatſoever, and of
the Defendant at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which wanted neither Fortifications, Men, Victuals,
Ammunition, Canon, Powder, Wine, Beare, Match, Water, nor any neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
when it was ſurrendred, to defend it till ſupplies might have arived. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was yeelded up before any the leaſt extremity, and ſo <hi>unworthily,</hi> and
<hi>Cowardly,</hi> both in Law and reall verity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer 4.</note> 
                  <hi>as to his beſt and moſt ſpeciall plea or enducement,</hi>

                  <hi>That he</hi> ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
the City and Caſtle ſo ſpeedily, as he did, of purpoſe to preſerve a body of
1500 foot and horſe for the ſervice of the State, then wanting men: And the
lives and eſtates of divers of our friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered, Firſt, That he might be aſhamed of ſuch a poore abſurd
pretence as this, to vaile his cowardiſe: his ſurrender in truth being but to ſave his
own life and eſtate, not the Garriſons, who were ſafer in the Town, Caſtle, then
in any other place whatſoever, and loſt both themſelves and their eſtates by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring
them, which they had preſerved (as <hi>Gloceſter</hi> men did their City and
Eſtates) had they manfully held them out to the laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The Parliament had no leſſe then 2000 armed foot, and 300 horſe
in the City to ſerve them there immediately before the ſurrender: yet this thirfty
Governour would for their ſervice and advantage, ſurrender both City, Caſtle,
with all the Cannon, Ammunition, Armes, Magazens, Proviſions, Wealth, Ships,
Priſoners, Colours in it to preſerve them only 1500 diſarmed, plundered, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
men to ſerve them, God knowes where, or how. A very frugal Steward
ſurely for the Republike, to looſe them no leſſe then 800 men in the very bargain,
with the City, Caſtle, Armes and premiſes to boot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:159182:45"/>
Thirdly, neither did he ſave thoſe 1500. naked men as he pretended, nor yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
a body of three hundred to ſerve them elſewhere, hee bringing ſcarce one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of them with him into <hi>London.</hi> He loſt the City, Caſtle, Armes, all
elſe in them before onely to ſave the men, and their eſtates; and after loſt both
the men and their eſtates, to ſave himſelfe, never reſerving ſo much as one En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
Drum, Trumpet, upon the Parly to call or keep his men together, nor yet
muſtering them into order, nor marching away with them in a body, nor relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, when diſmounted, plundered, abuſed in his ſight, leaving every man to
ſhift for himſelfe the beſt he might. And was not this a pretty ſaving of men to
ſerve the Parliament elſewhere, thus careleſly to loſe them, and of 2300. men
compleatly armed to ſerve them, to preſerve ſcarce 200. ſtript of all their Armes,
and quite disbanded? God preſerve the Republike from ſuch frugall Stewards,
ſuch pernitious bargains.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, admit hee had ſaved full 1500 unarmed men to ſerve the State, was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
not this a ſweet purchaſe (think you) to ſave ſo many mens perſons with the loſſe
of ſuch a place of conſequence, ſtrength, ſhipping, trade, command by Sea and
Land, with the hazard of the whole Kingdome? Better himſelfe, and all thoſe
1500, nay, better tenne thouſand men had bravely loſt their lives in defence
thereof; yea, better the whole City had been ruined if not poſſible otherwiſe to
bee ſecured to the State, then that the Enemy ſhould have ſo eaſily poſſeſſed
it, to the Cities, Countreys, and whole Kingdomes infinite prejudice.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Parliament needed no men at that time to ſerve them elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
but they would extreamly want <hi>Briſtoll</hi> were it loſt, farre more then they
wanted men: It was a bootleſſe ſervice then, to loſe what they ſhould
certainly moſt of all want, to preſerve only what they needed not.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Theſe mens ſervice was uſefull no where but in <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> where the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
State only needed and expected it; And thoſe who would not doe them the beſt,
the uttermoſt ſervice there where they moſt needed it, with the hazard of their
lives, would hardly doe them ſervice elſewhere, unleſſe they might have victory
in a bagge, (as <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> had the Windes) and might fight only where they
were ſure of no reſiſtance, to gaine <hi>Sarmacida ſpolia, ſine ſanguine &amp; ſudore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, They could do the Parliament no ſuch good ſervice any where as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
there in keeping <hi>Briſtol;</hi> there moſt of them were in their proper center, their
native ſoile where they fought for their lives, eſtates, lands, houſes, wives, children,
liberties, in the very hight and ſtrength of their ſpirits; there they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched
in ſtrong Forts and Bulworks, well manned, victualled, Ammunitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
where, in reſpect of the Enemies diſadvantage in aſſailing, and their own
convenience in defending, they might have ſlaine one hundred Enemies for
one of ours, as they had done before, killing and wounding above 1500 of the
Enemies, with the loſſe only of eight of the Garriſon; after which rate they
might have ſlaine the Enemies whole Army with the loſſe only of one hundred
men, (a ſervice they could never hope to attaine to in the open Fields,) and alſo
have ſaved not only 1500, but 2200 of their own men, to ſerve the State,
together with the City, Caſtle, Ships, Armes, Magazines, and Weſterne
Parts, all depending on them; and that with the totall ruine of the Enemies
Forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:159182:46"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, It is very imp<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rbable that theſe Garriſon Souldiers and Citizens
would adventure their lives to ſerve the State in any place elſe, who would not
doe it on their own dunghill, and in their proper charges, where they were
moſt concerned; Thoſe that will not fight it out to the utmoſt in a Fort,
where they have all advantages, will certainly not doe it in the open fields,
where the Enemy and they are upon equall ground. And it is not very likely,
that men diſarmed, diſcouraged, left to the ſcorne and plunder of the Enemies,
ſtript of all their fortunes, driven from their native habitations, and brought
to truſt to the Enemy for their lives, rather then to God and their own ſwords
for victory and ſecurity, ſhould fight for the Parliament without Armes, or
any other encouragement in the open fields.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, Admit he ſecured the Parliament 1500 pillaged naked friends to ſerve
them elſewhere, yet ſure I am, hee hath truly gained them fifteene, nay fifty
thouſand Enemies, with all the Armes, Strength, Ports, Forts, Traffick, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
Wealth, that the Weſt of <hi>England, Wales,</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> can afford, whence
divers thouſands of Enemies and Rebels are lately arrived in <hi>Briſtoll</hi> Ships,
to cut our throats, poſſeſſe our Eſtates, yea lay our Kingdome waſt; And was
not this a good piece of publike ſervice, worthy our higheſt applauſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Tenthly, The very loſſe of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> (for ought any wiſe man can yet perceive)
is like to coſt the Parliament and Kingdome the lives of above 15000, nay,
30000 men, (as it hath coſt them ſome thouſands already) ere <hi>Bristoll</hi> and the
Weſt be reduced, to that condition they were when this City was ſurrendred.
And is not this a ſweet peece of good husbandry to endanger the loſſe of 30000
mens lives, but to ſave the lives of 1500 only, and that when they were in
no greateſt ſecurity, and danger at all of being loſt, had they ſtood it out?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Eleventhly, The Defendant and his men, were purpoſely placed in the City
and Caſtle, (to the Kingdomes vaſt expence) to this very end, that they might
preſerve them from the Enemy, even with the loſſe of their lives, rather then the
Enemy ſhould poſſeſſe them to the publike prejudice: And yet this valiant
Gentleman is ſo diſcreetly ſparing (at leaſtwiſe of his owne, if not of their
lives) as rather certainly to looſe the Towne and Caſtle, then to hazard the
loſſe of all or any of their lives, contrary to his very truſt and duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Twelfely, Might not every Governour and Generall upon this pretence deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up any Fort, City, Town, Country to the Enemy, without ſhot or ſtroke, to
preſerve the lives of their men to ſerve the Parliament elſewhere? Had Colonell
<hi>Maſſey</hi> at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> or Col. <hi>Warnſlow</hi> at <hi>Plymmouth</hi> made this plea, of ſaving
their own and their Garriſons lives, to ſerve the Parliament elſewhere, theſe
Townes might have been yeelded up upon better Articles then <hi>Briſtoll</hi> long agoe.
Had his Excellency been acquainted with this frugall State policy by Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi>
at the famous Battels of <hi>Edgehill</hi> and <hi>Newbury,</hi> hee might eaſily before the
Fights began, have ſounded a Parley, and yeelded up all his Ammunition, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
Armes, Carriages, Colours, Drummes, Cornets, Priſoners to the Enemy,
and given them the honour of the Field, of purpoſe to ſave the effuſion of Chriſtian
blood, and reſerve the lives of his Souldiers to ſerve the Common-Wealth in
other places, (there being the ſame pretence of reaſon in theſe caſes, as in <hi>Briſtoll:</hi>)
And then I pray, what had become of our Parliament, Religion, Lawes, Liberties,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:159182:46"/>
Eſtates, and Lives too ere this? I doubt they had all been loſt by this new kind of
ſaving. And then what ſervice could theſe men doe the Parliament or State when
all was certainly loſt? We owe our lives, limbs, fortunes, all we have to our
deare Countrey, delete this principle out of mens hearts and you diſſolve, yea ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
all civill ſociety. It is therefore no excuſe at all for the Defendant to loſe this
place of conſequence to ſave a few mens lives, or eſtates, together with his own.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, it is the greateſt honour of a Governour, a Souldier, to die <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>
fighting; to loſe his life to ſave his Countrey. The very <hi>Heathen Romans,</hi>
and <hi>Tully</hi> teach us thus much Martiall Divinity. <hi>Dulce &amp; decorum eſt pro patria
mori.</hi> But this unmanly Governour was cleare of another mind, he will neither
hazard his owne, nor other mens lives to ſave a City, a Parliament, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Better all theſe were loſt then his life, or Garriſon endangered by any
bloudy aſſaults. And is not then this his principall excuſe, the higheſt manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of a degenerous cowardly ſpirit? Our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> informes us<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 17. 33. Matth. 16. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>He
that loſeth his life</hi> (by adventuring it for his Religion, God, Countrey,) <hi>ſhall ſave
it;</hi> yea, and the place committed to his truſt, as <hi>Maſſey</hi> and others have done:
<hi>but he that will ſave his life</hi> (or others) by a cowardly and unworthy ſurrender, as
this Gentleman did, <hi>ſhall loſe it,</hi> and that deſervedly by the Axe of juſtice, for
ſuch unmanly cowardize. It was <hi>Caiphas his Divinity</hi> concerning Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
<hi>It is expedient for us that one man ſhould die for the people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 11. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>that the whole
Nation periſh not:</hi> And it ſhould have beene the Defendants honour and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
to have ſaid the like; better that I, being but one man; yea, better my
whole Garriſon had died in defending this noble City, then that the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould periſh through its ſurrender, to preſerve our lives. It was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants
promiſe before the ſiege,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Haſſard,</hi> Capt. <hi>Bagnall.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>to die in Briſtols defence, and lay his bones there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;</hi>
But this he now profeſſeth, was ſpoken onely in policy, to incourage and
keep his Souldiers in heart, not in realey with any intent to performe it. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if it be a ſigne of a<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn 10. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>good Shepheard</hi> or Governour, <hi>to lay downe his life for
his Sheep,</hi> his Countrey; it is an undoubted badge of a evill and timerous one,
to refuſe to doe it after ſo many promiſes. This is the Defendants caſe, who would
rather adventure his head in a Martiall tryall, then his life in a breach, and for
this deſerves the loſſe of both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After this we next fell upon the debate of a point of principall concernment;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What ſhall be judged utmoſt extremity to excuſe a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and what not, &amp;c.</note>
                  <hi>namely,</hi> what ſhould be judged utter moſt extremity inregard of men, Ammunition,
victuals, or intenability of any Fort, to juſtifie the Governours ſurrender of it to the
enemy? And whether the Defendant were reduced to any ſuch extremity, ere he
ſurrendred Briſtol?</p>
               <p>For reſolving of this grand queſtion, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> alleaged, that his <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
Ordinances of Warre</hi> determined. <hi>That whoſoever yeeldeth up any Towne,
Fort, Magazine, Victuals, Ammunition, Armes, or that moveth any ſuch thing
but upon extremity, and that to the Governour, or in Councell, ſhall be executed as a
Traytor.</hi> This is the generall Law. Now what this <hi>extremity</hi> is, will be the
ſole queſtion; For reſolution whereof (he affirmed) we need goe no further then
to the ſeverall Caſes of<note n="*" place="margin">See the Doome of Cowardize &amp; Treachery.</note> 
                  <hi>Gomineys, Weston, Creſſingham, Elmham,</hi> and the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Norwich,</hi> anciently reſolved in Parliament, to the late <hi>King of Swedens
Millitary Lawes,</hi> and his <hi>Excellencies</hi> owne explanation this point (taken out
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:159182:47"/>
of them) in the ſecond <hi>Edition of his Lawes</hi> and <hi>Ordinances of Warre</hi> newly
printed, which reduce <hi>extremity</hi> to theſe three heads; (where there is no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
preſent want of men through ſlaughter or mortality to defend the place.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> if the Garriſon be reduced to an utter extremity of all eatable things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
ſo as they have no kind of food whereby to ſubſist, but muſt neceſſarily periſh
by famine, if they yeeld not preſently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> if there be no hope at all left them in ſuch a caſe of any ſuccour or reliefe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>if without parlying at the very inſtant, both the Forts, men, and armes
muſt of neceſſity fall into the hands of the enemy.</hi> If the Governour can prove by
pregnant witneſſes that he was really reduced to all theſe extremities, then he is to
be acquitted, but if he faile in reall proofe of any one of theſe, then he is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and executed as a Traytor, both by the King of <hi>Sweeds</hi> and his <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
Martiall Lawes;</hi> and this is the generall Law Martiall of all Nations, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by our owne Common Law, of purpoſe to eſtabliſh Millitary Diſcipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
cowardize, negligence, treachery, which are apt to be varniſhed over with
ſpecious, though falſe pretences.</p>
               <p>To prove this definition of extremity,<note place="margin">Object.</note> Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> produced the laſt Edition
of his Excellencies <hi>Ordinances of Warre,</hi> then newly printed by his <hi>ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
and the <hi>Iudge advocates Licence.</hi> But the Iudge Advocate oppoſed the
reading of them, pretending they were not yet approved by his <hi>Excellency</hi> ſo far
as to be uſed at a Councell of Warre, and that they were made ſince the loſſe of
<hi>Briſtoll.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which Mr.<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> replyed, that they were printed by his <hi>Excellencies
ſpeciall direction, and enjoyned to be obſerved by all,</hi> (as appeares by the <hi>Title:</hi>)
having beene firſt Voted and agreed on at a Councell of Warre; that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of them in print, <hi>by ſpeciall command,</hi> was the <hi>higheſt approbation</hi> that
might be, and it were in vaine to ratifie and publiſh them, if we might not
make uſe of them at this Councell of Warre, in a caſe which fals punctually
within their reſolution; and though <hi>Briſtoll</hi> was ſurrendred before the laſt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe Ordinances yet this clauſe which defines <hi>extremity,</hi> being onely an
expoſition of the former Lawes, and no new addition all Law not formerly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
we might &amp; ought to read it of right, to determin this difficulty, for which
it was purpoſely added. But the <hi>Advocate</hi> being very earneſt againſt the reading
therof, the Councel referred it to my <hi>Lord Generall,</hi> whether the <hi>explanation in the
new printed Ordinances and Lawes of War ſhould be uſed at this trial?</hi> Who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his judgement, they ſhould not now be read, or uſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereupon Mr.</hi> Prynne <hi>laid downe this concluſion for a poſitive and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
principle in Warre, that</hi> utmoſt extremity <hi>to juſtifie the ſurrender of any</hi>
Garriſon, Towne, Fort, or place of conſequence, muſt not be an imaginary, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
extremity, or a conjecturall improbability of holding out any long time, but a
reall, neceſſary, and preſent impoſſibility of holding out any longer against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
<hi>affirming,</hi> that no governour of any fortified Towne or Caſtle ought to ſurrender
the ſame upon any pretence of extremity, but wherethere is an abſolute, reall, and
preſent impoſſibility of holding out any longer, then that very inſtant time wherein he
makes the ſurrender. <hi>The reaſons whereof (he ſaid) were very obſervable,
grounded upon the higheſt principles of policy and warre; as namely,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:159182:47"/>
Firſt, to retard the enemies progreſſe and conqueſts, leſt a whole Kingdome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
ſhould be loſt in a moment, as all <hi>England</hi> would have beene long ere this, had
<hi>Gloceſter, Hull, Plymouth, Exeter, and other places,</hi> made no longer, nor better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
then <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> though not of ſuch importance to the Realme, nor ſo well
furniſhed as <hi>Briſtoll</hi> with all manner of proviſions for a ſiege. A Generall of an
Army, Governour of a Towne, muſt defend his part, with reſpect to the whole
Kingdome; and therefore though he cannot hold his ground, or gard his Fort
abſolutely, or for any long ſpace againſt the enemy, yet he muſt loſe ground
but by inches, not give it away by whole Townes or Countries; and though he
cannot defend his chage ſtill, yet he muſt hold out till the laſt minute
to ſtay the enemies progreſſe, and prevent a ſudden totall conqueſt of the
Realme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to ſpend the enmies men, ammunition, proviſions, a long ſiege,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
being the uſuall bane of any army; an infinite charge, diſadvantage, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the beſeegers, but great advantage, incouragement to the oppoſite
party.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to give a good preſident and encouragement to other Governours,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Garriſons, Forts, adjacent Counties, and to uphold Martial Diſcipline therby;
the holding out of a place of conſequence (as is evident by the late example of
<hi>Gloceſter</hi>) giving great incouragement to the adjoyning places to hold out ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
to the laſt, and animating all the party adhearing to them; whereas the
ſudden loſſe, or yeelding up of any eminent City, ſtrikes terrour into all adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Townes, Forts, Counties, who preſently wheele about to the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
enemy, as appeares by the example of <hi>Briſtoll;</hi> whoſe unexpected ſurrender
drew on the loſſe of <hi>Dorcheſter, Barnſtable, Exeter, Dartmouth,</hi> with moſt of the
<hi>Weſtern parts;</hi> and it had hazarded the loſſe of <hi>London,</hi> yea of the whole Kingdom,
had the enemies purſued their victory to <hi>London</hi> wals, and not beene unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beaten off at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> endangered by <hi>Briſtols</hi> ſurrender, and quite given for
loſt by Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> and his officers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To give advantage of ſurpriſing other places, or quarters of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
enemies, to cauſe either a raiſing of the ſiege by ſuch diverſions, or to get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
equivalent to the place beſieged, in caſe it ſhould be loſt, or not relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable;
whereas a ſudden unexpected ſurrender foreſtals all ſuch diverſions and
compenſations of loſſes. Had <hi>Briſtoll beene held out</hi> to the utmoſt, in caſe his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
could not have timely releeved it; yet he might have carried <hi>Oxford,</hi>
or ſurpriſed divers of the enemies Garriſons, Forts, Men, Armes, Horſe, in other
quarters, whiles they were occupied at <hi>Bristoll,</hi> when as its ſudden ſurrender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
three full dayes ſiege, anticipated all diverſions, and recoveries in value, to
help ballance <hi>Briſtols</hi> loſſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, to deprive the enemy of the Ammunition, Proviſion, Victuals, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Magazines in the Towne and Caſtle; which if ſpent in their defence, to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
loſſe and ſlaughter, the Canons cloyed, the Armes made unſerviceable to the
enemy, they could not have readily beene ſupplied from other parts, and ſo the
Towne and Caſtle might have beene eaſily regained by a preſent ſiege, in caſe
they had not beene ſeaſonably releeved; however, the victory at leaſt had beene
leſſe honourable, leſſe advantagious to the enemy; who by an unworthy ſpeedy
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:159182:49"/>
ſurrender gained a City and Caſtle ready fortified, victualled, ammunitioned,
provided with all neceſſaries to their hands, fit for preſent defence, without any
coſt or labour; with Canon and Armes almoſt ſufficient to furniſh an Army by
land, and ſhipping enough to ſet out a ſtrong Fleet by Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, To preſerve the adjacent Townes, Forts, Counties, depending upon
the holding out of the place beſieged, who by a cowardly preſent ſurrender may,
be in danger to be ſurpriſed on a ſudden, and taken unprovided of Ammunition
Men, Armes, Victuals, or ſufficient Fortifications. If a Towne well fortified,
manned, victualled, to hold out three months ſiege in moſt mens opinions,
ſhall be cowardly yeelded up before extremity, in three dayes ſpace, as <hi>Briſtoll</hi>
was; all the neighbouring Garriſons, Counities, Cities, Caſtles, who depend
upon its three months defence, are in danger of ſurpriſall, and being taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed
at unawares, as infinite hiſtoricall examples evidence; and the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
ſurrender of Briſtoll</hi> (as the<note n="*" place="margin">Page 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Relation of Gloceſter</hi> ſiege truly ſtiles it)
was likely to have indangered <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> whoſe vigilant Governour would
doubtleſſe have been better furniſhed with Men, Ammunition, Victuals, had not
<hi>Briſtols</hi> over-haſty ſurrender foreſtaled his intentions: And who knoweth not,
that this ſurrender might have indangered the loſſe of <hi>London</hi> through an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
ſurpriſe, had the enemy preſently advanced towards it, as ſome adviſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, if any Towne be yeelded up before abſolute extremity and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of holding out longer, there is a moſt certaine preſent loſſe to the State
(perchance irrecuperable for the future too) but if held out till extremity, there
is ſtill either a probability or poſſibility of ſecuring and preſerving it left,
even to the utmoſt minute of its tenability, and that by infinite caſualties,
contingencies, and paſſages of divine providence tranſcending all humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehention.
As firſt, by unexpected ſupplies from other parts: Secondly, by
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> diverſions, or invaſions of the enemies quarters elſewhere, ingaging them to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> raiſe their ſiege. Thirdly, by ſucceſſefull ſallies; Fourthly, by extraordinary
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſlaughters of the enemies upon diſadvantagious aſſaults, of which they of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> had former experiences, where the enemy loſt an hundred men to one
of ours, and had neere 1700, flaine and hurt in leſſe then three dayes, with
the loſſe onely of ſeven or eight. Fifthly, by ſudden ſickneſſe in the enemies
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Camp: his Excellency (as this Defendant affirmed) had two or three hundred
men that fell ſicke about this time in his Army in one day, and one thouſand
or more in one weekes ſpace, and the enemies (for ought he knew) might
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> have undergone the like mortality. We read that Gods <hi>Angel in one night
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſlew in the King of Aſſyriah his hoſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 19. 35. Iſa. 37. 36. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>an hundred foureſcore and five thouſand men,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> and thereby raiſed Ieruſalems ſiege:</hi> And for ought the Defendant knew, God
might have ſent an equivalent deſtroying Plague among the <hi>Goddammee Army
of Cavaliers,</hi> who beſieged <hi>Briſtoll.</hi> Sixthly, by unſeaſonable tempeſtuous
weather, which hath broke up many Leaguers. Seventhly, by the death or
ſlaughter of ſome principall Officers or Commanders. Eighthly, by ſudden
pannick feares and apprehentions of approaching reſcues,<note place="margin">2 Kings 7.</note> of which we have
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
                  <hi>an eminent Scripture preſident in the * beſiegers of Samariah;</hi> to omit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Hiſtories.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20. 22 23, 24, 25.</note> Ninthly, by ſudden <hi>mutinies and diſcords among themſelves,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> which in * <hi>Scripture,</hi> and Stories are copious. Tenthly, by ſcarcity of proviſions
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:159182:49"/>
with which the Enemy before <hi>Briſtoll</hi> was very much pinched as Mr <hi>Savidge</hi>
depoſeth: Eleventhly, By want of Ammunition, the Enemies condition at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
                  <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> who had ſpent moſt of their powder, ſhot, of which they had farre leſſe
in their Campe, then the Defendant ſurrendred to them in the Caſtle: Twelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
By deſpaire of ſucceſſe, for which very reaſon the Enemies had retreated from
<hi>Briſtoll</hi> in two or three dayes more, had thoſe who entred the Line at firſt
been repulſed, as they might have been with eaſe, though the Defendant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
they had taken a ſolemn Oath, not to raiſe the ſiege till they had taken the
Town; which might have bin as eaſily fruſtrated, as that Oath of the Iewiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,
<note n="a" place="margin">Acts 23. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Who vowed they would neither eat nor drink till they had murdered
Paul:</hi> yet miſſed of their deſign. Beſides all theſe (whereof Hiſtories afford
plenty of Examples) there are infinite other contingencies frequent in Story,
whereby God out of his divine Providence hath many times miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Forts and Cities, even in their utmoſt extremities, againſt their potent
Enemies; when they have been reſolute to ſtand out to the laſt, eſpecially in the
cauſe of God, Religion, or their Countrey. And in ſuch a caſe as this is, where
we may with confidence expect the beſt, the ſpeedieſt aſſiſtance the Lord of
Hoaſts and God of Heaven can provide for us (if we dare rely upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
or providence without diſtruſt) he deſerves not the title of a Souldier, much
leſſe of a <hi>Chriſtian Souldier, Governour or Commander,</hi> who will not truſt God
to the utmoſt exigency, and rely upon his power, wiſedome, faithfulneſſe for
ſeaſonable deliverance and reliefe, which the Defendant (for want of faith as
well as courrage) durſt not doe, and ſo yeelded up all.</p>
               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">9.</note> If abſolute and preſent impoſſibility of longer defence, be not made
the only Rule of utmoſt extremity, wee ſhall open a wide gap to the treachery,
cowardize, negligence, indiſcretion, avarice, ambition, diſcontent of every Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and Commander, to the overthrow of all Martiall Diſcipline, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the whole Kingdome to ſpeedy loſſe and ruine: It being an eaſie matter
for any Governour or Commander, how cowardly, falſe or treacherous ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
to invent many plauſible excuſes, many forged, ſuppoſed, probable extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and to finde Witneſſes under his command to atteſt them; and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
thereof to betray and yeeld up the moſt conſiderable Towns, Caſtles, Forts,
throughout the Realm to the Enemy without any ſtroke at all, or after a few
dayes counterfeit ſiege, the better to paliate his treacherous deſignes: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon all theſe grounds, as likewiſe to reduce extremity to a certainty;
no other extremity ought to be admitted, but only a preſent abſolute impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of holding out any longer; to which the Defendant was no wayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
as we have already proved.</p>
               <p>In oppoſition to theſe impregnable Reaſons, Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> maintained theſe
three Paradoxes, ſufficient to corrupt and cowardize all Governours, Garriſons
whatſoever, to ſubvert all military Diſcipline, and betray any Kingdome in a
moment.</p>
               <p>The firſt was this,<note place="margin">Paradox 1.</note> that when ever the principall Rampart of any Town
was once entred by the Enemy, this was a ſufficient extremity to juſtifie both
a Parley and ſurrender. But the Line of Communication which the Enemies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
at <hi>Briſtoll</hi> was the Principall Rampart, as he pretended: Therefore his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:159182:50"/>
of it upon their entring the Line, was juſtifiable.</p>
               <p>To which was anſwered;<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> Firſt, that the Enemies entring the principall Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
is no lawfull ſufficient ground of a Parley or ſurrender, no nor yet the taking
of the principall Fort (for the reaſons aforeſaid) as long as the other Forts or
Townes are tenable; by holding whereof the Enemy may in time be repulſed
out of the works they have entred. If this were true Military Doctrine,
then <hi>London</hi> ſhould by like reaſon be ſurrendred to the King in caſe he came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it together with the Tower, as ſoone as the Line of Communication (the
chief Rampart) were entred, or any Out-Fort taken; and an whole Army ſhould
yeeld the Field, if one Troop or company of the Forlorne hope were routed.
Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> Though the Line of Communication of <hi>Bristoll</hi> were entred, in one
only place, yet not one of the Out-Forts was taken; the body of the City defended
by the Key, and all that part beyond the Bridge, together with the Caſtle (the
chiefeſt Fort Rampart, Sconce,) and every Street in the Town both tenable
and defenſible, as we have formerly proved: therefore the Enemies bare entry
within the Line of Communication only, was no extremity at all to juſtifie its
ſurrender in the judgment of any but extreame cowards.<note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, That the
maintaining of ſuch a cowardly Paradox to excuſe this ſurrender, was an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it proceeded from cowardize, and a ſufficient proofe of a timorous ſpirit.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Paradox was;<note place="margin">Paradox 2.</note> That if the Enemy had once entred or poſſeſſed the
Town, the Caſtle ought not to bee kept to the prejudice of the Citizens, but
ought to bee ſurrendred together with the Town, by the conſtant practiſe and
policy of Warre in all places, all ages; in which he was ſo confident, that hee
challenged Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> to ſhew one preſident to the contrary, and produced di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
examples in forraigne Parts out of French <hi>Mercuries</hi> and <hi>Gallobelgicuſſes;</hi>
with ſome late examples at home to juſtifie this aſſertion: as namely, the example
of <hi>Leypſick, Mentz, Philips-burb, Prague, Ausburge,</hi> the <hi>Burſe, Breda,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Townes abroad, of <hi>Portſmouth, Exceter, Lincolne, Worceſter, Wincheſter,
Chicheſter, Malmesbury, Hereford, Taunton Town and Caſtle, Bridgwater, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,
Dartmouth, Lime,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">He ſhould have added <hi>Banbury</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> to the Catalogue.</note> 
                  <hi>Reading;</hi> where he ſaith the Townes and Caſtles
were both ſurrendred together and not the Caſtles held out when the Towns were
taken; yet none of theſe Governours were ever queſtioned by the King,
or Parliament. And hee gave this reaſon to prove this Paradox, that if
Caſtles ſhould hold out when the Townes were taken or yeelded, it would much
diſhearten the Citizens, and make them unwilling to entertaine or aſſiſt any
Garriſons in the Caſtles.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> retorted;<note place="margin">Anſwer. 1.</note> retorted; That this was the groſſeſt abſurdity that ever
was broached by any man in his right ſences, and had hee not been intoxicated
with a ſpirit of puſilanimity, he would never have invented ſuch a poor ſubterfuge,
or made ſuch an ignorant challenge as this to ſave his endangered life. For firſt,
Caſtles and Citadels in moſt Townes are uſually the ſtrongeſt, moſt tenable, moſt
impregnable pieces of all others, beſt able to reſiſt and annoy the Enemies; the
Out-works, Line, and Towns themſelves leſſe tenable and reſiſtible then they;
to argue therefore that the Caſtle ought to be ſurrendred as ſoone as the Town is
entred or taken by the Enemy, is in effect to averre, That the ſtrongeſt Fort of all
muſt bee yeelded, becauſe the weakeſt part of all is entred: If this were a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:159182:50"/>
good Souldierly argument; then by the ſelfe-ſame reaſon if there were twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſtrong Forts or Caſtles about a Towne, and but one weake one; the whole
twenty ſtrong ones, though tenable, muſt be yeelded, becauſe only the weakeſt
one was forced; &amp; the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> (in caſe that City were beſieged)
might yeeld up both the Tower, Town, and all the other Forts to the King, if the
weakeſt part of the Line were but entred, or Hide-Parke, or <hi>Iſlington</hi> Fort once
entred by the Enemy; Yea, by this kinde of Souldery, if the weakeſt Troop or
Company in an whole Army be routed; the maine Body and Battalio of it, muſt
preſently yeeld up themſelves and the Field too, becauſe this weak party there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is defeated: and his Excellency at <hi>Edgehill</hi> fight, where ſome of his horſe
and foot runne ſhamefully away upon the firſt charge, ſhould by this ſenceleſſe
policy, have fled or yeelded, and not wonne the day, (as he did with greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,)
becauſe the worſt and weakeſt part of his Army was routed: But ſince
all men know, that the ſtrongeſt Forts and parties are to defend the weakeſt, not
the feebleſt them; and the Caſtles in Cities made more ſtrong and tenable then
other parts, for this very purpoſe, that they might hold out when the weaker
parts are taken, (this being the only uſe for which they were built and made ſo
ſtrong) the reaſon holds good on the contrary part; that becauſe the Town
which is the weakeſt is taken, therefore for this very reaſon the Caſtle which is
the ſtrongeſt part ought to be held out and not ſurrendered.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> Caſtles in moſt Townes, command the whole Townes where they
are, and thoſe who are Maſters of them, are ſtill Maſters of the places, and will
ſoon regaine the Townes: but if once ſurrendred, the Enemies become preſently
abſolute Maſters of both; and no hope is left of regaining either Town or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
againe without a ſiege or infinite expence and danger. Therefore there is all
the reaſon in the world to maintaine the Caſtles to the utmoſt when the Townes
are entred, and not to yeeld them up together, both to preſerve the dominion of
the place, and regaine the Townes with eaſe and ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> As long as the Caſtles hold out, the Enemy can enjoy little benefit by
the Towns, and have leſſe ſecurity in them. Beſides, their Conqueſt is incompleat,
leſſe terrible, not advantagious; their progreſſe from thence to other places retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unleſſe they leave the Caſtles unbeſieged. And their forcing of the Caſtles will
conſume them farre more men, Ammunition, money, then the entring of the
Towns, which without the Caſtles commanding them, are little worth. Therefore
for all theſe reaſons it is apparant; that Caſtles ought to be kept by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
exquiſiteſt grounds and policy of warre when as the Towns themſelves are
taken or ſurrendred.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> Neither will this be a diſcouragement, but the greateſt incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that may be to the Citizens, that the Caſtles muſt thus hold out to utmoſt
extremity: Firſt, becauſe the perſons and eſtates of the wealthieſt Citizens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
will be there ſecured againſt the Enemies rage and plunder, (as the honeſt <hi>Briſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
thought to have ſaved their perſons and eſtates by retiring into the Caſtle
when the Town had been forced, which were loſt by ſurrendring it:) Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Becauſe by keeping the Caſtles, the Townes are certaine to bee preſerved or
regained in a ſhort time, and thereby their liberties and priviledges: Thirdly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by this meanes they ſhall not bee long under the abſolute power of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:159182:51"/>
Enemy and new Lords to controule them, whereas if the Caſtles be yeelded their
perſons, eſtates, lawes, liberties, will be wholy expoſed to the Enemies will and
pleaſure, and ſubjected to their Tyranny. Therefore upon all theſe grounds the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
ought to have kept the Caſtle of <hi>Briſtol</hi> being ſtrong and tenable, to the
utmoſt extremity, and not to have ſurrendred it with the Town, though the
City had been taken or yeelded by compoſition.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> For examples, Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered, That if hee had his Books about
him, he could ſhew him at leaſt one thouſand Examples in Story to one of his,
where Caſtles have held out when the Townes were taken or yeelded: but ſince
his challenge was to produce but one Example to the contrary, he ſhould out of
preſent memory furniſh him with divers. The firſt, was a very ancient and
memorable one recorded in Scripture (which hee wondred the Defendant who
had read the Scriptures could forget) to wit, that of <hi>Thebez, Iudg.</hi> 9. where we
read<note n="a" place="margin">Iudges 9. 50. 51. 53.</note> 
                  <hi>That Abimeleck went to Thebez and encamped against it, and took it,
But there was a ſtrong Tower (or Caſtle) within the City, and thither fled all the
men and women, and all they of the City, and ſhut it to them; and got them up to
the Tower:</hi> but did not yeeld it up though the City was taken: <hi>And Abimeleck
came to the Tower and fought againſt it, and went hard to the doore of the Tower to
burn it with fire: And a certain woman caſt a piece of a Milſtone upon Abimelechs
head, and all to brake his ſcull: Then he called hastily to his Armour-Bearer,
and ſaid unto him, draw thy ſword, and ſlay me, that men ſay not of me, A woman
ſlew him; and he thruſt him through and he died, And when the men of Iſrael ſaw
that Abimeleck was dead; they departed every man to his place:</hi> Thus the ſiege
was raiſed, the Town preſerved, regained, and that by a woman. Had Col.
<hi>Fiennes,</hi> in caſe the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> had been taken, retired to the Caſtle, according
to his promiſe and there ſtood upon his guard, perchance Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> comming
for to aſſaile it as <hi>Abimeleck</hi> did the Tower or <hi>Thebez,</hi> might have been ſlaine
with a Milſtone by one of thoſe valiant women who offered to go up to the
Canons mouth to dead the bullets in caſe hee or his Souldiers were afraid to
charge; or at leaſt by ſome Musket or Cannon bullet; and ſo the ſiege might
have been raiſed and the Town regained: No man could tell whither ſuch an
accident might not have hapned, had the Defendant patiently expected the
iſſue of Gods providence in the Caſtle till utmoſt extremity, which no man
ought to deſpaire of, ſince (as the wiſe man enformes us)<note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 9. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>time and chance happen
alike to all men.</hi> Beſides, the ſiege might by ſundry other forementioned caſualties
have been raiſed, and the City preſerved: But alas, the Defendant was ſo farre
from having the faith and courage of a man, that he fell infinite ſhort of the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and proweſſe of this woman of <hi>Thebez;</hi> ſtiling the holding out
of the City and Caſtle, though but a day or two longer,<note n="b" place="margin">Letter to his <hi>Excellency,</hi> p. 4. Relation, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>A deſperate
Reſolution, &amp;c.</hi> not ſtaying till they were aſſaulted, but preſently yeelding
up both without any) aſſault, contrary to this Scripture preſident, which hee
had neither heart, nor courage to imitate. But leaſt hee ſhould pretend this
one example to be ſingular, I ſhall furniſh him with ſundry others, which I
wonder he could forget. If he had read the Roman Story, he ſhould have found
the<note n="c" place="margin">Livi. Rom. Hiſt. l. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Capitol</hi> defended againſt the <hi>Gaules when the City of Rome was taken; and
preſerved from ſurpriſe only by the crying of a Gooſe.</hi> Had his try all been at <hi>London,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:159182:51"/>
I could have informed him, that in our unhappy ancient Civill warres; the
Tower of <hi>London</hi> hath of times been held out when the City hath been yeelded:
the like we read of the Caſtles of <hi>Edenburgh, Barwick, Northampton, Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
Deviſes, Oxford,</hi> (in the time of <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſſe) <hi>Rocheſter, Bedford,
Nottingham, Pomfret,</hi> frequently kept in former times, when the Townes were
yeelded, or taken; and not to rove farther for preſidents; even <hi>Briſtol</hi> Caſtle
it ſelfe was held out by<note n="*" place="margin">See Graftons Chron. p. 211. 212. 213.</note> 
                  <hi>King Edward the Second, and the younger Spencer</hi> (in the
laſt yeare of this Kings raign) <hi>againſt the Queen and her Sonne</hi> Prince <hi>Edward,
after the Town was yeelded up to them by compoſition, to ſave their lives and
goods: and in theſe dayes Briſtol was ſtiled and reputed, A good Town and a ſtrong, well
cloſed, ſtanding on a good port of the Sea, having</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Yea Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Annal. pars prior p. 461. ſtiles it <hi>Caſtrum fortiſſimum</hi> in William Rufus his reign.</note> 
                  <hi>A STRONG CASTLE, and
the Sea beating round about it,</hi> Writes the Hiſtorian. Certainly had this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
well ſtudied the Hiſtory of <hi>Briſtol</hi> whiles he was there, he might have
found a preſident for holding out this very Caſtle after the City ſurrendred, and
then hee would not have made ſuch a ſilly challenge, to ſhew him one ſuch
example; But if theſe Ancient Examples had been forgotten, yet we have freſh
preſidents enough of this kinde which hee cannot but remember. The Caſtles of
<hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Nottingham</hi> both held out lately againſt the Kings Forces when the
Towns were taken. Nay, the very Cloſe at <hi>Litchfild</hi> (though no Caſtle but a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall)
held out againſt the Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> when the Town was yeelded; and ſince
the Parliament took it, againſt all Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Forces, almoſt as many weeks
as <hi>Briſtol</hi> it ſelfe did dayes, and againſt neare as great an Army, though it had
not above eightſcorce Souldiers in it: Yea, when the Prince had drained the
More about it, ſprung a Mine, blown up a great part of the Wall, and entred the
breach with above 200 men (being 50 more then firſt entred the Line at <hi>Briſtol</hi>)
yet the Garriſon there was ſo farre from yeelding the place by a Parley, that
they encountred the Enemies, took 200 of them Priſoners, beat the reſt out,
made good the breach till all their Powder within halfe a Barrell was ſpent;
and then came off upon more honourable termes by farre then the Defendant
at <hi>Bristol</hi> (which was not ſo much as aſſaulted, much leſſe entred) even with
their Colours diſplayed, their Bagge, Baggage, Armes, and reſtitution of their
Priſoners taken by the Enemy; which conditions were moſt punctually perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
becauſe they ſhewed themſelves men of valour, and had their armes about
them to defend themſelves from violence; when as the Defendant yeelded up
both Armes and Colours. To theſe I might adde the Examples of <hi>Limerick</hi>
and <hi>Galloway</hi> Caſtles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who held out many Months againſt the Iriſh
<hi>Rebels</hi> after the Towns were yeelded; Of <hi>Staffords</hi> Caſtle defended long
againſt the Parliament after the Town taken; and the freſh Example of
<hi>Lincoln,</hi> where the Cloſe was kept againſt the Earle of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> after the
Town ſurrenderd: But examples of this kinde are ſo frequent in all Stories,
and ſo experimentally known to every one who hath been bred a Souldier, that
I ſhall forbeare to trouble this honourable Councell (ſo well verſed in Hiſtories
and Warre) with any more preſidents of this kinde.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6.</note> To his objected preſidents; Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered: Firſt, that they
were only alledged, not proved by witneſſes, or Records; <hi>Gallo. Belgicus</hi> being
neither a legall teſtimony, nor record to be given in evidence at a tryall. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:159182:52"/>
That many of his preſidents were forraign, and it did not legally appeare
what were the grounds of thoſe Townes or Caſtles ſpeedy ſurrenders; which in
all probability was want of food, there being ſuch a ſcarcity of it in <hi>Germany</hi>
by reaſon of the long continued warres, that few Towns or Caſtles were victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aled
for one fortnights ſiege: and perchance they wanted Ammunition as well
as food. Thirdly, It appeares not whether thoſe Governours were not queſtioned
and capitally puniſhed for delivering up theſe Townes and Caſtles; ſince we finde
that in theſe late <hi>Germane</hi> wars, ſome have been condemned and executed for
yeelding up Townes too ſuddenly. Fourthly, many of our Towns he named had
no Caſtles in them, at leaſt none fortified to keep out an Enemy. Fifthly, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the ſurrendring and quitting of theſe Townes to the Enemy, was conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at, and never brought legally into queſtion as the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtol</hi> now is,
yet they deſerved to be both queſtioned and puniſhed, (as the quitting and
yeelding of <hi>Taunton, Dorcheſter, Lincolne, Banbury, Oxford,</hi> and other places:)
And if ſo, theſe examples can be no juſtification nor extenuation of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
crime. It is no plea for a Thief when taken, arraigned, to ſay. Such and ſuch
Theives have robbed others, and yet were never indited nor puniſhed for their
robberies; <hi>Ergo,</hi> my robbery is lawfull, and I muſt not be condemned for it:
Had they been apprehended and indicted, it had been no plea for them, that ſome
other thieves eſcaped without queſtioning; therefore no juſtification, nor excuſe
for him who is arraigned; Yet this is the ſum of the Defendants argument: Other
Governors in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> who have cowardly and treacherouſly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
&amp; quitted Garriſon Towns, have not been queſtioned for it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> I muſt
not be condemned nor blamed for my cowardly, traitorly ſurrendring of <hi>Briſtol,</hi>
now I actually impeached and convicted for it. If this be a good plea, to what
end are Martiall Lawes? Every Coward, Traytor ſhall then ſcape ſcotfee,
though he undoe, betray an whole Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7.</note> Some of the Townes he inſtanced in were cowardly quitted or
yeelded up upon his ſurrender of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> (as <hi>Barnſtable, Dorcheſter &amp;c.</hi>) whoſe
loſſe muſt be put on the Defendants ſcorce. As for the loſſe of <hi>Exceter,</hi> which he
inſtanced; it was anſwered: Firſt, that <hi>Exceter</hi> was beſieged, and held out more
Monthes then <hi>Briſtol</hi> did dayes; being beleaguered aboue three Months ſpace
ere it yeelded: and had he held out <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſo long, as he eaſily might, it would have
beene relieved in halfe the time, and kept ſafe till now: Secondly, that the yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up <hi>Bristol,</hi> was the loſſe of <hi>Exceter,</hi> which was much diſcouraged by its ill
preſident, and left deſtitute of all hopes or probabilities of relief by its ſurrender;
being too remote for his Excellency to relieve it, without endangering the loſſe
of <hi>Kent, London,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> during his abſence hence; and there being no
other Forces neare that could in any poſſibility or probability relieve it: yet
though it were thus hopeleſſe of all ſuccours, and much diſcouraged with the
ill examples of <hi>Briſtol, Barnſtable, Dorcheſter, Bridgwater, Taunton,</hi> and other
Weſtern Townes, it held out till the principall Fort was taken, and all their
powder ſpent; yea the Garriſon, Citizens, were all reſolved to have kept it with
their Pikes and ſwords when their Ammunition was exhauſted, had they had
but any probable hopes of ſuccours from any part; of which being utterly
hopeleſſe; they did for want of powder, after above three Monthes ſiege, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:159182:52"/>
the Town and Caſtle upon ſomewhat more honourable Termes then the
Defendant did <hi>Briſtol.</hi> Wherefore this preſident was ſo farre from juſtifying his
ignoble act, that it was a pregnant teſtimony and conviction of his guilt in not
holding out <hi>Bristol</hi> three dayes, when <hi>Exceter</hi> held above out three Monthes ſiege,
and ſpent all their Ammunition before they fell to Parley.</p>
               <p>His third Paradox was,<note place="margin">Paradox 3.</note> That ſome Generalls had ſentenced Commanders to
death for being too obſtinate in defence of Forts, and ſtanding it out overlong;
and that a French Author (there produced) affirmed; it was a capitall offence
to ſtout out a place overlong.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered.<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> 1. That this new Doctrine was certainely
calculated only for that Meridian where this great Souldier was borne, and fit
for none but it.<note place="margin">2.</note> Secondly, That the Defendant was ſo far from this fault of ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it out over-long; that he deſerves to loſe his head for yeelding <hi>Briſtol</hi> up
too ſoone; which certainly, in all mens judgements, is the more capitall crime
of the two.<note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, That no one preſident could be produced in Story, where
ever any Governour of a Town or Fort was judicially condemned or executed
by the Prince or State that intruſted him to keep them, for holding them againſt
the Enemy overlong: And if the Defendant had been guilty of this crime, wee
would have been ſo farre from impeaching, that we and the whole Kingdome
ſhould have honoured him highly for it, though wee have both juſt cauſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
him for the contrary; for which ſundry Governours have legally been
condemned. Fourthly, That it was a moſt ingrate requitall to execute any
man for his over-much valour and fidelity,<note place="margin">4.</note> and if this were once allowed for
Martiall Law, it would quickly make all Governovrs, Souldiers, Cowards or
Traytors; therefore certainly the Defendant had much miſtaken his French
Author; who writes only in generall: that ſome have been put to death for
ſtouting and holding out a Town overlong; without defining by whom this
was done. He pretends it was done by thoſe who intruſted them with the Townes,
of which no example can be produced; but certainly the Author meant it only
of the Enemies, who have ſomtimes put a Governour to death when a Town hath
been forced, for holding it over obſtinately out againſt them, for which there are
divers preſidents: And in this ſence (which doubtleſſe is the true) it ſuites very
well to the Defendants caſe. The poore man was excepted (as he tells us) out of
the Kings pardon ſent to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and ſo like to ſuffer if he held the Towne or
Caſtle till it were forced by the Enemy: Wherefore to prevent all danger and
ſave his beſt-beloved life, hee thought good to avoyd the rigour of this Law, by
purchaſing his impunity with the over-haſty ſurrender of them to the King; and
ſo by this unworthy ſhift

               <p>From this Commiſſion it appeares, firſt, that Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> was conſtituted
Governour of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> by Commiſſion from his Excellency under his Hand and
Seale. Secondly, that <hi>he had the command in chiefe of all the Forces and Garriſons
there, who were to be imployed FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE SAID
CITY, and the Liberties of the ſame; and to ſerve for the defence of the King, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and Kingdome.</hi> Thirdly, that he was ſpecially charged by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<hi>to take the ſaid City and Forces into his charge as Governour, and BY ALL
POSSIBLE WAYES AND MEANES TO PROVIDE FOR THE
DEFENCE AND SECURITIE OF THE SAME, AND TO
MANTAIN THE SAME AGAINST ALL ENEMIES AND
OPPOSITION WHATSOEVER; and that all Officers and Souldiers were
there to obey him as their Governour and Commander in chiefe for this ſervice:</hi>
Therefore he and his Officers were expreſly injoyned by this commiſſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and keep it againſt the enemy, to the uttermoſt extremity, and were there
placed for that very purpoſe: and that he ſent for, and accepted this Commiſſion
upon theſe very terms, and not only to rule his ſouldiers, not to keep the Town and
Caſtle, as he falſly at firſt pretended. Fourthly, <hi>that he was to obſerve and follow
ſuch further order and direction from time to time, as he ſhould receive from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:159182:53"/>
and both Houſes of Parliament;</hi> therefore not to ſurrender the City and
Caſtle without their ſpeciall order or direction, which he never had to doe it, as
himſelfe confeſſeth. His very Commiſſion therefore being expreſly violated in all
theſe particulars by this his ſurrender, before he was reduced to utmoſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
is a ſufficient evidence to declare and condemne him for a <hi>Traitor</hi> by the
very Ordinances of War, eſpecially ſince he knew the<note n="*" place="margin">See his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>pag.</hi> 13.</note> grand importance of
the place, for the Kingdomes ſafety.</p>
               <p>For Preſidents adjudged in point, I could produce many out of forraign<note n="*" place="margin">See Grimſtons Hiſtory of the Netherlands p. 827, 828.</note> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,
which I ſhall pretermit, becauſe they are no binding evidence in Law;
Wherefore I ſhall confine my ſelfe to ſuch domeſticke examples of this nature as
have been formerly adjudged in Parliament, (the ſupremeſt Councell of Warre,
whoſe judgements muſt direct all others) regiſtred amongſt our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie
Records, which cannot be controlled, and are the beſt evidence of any
other. The Records themſelves (examined by the Parliament Rolls) are long, and
written in Law-French, which perchance ſome of this Honourable Councell
underſtand not; I ſhall therefore briefly open them in Engliſh, into which I
have faithfully tranſlated them at large in <hi>The Doome of Cowardice and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie,</hi>
(printed by authoritie of Parliament) and apply them to the preſent caſe
in order as they are opened: which courſe the Councell very well approved.</p>

                  <hi>The firſt</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">7. R. 2. num. 38, 40.</note> 
                  <hi>Preſident is the caſe of</hi> John <hi>Lord of</hi> Gomineys, <hi>who in the Parl.
of</hi> 1. R. 2. n. 38. 40. <hi>was indicted and arraigned before the Lords for that he being</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>made Governour of the Town and Caſtle of</hi> Arde (<hi>in France) by K</hi> Edward <hi>the
third, to this intent,</hi> that he ſhould ſafely, keep the ſame for the King and his heires,
without ſurrendring them to any perſon without their command, did yet in King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the ſecond his reigne deliver and ſurrender the ſame to the Kings enemies,
without any command from him, to the diſhonour and diſ-inheriting of the King and
his Crowne, and of the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> against his undertaking aforeſaid,
without any dureſſe or default of Victuals or Artillerie, or of any other things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the defence thereof. To which Indictment the Defendant pleaded, that
the Town and Caſtle were ſo weake, that he could not well keep them againſt ſo great
a power of the enemies as was then ready to aſſaile them: Whereupon he aſſembled
all the Knights, Eſquires, and others in the Towne, and informed them of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
the Town was in, and of the enemies forces; and by common counſell and conſent
of them all he entred into a Treaty with the enemies, to ſave the Lieges of the King
within the Towne and Caſtle; and thereupon yeelded up the ſame upon termes of
compoſition, receiving no reward at all for ſurrendring the Towne or Caſtle. But
becauſe one <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Argentine</hi> Knight affirmed in Parliament, that he was
then in perſon within the ſaid Towne and Caſtle, in the defence whereof he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ready to live and dye, never conſenting to the ſurrender thereof: and becauſe
Sir <hi>Ralph de Ferrers</hi> Knight had valiantly defended them in former times against a
great force of the enemy when they were not ſo ſtrong as at the time they were ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred:
And becauſe <hi>de Gomineys</hi> had undertaken to keep them, and if he could not
have done it, he ought in no wiſe to have undertaken to keep them; and that another
ſhould and would have undertaken the ſafe keeping of them, had not he undertaken
it: and for that he yeelded them up in this ſort before utmoſt extremity, when he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
neither men, nor victuals, nor ammunition, he was adjudged to loſe his head, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:159182:54"/>
his plea, that he did it by the advice of a generall Councell of Warre,
Warre, to ſave the Kings liege Peoples lives and eſtates, and that
the Towne and Caſtle were weake, unable to reſiſt the Enemies power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Towne was of far leſſe importance to the Realme of <hi>England</hi> then <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll;</hi>
no treachery at all appeared in the ſurrender, made by the vote of a generall
Councell of War: yet we ſee the Governour adjudged to loſe his head, for not
holding it out to the utmoſt extremity, according to his duty. And if his plea
could not ſecure him from ſuch a ſentence, Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> his plea being the
very ſame with his, that he ſurrendred the City and Caſtle of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> to the
enemy before utmoſt extremity, becauſe they were weak and untenable for any
long time, to ſave the lives and eſtates of the Garriſon, and Parliaments friends,
and that by the counſell and aſſent of all the Knights, Eſquires, Souldiers, and
Inhabitants thereof, muſt needs be frivolous, and can no way extenuate his fault,
nor ſave his neck from the blocke; the rather, becauſe <hi>Bristoll</hi> was of far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſequence to the Kingdome now, and better provided, fortified, manned,
victualed, and more likely to be relieved, then <hi>Arde</hi> was then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond Preſident was of</hi> Pierce de Creſſingham <hi>and</hi> John de Spikeſworth
<hi>Eſquires, who were arreſted and arraigned in Parliament</hi> 7 Rich. 2. num. 17. for
<q>yeelding up the Castle of <hi>Drinkham</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> to the enemies,</q> from whom it
was gained by the Biſhop of Norwich, though it were well and ſufficiently ſtored
<q>with victuals and other neceſſaries, and ſtrong enough to be held against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
without the will or command of the King or his Lievtenant. To which
<hi>Spikeſworth</hi> pleaded, That he had never the custody of that Castle, or any thing
to doe therewith, but was chaſed into it by the enemy, it being then in the cuſtody
of <hi>Piers de Creſſingham:</hi> That ſoone after the enemy aſſaulting the Barbican,
he was unhappily routed, and one of his Varlets ſlaine cloſe by him: That he had
never any thing to doe in the Caſtle, neither as a Souldier thereof, nor in any other
manner whatſoever, but onely continued in it in manner aforeſaid till it was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
by the ſaid <hi>Piers;</hi> And therefore prayed, that it would pleaſe the King to
have him excuſed. Whereupon it was ordered he ſhould be ſet at liberty, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe could be ſaid againſt him. <hi>Piers Creſſingham,</hi> who had the cuſtody of
the Caſtle, alledged, That upon the yeelding up of the Towne and Caſtle of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
to the enemy, of all the Garriſon ſouldiers he had with him at <hi>Drinkham</hi>
none would continue with him for the ſafeguard of that Caſtle but onely five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
by reaſon of which great neceſſity, he was constrained for the ſafety of
his owne perſon and people, to enter into a Treaty with the enemies to deliver up
that Fort; and thereupon he yeelded it up, and not for any other cauſe, nor in any
other manner, but onely by conſtraint of the power of the enemies, aforeſaid; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
that he ever received any thing from the enemies by way of gift, or in any
other manner: Whereupon he conceived that no man ought to impute any manner
of blame or reproach unto his perſon; but if it ſhould be thought he had done ill in
any manner, he moſt humbly caſt himſelfe upon the grace of his Liege Lord. But
becauſe this excuſe was held inſufficient, he was committed to priſon, till the King
ſhould otherwiſe declare his opinion concerning him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here was a caſe of far greater extremity then <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> without any apparent
mixture of treachery; but onely five of the gariſon left to defend the Caſtle, when
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:159182:54"/>
as the Defendant had 2300 Souldiers at leaſt in <hi>Briſtoll;</hi> and a ſurrender by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
adviſe for the Governours and Inhabitants ſafety; yet becauſe <hi>Creſſingham</hi>
the Governour, by virtue of his office was bound to hold it till the utmoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
he was for the preſent adjudged to priſon, and to expect a further ſentence
afterwards; whereas <hi>Spikeſworth</hi> was acquitted, becauſe he came caſually into
the Caſtle, as forced by the enemy, and had no charge of it, as a Governour, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
or garriſon. Souldier; all which (as appeares by this reſolution) are anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and puniſhable for delivering up the ſmalleſt Fort before utmoſt extremity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third preſident is the caſe of the Biſhop of Norwich, accuſed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
7. R 2 num. 32. <q>for ſurrendring the Town of <hi>Gravelin</hi> to the enemy, before
utmoſt extremity, upon condition that it ſhould be totally demoliſhed, To which
the Biſhop pleaded, that by reaſon of the diſobedience of his Captains, who quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the field, and betooke themſelves to their Forts, he was conſtrained to retire
with his Forces to the Towne of <hi>Graveling,</hi> which he would have held out well
enough againſt all men, and did hold out till the other Captaines had ſurrendred
their Forts adjoining, to the <hi>French;</hi> and after that, untill ſpeedy ſupplies might
have arrived from <hi>England:</hi> But becauſe there were ſixe or 7000 Engliſh-men,
who came out of the Forts ſurrendred, lying on the ſands neare <hi>Calice,</hi> who could
not get into the Towne, and were in danger to be ſlaine by the <hi>French</hi> within two
or three dayes, (the Truce being then expired) whoſe loſſe would have been char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
principally upon him; thereupon he was commanded by the King himſelfe, to
render the Towne to the enemies or elſe to demoliſh it, and then to march to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
the ſaid <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and after that towards <hi>England,</hi> to ſave himſelf and others
of his Army, in caſe they were in any great want of victuals, as in truth they
were: and becauſe it behoved him to abate and void the Towne, as it was lawfull
for him to doe at his pleaſure, being gained by his proper conquest from the enemy:
it ſeemed to him, that he ought to be well excuſed of what ever was ſurmiſed
againſt him (for<note n="*" place="margin">Walſingham hiſt. Angl. p. 327 to 330. Holinſhed. Speed. Grafton in an. 6 Rich. 2.</note> compounding with <hi>French</hi> to raſe the Towne to the ground,
and to depart whither he would with his bagge, baggage, and men.) To which
was anſwered by the Lord Chancellor, That there was ſufficient victuals in the
Towne when the Kings Letter came there; after which the King ſent other victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
thither in great plenty, with Letters importing, how he had appointed his
Uncle to come speedily to his aid and ſuccour; yet notwithſtanding he departed
thence, leaving the Towne to the enemies, againſt the forme of his Indenture, by
which the King granted him whatever he ſhould conquer, not at all to ſurrender,
ſell, or leave the ſame to the enemy, but to hold and poſſeſſe it. And as for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
and defaults of his Officers, and their ſurrender of the Fortreſſes, they
neither could nor ought at all to excuſe him, ſeeing they were all named and choſen
by himſelfe, not by the King or his Councell, and the Articles of the ſurrenders
ſealed between them and the enemies, were made without the authority and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the King: Wherefore by the aſſent of the Earles, Barons, and other Lords
temporall preſent in Parliament, it was aſſented and decreed, That the Biſhop
ſhould be in the King mercy, (who out of his grace would forbeare to lay hands on
his body in regard of his function, though he might juſtly have proceeded against
him as a Lay-man:) that he ſhould be put to a fine and ranſome, according to
the quantity and quality of his offence, for which his Temporalties ſhould be ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:159182:55"/>
and whatever monies he had received from the King, and imployed to his
owne uſe, he ſhould preſently make full paiment thereof into the Kings Treaſury,
without delay or difficulty. <hi>Had he been a Lay-man his cenſure had proved ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall,
and more rigorous.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have all <hi>Colonell Fiennes</hi> excuſes pleaded to juſtifie this action: Firſt,
the ſaving not of a body of 1500, but 7000 Engliſh-men to ſerve the State, whoſe
lives were all endangered, not in a garriſon Towne or Caſtle well victualed, or
ammunitioned, as thoſe in <hi>Briſtoll</hi> were, but lying on the open ſands without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and that not in their owne native ſoile, but beyond the ſeas in an enemies
countrey. Secondly, Deſpaire of timely reliefe, and greater want of Victuals
then was in <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> where there was too much plenty. Thirdly, a Letter from
the King himſelfe, injoining the Biſhop to quit the Towne to the enemy in caſe
they wanted Victuals, as he alledged they did; when as <hi>Colonell Fiennes</hi> received
no ſuch Letter from the Parliament or his Excellency, to quit or yeeld up <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll.</hi>
Fourthly, this Towne was won from the enemy by the Biſhop himſelfe,
not immediately committed to him to guard by the King or Parliament, as <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll</hi>
was to the Defendant, who had leſſe right to ſurrender <hi>Bristoll,</hi> then this
Biſhop <hi>Gravelin,</hi> being his owne conqueſt. Fifthly, he did not yeeld up the
Towne, with all the Cannon, Armes, and proviſions in it to the enemy, as the
Defendant did <hi>Bristoll;</hi> but onely demoliſhed it and ſleighted the Fortifications,
departing thence with bag, baggage, cannon, and his men; yet notwithſtanding
all theſe particulars, and the gallant ſervice this martiall Biſhop had done in this
Expedition, he incurred this heavie cenſure, and had his Temporalties ſeized di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
yeers for his Fine and Ranſome. And if he deſerved ſuch a cenſure, no doubt
the Defendant deſerves a far greater, notwithſtanding his excuſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth preſident is that of Sir</hi> William de Elmham, <hi>Sir</hi> John Tryvet, <hi>Sir</hi>
Henry de Ferrers, <hi>and Sir</hi> William de Farendon, <hi>Knights, and</hi> Robert Fitz-Ralph
<hi>Eſquire, impeached in the Parliament of</hi> 7. R. 2. rot. Par. n. 24. <q>for ſurrendring the
Towne and caſtle of <hi>Burburgh</hi> to the enemy, and receiving monies for the Armes,
Victuals, Priſoners, and goods within the ſame. To the which Sir <hi>William de
Elmham,</hi> and moſt of the others pleaded, that they were enforced to ſurrender the
Towne and caſtle to the enemy of fine force, for the ſalvation of themſelves, the
Garriſon and people therein, the enemy having beſieged and aſſaulted it in very
great number, and ſet the Towne on fire within, who would have taken it by force,
and taken or ſlaine all thoſe within it, had they not yeelded it by agreement: And
that the monies they received, was onely for the Priſoners, Victuals, and other
goods within the ſame not for the ſurrendring of the Towne it ſelfe. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this excuſe was adjudged inſufficient, and the parties ordered to make
full paiment to the King of all the monies received from the enemy, to ſtand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to priſon, to make ranſome at the Kings will according to the quantity of
their ſeverall offences, and Sir <hi>William de Farendon</hi> left to the Kings mercy,
both for his body and goods, to doe with them what he pleaſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have a Towne aſſaulted by a multitude of enemies, fired in part, and
thereupon a ſurrender upon compoſition, to ſave the Officers and Souldiers from
being taken or ſlame by the enemy: yea, a better market then the Defendant
made at <hi>Bristoll,</hi> even a ſale of the priſoners, Victuals, and goods in the Towne to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:159182:55"/>
the enemy for money, when endangered to be all ſurpriſed by force; yet this
was judged no excuſe: Therefore certainly the Defendants pretended neceſſity,
and danger of forcing the Towne by the enemy, not halfe ſo reall as this, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
excuſe his crime, nor extenuate his guilt, nor yet his pretence of ſaving his
Officers and Garriſons lives and eſtates, to doe the Parliament ſervice elſe where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fift preſident, is that famous caſe of</hi> William de Weston <hi>in the Parliament
of</hi> 1. R. 2, num. 38, 39, 40. <q>The Commons in this Parliament prayed, that all thoſe
Captaines who had rendred or loſt Caſtles or Townes through their default, might
be put to anſwer it in this preſent Parliament, and ſeverely puniſhed according to
their deſerts, by award of the Lords and Barons, to eſchew the evill examples
they had given to other Governours of Townes and castles. Whereupon <hi>Iohn de
Gomineys</hi> (whoſe caſe I began with) and <hi>William de Weſton,</hi> then detained
Priſoners in the Tower, becauſe they had loſt and rendered the Kings Townes and
castles to the enemies, were brought by the Conſtable of the Tower before the
Lords in full Parliament in the White chamber; where <hi>Weſton</hi> by the Lords
command was arraigned by Sir <hi>Richard Leſcop,</hi> Steward of the Kings houſe, in
manners following.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>William de Weſton,</hi> you took upon you from the moſt puiſſant Prince (whom

King that now is, ſafely to keep to him and his heires, Kings of <hi>England,</hi> the caſtle
of <hi>Outhrewyke,</hi> without ſurrendring it to any one but to the ſaid Grand. father,
or to his ſaid heires, or by command from him, or from his ſaid heires; have you
<hi>William,</hi> who are a Liege man of our Lord the King, in times of the ſame our
Lord the King who now is, true heire to the ſaid Grand-father, delivered and
ſurrendred the ſame to the enemies of our Lord the King, without command from
him, to the diſhonour (or dammage) of him and his Crowne, and of the eſtate of
his Realme of <hi>England,</hi> againſt your allegeance and undertaking aforeſaid? What
will ye ſay hereunto?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the ſaid <hi>William</hi> put in his finall Anſwer in this behalfe. <q>To the
moſt ſage Counſell of our Lord the King, and to the other Lords and Commons of
the Parliament, ſupplicates and ſheweth <hi>William de Weſton,</hi> that albeit he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
of this, that he hath maliciouſly rendred the caſtle of <hi>Outhrewyke,</hi> of which
he had the cuſtody by delivery and aſſignment of our Lord the King, may it pleaſe
your ſage and juſt diſcretion to have the ſaid <hi>William</hi> excuſed thereof, for theſe
cauſes enſuing. First of all, may it pleaſe you to remember how that the ſaid <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
was lately informed by a Spie, that a great power of the enemies would
come upon him to beſiege the ſaid castle, with very great and very grievous Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
whereupon he the ſaid <hi>William</hi> preſently by his Atturney, and by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
required of the ſaid Councell, that it would pleaſe them to re-enforce the
ſaid castle with more men, for the defence and ſafeguard thereof, in regard that the
Garriſon of the ſaid castle that then was, were not halfe ſufficient in reſpect of
multitude to reſist ſo great a force in ſo large a place; but in concluſion, for all
this, he could not have any ſuccour from the ſaid Councell: And ſo the ſaid
<hi>William,</hi> not at all through his default, was left without people ſufficient for to
keep and defend the ſaid caſtle any long time; which he beſeecheth you to take into
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:159182:56"/>
your juſt and benigne conſideration. Alſo pleaſe you to know, how upon a Mua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
about one of the clocke the enemies came to beſiege the ſaid caſtle, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 2600 men of Armes, and 700 Arblasters Genevoyes, and with 5000 of
the commonalty of the countrey, having nine great Cannons, divers Engines, and
one great Mortar-peece, beyond all meaſure greater then ever they had ſeen any
before in thoſe Marches; and the ſame houre preſently a great number of the
men of Armes and Arblaſters aforeſaid came before the Gates for to aſſaile the
ſaid caſtle, and at this time ae Knight of theirs was ſlaine, who was couſin to the
Lord <hi>de Clifton</hi> as was reported, and many others were likewiſe then ſlaine and
wrecked. And within a ſhort time after they began to ſhoot with their Ordnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and other Engines, and ſo continued their aſſault from one day to another,
that is to ſay, Tuſeday, Wedneſday, Thurſday, and then were the walls and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the caſtle battered downe and bruiſed in many places; and they had likewiſe
by force trenched the ditches of the ſaid caſtle in three places, ſo as the water was
drained out; and that night came a great party of them, and by fine force made an
aſſault, and abated the Barricado's; and the next day (which was Friday) they
came about day breaking with all their Forces to aſſault the ſaid caſtle, but with
Gods aſſiſtance they were yet repulſed with force from their aſſault, and of the one
part and the other were ſome ſlaine and wounded. And the ſame day the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall
of <hi>Burgone</hi> ſent to the ſaid <hi>William</hi> and others of the ſaid caſtle, to render
it; whereupon having conſideration that the ſaid caſtle could not be kept, as well
in regard of the ſmall number of the people, as by reaſon that the walls in many
places were enfeebled by their marvellous Ordnance, there was a Treaty with the
Lords to this end; That the ſaid <hi>William</hi> and his company might adviſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the next morning; and ſo they departed each to his owne. Alſo
this ſame night the enemies cauſed all their Ordnances, Engines, Morter-peece,
Cannons, and Faggots, with Scaling-Ladders, Galleries, and all other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to be drawne up neare to the very ditch of the aforeſaid caſtle; and the next
day (which was Saturday) they made all things ready plainly for to aſſault the
plaece: And then firſt of all ſent an Herauld to the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> to know if the
ſaid caſtle ſhould be rendred to them or not? Whereupon the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the wiſeſt of his companions, taking conſideration how that the ſaid place
was deſtroyed and enfeebled with their Ordnance, and alſo that they were too
few men for its defence, by renſon that twelve of their companions were in this
time ſlaine, wounded and ſicke, ſo as there remained of all the people in the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in health, but onely 38 men to defend the ſame: hereupon by common aſſent
the ſaid caſtle (which could be kept no longer) was by force ſurrendred, for to
ſave their lives granted to them, and their goods: And that all theſe things
aforeſaid are true, the ſaid <hi>William</hi> puts himſelfe upon his proofe, according to
your moſt diſcreet Ordinances. Alſo it is to be remembred, that when the ſaid
caſtle was thus rendred as aforeſaid, certaine <hi>French</hi> people bargained with the
ſaid <hi>William</hi> for his victuals, to buy them, together with certaine Priſoners
which the ſaid <hi>William</hi> held impriſoned within the ſaid castle, for which things
he received of them for his payment 1500 Franks; of which he paid to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
for part of their wages which was behind unto them for one quarter of a
year<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and an halfe, 78 Franks; likewiſe after was paid at <hi>Calice</hi> for the victuals
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:159182:56"/>
of the ſaid castle before that time due, 442 Franks: Alſo for the paſſage of the
ſaid <hi>William</hi> and of his companions into <hi>England,</hi> and likewiſe for the expences
of the ſaid <hi>William</hi> being at <hi>Calice</hi> 135 Franks: And therefore the ſaid <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
prayeth in this regard your juſtice and benignitie, ſeeing by envious ſuggeſtion
he hath againſt all reaſon been accuſed, whereby his eſtate and name, by the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
ſinne of miſ-informers, and he alſo is ruined; having likewiſe conſideration,
that out of his proper goods he hath for the greater part paid his companions their
wages which were due unto them as aforeſaid, and alſo for the great coſts he hath
been at before this time, for to victuall the ſaid caſtle, (for which he hath given
his obligations in divers places, and oweth great ſummes, by reaſon whereof he is
on all ſides undone, if your juſt benignities doe not ſuccour him) that you would
be pleaſed for Gods ſake, and for pitie, to ordaine likewiſe for him, that he may by
your diſcreet nobleneſſe recover his estate and goods. Alſo the ſaid <hi>William
Weſton</hi> ſheweth, how the firſt day when the enemies came before <hi>Arde,</hi> that he
went in haſte to <hi>Calice</hi> unto the Captaine, and deſired of him more ſuccour and
aid of men, for the better guarding of his Fort of <hi>Outhrewyke,</hi> and to defend it
if the enemies ſhould come thither; and the Captain anſwered him briefly, that he
would not deliver nor give him aid nor ſuccour at the ſaid time, becauſe he
doubted that the ſaid enemies would come before the towne of <hi>Calice.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all theſe pleas, the Lords in this Parliament, together with the moſt
valiant and diſcreet Knights and other Members thereof, after good and mature
deliberation hereupon, delivered their judgement and reſolution againſt <hi>Weſton</hi>
in forme following. It ſeemeth to the Lords aforeſaid that you <hi>William,</hi> who
had taken upon you ſafely to keep the caſtle of <hi>Outhrewyke,</hi> as before is ſaid, that
you have without any dureſſe or default of victuals evilly delivered and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
the ſame to the enemies of our Lord the King, by your owne default,
againſt all apparent right and reaſon, and againſt your allegiance and undertaking
aforeſaid; and having by due information read the caſe of the late Baron of <hi>Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock,</hi>
who was a Lord, and one of the Peers of the Realm, who had taken upon him
ſafely to keep for the foreſaid Grandfather the towne of <hi>Barwick:</hi> the ſaid Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
perceiving afterwards that the ſaid Grandfather addreſſed himſelfe to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Realme of <hi>France,</hi> the ſaid Baron (without command of the ſaid Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
committed the ſaid towne of <hi>Barwick</hi> to a valiant Eſquire <hi>Robert de Ogle</hi>
as Lievtenant to the ſaid Baron, for to keep ſafe the ſaid towne of <hi>Barwick</hi> to the
ſaid Grandfather, and the ſaid Baron went as an horſeman to the parts of
<hi>France</hi> to the ſaid Grandfather, and there remained in his company: during
which time an aſſault of war was made upon the ſaid towne of <hi>Barwick</hi> by the
<hi>Scots,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> as Lievtenant of the ſaid Baron valiantly defended
the ſame, and at last by ſuch forcible aſſaults the ſaid towne was taken upon the
ſaid <hi>Robert,</hi> and two of the Sonnes of the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> there ſlaine in the defence
of the ſame. Notwithſtanding becauſe that the ſaid Baron himſelfe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon him the ſafeguard of the ſaid towne to the ſaid Grandfather, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
himſelf from thence without command of the ſaid Grandfather, and the
ſaid towne of <hi>Barwick</hi> was loſt in the abſence of the Baron, he being in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the ſaid Grandfather in the parts of <hi>France,</hi> as is aforeſaid: It was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,
by advice of the ſaid Grandfather, the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> who is preſent, the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:159182:57"/>
Nobles, Dukes, and Counts, <hi>Henry</hi> late Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the late Earle of
<hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter de Manny,</hi> that the ſaid towne
was loſt in default of the ſaid Baron, and for this cauſe he had judgement of life
and member, and that he ſhould forfeit all that he had; and to render his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in theſe words the ſaid Sir <hi>Walter</hi> had a command from the ſaid Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father.
Which things conſidered, and this alſo, that you <hi>William</hi> ſurrendred the
ſaid caſtle of <hi>Outhrewyke</hi> to the enemies of our Lord the King aforeſaid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any dureſſe or want of Victuals, againſt your allegeance and undertaking afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
the Lords abovementioned ſitting here in full Parliament adjudge you to
death, and that you ſhall be drawne and hanged. But becauſe that our Lord the
King is not yet informed of the manner of this judgement, the execution thereof
ſhall be reſpited untill the King be informed thereof: Whereupon it was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the ſaid Constable ſafely to keep the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> untill he had other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from our Lord the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This caſe is very punctuall, this judgment fatall to the Defendant, wherein all
his former pleas, and far better then he could make, are over-ruled againſt him
long ſince even in full Parliament. Firſt, this <hi>Weſton</hi> as ſoon as he heard of the
enemies approaches and intent to beſiege <hi>Outhrewyke</hi> caſtle, ſent poſt to the
Councell, and to the Governour of <hi>Calice,</hi> acquainting them with the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Garriſon, and craving preſent aid, (as the Defendant pretended he
ſent to his Excellency) yet could receive no ſupplies from either. Secondly, his
Garriſon was not halfe enough to reſiſt the enemies great power, neither had he
meanes to encreaſe it; when as <hi>Bristoll</hi> garriſon was abundantly ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the enemy, and the Defendant might have doubled it had he pleaſed, there
being 6000 or 8000 able men more in the towne, whom he might have imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in its defence. Thirdly, there were 8400 enemies before it, as many or more
then were before <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and but 50 men onely in the caſtle to defend it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there were 2000 foot and 300 horſe at leaſt to guard <hi>Briſtoll:</hi> a vaſt diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
Fourthly, they had nine great Peeces of battery, a great Ram or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-peece,
greater then ever were ſeen in thoſe parts before, with many other
Engines, as many or more then the enemy had at <hi>Briſtoll.</hi> Fifthly, the ſiege,
battery, and aſſault thereof, continued from Munday till Saturday; whereas <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll</hi>
was beſieged onely from Munday till Wedneſday noone (not halfe ſo long)
and then yeelded upon parley. Sixtly, all the walls and houſes of the Caſtle were
beaten downe and battered exceedingly, and the ditches drained of the water by
trenches, and all their barricado's beaten downe, yet they ſtill held it out:
whereas not one ſhot at all was ſo much as made againſt the Caſtle or walls of
<hi>Briſtoll,</hi> but againſt the Out-works onely. Seventhly, after the walls and barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado's
were thus broken downe, and the ditch drained, they manfully repulſed
the enemy, who fiercely aſſaulted it, and ſlew divers of them, with the loſſe and
wounding of ſome of the garriſon; whereas <hi>Briſtoll</hi> Caſtle, and the body of the
Towne, were yeelded up before the leaſt battery, Mine, or Aſſault. Eighthly,
they made all things ready for an aſſault, planting all their Ordnance, Engines,
Galleries, and Faggots, cloſe to the Caſtle-ditch, and ſent two ſeverall Heraulds
and Meſſengers to him for a Parley ere he would treat: whereas the Defendant
before any battery or aſſault againſt the City or Caſtle ſent out twice to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:159182:57"/>
enemy for a Parley, with ſo much haſte, that he would not hearken to any who
would beat them out, or oppoſe or delay the Treaty. Ninthly, twelve of his fifty
men were by this time ſlaine, ſick, and wounded, ſo that he had onely 38 left, to
make good the caſtle thus battered and aſſaulted with ſo great a power; whereas
the Defendant loſt but eight men at moſt, and had at leaſt 2300 horſe and foot,
when he fell to parley. Tenthly, he ſurrendred the Caſtle, by the advice of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell of War, upon better grounds then the Defendant yeelded up
<hi>Briſtoll;</hi> to wit, becauſe the wals were beaten downe, the garriſon over ſmall to
defend it, the enemy very likely to force it by the aſſault, no preſent reliefe neare
at hand, and to ſave his owne with the Souldiers lives and goods, which elſe
were indangered to be loſt; none of which the Defendant can juſtly alledge, as
we have manifeſted. Eleventhly, he made the moſt of an ill bargaine, by ſelling
the Victuals and Priſoners in it to the <hi>French</hi> for 1500 Franks, with which he
paid his Souldiers their arrears of wages, diſcharged the debts of the caſtle ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Victuals, and defrayed the charges of their paſſage into <hi>England;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Defendant yeelded up all the Priſoners and Victuals to the enemy <hi>gratis;</hi>
with which proviſions the ſhips that brought over the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Souldiers were victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alled,
and left the State to pay the Souldiers arreares, and other debts contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by him there, amounting to many thouſand pounds, which ought to be
made good out of his owne eſtate. Therefore in theſe reſpects he ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the ſelfe ſame judgement of death, and to be drawne and hanged much
more juſtly then he.</p>
               <p>To theſe Preſidents,<note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> Anſwered: 1. That theſe Governours had
all of them Commiſſions under the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> to keep theſe
Townes and Caſtles, and that made their offence ſo great; but hee had
no ſuch Commiſſion under the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> to bee Governour
of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and this he conceived differenced the caſes much.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replyed:<note place="margin">Reply:</note> Firſt, that the Defendant was much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in this point; for theſe Towns and Caſtles lying in <hi>France,</hi> if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
of their Governourſhips were under any Seale, it was under the great
Seale of <hi>France</hi> not of <hi>England,</hi> as appeares by the expreſſe Statute, of 14. <hi>E.</hi> 3.
<hi>Stat. 4. &amp; 1. H. 6. Rot. Parl. Num.</hi> 14. 15. Secondly, that the great Seal being
carried from the Parliament when his Commiſſion was granted, he could not
expect any ſuch Commiſſion under the great Seal, but from the King himſelfe in
oppoſition to the Parliament, to whom he ſurrendred <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> perchance for want
of a Commiſsion under the great Seal to keep it. Thirdly, if this were a
good plea or warrantable diſtinction, then all the Governours of Towns and
Caſtles within the Parliaments power might treacherouſly or cowardly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
them forthwith to the King without puniſhment or danger, becauſe they
wanted a Commiſsion under the great Seal to keep them. Fourthly, he had a
Commiſsion under his <hi>Excellencies</hi> hand and ſeal to keep the City; under whoſe
Authority he took the cuſtody of it for the Parliaments and Kingdomes ſafety
in theſe diſtracted times, by vertue of a Commiſsion of both Houſes granted
to his Excellency: therefore his offence is as great, as capitall for ſurrendring
it contrary to his truſt and his Excellencies Commiſsion to keep it, as if it had
been under the great Seal. Fourthly, when his Commiſsion was firſt granted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:159182:58"/>
the Parliament had not made a <hi>New great Seal</hi> to ſeal it, but ſince his ſurrender of
<hi>Briſtol,</hi> they had made one: and he durſt aſſure the Defendant, had his courage
and fidelity been ſuch as to hold out <hi>Briſtol</hi> till the new Seal was made, hee
would have procured him a Commiſsion under it to keep <hi>Briſtol,</hi> rather then
hee ſhould have yeelded it up cowardly to the Enemy for want of a Commiſsion
under the great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> But becauſe he held it not till ſuch Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
might be obtained, he muſt be condemned for rendering it contrary to that
Commiſsion which he both ſent for and received from his Excellency under his
Seal of Armes alone.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Anſwer was,<note place="margin">Anſwer 2.</note> that it appeared not in theſe Records what other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and proofes were produced againſt theſe perſons, beſides thoſe mentioned
in them, and therefore for ought he knew they might be condemned for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe beſides what is alleadged in theſe Records, elſe the caſes might ſeem
very hard and the ſentences none of the juſteſt.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> Replyed,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> That the Defendant by this ſtrange Anſwer
betrayed his extraordinary ignorance in matters of Law and Records, into
which no Depoſitions of Witneſſes are wont to bee inſerted, but only the
true ſtate of the caſe it ſelfe, and the Iudgement given thereupon, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſurmiſe they were condemned for any thing elſe, then what is expreſly
mentioned in the Records and Iudgments themſelves, is to averre againſt the
very Records, and the Iudges that gave the ſentences; and ſo to falſifie and nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
all Records. The caſes therefore being admitted to be really ſuch as the
Records relate in nature of a demurrer or conceſsion, and the Iudgements de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
them to be ſuch; this anſwer muſt rather be deemed an ignorant
miſtake, then any ſolid reply.</p>
               <p>His third Anſwer was,<note place="margin">Anſwer 3.</note> That the Caſtle of <hi>Outhrewik, Arde</hi> and <hi>Burbugh,</hi>
were places of no great conſequence or wealth and therefore ought to be held out
to the utmoſt. But <hi>Briſtol</hi> being one of the richeſt, chiefeſt Cities in the
Realme, and of great importance, ought not to bee endangered or ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by holding it to the utmoſt extremity, as Caſtles and other ſuch places
of leſſe concernment might be.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> Anſwered:<note place="margin">Reply.</note> Firſt, that if places of ſmalleſt concerment
ought to hold out to extremity, and if it be death to yeeld them up before; then
certainly <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and places of greateſt conſequence to the ruine or ſafety of
the Realme ought much more to be kept till extremity, and the yeelding of them
up muſt be more capitall: elſe he that betrayeth the greateſt truſt, and doth moſt
miſchiefe to the State, ſhall be leſſe culpable, and undergoe a milder cenſure
then he that betrayes the ſmalleſt Fort: yea if this were either good juſtice, law,
or Lodgick; the Defendant might argue, that he who ſteales ten thouſand pounds
or murthers a man, deſerves not death, but hee who ſteales thirteen pence halfe-penny,
or ſtrikes a man ought to bee hanged without pitty. The preſident
and Argument therefore held <hi>à minori ad majus:</hi> If theſe were condemned for
their cowardly ſurrendring of thoſe inconſiderable Townes and Caſtles before
utmoſt extremity, which did but little prejudice to the Republike; then much
more ought the Defendant to loſe his head for yeelding <hi>Briſtoll</hi> thus, a place of
higheſt concerment to the Kingdome, which is almoſt loſt in, and by its loſſe.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:159182:58"/>
And doubtleſſe the Defendant who would not adventure his life to preſerve
ſuch a moſt conſiderable City as <hi>Briſtol</hi> to the utmoſt exigent, would never
adventure it to hold out any other inferiour places till the laſt, but yeeld them
up without reſiſtance. Since therefore it appeared by theſe preſidents; that the
parties impeached for ſurrendring up any Forts were alwayes detained under
cuſtody during their tryall; He deſired the Councell the ſecond time, that
Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> might preſently bee put under ſafe cuſtody, and judgement given
againſt him according to theſe preſidents and the Lawes of warre: the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were ſeconded by his own late judgement againſt <hi>Yeomans</hi> and <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi>
whom he condemned and executed by Martiall Law only for endeavouring
to deliver up <hi>Briſtoll</hi> to the Enemy before it was fully fortified, when as
himſelfe thus cowardly and traitorouſly ſurrendred it to them after it was forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and abundantly furniſhed with all neceſſaries to hold out a ſiege, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionall
ſurrender being not ſo criminall or fatall to the Republike, as his
actuall.</p>
               <p>When we had thus made good the ſeverall Articles of our charge, and fixed
the loſſe of <hi>Briſtol and the Weſt too</hi> on Col. <hi>Fiennes,</hi> who by his not denying it
in his Anſwer to the fourth Article, did thereby in point of Law confeſſe it.
The Colonell to free himſelfe from this heavie charge, took the boldneſſe to
tranſlate it, to one no wayes guilty of it; averring before the Councell with
greater impudency then verity, <hi>That Briſtol and the Weſt were not loſt by him,
but by Sir William Waller:</hi> to prove this Paradox, he produced ſeverall imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
Allegations, caſting ſundry falſe aſperſions upon that eminent Knight
behinde his backe, which he durſt not have uttered in his preſence. Vpon which
Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> humbly moved the Councell, that a Gentleman of his worth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
might not be thus publikely traduced, where he was neither preſent to
make his defence, nor a party to the Articles; deſiring that either he might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially
prove this palpable ſlander by pregnant evidences, or elſe be exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily
puniſhed for it.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Defendant firſt alledged,<note place="margin">Calumny 1.</note> that he ſent Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> 1200
Foot out of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> (to wit, Colonell <hi>Pophams</hi> whole Regiment) very well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
who at the rout of Sir <hi>William</hi> neare the <hi>Deviſes</hi> loſt all their Armes, (not
many of theſe men returning thenceto <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and thoſe without Arms;) the
loſſe of which Regiment ſo weakned the garriſon, that it loſt both <hi>Briſtoll</hi> and
the Weſt, which he could not defend for want of men.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered,<note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> firſt, that <hi>Bristoll</hi> was not loſt for want of
men; and that this Regiment was fully made up and ſupplied by the Defendant
his owne confeſſion, with a great over-plus; Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> not receiving
above 7 or 800 Foot out of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> in lieu whereof the Defendant raiſed 1100
or 1000 at the leaſt,<note place="margin">2.</note> beſides thoſe from <hi>Malmſbury.</hi> Secondly, that when he
ſent forth that Regiment he had an independent Commiſſion, and could not be
enforced to it, not ought to have ſent them if the City were thereby endangered,
without ſpeciall command from the Parliament or his Excellency: His ſending
out then of this Regiment being his owne voluntary act, (as his owne Letter
to Colonell <hi>Popham</hi> atteſts, and he confeſſed) it is cleare that himſelfe onely was
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:159182:59"/>
the loſſe both of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> and the Weſt; and if there were no other evidence, this
alone would endanger his head, it being capitall by all Laws of war for any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
to ſend out his Garriſon, or to abſent himſelfe from his charge, without
ſpeciall command, if the place be by this means loſt or ſurpriſed, as was adjudged
in Parliament in the caſe of the Baron of <hi>Greyſtock</hi> cited in <hi>Weſtons</hi> caſe; of the
Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Waiſing. hiſt. Angl. p. 337. See 56. E. 3. n. 23</note> 
                  <hi>Henry Percy</hi> in 7. <hi>R.</hi> 2. and others: Vpon which ground
we find the Governour of <hi>Calice</hi> refuſed to part with any of his Garriſon for the
defence of <hi>Outhrewyke</hi> Caſtle: And the reaſon is apparent, becauſe if Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
might draw out their Garriſons, or deſert their charges at their pleaſure,
their Forts might be eaſily ſurpriſed, betrayed, and a gap opened to infinite
treacheries; ſo that in this confeſſion we may ſee the juſt hand of God upon this
ſlanderer, who by endevouring to impeach Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> hath thus made
an halter to hang himſelfe, and thereby acquitted him from all imputations of the
loſſe of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> or the Weſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Calumny 2.</note> he produced his Couſin Captain <hi>Temple</hi> to teſtifie, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of his acquaintance, and of kin to Colonell <hi>Fiennes,</hi> overtook another
Gentlewoman upon the high-way, newly come from <hi>Oxford,</hi> of whom asking
what newes, ſhe anſwered, that the greateſt Newes now at <hi>Oxford</hi> was, that
though Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> had occaſioned the loſſe of <hi>Bristoll</hi> and the Weſt, yet
Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> was like to ſuffer for it, and become his Sacrifice; who being the
great <hi>Diana</hi> of the people, and ſo neceſſary a man to the Parliament, now in the
field with an Army, they would forbeare to queſtion him, and ſacrifice Col.
<hi>Fiennes,</hi> to humour him and his party.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered,<note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> firſt, That this extravagant report, teſtified
onely at the third or fourth hand, was no evidence at all, and ſavoured rather
of a direct plot to traduce Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> then to juſtifie Colonell <hi>Fiennes.</hi>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> that all the Weſtern Gentlemen had a quite contrary opinion of this
buſineſſe, that <hi>Briſtoll</hi> and the Weſt were loſt by the Defendant, not by Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi>
as appeared both by their extraordinary reſpects unto him, and preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of him to regaine the Weſt.<note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, admit this fabulous report to be
bruited in <hi>Oxford</hi> (to aſperſe Sir <hi>William,</hi> the Parliament, and juſtifie the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant)
yet it ſignified no more, but that Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> had better friends
and reſpect at <hi>Oxford</hi> then Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> perchance for his good ſervice in
ſurrendring up <hi>Briſtoll</hi> to them at ſo eaſie a rate in ſo ſhort a time, (enough to
purchaſe him both friends and favour at the Court) where Sir <hi>William</hi> was not ſo
gratefull, becauſe he never did them ſo great a courteſie, or good peece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
nor the Republike ſo grand a miſchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calumny</hi> 3. Nota.</note> 
                  <hi>Colonell</hi> Fiennes <hi>for a concluſion of his defence, had the impudence
to informe the Councell,</hi> That this trouble, proſecution, and diſgrace had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
him, but for that conſtant affection and ſervice which he and his family had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſhewed to his Excellency and his Army, for which Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> and
his party did maligne him.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replied,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> that this was a moſt falſe, ſcandalous, ſeditious
ſpeech, diſcovering who they were that raiſed, fomented, the late unhappy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between his <hi>Excellency</hi> and Sir <hi>William,</hi> and to what finiſter end; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:159182:59"/>
could be uttered more effectuall to ſet all the Parliaments ſeverall Armies
into a faction againſt one another, in ſtead of joyning againſt the publike enemy,
And therefore having neither the leaſt ground nor proof to juſtifie this calumny,
he deſired he might be exemplarily proceeded againſt for it.</p>
               <p>In fine, after ſome impertinent hear-ſay proofs, what opinion the enemies had of
his valourous defence of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and the intenability thereof, (which were then
fully anſwered by the proofes themſelves) and a recapitulation of all the heads of
his defence, he concluded with this peroration.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My Lords, I have at laſt ended my defence, and (as I hope) ſufficiently clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both my honour, valour, and fidelity to the State in the defence of <hi>Briſtoll:</hi>
And now I beſeech you to conſider, whoſe honour or life can be in ſafety, if
Lawyers (feed by their owne malice) may fift and turne up all his actions, and
ſnarle at his words If ſuch who are no Souldiers, may upon the information of
Atturnies, and teſtimony of Shop-keepers, Ale-wives, Enemies, but of no Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
at all, (except ſuch who appeare out of particular ſpleen) be brought thus
upon the Stage for their lives, and the great Priviledges of Parliament broken
by ſuch an Impeachment of a Member of it, which could not be paralleld but
by that accuſation of the five Members. Wherefore I deſire, that as I have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
my countrey faithfully, and done many good ſervices for it, ſo I may by
this Honourable Councell be juſtified in my faithfulneſſe, and repaired againſt
the Proſecutors in my Honour, more deare unto me then my life, that ſo after all
my publike ſervices, I may not now be caſt behinde the doore like a diſh-clout,
unfit for any further imployment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> replyed, Firſt, that he wondred much why the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
ſhould thus except againſt him as an unfitting Proſecutor, ſince himſelfe
(without his privity or deſire) had by a Proclamation under his <hi>Excellencies</hi> hand
and Seale, poſted up at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and the <hi>Exchange,</hi> ſelected him and Mr <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
by name to proſecute this buſineſſe againſt him; if then we were unmeet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,
it was his owne not our errour, and he muſt blame onely his owne judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the choice, not us. Secondly, that though he were but a common Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
yet he deemed one of that profeſſion a very fit proſecutor of him who had
betrayed his truſt, and in it the Kingdome, contrary to Law: And whereas the
Defendant ſcandalouſly objected, <hi>that he was feed by his owne private malice,</hi> he
proteſted, that there was never any malice, nor cauſe therof between them; that he
formerly honoured the Defendant for his <hi>Pen,</hi> but never for his <hi>Sword,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
ſome courteſies on, though he never received any from him; that he was
born not far from <hi>Bristoll,</hi> bred up ſome years therein, had many friends, kinred,
in or near it, who loſt much, and himſelf not a little, by its ſurrender; that nothing
had ingaged him in this proſecution but the Defendants owne ſummons, nor feed
him but the publike ſervice of the Parliament, and ſecurity of the Realme, that
although he had loſt and ſuffered much for the Church and State, yet he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
nor expected the leaſt recompence, much leſſe reward from either, nor ever
had any pay for publike ſervices, whereas the Defendant received good wages
for all his ſervices, and for loſing <hi>Briſtol</hi> too: that himſelf had never loſt any thing
of the States, as he had done, but onely what was his owne, (his Liberty, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:159182:60"/>
Eſtate, Members,) and that only for doing the Church and Kingdom ſervice,
neither of all which the Defendant had parted with for the publike: And therfore
whereas the Defendant boaſts of his publike actions, he could without vanity
or prejudice truly affirme, he had done ten times more ſervice for Church and
State, and ſuffered a thouſand ſold more for both, not onely <hi>gratis,</hi> but even with
the loſſe of all his earthly comforts, then this boaſter had done upon pay; and
that he doubted not through Gods aſſiſtance he ſhould be able to doe the Church
and State as good or better ſervice for the future, as he; wherefore he had little
reaſon to extoll himſelf ſo much, or depreſſe him ſo low, as not to be a fitting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor
of ſuch an unworthy action. That though he were no profeſſed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
yet he doubted not but he had read as many or more Treatiſes of military
affaires as himſelfe; that he had for eight yeares ſpace of his reſtraint in the
Tower of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Mount orguiell</hi> Caſtle, converſed with old Souldiers, (and
by name with Sir <hi>William Balfoure</hi> for five yeares in the Tower) from whom he
gained ſo much experience in martiall affaires, as he would have undertaken to
have kept the City and Caſtle of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> till this day, had he been Governour
there as the Defendant was, notwithſtanding their pretended intenability, and
the enemies power: that in the managing of this very buſineſſe before this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Councell, he had in ſundry particulars manifeſted himſelfe, if not a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet at leaſt as good a Souldier as the Defendant, (for which he appealed to
the Councell) and in regard of his long ſuffering and reſtraint in Caſtles was the
ancienter Souldier of the two: That the Defendant had confeſſed to Lievtenant
Col. <hi>Paleologus</hi> and <hi>Andrews,</hi> when he firſt undertook the Government of <hi>Briſtoll,
That he was no Souldier,</hi> and his yeelding of it up in ſo ſhort a time, before extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
upon ſuch poor conditions, manifeſted him in truth to be no Man at Arms;
and therefore though he were no profeſſed Souldier, yet why he ſhould not be
a Souldier ſufficient to proſecute him who by his own confeſſion and action is no
reall Souldier, he could yet diſcern no reaſon. For his Witneſſes, whom he here
vilified and traduced, they were many of them perſons of quality and honour,
ſome of them Members of Parliament; others, more expert Souldiers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
better verſed in martiall affaires, then any of the Defendants Witneſſes; all
of them perſons of good fame and converſation, diſ-intereſſed, diſ-ingaged in
the cauſe, againſt whom no exceptions can be taken: whereas all his materiall
Witneſſes were his owne Officers, Brother, Kinſmen, Servants, Creditors, and
parties in the cauſe, moſt of them involved with him in the ſelf-ſame guilt. That
his Life and Honour were now drawne in queſtion only by himſelfe, upon his
owne motion and engagement of us, and if he loſt them (as he loſt <hi>Briſtoll</hi>) he
might thank himſelfe for intereſſing us in this publike ſervice, for our Countries
honour and future ſecurity, the onely thing we aimed at in this preſent proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
That his pretended breach of priviledge of Parliament was but a fancie,
already anſwered and over-ruled in the Commons Houſe, who referred him to a
Triall before a Councell of War by two ſeverall Orders upon his owne motion
and pretended voluntary waiver of his Priviledge, before any impeachment
put in againſt him; which impeachment was firſt tendred to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
who upon the reading of it with one unanimous Vote referred it to his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:159182:60"/>
Excellency, to be proceeded on by a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>fair hearing</hi> before this Honourable
Councell; and if the proceedings on this impeachment upon his owne motion
by the Commons direction be a breach of Priviledge, it is onely in himſelfe and
the Parliament, not in us; and it hath no more reſemblance to the caſe of the five
Members then an Ape to a Lion: That he was now queſtioned, not for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
but unfaithfull ſervice to the Republike and Parliament, in the ſurrender of
<hi>Briſtoll,</hi> in which he preſumed he durſt not manifeſt himſelfe ſo far a Papiſt as
to plead <hi>a juſtification by works,</hi> or <hi>abſolution by preceding merits.</hi> That he needed
not to crave reparation of his honour and reputation from us or any other in this
caſe, ſince they were both impaired and ruined by himſelfe through this ignoble
action: that he had given the whole Kingdome an incurable fatall wound, an
irreparable loſſe (which the loſſe of his head and eſtate could no way recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence)
by this ſurrender, for which in the whole Kingdomes behalfe we here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
judgment againſt him according to the quality of his offence: That our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
for the Republike were every way equivalent to, if not tranſcending his, our
credits, our reputations, as deare to us as his to him, which we hoped ſhould no
wayes ſuffer for our zeale and fidelity in this publike proſecution upon our
owne expences, without thought of recompence. That if the Defendant ſhould
be pronounced guiltleſſe by this honourable Councell, after ſo full a charge and
hearing, he was obliged to us for bringing him to ſuch a publike vindication of
his ſuſpected fidelity, which elſe would have layen eclipſed under a black cloud
of jealouſies: But if he were pronounced guilty of the impeachment, (as we
made no doubt he would, the evidence being ſo cleare, the proofes and preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in point ſo punctuall) we ſhould deſerve thanks, if not from him (who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a deſire to be tried to the uttermoſt) yet at leaſt from the Parliament,
Kingdome, and our native Countrey, for bringing ſuch a grand, politike, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Delinquent to his Triall and condigne judgement, who by ſurrendring
<hi>Briſtoll</hi> hath endangered the loſſe of three whole Kingdomes, and of our Lawes,
Religion, Liberties, Lives, and preſent Parliament.</p>
               <p>And now (my honoured Lords and Gentlemen) leſt we ſhould incur your juſt
cenſure (according to the Defendants doctrine) for ſtouting out this cauſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
which by the Defendants tediouſneſſe hath-laſted nine dayes diſpute,
(though the Cities ſiege continued not three full dayes) we ſhall cloſe up all in a
word or two: We render you many hearty thanks, in our owne and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
names, for your nine dayes paines, patience, and that faire, honourable,
impartiall hearing, you have afforded both parties in the triall of this great
publike cauſe, in which the whole Realme is intereſſed, and whereon their eyes
are fixed; not doubting but as you have granted us a moſt full, faire, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
hearing, ſo you will in due ſeaſon (after ſerious peruſall of your Notes and the
Evidence on both ſides) give ſuch a juſt and equall ſentence, as ſhall chronicle
your juſtice to, and make this caſe a leading Preſident for all future times, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre
all Governours of Townes or Caſtles from cowardly, traiterly, or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
ſurrenders of them.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the long debate of this great cauſe, begun on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 14 of
<hi>December</hi> 1643. and concluded on <hi>Saturday December</hi> 23. After which both
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:159182:61"/>
parties were ordered to attend the Councell againe on <hi>Friday</hi> following being
the 29 of <hi>December,</hi> to heare ſentence, the Councell deſiring ſo much reſpite to
peruſe their Notes and prepare their Iudgment. Who ſitting againe, and we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
them, on the deſigned day, the Councell firſt delivered their ſeverall
judgements of the cauſe among themſelves in private; after which Colonell
<hi>Fiennes</hi> was diſarmed at the Councell-chamber-doore, (whereat he was much
appalled) and then he and we being called in, the Iudge-Advocate read his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
out of a paper <hi>in haec verba.</hi>

               <p>The Defendant aſtoniſhed at this ſentence, told the Councell in an inſolent
manner, that he little expected ſuch a ſentence from them; and (as if he had been
their Controller) demanded upon what grounds and reaſons they thus condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him? and whether they did allow of our paper-witneſſes, or diſallow the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of his Officers? Whereupon all being commanded to withdraw for
a ſhort ſpace, and then called in againe, the Defendant was told, <hi>it was againſt
the ſtile and honour of the Councell, to be demanded the reaſons of their judgement
after it was once pronounced.</hi> Vpon this the Defendant (prompted by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
alledged, that he was a Parliament-man, and claimed his priviledge, that
he ought not to be condemned without the privity of the Commons Houſe, to
which he appealed againſt this ſentence, and deſired his appeale might be entred.</p>
               <p>To which Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered, that he had formerly appealed from the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
(the ancient proper Iudge of his cauſe) to a Councel of war, and by his own
voluntary motion waived his Priviledge to put himſelf upon this triall, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by two Orders of the Houſe; therefore he could not now appeal back again to
the Houſe, or reſume or claim his waived Priviledge after judgment. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon his requeſt his appeale was entred; yet a Guard was ſet upon his perſon
at his Lodging; and upon better conſideration he ſent to withdraw his appeal that
night, (though the Councell aſſented not to it) being well aſſured that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would confirme the ſentence, and perchance ſee it put in due execution.</p>
               <p>The Proſecutors proteſting their ſorrow for the Defendants folly, in pulling
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:159182:61"/>
ſuch a ſentence on his owne head through his vaine pride and ambition to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himſelfe, left him under reſtraint, and returned early next morning to <hi>London:</hi>
where the firſt Newes they heard, was, that the Defendants friends had reported
over all the City, the very evening the ſentence was given, ſome houres before it
was pronounced (by way of Propheſie, or Policie rather) that Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi>
was abſolutely acquitted by the Councell, and came off with ſuch honour as
none ever did before him; that not one of the Articles was proved againſt him,
his Proſecutors very much blamed, and ordered to aske him forgiveneſſe at the
leaſt, if not to undergoe ſome heavie puniſhment for ſlandring him; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
were averred with ſo much confidence, that the newes of his condemnation
would hardly be credited at firſt, till our Relations of the truth of his ſentence
to ſome Members of the Houſe, ſeconded with Letters from Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> and
ſome of the Councells owne atteſtations, quite allayed this falſe Allarme by
degrees.</p>
               <p>After which the Defendants Friends and Partiſans altering the Scene of this
unexpected Tragedy, confeſſed he was in truth condemned to loſe his head, but
yet he was abſolutely acquitted by the Councell of Warre from the Articles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
and all pretences of Cowardize or Treachery, and condemned onely
for not firing the Citie, which his tender conſcience, and care of the Parliaments
honour, would not permit him to turn into aſhes, to the ruine of many innocents:
And withall they further bruited, that the Defendant was wholly acquitted by
three of the ancienteſt beſt experienced Souldiers and religious party in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and condemned only by ſome of the younger deboiſter Colonels, &amp;c. caſting
ſundry groſſe aſperſions both upon the Proſecutors and Councell, to their into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable

To make theſe falſe reports more currant, they likewiſe reported, that the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell

               <p>Which Petition being publiſhed in print, conjured downe the former falſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and forced the ſhameleſſe ſlanderers to pull in their lying tongues for a
ſeaſon: But not long after <hi>Britannicus</hi> (bribed by the Defendant or his Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans)
moſt impertinently and unſeaſonably pleaded this condemned perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
and pardon, notwithſtanding his cenſure; making his pretended Pardon
(if granted by his Excellency) without the Houſes privity <hi>a meere act of juſtice,</hi>
not of <hi>grace;</hi> for which he received a juſt <hi>Check</hi> in print; Vpon this <hi>Britannicus</hi>
not only pleads for him the ſecond time againſt the <hi>Check,</hi> but the Colonell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
aſſumes the boldneſſe (inſtead of lamenting, acknowledging his grand
ſtate-ruining offence) once more to juſtifie himſelfe, and cenſure both his Iudges
and Proſecutors, in a printed Pamphlet inſcribed, <hi>A Checke to the Checker of
Britannicus,</hi> or, <hi>The Honour and Integrity of Colonell</hi> Fiennes <hi>revived, re-eſtated,
and cleared from certaine Prejudices and Mistakes, occaſioned by the late Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reports,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>London Printed by</hi> Andrew Coe, 1644.</p>
               <p>That this Treatiſe was penned by himſelfe, is cleare by the ſtile, by his owne
expreſſions in it uttered at his Triall, the catalogue of the Witneſſes produced on
his part, and this equivocating paſſage in the Preface <hi>To all the well-affected par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the Kingdome,</hi> viz. <hi>Rather then a Gentleman ſhould by his owne patience and
modeſty ſuffer his blood to be thus hunted to the laſt drop</hi> (though for my owne
part I never ſaw his face) <hi>yet having ſeen the tranſactions and proſecutions of his
buſineſſe, I ſhall write not to contradict, &amp;c. but to ſtate the condition of a ſentence, &amp;c.</hi>
Doubtleſſe no man can be ſo ſottiſh as to imagine that <hi>Britannicus</hi> (to whom
ſome attribute this Treatiſe) never ſaw Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> ſweet face, much leſſe that
this Pamphlet was writ by a meet Stranger, who never really viewed his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy;
for why ſhould any Stranger be ſo zealous for a condemned perſon
whom he never beheld, as thus profeſſedly to plead his cauſe in his owne words;
or how could he come to know the tranſactions, proſecutions of this buſineſſe,
and names of his Witneſſes, as they are there related, being never yet publiſhed
in print? Therefore this equivocating paſſage proves it was penned by himſelfe,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:159182:63"/>
who never ſaw his own face really, but onely the ſhadow of it in a glaſſe, though
he might haply view his ruby Noſe without a Mirrour.</p>
               <p>The whole ſcope of this new <hi>Check-worke</hi> is, Firſt, to juſtifie this Delinquents
innocency againſt his cenſure, to lay an aſperſion on his Iudges and the <hi>Law of
Warre,</hi> by which he was condemned, the whole contexture tending to prove he
had<note n="*" place="margin">See Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 7. in the Check.</note> 
                  <hi>ſummum jus, and</hi> ſo <hi>ſumma injuria</hi> in his condemnation; <hi>that the Law of
War is unjuſt, yea againſt Gods Law; and that he was condemned for not holding</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll
<hi>to the utmost extremity, not according as extremity is commonly taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
but according to the ſtrict Martiall interpretation of extremity; for obeying
the Law of God before the Law of War, in not burning to the ground the ſecond City
of the Kingdome, and for not doing ſo much evill that good might come of it:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he profeſſeth himſelfe no <hi>Delinquent,</hi> but a <hi>juſt perſon,</hi> notwithſtanding his
condemnation, in theſe very termes; <hi>I am farre from writing an Apologie for A
DELINQUENT, and as far from writing A DELINQUENCY
ON A IVST PERSON:</hi> (O ſtrange ſelf-Iuſticiary, O moſt impudent
affronter of Iuſtice!) But whether he be ſuch an one or not, the premiſed <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and ſubſequent Depoſitions, will ſoon diſcover to his ſhame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to magnifie his owne (unknowne) valour, and to applaud him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<hi>as</hi>

of the Republike for his former Valour and Services, &amp;c.</hi> A pretty modeſt
Trumpeter of his owne praiſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To aſperſe his Proſecutors with injurious calumnies, who only
for craving Iuſtice againſt this impenitent obſtinate Malefactor (who will
neither confeſſe nor lament his Realme-ruining offence) are falſly branded
with the Titles of <hi>Hunters after the laſt drop of his blood, men destitute
of Charity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Prologue to all the well-affected Partie, and Quere's.</note> 
                  <hi>bribed Lawyers, ſad and fatall inſtruments of Malignants, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly

diviſions; to carry on the grand deſigne of the Enemy, &amp;c.</hi> whereas their
fidelity and ſervices to the State, their oppoſition againſt Malignants, and their
miſchievous deſigns, (which the Defendant hath advanced more then any man)
with their patient, unbloody, charitable Deportment after ſo many publike
Defamations, and unſufferable affronts to publike Iuſtice, might have demerited
better language from him, who endeavoured (out of his abundant charity) to
deprive them both of their Liberties, Reputations, Members, Lives, (had
he been acquitted) only for impeaching him for this diſhonourable ſurrender
upon his owne engagement.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To ward off his feared Execution of his demerited Sentence and
crave the allowance of his pretended Pardon, to ſave his unworthy life (which
he refuſed to hazard to preſerve the Kingdome in holding <hi>Briſtol;</hi>) when as a
man of true valour and honour would rather have loſt a thouſand lives, then
endeavour to ſave one by ſuch ignoble ſhifts and impudent falſe Apologies.</p>
               <p>It is not our intention to give any particular Anſwers to the Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in his <hi>Check,</hi> whereunto this whole <hi>Relation</hi> of the Tryall gives the <hi>Mate;</hi>
only we ſhall briefly examine the validity, detect the abſurdity of the two
beſt Arguments of his Innocency deduced from his ſentence and pretended
Pardon, not formerly anſwered, being ſince the Tryall, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:159182:64"/>
                  <q>His Argument from his ſentence is this:<note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note> The Article of warre is the hinge
upon which the ſentence only moves: here is no concomitant expreſſion of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize
or treachery, ſo as the guilt is externall, and not internall; a guilt
of diſproportion and want of commenſuration to the Article: and he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to loſe his head only for not holding out the Town to extremity in a
Marſhall interpretation, <hi>according to the very Article of warre; for not firing
the ſecond City of the Kingdome, and for obeying the divine Law of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Law of Warre in not doing ſo much evill, that good might come
thereof:</hi> (So he moſt abſurdly falſly and ſcandalouſly argues,) Ergo, <hi>the
ſurrender was neither cowardly nor trayterous.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To which we Anſwer:<note place="margin">Anſwer. 1.</note> 1. That this is the firſt Argument we ever yet heard
of this nature, that a mans very ſentence of condemnation, ſhould be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of his Innocency in that for which he was condemned. I am condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
only according to the Letter and true meaning of the Law: <hi>Ergo,</hi> I am
Innocent, Guiltleſſe, and deſerve a Pardon; (the whole ſubſtance of this
Argument) is ſuch a nonſence contradiction, as becomes none but ſuch who
have loſt their <hi>Heads, as leaſt their braines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> The very ſentence expreſſeth, that he was arraigned and convicted
before this Honourable Councell, for ſurrendring and delivering up the Town
and Caſtle of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> with the Forts, Magazines, Armes, Ammunition, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
and other things thereunto belonging, and for not having held the ſame
to the utmoſt extremity, ACCORDING AS BY YOUR DUTY
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE DONE: (this is the only ground
and reaſon of the ſentence:) For WHICH OFFENCE this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Councell hath adjudged you to bee executed ACCORDING TO
THE TENOR OF THE ARTICLE OF WARRE,
by having your head cut off from your body;</q> So as the Article of warre, is
made the rule only of the Iudgement and execution, but the not <hi>doing of his duty</hi>
the crime, and ground of his Iudgement, by the very words of the ſentence: So
that all his large Diſcourſe that he was condemned only by the rigor of the
Article of Warre, which is <hi>Summum Ius,</hi> is a mecre wilfull calumny.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> whereas hee principally objects; that the <hi>Sentence chargeth him
not with the concomitant expreſſions of Cowardize or Treachery:</hi> Therefore he was
guilty of and condemned for neither. The anſwer is very cleare, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for both by the very Sentence: For it recites, that he had been <hi>arraigned</hi>
to wit, upon our Articles of Impeachment, which expreſly charged him that hee
had <hi>Trayterouſly and Cowardly ſurrendred the City and Caſtle:</hi> upon which
impeachment hee was both convicted and condemned to loſe his head: Now if
the ſurrender had not been traytorly and cowardly, he could neither in Law
nor equity have been convicted or condemned upon this impeachment, but
acquited. His condemnation therefore being grounded on, and his ſentence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
unto our Impeachment: Hee muſt of neceſſity bee guilty of treachery
and cowardize; and though the very words be not expreſſed in the ſentence, yet
they are neceſſarily imployed in this clauſe; <hi>For ſurrendring and not holding out
the ſame to the utmoſt extremity, according as by your duty you ought to have
done:</hi> For he that ſurrenders a fortified Town before utmoſt extremity contrary
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:159182:64"/>
to his duty; muſt of neceſſity bee interpreted to doe it out of treachery or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize,
or both conjoyned (cowardize being the greateſt betrayer of truſt)
and the only reaſon why the Law Marſhall makes ſuch a ſurrender Treaſon,
puniſhing it with death, is, becauſe it preſumes it traytorly and cowardly:
Yea the ſole cauſe why theſe expreſſions were omitted in this Sentence was,
becauſe they are not mentioned but meerely implyed in the Article of Warre
it ſelfe, by which the ſentence was drawn, and to avoyd prolixity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
that at large which is neceſſarily underſtood and ſupplyed by other words.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> Whereas hee ſaith, his guilt is externall, tis very true; the whole
Kingdom beheld his cowardize and treachery with griefe, yea deteſtation, and
thought him worthy to ſuffer for it: but that it was not internall, is but his
own averment, which his externall guilt diſproves; and himſelfe confeſſing that
he was externally guilty (and for this moſt juſtly condemned according to the
Letter of the Law) he may be as juſtly executed.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> For his pretended mortall equity to extenuate his offence; that he
muſt have fired the City to the ground, &amp;c. it is but a meere groundleſſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and an inſufferable aſpertion both to the Parliament and Honourable
Councell, he being neither accuſed nor condemned for not firing the Town,
but for not holding it and the Caſtle to extremity, which he might eaſily have
done without burning it to the ground, as the premiſes demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>The laſt Argument of his guiltleſneſſe (on which he principally relies) is
his Excellencies pretended Pardon,<note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> whereon he hath made a large co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary.</p>
               <p>To which wee ſhall give theſe Anſwers,<note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> we hope without offence to any.
Firſt, that we are not aſſured that the Defendant hath any reall Pardon of his
Sentence; the rather, becauſe the Houſe of Commons whereof he is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and which referred him to his tryall, was never yet acquainted with it,
nor privie to its granting, for ought we finde in the <hi>Journall Book,</hi> as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of right they ought to have been, at leaſt wiſe by the Defendant, who
hath forfeited the benefit of it, by this ſlighting of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> Admit he hath a Pardon from his Excellency, yet then we may
juſtly queſtion: 1. Whether it was not ſurreptitiouſly procured, upon meer miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informations,
of the Defendant, or his Friends (his Lordſhip being not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the Tryall) which miſ-informations (over-frequent in all ages) nullifie
the Kings own Pardons, Charters under the Great Seale of <hi>England;</hi> much
more his Excellencies, by like reaſon? 2ly, whether it was not penned, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
altered, corrected by the Delinquent himſelfe (or ſome neare friend
of his) before it paſſed his Excellencies ſignature? the whole contexture ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
of his ſtile, containing many expreſſions <hi>verbatim,</hi> which he uſed
in his defence: and his bold Commentary on it, giving us ſome grounds of
conjecture, that he firſt made or corrected the Text it ſelfe, before it was Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,
it being frequent in other caſes to doe the like. 3ly, whether the Copy
printed by him, be agreeable to the originall Pardon? the Record whereof being
no where extant to our knowledge by which we may compare it, and the &amp;c.
in it aſſuring us, that ſomething is concealed in the printed Copy which
would have made for our advantage, if recited? Now if all or either of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:159182:65"/>
theſe prove true (as we doubt not but they will upon due examination) that
this pretended Pardon was ſurreptiouſly obtained by miſinformation; or
peruſed, corrected, by the Delinquent or his friends; or the printed Copy of it,
falſe or maimed; his Arguments from and gloſſe upon it, will rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his fraud and guiltineſſe, then vindicate his valour, fidelity or innocency
in this Action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, we anſwer, that the Pardon recites how his Excellency</hi> by vertue of an
Ordinance of both Houſes of Parliament hath given and granted to the ſaid
Colonell a free and full pardon of all manner of offences, errours, and overſights
committed in the ſaid ſurrender of the City and Caſtle of Briſtol. <hi>But we never
yet heard of any ſuch Ordinance of both Houſes authorizing or allowing this
Defendants Pardon, having cauſe to believe that the Houſes will be very caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of granting or allowing any Pardon in this caſe, which ſo highly concernes
both Houſes, and the whole Kingdomes ſafet, by reaſon of the ill conſequences
it may produce. We read in</hi> Emanuel<note n="a" place="margin">Belgica Hiſt. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis l. 13 p. 402. 403. 404.</note> Meteranus,<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 827. 828.</note> Grimſtons <hi>Hiſtory
of the Netherlands,</hi> Thuanus <hi>and others,</hi> Anno. 1587. <q>That <hi>Van Hemert</hi> a
very wiſe and brave young Noble-man, one of the chiefe houſes of the Netherlands,
and Governour of the Town of <hi>Grave,</hi> together with two of his Captaines, <hi>Du
Banck</hi> and <hi>Korfe</hi> were impriſones, condemned by a Councell of warre, and then
beheaded and executed at <hi>Bommel</hi> by command of <hi>Robert Dudly</hi> Earle of
<hi>Leyceſter</hi> (Governour of the Law-Countreys under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous
Memory) for that they ſurrendred the ſaid Town of <hi>Grave</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi>
when he had beſieged it above three Moneths ſpace, with a puiſſant army and
beaten down the wals of it leavell to the ground with perpetuall batteries and
aſſaults: And although there appeared no treachery at all, nor any intelligence
held with the Enemy, in this caſe, and that the Governour condeſcended to a Treaty
and ſurrendred the Town to the Enemy only upon the Citizens importunity, who
earneſtly intreated him upon their knees with teares in their eyes to embrace a
Parley, for the ſaving of their lives, eſtates, and liberties, which were granted
them upon the Articles of agreement; and although the Garriſon ſouldiers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>marched away with their Armes</hi> (which they left behinde them at <hi>Briſtoll</hi>)
and had all the Articles punctually fulfilled; and although himſelfe and his potent
friends earnestly beſought the Earle of <hi>Leyceſter,</hi> that he might ſerve the Queen
of <hi>England</hi> either by Sea or Land, at his own charges, and by his valour and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
make recompence of his fault committed only through want of underſtanding and
marſhall pollicy, contrary to the will and intent of the Earle then Governour Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
under the Queen, yet the Earle, for upholding martiall Diſcipline, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all future ſurrenders of this kinde, would on no wiſe diſpence with the execution;
whereupon they were all there openly beheaded at <hi>Bommel,</hi> Iune, 28. 1587, which
was held a good example, to the great furtherance of marſhall diſcipline, which
at that time was much decayed.</q> 
                  <hi>And whether theſe times call not for a like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
(when ſo many treacheries and acts of cowardice break forth in ſundry
places to the endangering of the State and Parliament) we ſubmit to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the ſupreame Councell of the Realme to whoſe deſcition it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belongeth, to pertermit or haſten the Defendants execution: who ſhewed
farre more cowardice at leaſt (if we ſay not treachery) in ſurrendring</hi> Briſtol <hi>in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:159182:65"/>
leſſe then nine dayes ſiege, then</hi> Van Hemert <hi>did, who held out</hi> Grave <hi>above three
monthes, till the Wals were demoliſhed, and yet then marched away withall the
Garriſon and their armes too; and then moſt Governours elſe have done: the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inconſiderable ſmall Town of</hi> Lime <hi>ſtanding but in a hole, and having no
conſiderable works about it, or proviſions in it comparable to</hi> Briſtol, <hi>together
with</hi> Warder <hi>Caſtle, and other places, holding out more moneths againſt the
Enemies ſtormings and aſſaults, then the great City and Caſtle of</hi> Briſtol <hi>under
his command held out dayes; yet hee will needs juſtifie to the world both
in his</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">See here, p. 21.</note> Anſwer <hi>and printed Pamplets (with how little truth or colour let all
men judge,</hi>) That he held it out to the utmoſt point, not only of duty, but alſo of
Honour, that any Souldier could or ought to have maintioned the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Wee anſwer, that the ſuggeſtions and principall grounds of the
Pardon relating to the Proſecutors, and Counſells ſentence, in the ſence they
are preſſed and made uſe of, are meare miſrecitalls, miſinformations, (which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
the Pardon) as all the premiſes, and ſucceeding teſtimonies evidence; As for
his Excellencies own teſtimony of his Integrity in the Scottiſh Negotiation,
<hi>Ann.</hi> 1641, and endowments FOR OTHER IMPLOYMENTS in
the State; they are no convincing Arguments of his courage, integrity, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuations
of his cowardize and treachery in ſurrendring <hi>Briſtol;</hi> nor yet
his pretended valorous carriage at <hi>Keinton Field</hi> atteſted by Sir <hi>William Balfour,</hi> as
we have formerly evidenced. Therefore there is nothing in his Pardon that can
any way acquit him from cowardize or Treachery in the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> And
the words OTHER IMPLOYMENTS, &amp;c. diſcover, that his Excellency
deemes him a better Commiſſioner then Souldier, and we wiſh he had ſhewed
himſelfe either a good Treater or Commander at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> where he was neither
one nor other, for then we are certaine, hee would never have yeelded up all the
Ammunition, Canon, Magazines, Armes, Priſoners, and Colours to the Enemy,
together with the City and Caſtle, before any one For taken, or any one aſſault
ſo much as given, or Canon ſhot made againſt the City or Caſtle walls, which had
2300 armed Garriſon Souldiers at the leaſt, then ready to defend them.</p>
               <p>In fine, both his Sentence and Pardon (be it what it will) are apparant demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of his guilt and capitall offence. And whether his carriage in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath been ſo <hi>valorous, ſo free from all umbrages of Treachery,</hi> as may juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit
an<note n="a" place="margin">See the cloſe of his Pardon.</note> 
                  <hi>abſolute Pardon and diſcharge from the execution of his capitall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and ſuch a ſpeedy releaſe from all future impriſonment, reſtraint, and likewiſe

when he heard the Governour Colonell <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes</hi> had agreed unto

on Articles for the ſurrender of the ſaid City and Caſtle, and asked him
whether it was true? to whom Colonell <hi>Nathaniell Fiennes</hi> anſwered, it was
true; then Captaine <hi>Buſhell</hi> asked him, why he did not publiſh the ſaid Articles,
that ſo both ſouldiers and Towneſ-men might know what they had to truſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
Captaine <hi>Buſhell</hi> then ſaid unto Colonell <hi>Nathaniell Fiennes,</hi> Sir; <hi>If you
pleaſe I will be ready to doe you the ſervice to publiſh the Articles for you;</hi> where-upon
the ſaid Colonell <hi>trembling and quaking, delivered to Captaine</hi> Buſhell <hi>the

the Towne.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then I ſaid unto Captain <hi>Buſhell,</hi> here is great talk about London of the great
quantity of Ammunition, &amp; Victuall that was in Briſtoll Caſtle when it was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered,
I deſire to heare ſomething from you concerning it. To which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of mine Captaine <hi>Buſhell</hi> anſwered; Sir, I beleeve there is not any man
can give you a more exact account of this then I can, for though the Keyes of
the Caſtle and Magazine, according to the Articles of the ſurrender of the ſaid
City and Caſtle, were delivered up to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> yet I doubting leaſt ſome
lighted Matches might be left in the Magazine of powder, did breake open the
doores of the ſaid Magazine, <hi>where I</hi>

                           <hi>found 70. barrells of Powder; Then</hi> I asked
him <hi>whether they were double Barrells?</hi> he ſaid, <hi>that they were commonly called
by the name of French Barrells, and that they did hold as much as any two of our
ordinary barrells.</hi> He ſaid further, that there were at the ſame time in the ſaid
Magazine 140. <hi>bundles of Match,</hi> and that <hi>in the Caſtle there was Bullet anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
with materialls to make more;</hi> he told me likewiſe, how <hi>many barrells of
Beefe, how many Butts of Sack, and how many Tunne of Beere he found there,</hi>
the number of which particulars I have now forgotten; but I remember, <hi>they
ſeemed unto me to be a very vaſt proportion;</hi> for ſea <hi>Coales he ſaid, that he did
beleeve there were enough to ſerve halfe London for a moneth:</hi> ſome other things
he told me concerning Briſtoll, but not worth the mentioning: what I
have here ſet downe, if it doth not containe in it the very words which Captain
<hi>Buſhell</hi> ſpake unto me, I am certaine it containes the effect of them. Dated the

none but the Governour and himſelf (who had the care and providing of moſt
of the Proviſions and Ammunition) knew their Powder was ſo neere ſpent;
That they were all reſolved when their powder was al gone, to hold it out to the
laſt, and rather to dye and burn the Town when they could keep it no longer,

and that for want of men they were enforced voluntarily to quit the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi>
one of their ſtrongeſt Out-Workes; which the Enemie thereupon tooke

Briſtoll with his Troopes,<note place="margin">Artic. 4, 5, 6, 8.</note> and many Gentlemen of the Country leaving the

ſtay with him, and diſpoſed my horſe which were neere 20. under the ſaid
Governours Command; <hi>Who vvas</hi> * <hi>very confident</hi> (as I conceived) <hi>that the
Line and Workes about the ſaid City vvere very ſufficient,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Nota.</note> 
                           <hi>and the Caſtle thereof
in very good defence, the Workes vvhereof, he vvas very diligent to perfect,
and to increaſe his men and Armes till the Enemie came before it. And I my
ſelf conceived the ſaid Tovvn and Caſtle tenable againſt all the Enemies po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver,
elſe I vvould not have continued therein:</hi> And although I pretended
not to have a lodging in the Caſtle, yet <hi>Captaine Birch</hi> told me I might have
one, ſo as I would ſend in ten pounds a man for my ſelf and my retinue, to buy
proviſion of victuals. That the 23. of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt the Enemie appeared in ſmall
bodies before the Eaſt and South parts of the City, but retreated again to their
Quarters; and the next day they appeared in greater bodies, and that night
Quartered ſomewhat neere unto it. The 24. of that moneth they aſſaulted
ſome of the Out-Workes very weakly, and ſhot their Ordnance at randome:
The 25. day they appeared in greater number, and diſcharged divers Canon
ſhot againſt the Out-Workes, ſome of which fell into the City, but did no
harme. The 26. they furiouſly ſtormed the Town from one a clock in the
morning till after day-light, and were repulſed with great loſſe every where,
but in one place where the Line was defective; where ſome of the Enemy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
betweene 5. and 6. of the Clock (as I heard) that morning. Not long
after the ſaid Governour meeting me, deſired me to come to a Councell of
War, at which there met ſome 8. or 9. Officers and no more: <hi>Where the ſaid
Governour himſelf,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Nota.</note> 
                           <hi>propounded a Parly vvith the Enemy,</hi> complayning then

And the Governour then preſſing to have the Parly * ſpeedily and openly, I
was much againſt it, deſiring it might be forborne till the Enemie came on once
more upon us, for if we ſhould Parly with them now, it would diſcourage the

(vvhich vvas our neereſt Gate to retreat in at) and the Colledge Greene, and that
if I did not immediately retreat, the enemy vvould get betvvixt us and the Tovvne,

the Governours, many ſuffered very much; As for my owne part, I was kept
priſoner in the Caſtle, and could not get from the Towne untill the third day
following. The Governour broke the conditions with the enemy, in not Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
like delivering up the Towne, and Armes according to the Articles agreed
on, for the which cauſe the enemy (as they told me themſelves) had no reaſon
to performe their conditions to us, when our Governour in the firſt place
broke his conditions with them. I know no greater cauſe why the Officers,
Souldiers, and others <hi>were ſo plundered, miſerably abuſed, and many ſeduced to
forſake us and take entertainment of the enemy,</hi> then the miſcarriage of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
whom (ſo far as I could diſcerne) wholly put every man to ſhift for
himſelfe; and neglected performing conditions, cauſing Guards to be kept
at Forts or other places, and ſuffering many of the enemy to enter the Town,
inſomuch that betwixt thoſe that entred, and the priſoners that were let out of
the Caſtle (long before they ought to have been by their conditions) many of
us were miſerably abuſed both in the Towne and Caſtle, and wholly left to the
mercileſſe cruelties of the enemies. At this time the ill-affected had a faire op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to ſhew and revenge themſelves, yet notwithſtanding, I never knew
that in all the time either during the ſiege, or after it, they made any commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to hinder us, but we were afforded by the Inhabitants very much aſſiſtance
both by their perſons and Armes.<note place="margin">Nota.</note> * The Caſtle was a very large ſtrong Hold,
fortified with a very broad deepe ditch, or graft, in part wet and dry, having
a very good Well in it: the Caſtle ſtood upon a lofty ſteepe mount, that was
not Minable, as Lieutenant Col. <hi>Clifton</hi> informed me, for he ſaid the mount
whereon the Caſtle ſtood was of an earthly ſubſtance for a certaine depth,
but below that a firme ſtrong Rocke, and that he had ſearched purpoſely with
an Awgor and found it ſo in all parts; the foote of the Caſtle upon a Mount or
Rampart was fortified with a gallant Parrapet well flanking, which with its
well ſcraping muſt needs ſtrengthen it from battering, the Parrapet at the baſe
being as I gheſſe twelve foote thicke, the Walls of the Caſtle were very high,
well repaired, ſtored with ſtrong flancking Towers and Galleries on the top,
and if with a little earth lined, I am ſure had been paſt the power of Canon to
batter; but as they were, not much hurt, I thinke, could have been done
by the enemy unto them.<note place="margin">Nota.</note> * <hi>Within theſe vvalls vvas an exceeding high Fort or

                        <p>This Teſtimony being full and home; Col. <hi>Fiennes,</hi> excepted againſt the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
becauſe there had beene ſome differences between his brother Col. <hi>Iohn
Fiennes</hi> and him; whoſe valour was ſuch, that he drew his ſword &amp; cut off <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Woods</hi> finger, when as two men held his Armes. To which Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi>
anſwered, that the difference was not betweene the witneſſe and defendant
himſelfe, but the defendants Brother, which concerned not him. That this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
grew ſince the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and its reference to a Councell of
War, not before; and that upon this very point now in iſſue; that <hi>Major Wood</hi>
affirmed this Town and Caſtle when ſurrendred, to be ſtrong and tenable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all the Enemies power: Whereupon Col. <hi>Iohn Fiennes</hi> gave him the lye,
and cut off his finger as aforeſaid; And if this ſhould be a good exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a witneſſe, then the Defendant and his Brother (as deeply guilty in this
fact as himſelfe) might quarrell thus with all other witneſſes (as they did with
Captain <hi>Bagnall</hi> even in the Councell-chamber) and ſo by this practiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of their Teſtimonies, if they could not perſwade them by promiſes
of preferment and areares to hold their peace. Vpon which ground the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
ruled his Teſtimony ſhould be received.</p>
                        <p>Then the Defendant endeavoured to battle and diſgrace him all he might,
by demanding of him many impertinent and captious queſtions. As namely,
whether he were an Engineere, and had ſtudied fortifications, as he gave out
he had don? How long he had ſo ſtudied, &amp; whether he had been in ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the ſeas? &amp;c. To all which he replyed, he would give anſwer, if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
not he alone required it. To which queſtions they willing him to anſwer,
he affirmed on his Oath, that he was an Engineere, and had made it his ſtudy
eight or nine yeeres; that he had beene in ſervice in forraigne parts: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Defendants queſtions touching the ſtrength of the Caſtle and Workes
(in which he thought to entrap him,) he gave ſo good an account in each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
as manifeſted his skill in Fortifications, and the Caſtle and Workes to
be very ſtrong and tenable divers moneths, againſt all the Enemies power.
Then he interrogated him, where he and Colonell <hi>Stephens</hi> were, when they
preſſed him to make a Sally? to which he gave a punctuall anſwer: Next he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:159182:72"/>
demanded, whether he went forth in the Sally, and where he was when the
Sally was made? To which he anſwered, That himſelf commanded him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to look to the Percullice at Frome gate, and to ſee it let down in caſe
the Sally ſhould be beaten back, to keep out the Enemie from entring; which
ſervice he proved by ſome of the Defendants own witneſſes, that he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
he likewiſe upon this demand atteſted; that the Sally conſiſted not of
above 200. men, when as they might have ſent out thrice as many: that the
Sally was made with all diſadvantage up the hill, that they beate the Enemy
through divers ſtreets, and had in probability driven them out of the Suburbs,
but that the horſe ſent out in the ſally under Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> (who charged
not, but retreated at the Enemies firſt entrance) baſely retreated upon the fall
of one horſe which was ſhot, and ſo both diſ-heartened and diſ-ordered their
Foot, and cauſed their retreate; yet he never queſtioned the Horſe or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of them. That Major <hi>Lewis</hi> (whom the Defendant laboured to aſperſe
all he could) went out in this Sally, where he behaved himſelfe very gallantly
and received a wound; and that he being an old experienced Souldier, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
diſliked the calling off the Souldiers from the Line at firſt; and adviſed
the Governour to fall upon them from the Line, as ſoone as they entred, when
they might have eaſily beene cut off. And whereas the Defendant alleaged, that
Colonell <hi>Waſhingtons</hi> whole Regiment of Foote had poſſeſſed themſelves of
the Suburbs when the Sally was made, it appeared upon the ſtrict examination
of this witneſſe, that his whole Regiment that entred were not above 300.

morning. So little advantage gained he, by examining this witneſſe; who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affirmed, that the bullets one night flying ſomewhat thick in the ſtreete
where he and the Governour ſtood talking together, being ſhot onely at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in the dark; the Governour was ſo fearefull, that though he had an
Armour of proofe upon him, he preſently cryed out, <hi>they have found me
where I ſtand,</hi> and thereupon removed cut of Gunſhot. He likewiſe teſtified,
that the place where the Governour uſed to ſtand with his Troope, under Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
<hi>Jones</hi> houſe, (which he alleaged to be a place of greateſt danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Granado caſually fell there almoſt into the midſt of his Troope though
it hurt no man) was one of the ſecureſt places about the City, the Wals of the
Gardens and houſe betweene them and the Enemies, being more then double
Canon proofe, and the place they ſtood in, not commanded from any the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
quarters, being free from all kinde of ſhot, but this Granado mounted ſo,
as it fell juſt under the Houſe Walls from over the houſe top. And therefore it
was no great Argument of his valour to ſtand in a place of ſuch ſecurity.</p>

            <p>This Witneſſe comming very cloſe, the Defendant was very much netled
at it, and thereupon ſent a Warrant to bring him from <hi>London</hi> to Saint <hi>Albanes,</hi>
where he perſonally appearing before the <hi>Councell,</hi> the Defendant charged him
for a partiall witneſſe, and that he had forſworne himſelf in his Depoſition.</p>
            <p>As to his partiality Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> anſwered, that he was the moſt indifferent
witneſſe of all others, becauſe he was no mercenary <hi>Captain</hi> to whom arrears
were due, but one who ſerved his Country freely, and raiſed his Company on
his own charge; whereas all the Officers he produced ſerved onely for hire,
not <hi>gratis.</hi> And if there were any partiality, it was likely rather to be for
then againſt him. For whereas <hi>Captaine Bagnall</hi> was a meere ſtranger unto
us, to whom he had no relation nor obligation; he had been a long acquaintance,
and active faithfull friend to the Defendant, for whom he had done many
good ſervices. As firſt, he had taken two dangerous journyes to <hi>London</hi> and his
<hi>Excellency</hi> at his own proper charge, to procure him an Independant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
for his Governour-ſhip of <hi>Briſtoll.</hi> Secondly, he had beene very active
in furniſhing him with men and monies, from time to time during his reſidence
in <hi>Briſtoll.</hi> Thirdly, he did at his earneſt requeſt and upon his promiſe to
defend the Town and Caſtle to the utmoſt, raiſe him a company of men (moſt
of them Volunteers) at his own charge, who did very good ſervice and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
themſelves manfully in the Siege. Fourthly, he had adventured his life
and eſtate for him, and done him more faithfull ſervice upon his own purſe
without the leaſt recompence, then any man of his quality in thoſe parts, and
there was never any enmity between them. It was therefore, very improbably
that this witneſſe would be partiall on our parts againſt the Defendant, without
any ground or motive. And it was a very ingrate requitall of all his coſts,
travell, reſpects, disburſments, for the Defendant thus to baffle, and charge
him openly with perjury. And if he thus affronted abuſed this witneſſe to
whom he was ſo much obliged, before the Councels faces, onely for depoſing
truth (to ſtop whoſe mouth Colonell <hi>Iohn Fiennes</hi> proffered him a <hi>Captaines</hi>
place in a new Regiment he ſaid he was to raiſe) the Councell might eaſily
conjecture how he dealt with others by threats, or promiſes behind their backs,
and how difficult a thing it was for us to procure any to atteſt the truth of his
unworthy actions.</p>
            <p>To prove him perjured, the Defendant alleaged, that <hi>Captain Bagnall</hi> among
others ſubſcribed his name to the Letter he ſent to his Excellencie, which in
many things was contrary to his Depoſition. To which he anſwered, that he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:159182:74"/>
ſubſcribed the Letter at his importunity: that he diſliked many things in it,
which he told the Defendant he knew and would juſtifie, to be miſtakes:
That he ſubſcribed not to all the particulars in the Letter, (which no one that
ſigned it could certainely atteſt on his owne knowledge) but onely to ſuch
things in it as he knew; ſome atteſting one part which the others knew not of,
and all of them atteſting the whole between them, not every one that ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
every particular, as appeares by the letter it ſelf, and is uſuall in ſuch kinds
of Relations of fights and ſieges, where though the whole Relation be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by many as true, one atteſting one part, another another diſtributively,
yet no one ſubſcriber can or doth atteſt the whole in common judgement, but
onely ſo much as himſelf did act or ſee. Which anſwer clearly took off this
objection. This device failing him, he began to interrogate the Captain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every branch of his Depoſition to intrap him, but yet failed in his project.
He demanded of him when and where he ſaw the Enemie enter? where he was,
and what he did when the Enemie ſtormed the Works that morning? To which
he gave punctuall anſwers. Then he demanded, whether he drew his men off
the Line as ſoone as he received his command to do it? He anſwered no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he thought it inconvenient, &amp; the readieſt way to loſe and betray the City,
as it proved. Upon which anſwer the defendant demanded Iudgement of death
againſt him, for diſobeying his Orders: To which was anſwered, that he was
a volunteer, and under no pay or ſtrict command as others: that his diſobeying
the firſt command, was upon good grounds to prevent the loſſe of the Town:
that he came immediately to the defendant himſelfe to acquaint him with the
reaſon of his diſobedience, and importuned him, inſteed of drawing his men
into the City from the Line, to make good the breach, and charge the Enemy
preſently, which had ſaved the Town; which Councell he refuſing, he did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
draw off his men as he was commanded: that if his diſobedience had
beene capitall, he ſhould have preſently queſtioned and proceeded againſt him
for it; or have Articled againſt him before this Honourable Councell long<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ere
this; but having thus long neglected to doe either, himſelfe was moſt faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the two, and this exception ſavoured more of malice then juſtice. Then
he demanded of him, In what place it was that he importuned him to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Enemie in ſuch ſort as his Depoſition mentions? Who anſwered, <hi>it
was in a ſignall eminent place, even in the midſt of the City, juſt over againſt the
place where</hi> Yeomans <hi>and</hi> Butcher <hi>were hanged by his directions,</hi> for offering no
ſurrender and betray <hi>Briſtol</hi> to the Enemie. At which the Defendant grew
blank, ſaying, he did not <hi>remember that he ſpake any thing to him there.</hi> After
this he demanded of him, how long he ſtayed in the Towne after he was
drawn off the Line? To which he anſwered, that he ſtaid with his men in
<hi>Winestreete,</hi> neer the Market houſe above 2. houres, as divers other companies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
did, and in all that time received no Orders for a Sally, or any thing elſe;
by meanes whereof many of the Souldiers departed from their Colours to
Tavernes, Alehouſes to drinke, and ſo gave the Enemies time and reſpite to
enter further into the Suburbs without reſiſtance, and to poſſeſſe themſelves of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> Fort, and Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges</hi> houſe, and ſome of them came under the
Colledge wall over againſt Alderman <hi>Hooks</hi> houſe, and played upon our Forces, I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:159182:75"/>
in the Marſh, whereupon he hearing from Colonell <hi>Stephens,</hi> that they needed
ſome helpe in the Marſh, and having no other commands, marched with his
men into the Marſh, and played upon the Enemie under the Colledge wall,
and mounting one of Sir <hi>Francis Pophams</hi> peeces, on the top of Alderman
<hi>Hookes</hi> houſe, he played ſo hotly on the enemies there, that he made them quit
the Colledge greene, the reſt of the Forces ſtanding idle in the midſt of the
City in the meane time for want of command, and not making any Sally againſt
the Enemie to beate them out. Then he charged him with perjury, for Depoſing
he ſent for a Parley without calling any Councell of war; for that others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
he did call a councell. To which was anſwered, that the Article runnes,
<hi>no common Councell was called,</hi> and ſo the Depoſition muſt be intended as the
Article runs, <hi>that there was no Common Councell;</hi> and that is moſt certaine, for
firſt Colonell <hi>Stephens,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edward Stephens</hi> (whom Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi>
in Print avers to be at the Councell) expreſly depoſe, that they were not at
any ſuch Councell, nor ever had notice of it: <hi>Major Allen</hi> and other Officers
depoſe the like. And ſuch a Councell for a Parly ought to have beene gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
of which all chiefe Officers ſhould have had notice. Beſides Colonell
<hi>Strood</hi> and others depoſe, that there was not above nine or ten at it, and that of
them two or three Voted againſt the Parley, and one gave no Vote at all. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he might ſafely enough depoſe, it was <hi>done without a common Councel of War,
and without the Privitie or conſent of any,</hi> or at leaſt of VERY FEW of his
Officers; five or ſix being the moſt that conſented to it. Next he quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him as perjured, for ſaying the place where his Company guarded the Line,
was in his judgement (for he never meaſured it) nearer the place where the
Enemy entred, than it was to the maine Guard, and that they might have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
ſooner to the breach directly from the Line, then from thence to the main
Guard, and ſo to the breach; becauſe Captain <hi>Tyſon</hi> depoſed, it was almoſt a
quarter of a mile nearer to the maine Guard then to the breach. To which
was Anſwered; Firſt, that <hi>Captaine Bagnall</hi> depoſed onely, that he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
nothing certaine in point of knowledge of the diſtance, becauſe he never
meaſured it, but only in point of his opinion and judgement it was nearer to the
breach than to the main Guard. Therfore admit it were further, it was no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
at all, becauſe he ſwore only as he conceived, not as he knew it, and ſo only
a miſtake in point of opinion. But admit it were further to the breach than to
the maine Guard, yet <hi>Captain Tyſon</hi> himſelf depoſed, that it is nigh half a mile
the nearer way to march from <hi>Newfound-land</hi> where <hi>Captaine Bagnalls</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was, to the breach by the Line, then to march from thence to the maine
Guard at the <hi>Tolſey,</hi> and from thence to the Line; and that was the ſole queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
put to <hi>Captaine Bagnall</hi> by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynne,</hi> Whether it was not much the nearer
way for his Company to have marched directly from the Line to the breach by
the Outworkes, without paſſing through the City, then to march through the
City by the maine Guard, and ſo to the breach? To which he anſwered, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it was: for which the Defendant would make him forſworne, when as
his owne Witneſſe <hi>Captaine Tyſon</hi> ſweares the ſame, that it was the nearer way
neere halfe a mile, though it was nearer to the maine Guard it ſelfe, then to the
breach. Then he pretended him perjured, becauſe he ſwore, he ſaw ſome of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:159182:75"/>
the Enemies horſe marching back toward <hi>Durdham Downe</hi> after their Foote
were entred, when as <hi>Captaine Husbands</hi> and <hi>Cornet Husbands</hi> in their Fort
ſaw none march back: To which was anſwered; firſt, that one man might ſee
that which another ſaw not, Secondly, that theſe oppoſite witneſſes plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that the horſe might march back and yet they not ſee them, and that
they could not ſweare no horſe retreated. Thirdly, <hi>Captain Hill</hi> and Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<hi>Taylour</hi> depoſed, that the horſe retreated back to <hi>Durdam Downe,</hi> &amp; that
they ſaw them retreate; and his owne witneſſe <hi>Samuel Allen</hi> depoſed; that
they retreated with their horſe above 200. yards from the Forts: <hi>Captain
Bagnall</hi> therefore having three expreſſe witneſſes to back him, muſt ſtand <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
in Curia,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Captain Husbands</hi> and his brother, ſaw no
Horſe retreate. His laſt inſtance to prove him perjured was; <hi>that he depoſed the
Defendant had Conference with Gerard in the garden, &amp; after that, returning to the
Councell told them, they muſt deliver up all their Armes; &amp;c.</hi> when as <hi>Capt. Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
was not in the garden; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he could not ſwear he had conference with
him there. To which was anſwered; Firſt, that <hi>Capt. Bagnall</hi> ſwore expreſly, that
he ſaw him go in, and come out of the Garden, and that there was a window
in the roome where he was that looked into the garden, through which he
ſaw him confer with <hi>Gerrard:</hi> therefore his being not in the Garden is no
proof that he ſaw him not confer with him in the Garden. Secondly, admit he
ſaw him not there with <hi>Gerard,</hi> yet divers others ſaw him confer with him,
and himſelf confeſſeth he did ſo, and that in the preſence of the Mayor and
divers others: how then can it be perjury to ſweare that which ſo many ſaw,
and himſelf confeſſeth to be a truth? Thirdly, Col. <hi>Strood</hi> depoſeth the very
ſame Captain <hi>Bagnall</hi> doth, without any exception taken to it: therefore the
one can be as little perjured as the other. In fine, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> informed the
Defendant, that ſince he thus laboured very maliciouſly and unworthily to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
the truth and Teſtimony of his indifferent honeſt witneſſe, he would by
way of requitall inform the Councell and him, of ſome palpable contradictions
or overſights in the Defendants chiefe witneſſes, which elſe he would have
concealed.</p>
            <p>Firſt his univerſall chiefe witneſſe, <hi>Lieutenant Clifton,</hi> confeſſed yeſterday <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
upon oath, that he complained to the Defendant of Major <hi>Langriſh</hi> his neglect
and cowardize, adviſing him to caſhiere him; yet this day in <hi>Langriſh</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
he denyed upon oath, that he complained of him. Againe he depoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
oath that <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was far ſtronger and more tenable then <hi>Briſtoll:</hi> And
yet Mr. <hi>Iohn Stephens</hi> depoſeth, that he ſaid openly in the Court of Requeſts,
it was impoſſible for <hi>Gloceſter</hi> to hold out 3. dayes againſt the King.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Captaine Rawlins</hi> depoſed, the Enemie had planted a battery and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
drawn their Ordinance within the Line before the Sally, to wit about 9. of the
clock; whereas <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant Husbands</hi> both expreſly depoſe, that
no Canon were brought in till two of the clock at leaſt; which they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of, becauſe there could no Canon be brought in but by the Fort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they ſtood.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Lieutenant <hi>Husbands</hi> depoſed, that the Horſe entred the Line with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one houre after the Foot firſt entred; and upon croſſe demands he atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:159182:76"/>
that the Foot entred before ſun-riſing about 4. of the clock, and the Horſe
not till 6. or 7. which is two or three houres at leaſt; yea <hi>Captain Nevill</hi> with
other of his owne witneſſes atteſted, the Horſe entred not till 7. or after.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Major Holmes</hi> depoſed: that he voted at the Councell of War
againſt a Parley; and being demanded the reaſon; he anſwered, It was becauſe
he thought the Town to be in as good condition in <hi>Gloceſterſhire</hi> ſide, as he left
it in <hi>Somerſetſide</hi> where his charge was: Which could not be, for the Enemie
had made no entry on that ſide, as they had done in this. Beſides, he depoſed
he was in the Sally which was beaten back: therefore the Parly was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on before the Sally made, as <hi>Colonell Strode</hi> expreſly depoſed; though the
Defendants witneſſes and Major <hi>Holmes</hi> denyed it; or elſe this could not be the
reaſon of his vote againſt a Parlcy; for after the Sally beaten in, he muſt
needs know they were in worſe condition on <hi>Gloceſterſhire</hi> ſide, then in <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi>
where the enemy never entred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Captain Bagnall</hi> thus cleared in all particulars; was bafiled unſufferably by
the Defendant himſelf before the Councell, and by his witneſſes aſſoon as the
Councell was riſen, ſome of them giving him the lye in the Councell cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
others challenging him, others menacing him, in ſuch ſort, that Mr <hi>Prynne</hi>
complayning of theſe inſufferable abuſes to the Councell, it was ordered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
Articles of complaint in Captaine <hi>Bagnalls</hi> name againſt thoſe who
challenged and gave him the lye; which he did accordingly.</p>

the city and caſtle of Briſtoll,<note place="margin">Artic 4. 6. 7. 8.</note> that at the time when the enemy had entred the
Lyne about the Barne, between Brandon-hill and the Wind-mill Fort, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:159182:77"/>
that they were gotten in poſſeſſion of Eſſex Fort &amp; the ſuburbs adjoyning, being
as was conceived betwixt two or three hundred of them, the enemy that were
without being repulſed in ſeverall other places which they had ſtormed, were
with-drawne backe as farre as Durdam Downe; the cauſe of my knowledge
was, in that after they were beaten out of ſir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges</hi> his houſe, and
ſeverall other houſes on that ſide of the water, with our Canon ſhot from the
Key, and with our Musketeers that were placed in ſeverall houſes on the Key,
I rode forth at Newgate, and from thence up to the Fort of Pryors Hill, from
thence a long the Line to the redoubt, and ſo on to the Windmill Fort, all
which places I found ſecure, and our men very couragious; from thence I rode
to the place where the enemy entred, and almoſt to Brandon-hill Fort, all
which part of the Lyne was cleare and no enemy nearer it, then the Downe
aforeſaid: and as I returned backe the Souldiers in the Forts, and in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt
earneſtly deſired me to procure ſome ſtrength to be ſent out of the city
to aſſiſt them, and likewiſe to make good the Lyne againe, which I promiſed to
certifie the Governour of. I came immediately to the Towne, and met the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
with ſeverall other Gentlemen riding then through Newgate forth of
the city: I told him that the Forts were all ſecure, and that the Lyne was clear,
and that I conceived that if he would be pleaſed to ſend forth a matter of two
hundred men,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> he might not onely ſecure the Lyne, but alſo take all thoſe that
were entred, which he not onely refuſed to doe, but ſent a Warrant to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
that then was upon the Lyne, betwixt the Wind-mill Fort and the Redoubt,
commanding him on paine of death to draw his men off the Lyne, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
into the Towne with them; which Warrant I ſaw, and read it, and as
ſome of the Cavaliers told me the next day, the enemy that was without the
Lyne knew not of thoſe that were within, at leaſt two houres time, in which
time their Ammunition was ſpent, and then did thoſe that were within Eſſex
Fort aforeſaid ſend out Meſſengers to thoſe of the enemy that were without,
intimating, that if they did not come ſpeedily into their reliefe, they ſhould
be all cut off; and then, and not till then came the enemy within the Lyne both
horſe and foote, and poſſeſſed themſelves of the ſuburbs: whereupon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
preſently deſired a Parly with the enemy, which accordingly was done:

Hill Fort and Wind-mill Hill Fort, I was upon the Line between the ſaid two

out upon them at the Colledge Greene, the enemy throwing downe their

thence to Charge the enemy immediatly without retreating into the City,
which had been farre the nearer, ſpeedier and more advantagious way to

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:159182:85"/>
by Prince <hi>Rupers;</hi> Colonell <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes</hi> being then Governour thereof.
That on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 26. of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt, the Enemie giving a generall ſtorme
and aſſault to the Out-workes of the ſaid City, were valiantly repulſed by
the Garriſon Souldiers with great loſſe and ſlaughter to them, and the loſſe of
not above 5. or 6. of our men onely: about 200. of the Enemies as was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
reported and no more, entred the Line neere the Colledge greene, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
our men were by the Governours direction commanded off the Line, and
particularly thoſe of our Regiment were by Order drawne into the Caſtle,
whether this Deponent came about an houre and a halfe after the Enemies
entring the Line; where finding a great company of men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
of meane condition in appearance; this Deponent betooke himſelfe to
the top of the Caſtle, where he viewed that ſide of the Workes where the
Enemy entred, but in two houres ſpace of his continuance there, he could
not perceive one Enemy more to enter, neither indeed was there any probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
they ſhould, having ſo ſharpe a repulſe upon their deſperate aſſault, that
morning every where, at <hi>Priors</hi> Fort and <hi>Brandon</hi> hill Fort; the multitude
of their ſlaine men in the Trenches and neere thoſe Forts, cauſed them to
quit the places in great diſorder, and to flye and diſperſe themſelves as this
Deponent then well perceived, who afterward could diſcerne no Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that and the Windmill Fort, having received ſuch hot entertainment
from our Souldiers all along thoſe Workes. And when this Deponent firſt
aſcended the Caſtle Wall, he perceived about 300, of the Enemies Horſe
marching off, a mile as he conceived, from the Works: whereupon divers of
the Souldiers were very deſirous to return to the Line from whence they
were called, and one whom this Deponent ſuppoſed to be an Officer, being
below in the Green, exclaimed againſt us on the Wall, becauſe we went not
againe to the Line; further crying upon this Deponents demands, that he had
a Command for that purpoſe; whereupon this Deponent applyed himſelfe to
the Governour Colonell <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes,</hi> whom he met at the Caſtle gate,
and acquainted him therewith, which he then contradicted, commanding this
Deponent not to ſtir without Order from himſelfe, or his ſuperior Officers,
which this Deponent obeying, had no further notice of any thing, onely a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before night he heard there was a Parley with the Enemie, and about eight
of the clock at night as he and his Major were at Supper; they received In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
that the conditions of ſurrendring the Town and Caſtle were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded:
whereupon this Deponents Major went to know what the Termes
of ſurrendring were, and upon his return gave him notice to prepare for a
march by 9. of the clock the next morning; and going about 8. of the clock to
the Caſtle that morning for his cloak-bag and cloathes, he found the gates
thereof ſhut, and no admittance, but immediately after he preſſing into the
Caſtle upon the opening of the wicket, found Colonell <hi>Iohn Fiennes</hi> with ſome
of his Troopers, and many of our Foot Souldiers there; but the Keyes of the
Caſtle, contrary to the Articles of agreement, were in the cuſtody of one of
the Kings Commanders, who aſſiſted with 3. or 4. more, would ſuffer none
of our men to paſſe in or out, but when they pleaſed; beating and abuſing
many of our Souldiers, and diſ-arming <hi>moſt</hi> of our Officers and Troopers
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:159182:85"/>
there, contrary to our conditions; where we were detained by an Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
number, till 3. of the clock that day; many affronts being offered unto us
in the interim, the Governour of the Caſtle, and Colonell <hi>Iohn Fiennes</hi> being
gone away long before; and whilſt we were thus detained by the Enemies in
the Caſtle, notice was given us of the many injuries and violences offered to our
Commanders, Officers, and Souldiers in the Town, ſo as this Deponent and
his Major, were conſtrayned to procure one of the Kings Officers to guard
them to their lodgings at the <hi>Gillards</hi> Inne, from whence after 6. of the clock
by favour of one of the Kings Captains, they were conveyed towards <hi>Bathe,</hi>
and as this Deponent paſſed the Suburbs, he met divers Common Souldiers of
his own and other Companies, who ſeemed fully reſolved to march away with
the Governour in the morning, that had liſted themſelves in the Enemies Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
upon no other ground (as this Deponent conceiveth) but that no care was
taken by the ſaid Governour for their ſecurity, and proviſion, or to ſee the
Articles of Agreement performed. And this Deponent further ſaith, that
when the ſaid Town and Caſtle were ſurrendred, there was neither want of
Victuall nor Ammunition, nor Souldiers to defend the ſame; and that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to his knowledge had taken none of their Forts, nor made any breach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
nor battery againſt the Walls of the ſayd City or Caſtle, and that the ſaid
Caſtle was then well fortified and provided to hold out a Siege; and all the
Canons, Ammunition, Armes, Priſoners, Victualls, Colours, were reſigned
up to the Enemy by the ſaid Governour.</p>

like; whereby the Enemy made their entrance without much oppoſition;

there was no meanes uſed to take the Enemie before expreſſed, and to make
good our Workes againe; but we were within one houre after the entry of the
