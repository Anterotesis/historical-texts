            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Obedience to the Commands of the Right Honourable the Lords Iustices, and the most Reverend and Learned Primate, and to the desires of my Reverend Brethren, put it past my inquiry, whether I ought to Publish this following Sermon. I will not therefore excuse it, and say it might have advantages in the Delivery, which it would want in the Reading; and the eare would be kind to the Piety of it, which was apparent in the design, when the eye would be severe in its censure of those arguments, which as they could not be longer in that measure of time; so would have appeared more firm, if they could have had liberty to have been pursued to their utmost issue. But reason lies in a little room, and Obedience in less. And although what I have here said, may not stop the mouths of Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to keep up a faction, yet I have said enough to the sober and pious, to them who love Order, and hearken to the voice of the Spouse of Christ, to the Loving and to the Obedient: And for those that are not so, I have no argument fit to be used, but Prayer, and readiness to give them a reason, when they shall modestly demand it. In the
<pb facs="tcp:53467:3"/>
mean time I shall onely desire them to make use of those truths which the more learned of their party have by the evidence of fact been forced to confess. <hi>Rivet</hi> affirms that it descended <hi>ex veteris aevi reliquiis,</hi> that Presbyters should be assistants or conjoyned to the Bishops, (who is by this confessed to be the principal) in the imposition of hands for Ordination. <hi>VValo Messalinus</hi> acknowledges it to be <hi>rem antiquissimam,</hi> a most ancient thing that these two Orders, <hi>(viz)</hi> of Bishops and Presbyters, should be distinct, even in the middle, or in the beginning of the next age after Christ. <hi>Dd. Blondell</hi> places it to be 35. years after the death of <hi>S. John</hi> Now then Episcopacy is confessed to be of about 1600. years continuance: and if before this they can shew any Ordination by mere Presbyters, by any but an Apostle, or an Apostolical man; and if there were not visibly a distinction of powers and persons relatively in the Ecclesiastical Government: or if they can give a rational account why they who are forced to confess the Honour and distinct Order of Episcopacy for about 16. ages, should in the dark interval of 35. years (in which they can pretend to no Monument or Record to the contrary) yet make unlearned scruples of things they cannot colourably prove; if (I say) they can reasonably account for these things, I for my part will be ready to confess that they are not guilty of the greatest, the most unreasonable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable schism in the world. But else, they have no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to palliate the unlearned crime. For will not all wise men in the world conclude, that the Church of God, which was then <hi>Holy</hi> not in title onely and designe, but practically and materially; and persecuted, and not immerged in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular temptations, could not all in one instant joyn together to alter that form of Church Government, which Christ and his Apostles had so recently established, and without
<pb facs="tcp:53467:3"/>
a Divine warrant destroy a Divine institution, not onely to the confusion of the Hierarchy, but to the ruine of their own Souls. It were strange that so great a change should be, and no good man oppose it. <hi>In toto orbe decretum est:</hi> so <hi>St. Hierom.</hi> All the world consented in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Episcopal Order. And therefore if we had no more to say for it, yet in prudence and piety we cannot say they would innovate in so great a matter.</p>
            <p>But I shall enter no further upon this enquirie: onely I remember that it is not very many Months since the Bigots of the Popish party cryed out against us vehemently, and inquired, VVhere is your Church of <hi>England</hi> since you have no Vnity? for your Ecclesiastick head of Vnity, your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, are gone. And if we should be desirous to verify their argument, so as indeed to destroy Episcopacy, VVe should too much advantage Popery, and do the most imprudent and most impious thing in the world. But blessed be God, who hath restored that Government, for which Our late King of glorious memory gave his blood. And that (me thinks) should very much weigh with all the Kings true hearted Subjects, who should make it Religion not to rob that glorious Prince of the greatest honour of such a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. For my part, I think it fit to rest in those words of another Martyr <hi>St. Cyprian, Si quis cum Episcopo non sit, in Ecclesia non esse</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 69.</note> He that is not with the Bishop, is not in the Church: that is, he that goes away from him, and willingly separates, departs from Gods Church; and whether he can then be with God, is a very material consideration, and fit to be thought on by all that think heaven a more eligible good then the interests of a faction, and the importune desire of rule can countervail.</p>
            <p>However. I have in the following papers spoken a few things, which I hope may be fit to perswade them that are


<pb facs="tcp:53467:4"/>
not infinitely prejudic'd: and although two or three good arguments are as good as two or three hundred, yet my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose here was to prove the dignity and necessity of the Office and Order Episcopal, onely that it might be as an Oeconomy to convey notice, and remembrances of the great duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon all them that undertake this great charge. The Dignity and the Duty take one another by the hand, and are born together: onely every Sheep of the Flock must take care to make the Bishops duty as easy as it can by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and love, by Prayer and by Obedience. It is at the best very difficult, but they who oppose themselves to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, make it harder and uncomfortable. But take heed; if thy Bishop hath cause to complain to God of thee for thy perversness and uncharitable walking, thou wilt be the looser. And for Vs, VVe can onely say in the words of the Prophet,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jerem. 9.1.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>VVe will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people:</hi> But Our comfort is in God: for <hi>we can do nothing without him,</hi> but in him <hi>we can do all things.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore VVe will pray, <hi>Domine, dabis pacem nobis, omnia enim opera nostra operatus es in nobis</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esa. 26.12.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Who are these Rulers of Christs Family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though Christ knew it, and therefore needed not to ask; yet we have disputed it so much, and obeyed so little, that we have chang'd the plain hypothesis into an intangled question. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer yet is easie as to some part of the inquiry. The Apostles are the first meaning of the text: for they were our Fathers in Christ: They begat Sons and Daughters unto God: and where a spiritual paternity is evident, we need look no further for spiritual Government, because in the paternal rule all power is founded: They begat the Family by the power of the word and the life of the spirit, and they fed this family and rul'd it by the word of their proper Ministery. They had the keyes of this house, the Stewards <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; and they had the Rulers place; for they sat on twelve thrones and judged the twelve tribes of


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53467:6"/>
Israel. But of this there is no question.</p>
            <p>And as little of another proposition: that this Stewardship was to last for ever; for the powers of Ministring in this Office, and the Office it self were to be perpetual. For the issues and powers of Government are more necessary for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating the Church, then for the first planting: and if it was necessary that the Apostles should have a rod and a staff at first, it would be more necessary afterwards when the Family was more numerous, and their first zeal abated, and their native simplicity perverted into arts of hypocrisy and formes of godliness, when <hi>Heresies should arise, and the love of many should wax cold.</hi> The Apostles had also a power of Ordination; and that the very power it self does <hi>denote,</hi> for it <hi>makes</hi> perpetuity, that could not expire in the dayes of the Apostles, for by it, they themselves propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated a succession. And Christ having promis'd his spirit to abide with his Church for ever, and made his Apostles the channels, the Ministers and conveyances of it, that it might descend as the inheritance and eternal portion of the Family; it cannot be imagined that when the first Ministers were gone, thereshould not others rise up in the same places, some like to the first, in the same Office and Ministery of the spirit. But the thing


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53467:6"/>
is plain and evident in the matter of fact also.<note place="margin">Epist. 73. ad Juba<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Quod in Ecclesiâ nunc geritur, hoc olim fecerunt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoli,</hi> said S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Cyprian</hi>; What the Apostles did at first, that the Church does to this day, and shall do so for ever. For when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> had given to the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. of <hi>Ephesus</hi> rules of Government in this Family;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.14</note> he commands, that they should be <hi>observed till the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ</hi>: and therefore these authorities and charges are given to him and to his Successors; it is the observation of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> upon the warranty of that text, and is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and undeniable.</p>
            <p>Well then. The Apostles were the first Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; and this Office dies not with them, but must for ever be succeeded in; and now begins the enquiry, who are the Successors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: for they are, they must evidently be the Stewards to feed and to rule this Family. There are some that say, that all who have any portion of work in the Family, all the Ministers of the Gospel are these Stewards, and so all will be Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. The Presbyters surely; for say they, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Bishop is the same thing, and have the same name in Scripture, and therefore the Office cannot be distinguished. To this I shall very briefly say two things, which will quickly clear our way through this bush of thornes.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53467:7"/>
I. That the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> is but an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appellative used amongst the Jews, as <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> amongst us; but it signifies no order at all, nor was ever used in Scripture to signify any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct company or order of Clergy. And this appears not onely by an Induction in all the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merations of the Offices Ministerial in the New Testament: <note n="*" place="margin">Ro. 12.6. Ephe. 4.11. 1 Cor. 12.28.</note>where to be a Presbyter is never reckoned either as a distinct Office, or a distinct order; but indifferently communicated to all the Superior Clergy, and all the Princes of the people.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The second thing I intended to say is this; that although all the superior Clergy had not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, but divers common appellatives; all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, even the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it self being called a Deaconship<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 1.25.</note>; yet it is evident that before the common appellations were fixt into names of propriety, they were as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently distinguished in their offices and powers, as they are at this day, in their Names and Titles.</p>
            <p>To this purpose S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Titus</hi> the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. of <hi>Crete</hi> a special commission, command and power to make Ordinations: and in him, and in the person of <hi>Timothy</hi> he did erect a Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature even over some of the Clergy, who yet were called Presbyters:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.19.</note> 
               <hi>against a Presbyter receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses</hi>:


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53467:7"/>
there is the measure and the warranty of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientia Episcopalis,</hi> the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>s. Audience Court: and when the accused were found guilty he gives in charge to proceed to censures: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, &amp; <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>You must rebuke them sharply; and you must silence them; stop their mouths,</hi> that's S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> word; that they may no more scatter their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom in the ears and hearts of the people. These Bishops were commanded, <hi>to set in order things that were wanting</hi> in the Churches, the same with that power of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi>; [<hi>other things will I set in order when I come,</hi>] said he to the Corinthian Churches; in which there were many who were called Presbyters: who nevertheless for all that name, had not that power. To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is plain in Scripture,<note place="margin">Cap. 2. v. 2.</note> that <hi>some would have been Apostles that were not</hi>; such were those whom the spirit of God notes in the Revelation: and some did <hi>love preeminence</hi> that had it not: for so did <hi>Diotrephes</hi>: and some were Judges of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all were not; for therefore they appealed to the Apostles at Jerusalem: and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Philip</hi> though he was an Evangelist, yet he could not give confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the Samaritans whom he had baptiz'd, but the Apostles were sent for: for that was part of the power reserv'd to the Episcopal or Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53467:8"/>Now from these premises the conclusion is plain and easy. 1. Christ left a Government in his Church, and founded it in the persons of the Apostles. 2. The Apostles received this power for the perpetual use and benefit, for the comfort and edification of the Church for ever. 3. The Apostles had this Government, but all that were taken into the Ministery, and all that were called Presbyters had it not. If therefore this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which there is so much disparity in the very nature and exercise and first original of it, must abide for ever; then so must that disparity: If the Apostolate in the first stabiliment was this eminency of power; then it must be so, that is, it must be the same in the succession that it was in the foundation. For after the Church is founded upon its Governours, we are to expect no change of government. If Christ was the Author of it, then as Christ left it, so it must abide for ever: for ever there must be the Governing and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, the Superior and the Subordinate, the Ordainer and the Ordained, the confirmer and the confirmed.</p>
            <p>Thus far the way is straight, and the path is plain. The Apostles were the Stewards and the ordinary Rulers of Christs Family by virtue of the order and office Apostolical; and although this


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53467:8"/>
must be succeeded to for ever; yet no man for his now, or at any time being called a Presbyter or Elder can pretend to it: for besides his being a Presbyter, he must be an Apostle too; else, though he be called <hi>in partem sollicitudinis,</hi> and may do the offices of assistance and understewardship; yet the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Government and Rule of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily belongs not to him.</p>
            <p>But then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; who are these Stewards and Rulers over the houshold now? To this the answer is also certain and easy. Christ hath made the same Governours to day as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <hi>Apostles still.</hi> For though the twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles are dead; Yet the Apostolical order is not: it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a generative order,</hi> and begets more Apostles: now who these <hi>minores Apostoli</hi> are, the successors of the Apostles in that office Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical and supreme regiment of Souls, we are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently taught in Holy Scriptures; which when I have clearly shewn to you, I shall pass on to some more practical considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore, certain and known it is, that Christ appointed two sorts of Ecclesiastick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; the XII. Apostles, and the LXXII. Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: to these he gave a limited commission, to those a fulness of power: to these a temporary imployment, to those a perpetual and everlasting;


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53467:9"/>
from these two societies founded by Christ, the whole Church of God derives the two superiour orders in the sacred Hierarchy; and as Bishops do not claim a Divine right but by succession from the Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so the Presbyters cannot pretend to have been instituted by Christ, but by claiming a succession to the LXXII: and then consider the difference, compare the Tables, and all the world will see the advantages of argument we have: for since the LXXII. had nothing but a mission on a temporary errand, and more then that we hear nothing of them in Scripture; but upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Christ powred all the Ecclesiastical power, and made them the ordinary Ministers of that Spirit which was to abide with the Church for ever; the Divine institution of Bishops, that is, of Successors to the Apostles, is much more clear then that Christ appointed Presbyters, or Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the LXXII: and yet if from hence they do not derive it, they can never prove their order to be of Divine institution at all, much less to be so alone.</p>
            <p>But we may see the very thing it self: the very matter of fact. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames</hi> the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> called an Apostle:<note place="margin">Gal. 1.19.</note> 
               <hi>Other Apostles saw I none, save</hi> James <hi>the Lords Brother.</hi> For there were some whom the Scriptures call <hi>the Apostles

               </gap>, those who are now called B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>s. were then called Apostles, saith the same Father: the sence and full meaning of which argument is a perfect commentary upon that famous prophecy of the Church,<note place="margin">Psalm 45.16</note> [<hi>In stead of thy Fathers thou shalt have childen whom thou mayest make Princes in all Lands,</hi>] [that is,] not onely the twelve Apostles our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Christ, who first begat us, were to rule Christs Family, but when they were gone, their Children &amp; Successors should arise in their stead, <hi>Et nati natorum, &amp; quinascentur ab illis,</hi> their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Successors to all generations shall be <hi>principes populi,</hi> that is, Rulers and Governours of the whole Catholick Church. <hi>De prole enim Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae crevit eidem paternitas,</hi> id est, <hi>Episcopi quos illa genuit, &amp; patres appellat, &amp; constituit in sedibus Patrum</hi>; saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austin</hi>; the Children of the

            <p>After these plain and evident testimonies of Scripture, it will not be amiss to say, that this great affair relying not onely upon the words of insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but on matter of fact; pas'd forth into a demonstration and greatest notoreity by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practise of the whole Catholick Church.

But when <hi>Constantine</hi> receiv'd the Church into his


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53467:11"/>
armes, he found it universally governed by B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>s. and therefore no wise or good man professing to be a Christian, that is, to believe the holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, can be content to quit the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government; (that by which the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of God was fed, and taught and rul'd,) and beget to himself new Fathers and new Apostles, who by wanting Succession from the Apostles of our Lord, have no Ecclesiastical and Derivative communion with the fountains of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>If ever <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi>'s rule could be us'd in any question, it is in this: <hi>quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus</hi>; That Bishops are the Successors of the Apostles in this Stewardship; and that they did always rule the Family, was taught and acknowledged always, and every where, and by all men that were of the Church of God: and if these evidences be not sufficient to convince modest and sober persons in this qestion, We shall find our faith to fail in many other articles, of which we yet are very confident. For the observation of the Lords day, the Consecration of the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist by Priests, the Baptizing Infants, the communicating of Women, and the very Canon of the Scripture it self rely but upon the same probation: and therefore the denying of Articles thus proved, is a way (I do not say) to


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53467:11"/>
bring in all Sects and Heresies, (that's but little,) but a plain path and inlet to Atheism and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: for by this means, it will not onely be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to agree concerning the meaning of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but the Scripture it self, and all the Records of Religion will become useless, and of no efficacy or persuasion.</p>
            <p>I am entered into a Sea of matter, but I will break it off abruptly, and sum up this enquirie with the words of the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which is one of the four Generals, by our Laws made the measures of judging Heresies. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>It is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge to bring back a Bishop to the degree and order of a Presbyter.</hi> It is indeed a rifling the order, and intangling the gifts, and confounding the method of the Holy Ghost: it is a dishonouring them whom God would honour, and a robbing them of those spiritual eminencies with which the spirit of God does anoint the consecrated heads of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. And I shall say one thing more, which indeed is a great truth, that the diminution of Episcopacy was first introduced by Popery, and the Popes of Rome by communicating to Abbots, and other mere Priests special graces to exercise some essential Offices of Episcopacie, hath made this sacred order to be cheap, and apt to be invaded.


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53467:12"/>
But then adde this; If <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was in so dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a condition for offering to buy the guifts and powers of the Apostolical order, what shall we think of them that <hi>snatch</hi> them away, and pretend to wear them whether the Apostles &amp; their Successors will or no?

               </gap>, to bely the Holy-Ghost; that is the least of it: it is rapine and sacriledge, besides the heresie and the schism, and the spiritual lie. For the government Episcopal, as it was exemplified in the Synagogue, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by the same measures in the Temple, so it was transcribed by the eternal son of God, who translated it into a Gospel Ordinance: it was san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed by the Holy Spirit, who named some of the persons, and gave to them all power and graces from above. It was subjected in the Apostles first, and by them transmitted to a distinct Order of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks: it was received into all Churches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in the Records of the Holy Scriptures, preached by the universal voice of all the Christian World, delivered by notorious and uninterrupted practise, and deriv'd to further and unquestionable issue by perpetual succession.</p>
            <p>I have done with the hardest part of the Text, by finding out the persons intrusted, <hi>the Stewards of Christs Family</hi>: which though Christ onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in this place, yet he plainly enough mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested

but a great labour, and a buisy imployment, a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life, and a necessity of making severe accounts. But all this is nothing but the general measures, I cannot be useful or understood, unless I be more particular. The particulars we shall best enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by recounting those great conjugations of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy offices and actions by which Christian Bishops have blessed and built up Christendom, for because we must be followers of them, as they were of Christ, the recounting what they did worthily in their generations, will not onely demonstrate how useful, how profitable, how necessary Episcopacy is to the Christian Church, but it will at the same time teach us our duty, by what services we are to benefit the Church, in what works we are to be imployed, and how to give an account of our Stewardship with joy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Christian Church was founded by B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>s: not onely because the Apostles, who were Bishops, were the first Preachers of the Gospel, and Planters of Churches, but because the Apostolical men, whom the Apostles used in planting and dissemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Religion, were by all Antiquity affirm'd to have been Diocesan Bishops; insomuch that as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> witnesses there were at the first dissemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the faith of Christ,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. Tit. 1</note> many Churches who had in them no other Clergy, but a Bishop and his


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53467:15"/>
Deacons, and the Presbyters were brought in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards as the harvest grew greater. But the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops names are known, they are <hi>recorded in the book of Life,</hi> and <hi>their praise is in the Gospel</hi>: such were <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus, Clemens</hi> and <hi>Linus, Marcus</hi> and <hi>Dyonisius, Onesimus</hi> and <hi>Cains, Epaphroditas</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames our Lords Brother, Evodius</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi>: all which, if there be any faith in Christians that gave their lives for a testimony to the faith, and any truth in their Stories; and unless we who believe <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi> and <hi>Plutarch, Livy</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> think that all Church story is a perpetual Romance, and that all the brave men, the Martyrs and the Doctors of the Primitive Church, did conspire as one man to abuse all Christendom for ever; I say unless all these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible suppositions be admitted, all these whom I have now reckoned were Bishops fixed in several Churches, and had Dioceses for their Charges.</p>
            <p>The consequent of this consideration is this. If Bishops were those upon whose Ministery Christ founded and built his Church, let us consider what great wisdom is required of them that seem to be Pillars: The Stewards of Christs Family must be wise: that Christ requires, and if the order be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Church, wisdom cannot but be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the Order. For it is a shame if they who by their Office are Fathers in Christ, shall by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulness


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53467:16"/>
skilfulness be but Babes themselves; understanding not the secrets of Religion, the mysteries of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the perfections of the Evangelical Law, all the advantages and disadvantages in the Spiritual life. A Bishop must be exercis'd in Godliness, a man of great experience in the secret conduct of Souls, not satisfyed with an ordinary skill in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing homilies to the people, and speaking common exhortations in ordinary cases; but ready to answer in all secret inquiries, and able to convince the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers, and to speak wisdom amongst them that are perfect.</p>
            <p>If the first Bishops laid the foundation, their Successours must not onely preserve whatsoever is fundamental, but build up the Church in a most holy Faith, taking care that no Heresie sap the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and that no hay or rotten vvood be built upon it: and above all things, that a most Holy life be superstructed upon a holy and unreproveable Faith. So the Apostles laid the foundation, and built the vvalls of the Church, and their Successors must raise up the roof as high as Heaven. For let us talk and dispute eternally, vve shall never compose the controversies in Religion, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish truth upon unalterable foundations, as long as Men handle the vvord of God deceiptfully, that is, vvit designes and little artifices, and saecular


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53467:16"/>
partialities, and they will for ever do so, as long as they are proud or covetous. It is not the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of our questions, or the subtilty of our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries that makes disputes interminable; but We shall never cure the itch of disputing, or establish Unity, unless we apply our selves to humility, and contempt of riches. If we will be contending, let us contend like the Olive and the Vine, who shall produce best, and most fruit: not like the Aspine and the Elm which shall make most noyse in a wind. All other methods are a beginning at a wrong end. And as for the people; the way to make them conformable to the wise and holy rules of faith and government, is by reducing them to live good lives. When the Children of Israel gave themselves to gluttony and drunkenness, and filthy lusts, they quickly fell into abominable idolatries; and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> says that men make shipwrack of their faith by putting away a good conscience:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.19 2 Tim. 3.9,</note> for the mystery of faith is best preserv'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in a pure conscience, saith the same Apostle: secure but that, and we shall quickly end our disputes, and have an obedient and conformable people: but else never.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As Bishops were the first Fathers of Churches, and gave them being: so they preserve them in being. For without Sacraments there is no


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53467:17"/>
Church; or it will be starv'd and die: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bishops there can be no Priests, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no Sacraments: and that must needs be a supream order from whence ordination it self pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. For it is evident and notorious that in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture there is no record of ordination, but an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical hand was in it: one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one of the chief, one of the superiour and Ruling Clergy: and it is as certain in the descending ages of the Church, the Bishop always had that power, it was never denyed to him, and it was never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Presbyters: and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierom</hi> himself when out of his anger against <hi>Iohn</hi> B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> endeavoured to equal the Presbyter with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, though in very many places he spake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, yet even then also, and in that heat, he except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ordination,</hi> acknowledging that to be the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>s. pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar. And therefore they who go about to extinguish Episcopacy, do as <hi>Iullan</hi> did; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Presbytery, and starve the Flock, and take away their Shepheards, and dispark their pastures, and tempt Gods providence to extraordinaries, and put the people to hard shifts, and turn the channels of Salvation quite another way, and leave the Church to a perpetual uncertainty, whether she be alive or dead, and the people destitute of the life of their Souls, and their daily bread, and their spiritual comforts, and holy blessings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53467:17"/>The consequent of this is. If Sacraments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Bishops, then let us take care that we convey to the people holy and pure materials, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed with a holy ministery, and ministred by holy persons. For although it be true, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the Sacraments does not depend wholly upon the worthiness of him that ministers; yet it is as true, that it does not wholly rely upon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of the Receiver: but both together relying upon the goodness of God produce all those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which are designed. The Minister hath an influence into the effect, and does very much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; and if there be a failer there, it is a defect in one of the concurring causes; and therefore an unholy Bishop is a great diminution to the peoples blessing. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierom</hi> presses this severely:<note place="margin">in Cap. 2. Zeph.</note> 
               <hi>Impiè faciunt</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They do wickedly who affirm that the Holy Eucharist is consecrated by the words</hi> [alone] <hi>and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayer of the consecrator, and not</hi> [also] <hi>by his life and holiness,</hi> and therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. Ep. 4.</note> that <hi>none but holy and upright men are to be chosen, who offering their Sacrifices worthily to God may be heard in their prayers for the Lords people</hi>: but for others; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificia eorum panis luctus</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi>) <hi>their Sacrifices are like the bread of sorrow, who ever eats thereof shall be defiled.</hi> This discourse is not mine but S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Cyprians</hi>: and although his words are not


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53467:18"/>
to be understood dogmatically, but in the case of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and caution, yet we may lay our hands upon our hearts, and consider how we shall give an account of our Stewardship, if we shall offer to the people the bread of God with impure hands: it is of it self a pure nourishment, but if it passes through an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean vessel, it looses much of it's excellency.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The like also is to be said concerning prayer. For the Episcopal Order is appointed by God to be the great Ministers of Christs Priesthood, that is, to stand between Christ and the people in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse of prayer and blessing. <hi>VVe will give our selves continually to prayer</hi>: said the Apostles: that was the one half of their imployment: and indeed a Bishop should spend very much of his time in holy prayer, and in diverting Gods judgments, and procuring blessings to the people; for in all times, the chief of the Religion was ever the chief Minister of blessing. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> blessed <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and <hi>Melchisedek</hi> blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> blessed the people; and <hi>without all controversy</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,) <hi>the less is blessed of the Greater.</hi> But then <hi>we know that God heareth not sinners</hi>; and it must be <hi>the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous Man</hi> that shall <hi>prevail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore we may easily consider that a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prelate is a great calamity to that Flock, which


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53467:18"/>
he is appointed to bless and pray for. How shall he reconcile the penitents, who is himself at enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with God? How shall the Holy Spirit of God descend upon the Symbols at his prayer who does perpetually grieve him, and quench his holy fires, and drive him quite away? How shall he that hath not tasted of the spirit by contemplation, stir up others to earnest desires of Celestial things? Or what good shall the people receive, when the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. lays upon their head a covetous or a cruel, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just or an impure hand? But therefore that I may use the words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dial. adv. Lucifer.</note> 
               <hi>Cum ab Episcopo gratia in populum transfundatur, &amp; mundi totius &amp; Ecclesiae totius condimentum sit Episcopus &amp;c.</hi> since it is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that from the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. grace should be diffus'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the people, there is not in the world a greater indecency then a holy office ministred by an unholy person, and no greater injury to the people, then that of the blessings which God sends to them by the Ministeries Evangelical they should be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defrauded by a wicked Steward. And therefore it was an exellent prayer which to this very purpose was by the son of <hi>Sirach</hi> made in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the High Priests the sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> [<hi>God give you wisdom in your heart to judge his people in right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness, that their good things be not abolished, and that their glory may endure for ever.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53467:19"/>
which God requires. There is reason in these words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> [<hi>It is necessary that the Church should adhere to their Bishop as the body to the head, as plants to their roots, as rivers to their springs, as children to their Fathers, as Disciples to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>] These similitudes express not onely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and dependency, but they tell us the reason of the duty. The head gives light and reason to conduct the body, the roots give nourishment to the plants, and the springs, perpetual emanation of waters to the channels. Fathers teach and feed their children, and Disciples receive wise instruction from their Masters: and if we be all this to the people, they will be all that to us; and wisdom will compel them to submit, and our humility will teach them obedience, and our charity will invite their compliance. Our good example will provoke them to good works, and our meekness will melt them into softness and flexibility. For all the Lords people are <hi>populus voluntarius,</hi> a free and willing people; and we who cannot compel their bodies, must thus constrain their souls; by inviting their wills, by convincing their understandings, by the beauty of fair example, the efficacy and holiness and the demonstrations of the spirit.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>experimentum ejus qui in nobis loquitur Christus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 13.7.</note> The experiment of Christ that speaketh


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53467:20"/>
in us. For to this purpose those are excellent words which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> spake. [<hi>Remember them who have the rule over you, whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.</hi>] There lyes the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration: and those Prelates who teach good life, whose Sermons are the measures of Christ, and whose life is a coppy of their Sermons; these must be followed; and surely these will: for these are burning and shining lights: but if we hold forth false fires, and by the amusement of evil examples call the vessels that sail upon a dangerous Sea to come upon a rock, or an iron shore instead of a safe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, we cause them to make shipwrack of their precious faith, and to perish in the deceiptful and unstable waters. <hi>Vox operum fortiùs sonat quàm verborum.</hi> A good life is the strongest argument that your faith is good, and a gentle voice will be sooner entertaind then a voice of thunder: but the greatest eloquence in the world, is a meek Spirit, and a liberal hand: these are the two pastoral staves the Prophet speaks of <hi>nognam</hi> &amp; <hi>hovelim, beauty and bands</hi>:<note place="margin">Zech. 11.7.</note> he that hath the staff of the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the ornament of fair example, he hath also the staff of bands, <hi>atque in funiculis Adam trahet eos, in vinculis charitatis</hi>;<note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> as the Prophet <hi>Hosea's</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is; he shall draw the people after him by the cords of a man, by the bands of a holy charity.


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53467:20"/>
But if against all these demonstrations any man will be refractary; We have in stead of a staff, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical rod; which is the last and latest remedy, and either brings to repentance, or consignes to ruin and reprobation.</p>
            <p>If there were any time remaining; I could reckon that the Episcopal order is the principle of Vnity in the Church; and we see it is so, by the innumerable Sects that sprang up when Episcopacy was persecuted. I could adde, how that Bishops were the cause that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote his Gospel; that the Christian Faith was for 300 years together bravely defended by the sufferings, the prisons and the flames, the life and the death of Bishops, as the principal Combatants. That the Fathers of the Church whose writings are held in so great venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the Christian World, were almost all of them Bishops. I could adde, that the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion in <hi>England</hi> was principally by the Preachings and the disputings, the vvritings and the Martyrdom of Bishops. That Bishops have ever since been the greatest defensatives against Popery. That <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> were Governed by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops ever since they were Christian, and under their conduct have for so many ages enjoyed all the blessings of the Gospel. I could adde also, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy is the great stabiliment of Monarchy; but


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53467:21"/>
of this we are convinc'd by a sad and too dear bought experience. I could therefore in stead of it, say, that Episcopacy is the great ornament of Religion, the Gentry being little better then Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, while they live under the Presbytery. That as it rescues the Clergy from contempt; so it is the greatest preservative of the peoples liberty from Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick Tyranny on one hand, and Anarchy and licentiousness on the other. That it endears obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And is subject to the Laws of Princes. And is wholly ordained for the good of mankind, and the benefit of Souls. But I cannot stay to number all the blessings which have entered into the world at this door: I onely remark these because they describe unto us the Bishops imployment, which is, to be buisy in the service of Souls, to do good in all capacities, to serve every mans need, to promote all publick benefits, to cement Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to establish peace, to propagate the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, to do hurt to no man, to do good to every man; that is, so to minister, that Religion and Charity, publick peace, and private blessings may be in their exaltation.</p>
            <p>As long as it was thus done by the Primitive Bishops, the Princes and the People gave them all honour. Insomuch that by a decree of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. had power given him to retract


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53467:21"/>
the sentences made by the Presidents of Provinces, and we find in the acts of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued some innocent persons from death when the executioner was ready to strike the fatal blow: which thing even vvhen it fell into inconvenience; was indeed forbidden by <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorlus</hi>; but the confidence and honour was onely chang'd, it was not taken away for the condemned criminal had leave to appeal to the <hi>Audientia Episcopalis,</hi> to the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>s Court. This was not any right which the Bishops could challenge, but a reward of their pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and so long as the Holy Office was holily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, the World found so much comfort and security, so much justice and mercy, so many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and spiritual blessings consequent to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of that order, that as the Galatians to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> men have plucked out their eys to do them service, and to do them honour. For then Episcopacy did that good that God intended by it: it was a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Government, by spiritual persons, for spiritual ends. Then the Princes and the People gave them honours because they deserv'd and sought them not: then they gave them wealth, because they would dispend it wisely, frugally and charitably: Then they gave them power; because it was sure to be us'd for defence of the innocent, for relief of the oppressed, for the punishment of evil doers,


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53467:22"/>
and the reward of the virtuous. Then they desir'd to be judg'd by them because their audiences or Courts did <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they appeas'd all furious sentences, and taught gentle principles, and gave merciful measures and in their Courts were all equity and piety, and Christian determinations.</p>
            <p>But afterwards, when they did fall <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> into saecular methods, and made their Counsels vain by pride, and durtyed their sentences with money, then they became like other men; and so it will be, unless the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>s. be more holy then other men; but when our sanctity and severity shall be as eminent as the calling is, then we shall be called to Councels, and sit in publick meetings, and bring comfort to private Families, and rule in the hearts of men by a <hi>jus relationis,</hi> such as was between the Roman Emperors and the Senate; they courted one another into power, and in giving honour striv'd to out do each other: for from an humble wise man, no man will snatch an imployment that is honourable; but from the proud and from the covetuous every man endeavours to wrest it, and thinks it lawful prize.</p>
            <p>My time is now done, and therefore I cannot speak to the third part of my text, the reward of the good Steward and of the bad: I shall onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it to you in a short exhortation; and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53467:22"/>
In the Primitive Church a Bishop was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admitted to publick penance; not onely because in them every crime is ten, and he that could discern a publick shame, could not discern a publick honor, nor yet onely because every such punishment was scandalous, and did more evil by the example of the crime, then it could do good by the example of the punishment: but also because no spiritual power is higher then the Episcopal, and therefore they were to be referred to the Divine judgment, which was likely to fall on them very heavily. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: the Lord will cut the evil Stewards asunder: he will suffer Schisms and Divisions to enter in upon us, and that will sadly cut us asunder, but the evil also shall fall upon their persons; like the punishment of quartering Traitors, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, punnishment with the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of detestation and exemplarity. Consider therefore what is your great duty. Consider what is your great danger. The lines of duty I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready describ'd; onely remember how dear and pretious Souls are to God, since for their salvation Christ gave his bloud, and therefore will not easily loose them, whom though they had sin'd against him, yet he so highly valued; remember that You are Christs deputies in the care of Souls, and that You succeed in the place of the Apostles. <hi>Non est facilè


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53467:23"/>
stare loco Pauli; &amp; tenere gradum Petri,</hi>; You have undertaken the work of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the office of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter,</hi> and what think you upon this account will be required of us: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierom</hi> expresses it thus. The wisdom and skill of a Bishop ought to be so great; that his countenance, his gesture, his motion, every thing should be vocal, <hi>ut quicquid agit, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid loquitur, doctrina sit Apostolorum</hi>: that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he does or speaks be doctrine Apostolical. The Ancient Fathers had a pious opinion, that besides the Angel guardian which is appointed to the guard of every man; there is to every Bishop a second Angel appointed to him at the Consecration: and to this <hi>Origen</hi> alludes, saying that every Bishoprick hath two Angels, the one visible and the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible. This is a great matter and shews what a precious thing that order and those persons are in the eyes of God; but then this also means, that we should live Angelick lives, which the Church rarely well expresses by saying, that Episcopal dignity is the Ecclesiastick state of perfection, and supposes the persons to be so far advanc'd in holiness as to be in the state of confirmation in grace. But I shall say nothing of these things; because it may be they press too hard, but the use I shall make of it upon occasion of the reward of the good and bad Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; is to remind you of your great danger. For


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53467:23"/>
if it be required of Bishops to be so wise and so holy, so industrious and so careful, so buisy and so good up to the height of best examples, if they be anointed of the Lord, and are the Husbands of the Churches, if they be the Shepheards of the flock, and Stewards of the houshould; it is very fit they consider their danger, that they may be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do their duty. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Bernard</hi> considers it well in his epistle to <hi>Henry Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Sens</hi>; If I lying in my Cell, and smoaking under a Bushel, not shining, yet cannot avoid the breath of the winds but that my light is almost blown out; what will becom of my Candle if it were plac'd on a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick and set upon a hill? I am to look to my self alone, and provide for my own salvation; and yet I offend my self, I am weary of my self, I am my own scandal and my own danger: my own eye, and my own belly, and my own appetite find me work enough; and therefore God help them who besides themselves are answerable for many others. <hi>Iacob</hi> kept the Sheep of <hi>Laban</hi>; and We keep the Sheep of Christ: and <hi>Iacob</hi> was to answer for every Sheep that was stoln, and every lamb that was torn by the wild beast; and so shall We too; if by our fault one of Christs Sheep perish; and yet it may be there are 100000. Souls committed to the care and conduct of some one Shepheard, who yet will


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53467:24"/>
find his own Soul work enough for all his care and watchfulness. If any man should desire me to carry a Frigat into the Indies in which a 100. men were imbarqued; I vvere a mad man to undertake the charge, vvithout proportionable skill; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vvhen there is more danger, and more Souls, and rougher Seas, and more secret Rocks, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Storms, and the Shipvvrack is an eternal loss, the matter vvill then require great consideration in the undertaking, and greatest care in the conduct.</p>
            <p>Vpon this account vve find many brave persons in the first and in the middle ages of the Church vvith great resolution refusing Episcopacy. I vvill not speak of those vvho for fear of Martyrdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd it: but those vvho for fear of damnation did refuse. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Bernard</hi> vvas by three rich Citties seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally called to be their B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>: and by tvvo to be their Arch-B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. and he refus'd them; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Dominicus</hi> refus'd four successively; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> refus'd the Archbishoprick of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Ferrerius</hi> vvould not accept of <hi>Valentia,</hi> or <hi>Ilerda,</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardinus Senensis</hi> refus'd the Bishopricks of <hi>Sens, Vrbin</hi> and <hi>Ferrara.</hi> They had reason; and yet if they had done amiss in that office vvhich they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd, it had been something more excusable; but if they that seek it be as careless in the office as they are greedy of the honour, that vvill be found intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Epistle to <hi>Fabiola</hi>; These things I am sure you could not read without trembling; and certainly, if it can belong to any Christian, then [work out your Salvation with fear and trembling] that's the Bishops burden. For the Bishop is like a man that is surety for his friend; he is bound for many, and for great sums; what's to be done in this case? <hi>Solomons</hi> answer is the way:<note place="margin">Prov. 6.3,4.</note> 
               <hi>Do this now, my Son, deliver thy self, make sure thy friend, give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eye lids</hi>: that is, be sedulous to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thy trust, to perform thy charge; be zealous for Souls, and careless of money; and remember this, that even in Christs Family there was one sad example of an Apostate Apostle; and he fell into that fearful estate merely by the desire and greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of money. Be warm in zeal, and indifferent

in thy temporalities. For he that is zealous in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, and cold in the spiritual: he that doth the accessories of his calling by himself, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal by his Deputies: he that is present at the feast of Sheep shearing, and puts others to feed the flock, hath no signe at all upon him of a good Shepheard. <hi>It is not fit for us to leave the word of God, and to serve tables.</hi> said the Apostles. And if it be a less wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy office to serve the tables even of the poor, to the diminution of our care in the dispensation of Gods word; it must needs be an unworthy imployment to leave the word of God, and to attend the rich and superfluous furniture of our own Tables.

can, and let not your own corrections of criminals be to any purpose, but for their amendment, for the cure of offenders, as long as there is hope, and for the security of those who are sound and whole. Preach often, and pray continually; let your disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be with charity, and your censures slow: let not Excommunications pass for trifles; and drive not away the fly from your brothers forehead with a hatchet: give counsel frequently, and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions seldom, but never without necessity or great charity.

For be sure, there is not a carkase nor a skin, not a lock of wool, nor a drop of milk of the whole flock, but God shall for it call the Idol Shepheard to a severe account. And how, think you, will his anger burn, when he shall see so many Goats standing at his left hand, and so few Sheep at his right? and upon inquiry


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53467:26"/>
shall find, that his ministering Shepheards, were Wolves in Sheeps cloathing; and that by their ill example, or pernitious doctrines, their care of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and carelesness of their flocks, so many Souls perish: who if they had been carefully and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wisely and conscientiously handled, might have shin'd as bright as Angels. And it is a sad consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to remember how many Souls are pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully handled in this world, and carelesly dismissed out of this world: they are left to live at their own rate, and when they are sick they are bidden to be of good comfort, and then all is well: who when they are dead, find themselves cheated of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and invaluable eternity. Oh, how will those Souls in their eternal prisons for ever curse those evil and false guides! and how will those evil guides themselves abide in judgment, when the Angels of wrath snatch their abused people into everlasting torments! For will God bless them or pardon them, by whom so many Souls perish? shall they reign with Christ, who evacuate the death of Christ, and make it useless to dear Souls? Shall they partake of Christs glories, by whom it comes to pass that there is less joy in Heaven it self, even because sinners are not converted, and God is not glorifyed, and the people is not instructed, and the Kingdom of God is not filled? Oh no! the curses

            <p>Can any thing be beyond this? beyond damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Surely a man would think, not. And yet I remember a severe saying of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Gregory</hi>; <hi>Scire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Praelati, quod tot mortibus digni sunt, quot perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis exempla ad subditos extenderunt.</hi> One damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not enough for an evil Shepheard: but for every Soul who dies by his evil example or perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous carelesness, he deserves a new death, a new damnation. Let us therefore be wise and faithful, walk warily, and watch carefully, and rule dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and pray assiduously. For God is more propense to rewards, then to punishments: and the good Steward that is wise and faithful in his dispensation, shall be greatly blessed. But how? <hi>He shall be made ruler over the houshold.</hi> What is that? for he is so already. True: but he shall be much more: <hi>Ex dispensatore faciet procuratorem,</hi> God will treat him as <hi>Ioseph</hi> was treated by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; he was first a Steward, and then a Procurator, one that rul'd his goods without account, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restraint.

our labour into rest, our watchfulness into fruition, and our Bishoprick to a Kingdom. In the mean time our Bishopricks are a great and weighty care, and in a spiritual sense, our dominion is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in grace, and our rule is in the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and our strengths are the powers of the Holy Ghost, and the weapons of our warfare are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: and the eye of God watches over us curiously, to see if we watch over our Flocks by day and by night. And though the Primitive Church (as the Ecclesiastick Histories observe,) when they depos'd a Bishop from his office, ever conceal'd his crime, and made no record of it: yet remember this, that God does, and will call us to a strict and severe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Take heed that you may never hear that fearful sentence, <hi>I was hungry and ye gave me no meat.</hi> If you suffer Christs little ones to starve, it will be required severely at your hands; And know this, that the time will quickly come, in which God shall say unto thee in the words of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Jer. 13.20.21.</note>
