            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wiſedome, and aſſaying profitable enterpryſes
for the common wealth of the Romaines, and
alſo for the glory and aduauncement of his
countrey, in noble feates of armes, ſtriuing to
be aboue the reſte ſingular, did continually oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
him ſelfe in hiſtories, &amp; in monumentes
of great antiquitie. Whoſe commendable ſtudies, <hi>Marcus Tullius Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi>
in a certayne epiſtle to his brother <hi>Quintus,</hi> commendeth in theſe
woordes, <hi>Cyrus ille à Zenophonte non ad hiſtoriae fidem ſcriptus, ſed ad
effigiem iuſti imperij, cuius ſumma grauitas ab illo Philoſopho cum ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulari

very liuely image of a prince, what he ought to be, and of his ſtate is in
thoſe bookes declared, the grauitie and maieſtie of. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
courteous humanitie is ioyned together of that Philoſopher,
the whiche bookes of <hi>Zenophon,</hi> not without great cauſe or dope conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
oure noble <hi>Africanus</hi> woulde neuer laye oute of his handes:
For in thoſe bookes is fully ſet out the ſtate and royall office of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prince and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate. The example of ſo worthy a prince of ſo great
wyſdome, of ſo victorious and valeante a conquerour, is of great force
to ſhewe what great knowledge, wyſedome, and profitable learning,
what glory is conteined in hiſtories to the ſtudentes thereof. This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Scipio,</hi> being a rare prince for all excellency. The ſtaye of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
Empire, a light to all princes, dayly occupied him ſelfe in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of hiſtories. <hi>Octauius</hi> Emperour of Rome, did greatly delight in
hiſtories, and in all antiquities of learning, who was in loue ſo muche
rapted &amp; inflamed with the <hi>Aeneados</hi> of the famous Poete <hi>Virgil,</hi> as
that noble <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> was delighted with <hi>Zenophons</hi> workes.
<hi>Alexander</hi> the great, whoſe commendation is aboue all princes, who
as the booke of the <hi>Machabes</hi> ſheeweth, hauing great warres in hande,
he wan many ſtrong cities, and ſlewe many kynges of the earth, goyng
throughout the endes of the worlde, in ſo muche that the whole worlde
ſtoode in awe of hym. This <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, being brought vp of
that great and moſte wyſe Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> did chiefly place his
delight in hiſtories, who gaue great and princely giftes to all ſuche as
<pb facs="tcp:16261:6"/>
by any meanes profited the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth thereby. This mighty prince
<hi>Alexander,</hi> did ſo muche delighte in hiſtories and in the bookes of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi>
the Greeke Poete, that he would reſt his ſtudy and minde therin.
Whiche bookes of <hi>Homere</hi> he named his pillowe, becauſe he woulde
neuer ſleape without them: ſaying alwayes giue me my pyllowe (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thoſe bookes.) Out of thoſe bookes he learned many notable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,

in his warres fought againſt <hi>Mithidrates.</hi> Thus <hi>Marcus Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius

inquiſition of the beſte learned, and by reading of hiſtories, was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and noble in al pointes of chiualry, that he ought to be placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the princes of all ages. <hi>Alexander Seuerus,</hi> an Emperour of great
glorie, and of moſte noble fame, inferiour to no prince in wyſedome and
learning, by whome the Romaines enioyed a floriſhing ſtate and moſte
peaceable gouernemente, the frutes of all good gouermente. This <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
Seuerus,</hi> wold neuer enterprice any thing of any great weight
or importance, either in warre or peace, but he would ſende for ſuche as
were knowen to be excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in hiſtories, to conſulte and debate with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of ſuche matters: wherein he founde a chiefe treaſure of all depe &amp; ſage
councell, a regiſter of all famous actes. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, at what

he demaunded of his noble men the nereſt and ſafyſt waye out of <hi>Perſia</hi>
into <hi>Aegipte,</hi> but none could tell him. A certayne marchaunt man the
hiſtorie ſayth, <hi>Homo multarum rerum peritus,</hi> a man very cunning in
many thinges, it ſemed by his anſwere he was a traueyler in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
&amp; in many other countries. This marchaunt was by countrey a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian,</hi>
who being brought to him, the hiſtorie maketh no mention of
his name, but <hi>Lucianus</hi> wryteth the ſtory. O king (ſayth the marchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t)
I am able to promyſe thee that the waye from this parte of <hi>Perſia</hi> into
<hi>Aegipte,</hi> is but three dayes iourney through the mountaynes, and ſo it
was proued. <hi>Alexander</hi> ignoraunt of the ſituation of the countrey, and

the marchaunt knew more by his trauayle then thoſe <hi>Perſians</hi> did,
of ſo great force is the worthy knowledge of hiſtories. The knowledge

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of that noble Empreſſe <hi>Zenobia,</hi> the Empreſſe of the Eaſte, ſhe
was the wyfe of valeant <hi>Odoacer,</hi> for her great wyſedome and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

learned Empreſſe <hi>Zenobia,</hi> by her wyſedome, and great knowledge in
hiſtories, excelled in thoſe dayes and in manye ages before, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mightye
Monarches of the worlde. This <hi>Zenobia</hi> made a Chronicle of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
warres fought in <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Alſo ſhe gathered a collection of all the
notable warres fought in the Eaſte partes. The reading of hiſtories
is a ſtudy right profitable for all men, for magiſtrates, for princes a
moſte pleaſaunt and comfortable trauell. The knowledge of hiſtories
is a ſpurre to vertue, a brydle to repreſſe vice in all that feare God. An
hiſtorie is the glaſſe of Princes, the image moſte liuely bothe of vertue
<pb facs="tcp:16261:7"/>
and vice, the learned theatre or ſpectacle of all the worlde, the councell
houſe of Princes, the trier of all truthes, a witnes of all tymes &amp; ages.
After death a perpetuall memorie of the noble actes of thoſe that here
deſerued fame, a liuely regiſter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common wealthes of al ages, the
worthieſt ſcholemaiſter of manners, the fountayne of all knowledge to
knowe God thorowely and thy ſelfe, a bytte and ſnaffle to the proude &amp;

quiet and ſofte pillowe to ſlepe on, the perfit deſcription of the marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

prouinces, ſo muche delighted in hiſtories, that for a perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of thinges done. He commaunded to be put in a chronicle all thinges
that happened to hym. And alſo that treaſon whiche <hi>Mardocheus</hi> the
Iewe vttered of the kinges cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berlaynes wrought againſt this <hi>Aſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
of the whiche treaſon the king commaunded inquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be made,
the king <hi>Aſueuerus</hi> commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it to be written in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chronicles before
his owne ſighte and the name of him that vttered the treaſon. This
worthy regiſter of fame, being preſerued and kepte. A certayne tyme
this king <hi>Aſueuerus,</hi> (not able to take ſleape in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night ſeaſon, through
his greate cares of mynde) commaunded the Chronicles and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to be brought before hym, and the Chronicles were redde. In that
place of the hiſtories redde to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, <hi>Mardocheus</hi> the Iewe was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
chronicled, who vttered the great treaſon wrought againſt the kyng, by
<hi>Bigthana</hi> &amp; <hi>Theres</hi> the kyngs chamberlaynes, who ſought to haue layd
handes on the kyng, but they were as all traytours deſerued, in lyke
ſorte hanged vppe, but <hi>Mardocheus</hi> who vttered this treaſon, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled
to greate honour. It was a worthye acte of the kynge to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alte
and rewarde the well doer, and to hange vp the traytours diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
ſo miſchieuouſly God and their prince, ſeeking to eſtablyſh their
deueliſhe purpoſe by the ſubuerſion of the prince. Proude <hi>Haman</hi> was
broughte to confuſion, that ſoughte the deathe of manye: who, beinge
aboue all the ſubiectes of the kynge aduaunced, not knowing him ſelfe
fell into the deſtruction that hee prepared for other. <hi>Malum conſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
conſultori peſſimum,</hi> The deuyce and counſell of a wicked man to

not able to take reſte, commaunded the Chronicle to be brought
to him, and to be redde, it ſemeth that Chronicles be pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they put
awaye tediouſnes, they bringe great wyſdome to princes, they geue
knowledge to forſee miſchieues and treaſons, &amp; to ſubuerte the wilye
pollicies of forayne nations. This noble kinge <hi>Aſueuerus</hi> calleth hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
an euerlaſting remembraunce. The actes of wiſe men are a rule
<pb facs="tcp:16261:8"/>
and ſquare for other to direct their councel and doings by. This noble
<hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> ſheweth to all wyſe men the depe knowledge in hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the great profite of them. <hi>Octauius Auguſtus, Alexander</hi> the
great, <hi>Lucius Lucullus, Alexander Seuerus, Ptolomeus Euergetes,</hi> who
were the great princes of the worlde, by learned hiſtories, in floriſhyng
eſtate gouerned, and thereby attayned to great wyſedome. The worthy
<hi>Zenobia</hi> is to be folowed in the great knowledge of hiſtories, and in her
great wyſedome obteined therin. That wyſe Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Henry the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th
was very ſtudious of hiſtories, and that victorious prince <hi>Henry</hi> the
eight, who was a terror to all princes that had any quarel againſt him.
The Emperour Charles the fifte ſovght his amitie, and Fraunces
the Frenche kyng afrayde to diſpleaſe him, he was more valiant then
<hi>Hector,</hi> of more noble courage then <hi>Achilles,</hi> an other <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi>
or rather if he had mynded to enlarge his dominion, an other <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
in wyſedome and graue councell <hi>Salomon.</hi> Theſe noble princes do
ſhewe what it is for princes to be learned, and eſpeciallye for graue
councell and wyſedome in hiſtories. He knoweth nothing that knoweth
not hiſtories, and it is the lyfe of beaſtes to knowe nothing, the more a
man knoweth, the more he excelleth from men &amp; differeth from beaſtes.

            <p>As conſerning the order of my Booke, I do beginne wyth the lyfe of

were not a fewe of couetous and ambitious parſonnes, which
to become riche, and to be exalted vnto honour and dignitye,
denyed their true fayth, in ſuch wiſe, that this was one of the

that hated peace, and eſpecially that <hi>Alaricus</hi> ſhould go vnto

obeyed as Emperour: who after hee had gouerned certaine

                  </note> (reputinge it a thinge very vnſeemelye the father

<pb facs="tcp:16261:152"/>
dignityes &amp; kingdomes vnto theyr ſonnes, it is a thinge that
we haue both redde and harde, and it ſeemeth both honeſt and
reaſonable: but rarely it hath happened, that anye man hath
vnderſtode, that the ſonne hath depriued himſelfe of his owne
ſegniorye, to geue it vnto his father, but rather it hath often
chaunced, that the childe hath by force depriued his father of
his lyuinge: yea and ſondrye times children haue deſyred and
procured theyr fathers deathes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they mighte inherite theyr

miraculous vertue, that there was ſo great loue &amp; obedience
in this ſonne. It happened therfore that <hi>Zeno</hi> was Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſworne Emperour at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and his ſonne
remayned in his former eſtate. The contrary vnto that, was

ioyninge his power with that of <hi>Amalaſuntha,</hi> (which was
the greater) he obtayned without difficultye the kingdome,
and obedience of al men. Notwithſtanding, this counſaile
or aduiſe ſucceded verye vnfortunate vnto <hi>Amalaſuntha,</hi> for
immediatlye after that <hi>Theodate</hi> ſawe himſelfe to be Lord

<pb facs="tcp:16261:159"/>
to conclude an vnitye with <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> &amp; <hi>Theodate,</hi> who
yelded not a little, for that he greatly feared the diſpleaſure
of the Emperour. But while this practiſe was a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge,
<hi>Belliſare</hi> arryued in <hi>Cicilia</hi> with a mightye hoaſt and
huge armye, for that he ſuppoſed it a thinge moſt neceſsarye

conquered the Cittyes <hi>Catanaia, Saragoſa,</hi> and <hi>Palermo,</hi>

therevppon he wrote with his owne hande vnto <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> a

               <p>After the Emperour had heard the firſt petition of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:16261:166"/>
although the Captaine, remayned captiue: whereat (when
he ſawe that he was deluded) he was more greuoſlye vexed
and oppreſſed, then at the former newes. Moreouer the
ſame nighte in which he arryued at <hi>Porto,</hi> whether it were
throughe ire or griefe,<note place="margin">The diſeaſe of Beliſar.</note> or by ſome other priuate occaſion, hee
was aſſaulted with ſo feruent an ague, that ſodeinlye he fell
into a ſound abandoned of all ſence: ſo that it was vnpoſſible
for him to ryſe out of his bedde, or procede in the enterprice of
<hi>Rome,</hi> for the anguiſhe of his diſeaſe did ſo encreaſe, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

               <p>In this meane while, whiche was of many dayes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<hi>Totile</hi> beſieged <hi>Rome</hi> ſo ſtraitlye that they of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
dyed by infinite nombers of famine,<note place="margin">Totile taketh Rome.</note> and did eate dogges,
cattes, &amp; rattes with other things, which may ſeeme vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
And in thende <hi>Totile</hi> wanne &amp; toke the ſame by force,
and ſent Embaſſadours vnto <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> offeringe vnto him
his ſeruice &amp; frendſhip, and that he would reſtore <hi>Rome</hi> vnto
him, ſo that he would graunte him peace: vnto whiche if hee
would not conſent &amp; yelde, be promiſed and proteſted vtterly
to ſubuert it, &amp; to moue againſt him moſt cruell warres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> aunſwered, that he had in Italy his Captayne <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſar,</hi>
&amp; that vnto him he remitted the diſpoſinge of all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres.
<hi>Totile</hi> with this aunſwere became ſo wrathful, that
he determined to deſtroy <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ruine &amp; deſtruction of Rome.</note> which determination (in an

to be burnt, with the better part of the whole Citty, and
ouerthrew the thirde part of the whole Cittye, &amp; ouerthrew
the thirde parte of the waules, commaundinge the Citizens
vpon paine of death to abandon the ſame, &amp; to procure an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
in ſome other place. In this wiſe he left <hi>Rome</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
deſtroyed and deſert. And went againſt <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was
the Captayne,<note place="margin">Totile becom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth Lorde &amp; patrone of many prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> which with the ſouldiours of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

At this preſent <hi>Beliſar</hi> recouered his healthe, and
enterpriſed as worthy an exployte as euer he had attempted.
For he went &amp; placed himſelfe with his ſouldiours in <hi>Rome,</hi>
mynding to repayre and defend the ſame, &amp; ſent his wyfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Yea he vſed ſuch diligente expedition in
the reedifying of the Cittye, that within a very ſhorte ſeaſon
he made a Cittye of a deſert and vnhabited ſoyle. The fame
wherof beinge publiſhed, many cytizens (drawne as it were
with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of the country, as alſo with the true zeale which
they bare vnto <hi>Beliſar</hi>) repayred thyther from all places.</p>
               <p>This being vnderſtode of <hi>Totile,</hi> he returned at a ſodayne by
makinge of great iorneyes vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> which he minded to
take together with the Captayne <hi>Beliſar.</hi> But it was defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſo valiantly, that <hi>Totile</hi> was enforced with great loſſe of
his ſouldiours to depart and rayſe the ſiege.</p>
               <p>In this meane ſeaſon Captaine <hi>Iohn</hi> had in <hi>Calabria</hi> and

whom <hi>Beliſar</hi> placed in theyr Cittye, &amp; hauing made ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
prouiſion &amp; well fortifyed the ſame, he left therein ſundry
gariſons of practiſed ſouldiours for the defence therof, with
a valiant Captayne named <hi>Cannon,</hi> and departed thence to
ioyne wyth <hi>Iohn</hi> and thother Captaynes, mynding to ſeeke
out <hi>Totile,</hi> betwene whom there happened diuers euentes,
which for breuityes ſake I omitte to wryte of.</p>
               <p>At this inſtant for that the king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> renued his war
in the Eaſte, <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was enforced to ſende for <hi>Beliſar,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in thende he wente not vnto that enterpriſe,<note place="margin">Beliſor ſente againe into Italye.</note> for that
there was a peace concluded. Whervpon he was ſent againe
into Italye, where although he obteyned not ſuch good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe

receyued eyther ſhame, reproche, or diſhonour, for hee at no
time declyned in any point, from that which was conuenient
or requiſit vnto a moſt valiant, prudent, &amp; politike Captaine.
And finallye, beinge ſurpriſed with age, hee returned vnto

manifold afflictions of the inhabitantes, as alſo through the
negligence of <hi>Iohn</hi> which made no expedition in ſuccouring
the ſame, &amp; by treaſon of certaine which were corrupted
with giftes, the cruell barbarian wanne it againe. But in
this he did not exerciſe ſuch tyranny as he vſed in the former,
for he permitted no ſpoyle to be done in the Cittye, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
and endeuoured to furniſh it with inhabitantes, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
of great rewardes &amp; large priuileges, vnto all ſuch as
would returne &amp; remayne there. He wan afterwardes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other places, and paſſed into <hi>Cicilia,</hi> in which (for that he
might not lightly or with ſmal trauaile conquere the Iland)
he lefte .iiii. Captaynes with an armye of ſouldiours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into Italye. Of all which within ſhorte ſpace he had

This <hi>Narſete</hi> was in great reputation &amp; authoritye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

whiche at that inſtante inhabited <hi>Hungarye,</hi> with ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye

he poſſeſſed himſelfe of all the Cittyes, &amp; Caſtelles therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

are enclined to loue their Prince, and for this they did the

great proweſſe, and that their name through him woulde be

Vnto whom the French kinge aunſwered, that it diſpleaſed

cauſed the Nauye to lye at Ancar, and certaine ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours

After <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> had vnderſtandinge of the taking of <hi>Golet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>

was concluded betweene them vppon theſe conditions, that
the Emperour ſhoulde geue in marriage vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>

woulde geue the Duchie of <hi>Millen</hi> for a Dowrye: to reſolue
vpon which waighty cauſes, the Emperour requeſted a yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

the maryage ſhoulde be ſolemnized (vnto which the Duchie

At this preſent a great nomber of the Princes of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye

a Cittye appertayninge vnto the Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> for the

accuſtomed vnto the preparation of anye warre, to requeſte

vnto affayres of greater importance, and ſo diſmiſſed them.
The Princes nothinge impaled with themperours condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and Edict pronounced againſt them, continued their
enterpriſe, and gathered to withſtand his violence an Armye
of 80. Thouſand footemen, and of 15. Thouſande horſemen,

ſignifyed that where they vnderſtode his maieſtye, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

they were that they might ſerue him in the ſame warre, and
that if hee prepared his armye againſt them, they nothinge
doubted but that they woulde both iuſtlye and honourablye
aunſweare him. The Emperour aunſwered that hee was
not come into Germanye of his owne accorde, but called by
them, &amp; that he was not minded to moue anye warre againſt
anye, but rather to chaſtice ſuch as ſhoulde ſeeme to diſturbe

ſhoulde paſſe: but theyr deuiſes toke no effect, for whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>Wherefore the Princes perceyuing theyr intentes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

for diuers cauſes the Emperour would not accepte, for as he
