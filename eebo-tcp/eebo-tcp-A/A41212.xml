         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

denying onely the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tradition,
which brings not down any part of

and yields due Authority to it:
the force of it reſting upon common
ſenſe and reaſon (which is in every
man, and which he muſt forſake that
denies the Witnes of ſuch Tradition)
it being not poſſible, that all the
Chriſtian Churches, which began in

agree all of them to deceive thoſe

ſuch <hi>common notion</hi> of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but muſt firſt prove it ſelfe to be
the onely Church, and infallible. And
ſeeing it is forced to ſeek ſuch proofe
by witneſſe of Scripture, they plainly
run in a Circle from the teſtimony of
their Church to the receiving or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49289:9"/>
proving of Scripture to be the Word
of God, and back again from the
Witneſſe of Scripture to prove their
Church; But <hi>Catholick or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal
Tradition</hi> brings down Scripture to
the Conviction of Heathens or Jews,
that will but uſe their common ſenſe
and reaſon: that diſcovery, which
Scripture makes of it ſelfe by light
from the innate qualities, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Arguments relucent in it, comes
after, and appeares to them onely,
that having entertained it upon the

               <p>Firſt, it is a Truth, that the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

freed from the mixture of Errour,
which had crept into the later Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh

as if every Nationall Church
did alwaies teach the ſame Doctrine,

and Acquaintance of the

through the godly care of <hi>Gregory</hi>
the firſt, then Biſhop, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of <hi>Austin</hi> and others, whom he

untruth (which they ſuppoſe, and
uſually impoſe upon the unwary) is
palpable, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Doctrine of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to Faith and
Worſhip, is the ſame it was in <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi>'s
time: and that we, by Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
have caſt off the Faith we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49289:23"/>
received. For firſt, as to the maine
and fundamentall Faith, that makes
a man or Church Chriſtian, no
queſtion but <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and thoſe that
were ſent, preached that they bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into, which is the very ſame that
we do ſtill. Then as for the matters
of Faith and Worſhip, which they
and we differ in, the Novelty is clear:
neither can they demonſtrate, that
any point we caſt off, was a doctrine
of Faith in S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time. Some
things, I confeſſe, of misbelief and
practiſe, were then crept in, and
gathering ſtrength; but it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
that in all their allegations of
Fathers for the points we differ in,
their owne <hi>Gregory</hi> comes rarely in;
indeed, that Purgatory was his
<hi>opinion,</hi> they have expreſſe proof,
not that it was an article of Faith in
that Church. On the contrary, it is
plaine, that <hi>Communion in both
kindes,</hi> was the doctrine and practiſe
of the Church in his time, as it had
been alwaies before: that <hi>Image-worſhip</hi>

the ancient Councils, which provided
therein, had any reſpect to ſuch Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
but to the conſtitution of the
Empire rather, and the Provinces
thereof; and that the alteration,
which has been any where ſince
made in the bounds of National Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
followed the diviſion of
Kingdomes into which the Empire
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49289:25"/>
was broken: which appears in the
ſeverall Councils of <hi>Toledo</hi> (above
mentioned) under their ſeverall
Kings, without dependance on <hi>Rome.</hi>
And if we look into the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Church and Councils (gathered and
publiſhed by the induſtry of Sir <hi>Hen:
Spelman</hi>) it will appear, that all the
Application made unto, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
had with <hi>Rome,</hi> did not ſpeak
a <hi>due ſubjection,</hi> but at moſt a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
adhaeſion;</hi> not acknowledgment
of that <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> but of their <hi>fair
respect,</hi> ſuch as any Church ought to
have to that Church, from which it
received the faith, ſo long as that
Church continues ſafely in the faith
it propagated, and ſo in a condition
of giving adviſe and direction to, and
of receiving due reſpect and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
from thoſe, among whom it
planted the faith.</p>
               <p>But as Errors prevailed in that
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo in this; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reſt, that uſurped Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi>
the 7. about 400. years after <hi>Gregory</hi>
the firſt, did lay on that yoak, and
began to bring the necks of Kings
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49289:26"/>
and Princes under it too: and ſtill by
their power does the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
hold his juriſdiction over the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
within their Dominions, as
<hi>Spain, France,</hi> &amp;c. But ſuch Princes
as came to underſtand their owne
right, not onely in Civil, but Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
things, did juſtly vindicate
their Crowns to the power and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
due unto them, and their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to the Liberty and Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which, as aboveſaid, belongs to
every National Church, having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it the whole Subordination of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical

                  <note place="margin">Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole caſe as it ſtands with the Roman Church.</note>To conclude. Seeing by Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we caſt out, as we had juſt cauſe,
Error and Corruptions crept in upon
the Chriſtian Faith and Worſhip,
and retained what ever was Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
we cannot be accuſed of <hi>Hereſie;</hi>
Seeing alſo by the ſame Reformation
we caſt off the yoak of an uſurped
Juriſdiction, and vindicated this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church to the juſt Liberty, we
cannot incur the guilt of Schiſme:
for that breach of Communion,
which followed either upon our cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to hold and practice with them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49289:26"/>
in the aforeſaid corruptions, or upon
our denying farther obedience to
that uſurped Authority, cannot be
imputed to us, who had juſt cauſe for
doing it, and uſed juſt Authority in
the doing. But if that <hi>breach of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
which followed, be <hi>Schiſme,</hi>
the guilt of it reſts upon the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> in generall, and on all <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Romaniſts</hi> in ſpeciall: according
to the ſeverall conſideration of
Schiſme (above, §. 3.) as it falls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two National Churches, or
between any National Church and
the Members thereof; When between
two National Churches, that Church
ſtands guilty, which gives the cauſe,
and peremptorily proſecutes it: So
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did, by impoſing
(under pretence of Infallibility, and
therefore incorrigible) her own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
pronouncing all thoſe to be
Heretiques that did not receive them,
and by uſurping Univerſal Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
concluding them Schiſmatiques,
that did not obey. But the guilt of
Schiſme lyes upon all Engliſh <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>
holding to that Church, as upon
Members dividing themſelves from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49289:27"/>
the body and communion of their
National Church; and this concerns
not onely thoſe, who have revolted
from this Church to the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> but
ſuch as alwayes profeſſed themſelves
to be of that Church: it falls upon
theſe not for deſertion or ſeparation,
but for <hi>Recuſancie,</hi> or their fefuſing
the communion of their National
Church, and adhering to a forreign
Juriſdiction: which is contrary to
the way and order which the ancient
Church took for preſerving Unity,
and excluding Schiſme: by no means
ſuffering ſuch diſobedience and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Members of any National
Church, where that Church did not
divide it ſelf from the Catholick, or
give cauſe, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
has done.</p>

Thoſe who (of what perſwaſion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)

               <p>By that which has been ſaid, it is
evident, the Reformation made by
this National Church was moſt juſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49289:27"/>
and regular: taking for the <hi>Rule,</hi>
Gods Word, with the conſent and
practice of the Ancient Church, and
thereupon rejecting no more than
was neceſſary, and retaining what
wns uſefull:<note place="margin">Difference 'twixt juſt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> ſhewing therein a due
zeal of Truth, together with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Prudence and Charity: to the
taking away juſt cauſe of Complaint
from all diſtempered Zelots, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fair occaſion of conviction and
allurement to thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
perſwaſion, from whom we differ;
when they ſhall duly conſider, there
was no more Difference made, than
needs muſt: Whereas others, who
have endeavoured Reformation out
of a miſguided zeal, taking for their
<hi>Rule,</hi> an oppoſition to the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> rather than a conformity to
Gods Word, and the Conſent of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Times, have caſt out for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
many things (<hi>Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Set Forms of Liturgy, Kneeling
at the Communion,</hi> and the like)
which were moſt undenyably before
Popery was hatched in the world.
Now theſe being caſt out upon
that ſcore by Heady Reformers, who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49289:28"/>
call themſelves Proteſtants, (Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
indeed againſt many Truths)
the Papiſt takes them up, and thanks
ſuch Reformers for yeelding ſuch
Truth to be Popery; and ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
more confirmed in his way,
and hath more cauſe of offence at
Reformed Proteſtants, were they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to be meaſured by ſuch irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

               <p>The Romaniſts know this well
enough, and are ſenſible of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Reformation or
Eſtabliſhment of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and all other pretenſions:
and therefore have made it alwayes
their main deſign, to undermine this
Proteſtant Church ſo wel eſtabliſhed:
and in theſe dayes, the Emiſſaries of
<hi>Rome</hi> have been very active to help
forward a confuſion, joyning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(if there be truth in that,
which ſo many have reported on
their knowledge) to Sects of ſeverall
Perſwaſions, for the pulling down
what was, and advancing their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reformations. Not that the
<hi>Romaniſt</hi> approves them, but becauſe
he knows, that if the Church of

                  <hi>England,</hi> eſtabliſhed on ſuch ſure
grounds, can by any means be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
the other unbottom'd Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
will fall of themſelves, or
ſtand at no ſtay, to the ſhame of the
Religion they profeſſe; and ſo make
fair way for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, to
come in through their breaches, or
over their ruines, and find more
generall entertainment. It is the
Tempters Policy, and indeed his
Maſter-piece, when he muſt act an
<hi>Angel of Light,</hi> and muſt make his
advantage of thoſe that are come to
ſome ſenſe of Religion, or at leaſt to
a conceit they are religiouſly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
to lead them on by falſe Lights,
and make them over-act their parts
by a miſ-guided zeal, to a quarrelling
with their Governours, and ſlighting
all former Reformations, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Purity and Reformation;
til in purſuit of that purity, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out a more Reformed Aſſembly
or purer Church, they run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
clean out of the Church, and
yet carry it with them.</p>
               <p>Whither they are run, that have left
us, let them look to it. It is our work
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49289:29"/>
now to ſhew (and I wiſh they would
ſadly conſider it) what they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
by leaving us, no leſſe than
the guilt of Schiſme, which lies hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
on as many as have (of what
perſwaſion or Sect ſoever) wilfully
divided themſelves from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
Whether they doe this (as above
premiſed) by a bare Separation, or
by adding Violence and Sacriledge
to it, in pulling down, and (as much
as lies in their power) deſtroying
what was eſtabliſhed, that they may
ſet up their owne forme and way of
Government, and publick Worſhip.
I ſaid <hi>divide themſelves wilfully,</hi> to
leſſen the guilt of thoſe that follow
the Schiſme <hi>in the ſimplicity of their
hearts,</hi> deceived with the faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of Religion and Purity, which
they could not at firſt ſee through;
but if they will not uſe their eyes,
and carefully look into their way:
if they will not uſe the beſt meanes
they can for diſcovering the obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

returne from it, they lye under the

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49289:29"/>

Alſo we muſt note here the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

ſhew the impertinencie of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts

for, as it was above premiſed, the
caſe betweene <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Church, is as between two Nationall
Churches, having full authority for
publick Reformation; but the caſe
between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, and
thoſe that have divided from it, is
between a Nationall Church, and

they could have no ſufficient <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>

               <p>Now for making good the charge
of Schiſme againſt them, we will
premiſe ſome undeniable Truths,
which ſpeak the Authority of Church-governours,
the obedience due
thereunto, the condition of Schiſm,
and the danger and guilt of it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">1. Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>I. That the Church of Chriſt is a
Society or Company under a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Diſcipline. Government, and
the Members conſtituting that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are either Perſons taught, guided,
governed, or Perſons teaching, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
governing: and this in order
to preſerve all in Unity, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
every Member of this viſible
Society, to an effectuall and reall
participation of Grace, and Union
with Chriſt the Head; and therefore,
and upon no leſſe account is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
due unto them: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12,
13, 16. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. and he that
will <hi>not hear the Church,</hi> be <hi>as a
Heathen and Publican,</hi> Mat. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That every Nationall Church
has power,<note place="margin">2. Church Authority in making Decrees &amp; Orders</note> as to determine in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith, according to Gods
word, ſo to determine in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
Rites, Ceremonies, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49289:30"/>
of order, as in prudence it ſees
moſt fit for the better and more
convenient performance of Gods
worſhip, or adminiſtration of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Government. This is plain
by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26, 40.
The Rule above delivered ſpeaks to
this purpoſe, That the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
or determining matters
of Faith, or of the ſubſtance of
Worſhip, ought to manifeſt it out
of Gods Word, cannot doe it <hi>beſides
the ſame,</hi> (as the 20 <hi>Act</hi> of our
Church hath it) and we may expect
ſuch manifeſtation or proof, before
we yeild the abſolute aſſent of belief
unto any thing ſo propounded; But
in the Churches determination of
things in themſelves indifferent, and
enjoyning the obſervation of Rites
and Ceremonies, it is enough that
the particular be not againſt Gods
Word: and he that will not yeild
obedience to it, is bound to ſhew it
plainly contrary to the Word, or
elſe ſtands guilty of diſobeying the
known precepts of the Word, which
command obedience to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:49289:31"/>
I will not be enough to ſay, The
Governours of the Church did not
hold to their Rule, for this Rite or
Ceremony is not to <hi>edification,</hi> is
not <hi>decent;</hi> it might be better other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
For this is to ſet a mans owne
judgement, againſt that of the
Church, in matters of prudence:
a ſpice of that pride and ſelf conceit,
which is the Mother of all diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
&amp; Schiſm; and though a private
judgement might truly ſay, ſome
things might be better done in, and
about Gods Worſhip or Service;
yet unleſſe ſuch a one can ſay as
truly, thoſe things are unlawfull to
be done, and that by direct warrant
from Gods Word, he ought not to
diſobey.</p>

force the <hi>Cuſtomes of a Church</hi> (ſo

have to binde the Members of that
Church, as from Introducing any
New Cuſtome without Authority,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49289:31"/>
ſo to obſerve ſuch Cuſtomes as the
Church hath; and he that will
not, is reckoned by the Apoſtle
there, among the <hi>Contentious,</hi> or
diſturbers of the peace of the
Church; for againſt ſuch he urges
that. Much more are we to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the ſtrength of Univerſall
Tradition, the Cuſtome and Practice
of the whole Church in all Ages:
for of this we ſhall have occaſion

                  <note place="margin">4. Vnion of charity.</note>IV. In the ſame Epiſtle (for it is
mainly ſpent upon this Argument)
he commends <hi>Charity,</hi> as a Remedy
againſt that Pride, which upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit

(<hi>cap.</hi> 12.) pufft: them up, and made
them ſwell one againſt another, and
deſpiſe one another; the ready way
to Diviſion, and breaking all aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
This Charity (not that which
does workes of mercy, or relieves the
poor, as we ſee by <hi>ver. 3. cap.</hi> 13. but
which bindes together the body of
the Church; <hi>Edifying it ſelfe in
Love,</hi> as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. (Charity in
oppoſition to Schiſm) this I ſay he
commends, and by ſeverall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49289:32"/>
diſcribes: <hi>It vanteth not, is not
puffed up,</hi> ver. 4. not againſt Equals,
much leſſe in ſetting our private
judgement againſt our Governors.
<hi>It thinketh no evill,</hi> ver. 5. It receives
ſatisfaction eaſily from Equals, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
their Words and Actions to
the beſt: much more the commands
and doings of our Governours.
<hi>Charity ſeeks not her owne, endureth
all things,</hi> ver. 5, 7. ſuffers much, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than come to open difference

peaceable Charity ſuffer much ere it
come to a diviſion from the Church:
much leſſe will it ſeek that which is
anothers, that eſpecially which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Governours, their
power, meanes, preferments. Thus
Schiſm takes beginning from Pride,
and ſelf-conceit, goes on by uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſſe
to enormous exceſſe of
diſobedience and injuſtice; and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

Church, pretending to it above all
other, and by the forced exerciſes
of it, drawing admiration from the
beholders, and bringing in Proſelites
to their Sect; and it would be worth
the examining, at leaſt in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of theſe Pretenders, whether
<hi>their righteouſneſſe exceeds the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
of the Scribes and Phariſees!</hi>
Our Saviour has alſo foretold, that
falſe Teachers ſhall ariſe in his

but may be known by their

and famous Schiſms of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi>
and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of purity and ſtrictneſſe; <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus</hi>
about the year 250. was ſo
ſtrict, that he denyed reconciliation
to all that after Baptiſme fell into
Adultery, or in times of perſecution
yeilded to Idolatry: and broke with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49289:34"/>
the Church for re-admitting ſuch
upon their unfeigned Repentance. His
followers were called <hi>Cathari</hi> or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans
upon this pretence, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
followers he had; yea, many of
the <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> ſuch as ſuffered for
the Chriſtian Faith, were carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with that falſe pretence, and
ſided awhile with him, till ſeeing
their errour, they returned again to
the Unity of the Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
his Schiſm, as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>
relates it to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Ep. 46. <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
in the next age after him, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
becauſe he could not be made
Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> divided himſelf
and his party from the Communion
of the Church: deſpiſing it as a
mixed company of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> and
rebaptizing all that revolted from
the Church to his Communion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
the true Church onely to thoſe
of his perſwaſion: for under that
pretence of Purity, he drew many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and it proved a Schiſm of great
extent, and long continuance.</p>
               <p>If therefore this be one Reaſon
wherefore our pretenders cannot,
as they conceive, have that Purity,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49289:35"/>
or partake of the Ordinances as they
ought, becauſe of Carnall Chriſtians
ſuffered in the Communion of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and unworthy
receivers admitted to the Sacrament:
it was long agoe refuted by S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
in his learned workes againſt the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi>
demonſtrating by ſeverall
places of Scripture, which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and by ſeverall parables of our
Saviour, which repreſent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Church on Earth, to be
ſuch for mixture, as a heap of Chaff
and Wheat in the ſame <hi>Floor,</hi> of good
Fiſh and bad in the ſame <hi>Net,</hi> of
Corne and Tares in the ſame <hi>Field,</hi>
and that neither the unworthineſſe
of the Miniſter, or of other Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
makes Gods Ordinance ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall,
or pollutes him that comes
in Charity, and with a Conſcience
undefiled, or cleanſed from ſelfe-pollutions.
It is in the power and
belongs to the duty of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
to caſt out the ſcandalous,
or ſuch <hi>as walk diſorderly:</hi> but
when that is done, it is not for any
man to judge, he or ſhe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and unſanctified; for this is to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49289:35"/>
                  <hi>take the Lords Fan out of hand,</hi> with
which <hi>he will purge his Floor,</hi> Mat. 3.
and by breach of charity to offend

not done, but that diſorderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are yet ſuffered, and come to
the place of Worſhip, yea, to the

the Governors that are to ſee to it,
the Ordinance is not leſſe effectuall
to thee, if by ſelf-conceit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſſe
thou render not thy

               <p>In the next place, I would know,
what hinderance or prohibition of
purity, or ſtrict life, had they in the
Communion of this Church? Did
the Governors thereof forbid any
thing which St. <hi>James</hi> requires to
pure Religion (c. 1. ult.) <hi>to keepe
themſelves unſpotted of the World,</hi> by
<hi>Covetouſneſſe, Selfe-ſeeking, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49289:36"/>
Drunkenneſſe, Luſts of the fleſh,</hi>
the common ſpots of the World?
Or did they forbid <hi>to viſit the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe
and Widdow in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
or any works of Charity? Might
they not have done all theſe with
praiſe and commendation, had they
continued in the Communion of this
Church? And for theſe other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
of Devotion, <hi>Prayer, Reading,
Hearing,</hi> (which though belonging
to pure Religion, S. <hi>James</hi> thought
good to omit; we ſhall ſee the
reaſon of it preſently) might they
not be had duly, frequently? Was
there any thing forbid but the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
uſe, or ſeditious abuſe of them?
Private Meetings or Conventicles,
which were preparatories to Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Schiſm, in a performance of
thoſe Duties, to the <hi>deſpiſing of the
Church,</hi> or publique Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>But they will ſay, they could not
have theſe exerciſes in publique
purely adminiſtred or performed:
that is (as it will appeare below) not
according to their own deviſing and

every Chriſtian ſhould have a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49289:36"/>
care of performing theſe duties of
<hi>Prayer, Reading, Hearing:</hi> but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Pretenders to Purity ſeeme
to place the ſumme of Religion in
theſe eſpecially, I would wiſh them
to examine the purity of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by the Apoſtles trial of it, <hi>Jam.
1. ult.</hi> who thought good to omit
the mention of theſe exerciſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſeeking the
eſteem of holineſſe by ſuch perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
&amp; becauſe of Chriſtians then
(as now in our Times) reſting too
much on a fanſy of their faith &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of ſuch Exerciſes without
works and deeds anſwerable. And
therefore the Apoſtle deſcribed <hi>pure
Religion,</hi> by ſuch duties (of Charity, &amp;
abſteining from all ſpots of the world
or works of the Fleſh) as make better
proof of the ſincerity of Religion.</p>
               <p>If the making of <hi>Fatherleſſe</hi> and
<hi>Widdowes,</hi> the turning men out of
their Eſtates, the invading of other
mens Rights, had by the Apoſtle
been made the trial of <hi>pure Religion,</hi>
then might the <hi>Contentious</hi> of our
dayes have pretended to Purity and
Religion; and have <hi>bleſſed the Lord
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49289:37"/>
that they were become rich,</hi> though
with the ſpoiling of others, as they
did, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 5. but if Charity, and
denying of worldlineſſe, and luſts, be
the marks, then let them try whether
their way of Religion bring forth
ſuch fruits, or be in a capacity to do
it: When the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> alledge the
many pious and charitable works (as
building of Churches, Colledges,
Hoſpitals, Schools, and the applying
maintenance thereunto) done by
men in their Religion; our preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to Purity will be ready to ſay,
it was the Doctrine of Merit that
did it; not reflecting upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to conſider what kind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
theirs is, which pulls downe
the Monuments of Piety and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and converts the publique to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
uſe. But when we ſhew that
ſince the Reformation (which caſt
out <hi>Popiſh merit</hi>) as many good
works (for the computation has
been made) done in the like kinde,
as have been done in any one Age
before: we ſhew the fruits of our
Religion, and challenge theirs, which
onely can ſhew (for their way and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49289:37"/>
doctrines tend to no other iſſue) a
diſtempered zeal in deſtroying much
of that which before was raiſed to
pious uſes, and a ſelf-ſeeking in the
enriching themſelves by the ſpoiles.
<hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi> the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and noted <hi>ſpots of the World,</hi> are
(as it is fit) very much declined in
their way of purity; but the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee</hi>
could ſay more, he was no <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner,</hi>
no <hi>Adulterer;</hi> and Saint
<hi>James</hi> implied many other ſpots of
the World, which <hi>pure Religion</hi> muſt
keep a man from: and S. <hi>John,</hi> 1. Ep.
c. 2. 16. reducing the <hi>things of the
world,</hi> to three heads, makes two of
them the <hi>lust of the Eye,</hi> and <hi>pride
of Life,</hi> and therefore tells us, that
Coveting, Injuſtice, Sacriledge, and
the <hi>Pride</hi> of life, that either cauſes
them, or is maintained by them, are
the Exorbitant Iniquities of the
world, and therefore <hi>Spots,</hi> which
by S. <hi>James</hi> his rule, will not conſiſt
with <hi>pure Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been the longer upon this
Argument, becauſe there is ſcarce
any other thing by which the Devil
hath gained more, or the Church
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49289:38"/>
loſt more, than by this <hi>pretence of
Purity,</hi> the common plea of all Sects
in all Times.</p>
               <p>Now, as to their Reply above,
that they could not have thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

               <p>Firſt, the practiſe of the whole

Into this Iſland the Chriſtian faith

               <p>We refuſe not to meet them there:

ſhew thoſe paſſages in Scripture
were intimations of this practiſe
then beginning, and that their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of the Seventh day, or Jewiſh

the Univerſall practice of the

ſurvey of the Grounds on both ſides,
which yet I cannot in reaſon enter
upon, without asking leave to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it poſſible (which never was
ſeen in any particular) that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall

unto Scripture: but yeilding
that, as poſſible, to the Adverſaries,
it is cleare they are bound as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
to demonſtrate this Practiſe or
Government, is againſt Scripture,
and that their way is peremptorily
there preſcribed. How impoſſible
it is for them to do this, appeares at
firſt ſight, by their ſeverall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the paſſages of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
concerning Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Some of them look upon theſe
paſſages, and think they ſee a <hi>Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall,</hi>
or <hi>Preſbyterian;</hi> others of
them look upon them, and are as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49289:42"/>
ſtrongly perſwaded they ſee a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall,</hi>
or <hi>Independent</hi> way.
Where's the clear Evidence then,
which they pretend againſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Government? To examine
their chiefe Inſtances briefly and
plainly, for the ſatisfaction of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Capacities, make the triall of
thoſe that are alledged for the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall
way: becauſe that pretends to
more regularity, and to a better
foundation than the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Presbytery</note>Their Inſtances are from the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made in Scripture, of <hi>Preſbytery</hi>
and <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> and the

read, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 14. the laying on of
the hands of the Preſbytery:</hi> But
what evidence is there in this to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
that the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

for ſome other purpoſe; <hi>Secondly,</hi>

whether the word <hi>Preſbytery</hi> here,

are admitted: Thirdly, admit the

Tit. 1. 5. 8. Acts</hi> 20. 17. 28. If
we ſay, that in theſe and the like
places, thoſe firſt Elders ſet in the
Churches, newly planted, were <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
properly; or that the Elders or
Biſhops there mentioned, were of
both ſorts, ſome Biſhops properly,
ſome inferiour Presbyters, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49289:43"/>
could diſprove neither part
evidently: or if in the third place,
we ſhould grant them what they
aime at, that theſe were onely Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
it would be nothing to the
purpoſe, unleſſe they could directly
ſhew the power of Ordination and
Government over thoſe Churches
fully committed to them. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
thoſe Elders to be ſuch Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
the name <hi>Biſhop</hi> might be
appliable to any of them, in as
much as he had over-ſight of any
flock: which Name was appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after to the more Generall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
who had overſight of the
Presbyters, and particular Flocks, or
Congregations within ſuch Precincts.
And what marvail is it, if the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of theſe two ſorts of Elders or
Biſhops, did not, nay could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
ſo clearly in the beginning of
the new planted Churches, and
whilſt the Apoſtles were on earth
governing the Churches, as it did
after the Churches were enlarged,
and the Apoſtles gone off? Then
clearly appeared, who ſucceeded
them, and how far in that ordinary
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49289:43"/>
power which was to continue in the
Church. For our Saviour left his
Apoſtles with full power (extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and ordinary) for the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and propagating his Church
through the World. The ordinary
power they were to leave unto
others after them, for continuing of
his Church to the Worlds end, <hi>viz</hi> the
power of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> in the Miniſtry
of the Word &amp; Sacraments, the power
of <hi>ordaining</hi> and ſending others, and
the power of <hi>juriſdicton</hi> and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>How, and into what hands
they communicated theſe ſeverall
powers,</hi> That's the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the firſt Elders ſet in the Church by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note>Some of the <hi>Ancients</hi> apprehend
it thus, That they committed the
whole power to thoſe firſt Elders
they placed in every City where the
Church was planted, ſo that thoſe
firſt Elders were properly <hi>Biſhops,</hi>
having power to ordain other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and Labourers, as the encreaſe
or extent of the Church required.
Other <hi>Fathers,</hi> or ancient Writers,
ſeem to apprehend thoſe firſt Elders
to be meer Presbyters, to whom the
whole power was not committed;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49289:44"/>
but that afterwards upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of the Church, other ſpeciall
Men were intruſted with it to ordain
others, as need required, and as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Paſtors to rule and over-ſee
the whole Church, with all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Congregations and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or inferiour Paſtors belonging
to it. Either way is ſufficient for
eſtabliſhing the Epiſcopall power
and government, and the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
thereof, as they cannot diſprove
it, if we ſay thoſe firſt Elders were
Biſhops properly; ſo neither will
they gain any thing, if we grant
them in courteſy thus much, that the
firſt Elders were meer Presbyters.
For ſee briefly what they can ſay
againſt the firſt, or draw from the
ſecond.</p>
               <p>Againſt the firſt they uſually ſay,
1. If thoſe Biſhops at <hi>Philippi</hi> were
ſo properly, then were there more
than one Biſhop in one City or
Church: Anſw. This indeed was
abſurd and inconvenient, and never
ſuffered in the Church inlarged and
eſtabliſhed, but in the Church <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent</hi>
or beginning it might be very
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49289:44"/>
reaſonable by way of proviſion for
the future enlargement &amp; eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Church. So we find 12.
Apoſtles left in the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
by our Saviour, in order to
their propagating and governing the
Church through the whole World:
And ſo in ſome great Cities, where
and from which the Goſpel might
ſuddenly ſpread it ſelf, the Apoſtles
might proviſionally leave more than
One Elder veſted with power for the
ſupply of the Church enlarged.
Secondly, If the Elders or Biſhops
mentioned in thoſe places, were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
properly, veſted with ſuch
power, then would the Apoſtle alſo
have remembred the other ſort of
Elders between them and Deacons.
Anſw. But what if there were not
yet in that Church Elders or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the ſecond ſort? For no
Church at firſt was full. Or if there
were ſuch in that Church, why might
he not ſalute both ſorts under that
general name, <hi>Biſhop?</hi> Thirdly: But
then the Apoſtle did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
ſet down the Office of the
one or the other, for having ſet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49289:45"/>
down the office of a Biſhop, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
goes to the Deacon, 1 <hi>Tim. 3.
Tit.</hi> 1. 5. Anſw. It was not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
purpoſe in thoſe places, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſet down the Office of Elders,
nor of Deacons, but the general
qualification of the Perſons to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to thoſe Offices. We may
ask of them, Where has the Apoſtle
diſtinctly ſet down, or deſcribed the
Office of a Lady-Elder? They are
fain to force it out of one word <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(1 Tim.</hi> 4. 17.) which belongs
to the Preaching Elders, as they well
acknowledge. In the places above
mentioned, the Apoſtle gives, as I
ſaid, qualifications fitting the Perſons
of both ſorts of Elders (that then
were, or ſhould be, in the Church)
for the duties there hinted, <hi>teaching,
ruling,</hi> do belong to both ſorts of
Elders, but with Subordination of
the one to the other. And if they
will have the word <hi>rule (1 Tim.</hi> 4.
17.) inſinuate a diſtinct Office of
Elders from the preaching Elders,
without any intimation of ſuch an
Office any where elſe in Scripture,
why might not we ſay with more
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49289:45"/>
reaſon, that the ſame word in the
forementioned place (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.)
belongs to Biſhops of both ſorts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their order and ſtation,
to <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>take care of the Church of
God?</hi> Eſpecially ſeeing we ſhew
elſewhere in the ſame Epiſtle, ſuch a
Prelacy or ſupereminent power of
rule given to <hi>Timothy</hi> diſtinctly from
other Elders: as <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly
on no man, Rebuke not an Elder—receive
no accuſation againſt an Elder,</hi>
&amp;c. cap. 5. v. 19. 22. Like ſpeciall
power given to <hi>Titus,</hi> as we ſee in that
<hi>Epistle,</hi> beſides all the acts of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
power exerciſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and not communicated in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to Presbyters. And ſo the
exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.
28. might generally fit both ſorts of
Elders or Biſhops (ſuppoſing thoſe
of the inferiour rank preſent there)
that they ſhould all of them <hi>feed the
Flock</hi> according to their ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and in that ſubordination of
Rule which was in the Church.</p>
               <p>But if we grant them, that thoſe
Elders or Biſhops in the above cited
places were not Biſhops properly,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49289:46"/>
but ordinary presbyters:<note place="margin">No exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Scripture for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries pretenſion.</note> What can
they draw from thence advantagious
either to the <hi>Claſsicall</hi> or <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>
pretenſion, when as there is no
inſtance in all Scripture of the Power
veſted in a Claſſis or conſiſtory of
Presbyters, or in every particular
Congregation: but on the contrary
where ever there is mention of the
exerciſing of the power (for <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
by laying on hands, or for <hi>Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
in <hi>rebuking</hi> or <hi>receiving accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
againſt an <hi>Elder</hi> in <hi>rejecting Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks</hi>
or the like) we find it always done
by the Apoſtles, or ſpeciall men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thereunto, as <hi>Timothy, Titus.</hi>
Nor is it to any purpoſe to reply (as
they doe) Theſe were extraordinary
men, Apoſtles or Evangeliſts, and
ſo exerciſed that power as ſuch: For
albeit in the office of Apoſtle and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt
there was ſomething extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
and ſuppoſing <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp;
<hi>Titus</hi> may paſſe under the Title of
Evangeliſts, yet the power (of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Juriſdiction) was ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and to continue in the Church,
and to be communicated unto others
as was moſt convenient: What help
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49289:46"/>
therefore can the Adverſaries have
in the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts being
extraordinary perſons, unleſſe they
can ſhew the power did ordinarily
belong to, and was exerciſed by the
company of Presbyters: or elſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
it was left in their hands
by expreſſe and peremptory order
from the Apoſtles. So that here they
would be non-ſuited, laying their
plea only by Scripture againſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Tradition, and practice of the
Church: for the Scripture ſtory
goes not downe to the departure of
the Apoſtles: Now after they were
gone off, it clearly appeared by the
practice of the whole Church in
what hands the chief power and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was left, <hi>viz.</hi> not to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
in common, but in ſpeciall
hands, according to the inſtances and
examples of the exerciſing that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the Apoſtles Time. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Records alſo which continue the
Church ſtory from that Time, give
us the ſucceſsion of Biſhops from the
Apoſtles in the more eminent Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Rome,
Epheſus, Corinth,</hi> and this practice
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49289:47"/>
and ſucceſsion ſetled before St. <hi>John</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to Epiſcopall not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</note>All which, as it clearly ſhewes
thoſe ſeverall <hi>Angels</hi> of the ſeverall
Churches, to whom our Saviour by
Saint <hi>John</hi> did write, could be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then ſuch Biſhops, having chief
care of and rule in thoſe Churches,
&amp; therfore more chargeable with the
Corruptions prevailing in them: So
doth it clearly convince that plea of
the Adverſaries, which amounts to a
charging the firſt Biſhops with Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
and invaſion upon the right
of Presbyters, or particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
to be a conceit altogether
unreaſonable; for it is beyond all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
that Saint <hi>John</hi> would
have ſuffered ſuch an invaſion, or
that thoſe firſt Biſhops, who conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the Apoſtles and were their
diſciples, ſhould make ſuch an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and immediately ſubvert the
Apoſtolicall order pretended for the
Presbyterian Conſiſtory: Or that
thoſe firſt Biſhops, being holy men,
and many of them <hi>Martyrs</hi> (for ſtill
we finde the heathen Perſecutors
ſought chiefly after the Biſhop of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49289:47"/>
the Church, that the chief Paſtor
being ſmitten the flock might be
more eaſily ſcattered) ſhould be ſo
ambitious and unjuſt; or laſtly, that
the Presbyters then ſhould be ſo
tame, as not once to complain of the
wrong done them, or to tranſmit
their Proteſtation againſt it to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Tryal by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
It comes to this iſſue: The
Adverſaries were bound to ſhew di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Authority of Scripture againſt
Epiſcopal Government, it being in
poſſeſſion, eſtabliſhed by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Authority of this Nationall
Church, and which is more, by the
perpetuall practice of the Catholick
Church; againſt this it was expected
they ſhould bring ſome places of
Scripture, forbidding that power of
Ordination and Juriſdiction to be
committed to ſpeciall hands, ſuch as
Biſhops properly taken: or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it to the Conſiſtory of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or ſome inſtances at leaſt of that
power exerciſed by ſuch a company:
Whereas all they can evince out of
Scripture, is, that there were Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49289:48"/>
(ſtrictly ſo taken, and of the
inferiour rank) which being granted
them, we ſhew there was a Prelacy
ſtill over ſuch Presbyters; ſtill there
were ſpecial men, that had an inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and rule over them; and
when the Apoſtles went off, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of the Church ſhewes the
power was left in the hands of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
men, called Biſhops properly:
So that the Government of the
Church by Biſhops, appears (as was
ſaid above) conformable, not onely
to the Univerſal practiſe of the
Church, after the Apoſtles time, but
alſo to the Word of God, <hi>i.e.</hi> to the
practiſe and patterns we have there,
1. of our Saviour appointing twelve
Apoſtles, and beſides, and under
them ſeventy Diſciples of a lower
rank; 2. of Apoſtolical practiſe, by
which we find the power exerciſed
by ſpecial Elders, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apoſtles
themſelves, or other choice men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thereunto by them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all Elders had power of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the Word and Sacraments:

               <p>Laſtly, The Government of the
Church, by Biſhops, was ſaid above
to be moſt agreeable to the reaſon
of Church-government, for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Unity, and excluding Schiſm.
This is very obvious in the writings
of the Fathers: St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had
much to do with the <hi>Novatian</hi> Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
of his time, which cauſed
him to write many Epiſtles upon
that occaſion, and a Book intituled
<hi>De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitate Eccleſiae;</hi> wherein he
ſhewes the Unity of the Church, as
to the preventing of Schiſme, ſtands
much upon this, that there be <hi>one
Biſhop in one Church.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
(whom they of the Presbyterian
perſwaſion take for their beſt friend,
becauſe he ſtrives to advance the
Order of Presbyters as much as he
can, yet) as he denies the power of
Ordination belongs to Presbyters,
ſo he acknowledges, that Biſhops
were appointed over Presbyters to
keep out Faction and Schiſm; that
the people ſhould not ſay, as they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49289:49"/>
did at <hi>Corinth, I am of Paul, I of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos</hi>
— I of this Teacher, I of that.
And for his ſaying of Presbyters,
that they did anciently <hi>communi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilio,</hi>
with joint advice rule the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
is not to be underſtood <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivè</hi>
to the Biſhop, for ſuch a time
was never known in the Church, but
joyntly with him as his Council: ſo
were the <hi>Preſbyteri Civitatis</hi> to the
Biſhop; and their advice was more
uſed (and there was more cauſe for
it) before the many Canons and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of Councils gave rule in moſt
particulars what the Biſhop ſhould
do: as it was by that time S. <hi>Jerom</hi>
wrote: and whatever he ſaith for
the advancing of the order of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
it is but to ſet them above all
Deacons (even thoſe that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
attended on the Biſhop, and, it
ſeems, carried themſelves too high)
it is not to equal them to Biſhops,
whoſe Prelacy St. <hi>Jerome</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
and thought it very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for this purpoſe of keeping out
Schiſm, which the Parity of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
would expoſe it to.</p>
               <p>And I would appeale to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49289:49"/>
of any of that perſwaſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were not more convenient
and neceſſary for keeping all in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to have one aged, grave, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and experienced in the way of
the Church, to be the ſtanding Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
of the Claſſis or company
of Presbyters, than to change their
Moderator year by year, and leave
the place open to every young un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd
Presbyter, that can make
a faction to advance him unto it: I
have heard this inconvenience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
on by ſome of the new ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Claſſes: whereas a Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a Moderator as is fixed, and
above all competition, is more ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to keep all ordinary Presbyters
in their ſtation, and within their
bounds. And then again, I would
demand, whether the Apoſtles, who
complained of Diviſions, as in the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and of falſe
Teachers there and elſwhere, were
not careful to provide the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Expedient in government
againſt them? It cannot be denyed;
and upon this ſcore, and to this very
end of preſerving Schiſm, it cannot
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49289:50"/>
be thought otherwiſe, but that the
Apoſtles gave beginning to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
throughout the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Notwithſtanding thoſe of the
Claſſicall perſwaſion, bear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
much upon Mr. <hi>Blondels</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections:
whoſe pains might have
been better implyed to the uſe of the
Church upon ſome other Argument.
For in this it is impoſſible to drive
out of Antiquity (though ranſaked
over again) any more to the purpoſe
of the Presbyterian claim, than has
been already acknowledged, and the
weakneſs of it diſcovered, <hi>viz.</hi> That
it ſeems to be the judgement of ſome
Fathers, that the name <hi>Biſhop</hi> was at
firſt common to all <hi>Elders,</hi> and that
thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> mentioned <hi>Phil. 1. 1.
1 Tim. 3. Tit.</hi> 1. were Presbyters, or
Elders of the ſecond rank. But what
advantage is this to the cauſe they
would eſtabliſh, without proving
alſo, that the power of Ordination
and Government (which we appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
to <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſtrictly taken) was
communicated to Presbyters in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?
To the witneſſing of this, it is
not poſſible to force Antiquity, no
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49289:50"/>
not S. <hi>Jerome</hi> alone. All that ſeems
to ſpeak any thing that way, amounts
but to this: that they were uſed in
the Government, and things done
with their adviſe and counſel; &amp; that
they were more uſed in Ages before
St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> than in his time; and
there was ſome reaſon for it (as I
ſaid) becauſe by that time proviſion
was made in moſt Caſes by the many
Canons and Conſtitutions of the
Church.</p>

there being a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Wanting</hi> or <hi>not having</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and <hi>caſting them</hi> out when

other Reformed Churches; for firſt
they muſt anſwer for the <hi>Schiſm</hi> in
forſaking the Communion of this
Church; and as their Caſe is not the
ſame with that of the Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
ſo cannot thoſe Churches
juſtly receive them, having broken
the Communion of this. Therefore
was it ſo carefully provided for in
many Councils of the Ancient
Church, that none ſhould travail to

any forreign Church without his
<hi>Communicatory letters</hi> to teſtifie his

to Communion in the Other.
And this to preſerve Unity. And

of them that uſe them: See we how
Reaſon evinces the <hi>lawfulneſſe</hi> and
<hi>expediency</hi> of them in publique, and
therein commends the prudence of
the Church in appointing them.
1. As the <hi>matter</hi> or things prayed
for, and the <hi>intention</hi> of the ſpirit or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49289:57"/>
affection, with which they are pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for, is of the ſubſtance of Prayer:
ſo the utterance or words are but
externall to it, and therefore Prayer
without words, is Prayer truly;
Now let the matter of our Prayer
be according to Gods will, and the
Spirit and affection ſuitable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and accompanying our Petitions,
it is indifferent whether the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
be in our own words, or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed;
whether in Forms before
compoſed, or upon the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Let a man prepare his heart
afore-hand ſuitable to the Forms and
generall Requeſts, that he knows are
made in publique, and God, who is
not taken with words or varying of
the phraſe, will hear him, as he did
the penitent Son, who thought and
reſolved before-hand what to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,</hi>
what to <hi>beg, I will go</hi>—and
<hi>ſay—Luke</hi> 15. 18. and accordingly
he ſaid when he came into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
preſence. And as our Saviour
prayed thrice, <hi>ſaying the ſame words,
Mat.</hi> 26. 44. ſo let the ſame affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and deſires of the heart return,
or be preſent, they may again be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49289:57"/>
in the ſame form of words:
And if the forms of the publique
Service do contein (as we ſaid above
they do in generall) all the requeſts
fitting to be made, then may they
ſtill be uſed for the expreſſing ſuch
requeſts and deſires.</p>
               <p>Here, that they may ſeem to ſay
ſomething rather than nothing, they
reply; That prayer of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Son, though ſet and before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
was his own, and ſo was that
prayer of our Saviour, though ſet,
and in the ſame words repeated; but
the ſet Forms of the Church are not
his prayers that miniſters in the
Congregation. If he would utter
his own prayers, though ſet and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prepared, they would joyn
with him; for then they conceive he
prayes, what the Lord has put into
his minde, whether upon former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation,
or preſent conception.
Theſe ſeem to be the moſt reaſonable
of all thoſe that are againſt the ſet
Forms of the Church: for they ſee
Reaſon to allow the people to pray
in ſet Forms of other mens making,
and the Miniſter to pray in ſet Forms
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49289:58"/>
of his own, but not anothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing.
Now if they would well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
this, they would ſee little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
upon ſuch a difference to quarrel
with Authority, and abſtein from
the publick Worſhip of God in his
Church: For no ground in Scripture
can they have of ſuch a diſtinction,
much leſſe warrant upon ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
difference to abſtein from
Church Communion. Alſo by this
reaſon the Miniſter ſhould not uſe
the Lords prayer, becauſe not of his
own compoſing. Again, this is to
place the ſubſtance and effect of
prayer in Frame of Words, rather
than in matter or things prayed for,
and the ſuitable affections of the
heart: both which may be found
right in uſing Forms compoſed by
others. For the matter of the Church
Forms it is plain, there is nothing
but according to the will of God, and
if he that uſes them prepare his heart
with ſuitable affections, God requires
no more. The prophet bids, <hi>Take
words with yow—and ſay, Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 2. If then
the heart be prepared with ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49289:58"/>
and deſires as are fitting for
Confeſſion and petition, is it ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
whence <hi>we take the words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuggeſted to us by others, as it is
there, or invented by our ſelves? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if the people can better underſtand
the things prayed for, and better
prepare their hearts with ſuitable
affections, when the ſet Forms of the
Church are uſed, than they can when
they hear the Miniſters Prayer:
(which they can, by reaſon Thoſe
Forms contein all neceſſary requeſts,
better than any one mans prayer can
probably do; and becauſe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
prayers being neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in generals, the people ought
ſtill, from thoſe general Confeſſions
or Petitions, to reflect upon their
own particular Sinnes, Infirmities,
Wants and Deſires) it is therefore
moſt reaſonable the people have the
Publique prayers in the Set forms,
with which they are beſt acquainted,

as miniſter in this Nationall Church,
and are to be the Mouth of the

ſome may do it diſcreetly, yet would
many inconveniences follow through
the different performance of others.
1. Want of Uniformity in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Worſhip of the ſame Church.
2. Defect often in not putting up all
the requeſts, which are fitting to be
made, not doing all that is fit to be
done at publique meetings to the
glory and worſhip of God. 3. Many
Impertinencies, Tautologies in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
ſometimes unfitneſs, and
unlawfulneſs of that which is ſpoken,
ſuch as the Congregation cannot
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49289:59"/>
ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to. A difference there is
betwixt Liberty in this performance
of publique worſhip, and of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;
for the Worſhip and Prayers
are preſented immediately to God
himſelf; but preaching, though it
treats of things pertaining to God,
yet ſpeaks to the people: To the
Prayers of the Church, the whole
Congregation is to ſay <hi>Amen:</hi> but
that which is delivered in preaching,
falls under trial and examination,
whether it be ſo: For providing and
delivering a Sermon to the people,
they have liberty of time as they
pleaſe, &amp; of uſing what means &amp; help
they pleaſe: but as for the putting up
the prayers of the Congregation,
whereſoever there is a deſpiſing of
ſet Forms, and an expectation of
private Conceptions from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
there the former inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will often be run into by ſome,
through ſelf-conceit of Gifts, and
Pride of ſhewing them in variety of

the ſame Chapter, or at leaſt every

ſome now plead for the Liberty) to
the edification of the Church: but
many of thoſe who are againſt Set

too, thinking it fit (as indeed it is)
that none ſhould uſe their gifts pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,
but ſuch as are called, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and ordained to it by the
Church; and if ſo, then alſo ſhould
they think it ſit, that thoſe, who are
ſo allowed, as publique Miniſters in
the Congregation, ſhould uſe their
gifts ſo, and in ſuch a way, as the
ſame Church ſees ſit and allowes:
for if theſe will plead liberty of
uſing their ſpirituall Gifts againſt
the Conſtitution of the Church, and
that by this 14. chapter to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
then may the other with
as good Reaſon plead Liberty
for all gifted men; for all that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49289:61"/>
had ſuch gifts (as here the Apoſtle
ſpeaks of, and ſeeks to order) might
have their turn of ſpeaking and uſing
them.</p>
               <p>But they are both out of the way,
and inconſequent in their reaſoning
from this Chapter, not diſtinguiſhing
Times and Gifts, nor acknowledging
duly the Authority of the Church;
and therefore under pretence of
ſuch Gifts, pleading for Liberty of
uſing them, that is, as it often proves
of venting what they pleaſe in the
Congregation; whereas they ought
in all humility, to expect the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
approbation of their Gifts, and
then know they muſt uſe them with
ſubmiſſion ſtill to the Church, in
ſuch a way as is thought moſt fit for
preventing the above-mentioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
for preſerving <hi>Order</hi>

               <p>But ſee whether this Pride of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

a Set form, and to a neglecting
the uſe of it altogether as far below

ſelf, as needing not to pray at all.
Such I have met with, miſerably cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelves off, not onely from
the comfort of the prayers of
Chriſts Church on Earth, but from
the benefit of his interceſſion in
Heaven, and evacuating (as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
the eternal Prieſthood of
Chriſt: for if they need not pray, they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49289:62"/>
need not confeſſe, nor ask forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
nor beg Grace or any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
help, and ſo need not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion
of Chriſt for obteining
ſuch mercies; for his being our
<hi>Advocate 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 1. ſuppoſeth our

<hi>our coming to the Throne of Grace,
Heb.</hi> 4. 16. or <hi>our coming to God by
him, Hebr.</hi> 7. 25. And as for thoſe
that ſo much prize the prayers
of their owne conception to an
undervaluing of that, which the
Lord framed and taught us; let
them conſider how little they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his Interceſsion, when they
come by him to put up their owne
prayers, deſpiſing or wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
his But we knowing the
perfection of that prayer, which
conteins all things fitting to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
doe often uſe it in the publick
prayers of the Church, and alwayes
with our own, that if any thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
be through our imperfection O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in our own, it may be ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the uſe of that, and knowing
that Chriſt is ready to hear &amp; receive
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49289:62"/>
the requeſts of every humble ſpirit,
which is carefull to doe, and make
uſe of what he has taught us, We
therefore delight to expreſſe, or to
ſum up our deſires often in his form
of words; for as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his

us, Chriſt when we beg his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion

But in the Rites and Ceremonies
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> they
finde <hi>Superſtition;</hi> and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſuch Rites and Ceremonies
were derived from, and abuſed in
Popery unto Superſtition. They were
uſed indeed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
(and abuſed too) but derived from
the Ancient Church, and uſed by it
to good purpoſe before Popery crept
in. Nor is it a good Rule of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to caſt out whatever has
been abuſed by Popery; we need
not do it to the very ſame individual
things which have been ſo abuſed,
(excepting Images (as the <hi>Brazen

uſed to Superſtition) for the ſame
individuall Churches ſtand, which I
ſuppoſe they hold, were abuſed in
time of Popery; much leſſe are we

onely <hi>in specie,</hi> in their kind, the
individuall act or performance of
them under that abuſe being tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

to Chriſtian prudence &amp; chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

not making moe differences than

<hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaid well in

               </p>
               <p>As for example, that women ſhould

they had it then for each other.
So <hi>the putting off the Old man,</hi> ſo oft

duty: and it was repreſented in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,
by their putting of Old

God, becauſe the Prayers are in Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms,
by their not comming to the

Kneeling; by withholding their

and the like, they make themſelves

and fall into that ſuperſtition, which
is called Negative: For they place
Religion in not doing theſe, account
themſelves therfore godly and pure,
and make ſuch abhorring or abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from theſe, a mark of their
Religion or Sect: And then, that
may better underſtand themſelves in
the point of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> they ought to
put a difference between the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
and the <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> of
Worſhip.<note place="margin">Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantialls of VVor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> The Subſtance of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſtands (as ſaid above) in a due

the due object; and this is of Gods

Again, Worſhip is determined <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively</hi>
to ſuch or ſuch a thing or

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49289:69"/>
any religious worſhip upon an undue

the worſhip due to God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed

them a remembrance of <hi>benefits</hi> and
<hi>duties,</hi> and therefore <hi>Motives</hi> of
Worſhip to God, who gives the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

our Worſhip to time and

(for the reaſon is alike) is given to
our Saviour Chriſt, upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> not letters
and ſyllables of his Name, but the
Perſon of our Saviour is the Object
of the Worſhip; and the naming or
ſpeaking of his Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> (which
notes his Perſon, and withall carryes
in it the remembrance of that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he wrought for us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the greateſt Motive of worſhip)
does determine the Worſhip Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the performance
of it to ſuch a time or occaſion.</p>
               <p>So for <hi>Things</hi> ſeen, which bear
the remembrance of ſuch benefits,
as may give <hi>Motive</hi> of Worſhip, and
determine it, not <hi>Objectively</hi> but <hi>this
way</hi> rather then that. The <hi>Ark</hi> with
the <hi>Mercy ſeat</hi> was the ſign and
witneſſe of Gods preſence, (<hi>there I
will meet with thee, and commune
with thee. Exod</hi> 25. 22.) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they worſhipped towards it.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49289:70"/>
                  <hi>Worſhip at his footſtoole. Pſ.</hi> 99. 5. and
132. 7. So it was called becauſe of
the ſpeciall exhibition of his preſence
on Earth. Now the worſhip was not
given to the <hi>Ark</hi> Objectively, but to
God: only that way, or thitherward
rather then other. Thus <hi>Daniel</hi>
prayed towards <hi>Jeruſalem—c.</hi> 6. 10.
And ſhould any (that I may ſpeak of
<hi>Rites</hi> not enjoyned by this Church,
yet practiced by ſome, and no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
piouſly) pray as the Ancient
Chriſtians did, towards the Eaſt, in
acknowledgement of the light of the
Goſpel riſen upon them; or at their
comming into Gods houſe bow
themſelves in ſenſe of the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and of the holy duties they
come to, and of their own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe;
or in their approach to the
holy Table bow or proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the ground, in acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that ſpeciall exhibition
Chriſt makes of himſelfe there,
and in ſenſe of his own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
what Chriſtian that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
himſelf, could accuſe theſe of
ſuperſtition and Popery, or not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
approve them as ſignificant and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49289:71"/>
ſeemly expreſſions of Chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion?</p>
               <p>There is a Cuſtom of uncovering
the head at the coming in of light,
if this be done with <hi>thankfulneſſe</hi> of
ſoul for the light of the Goſpel, and
<hi>deſire</hi> of enjoying the light of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
what harm? Is it not lawfull, yea
Chriſtian-like to glorify God on all
occaſions? for the comming in of
the light is but an occaſional remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.
Let me put it to them far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
ſhould a Papiſt when he unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the head or bows the body at the
ſight of a <hi>Croſſe,</hi> doe it out of hearty
thankfulneſs to God for redemption
by Chriſt Crucified; making the
<hi>Croſſe</hi> no object of the Worſhip, but
only the ſight of it an occaſionall
remembrance and motive: would
there be any thing in this unbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a Chriſtian? I cannot but ſay it
concerns a Chriſtian often to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and thankfully to acknowledge
Gods mercies upon any occaſion:
and if the inward worſhip (which
ſtands in ſuch due acknowledgments
of the heart) may upon occaſionall
remembrances be given, then may
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49289:71"/>
the outward expreſſion alſo by unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the head or bowing the body,
unleſſe <hi>prudence</hi> out of reſpect of
time or place forbid it, for <hi>Religion</hi>
will not. And to come a little more
home to thoſe that are ſo ready to
cry ſuperſtition: ſhould any one of
them eſcape a ſhipwrack or hazard
of battail, or be redeemed out of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
ſlavery; and ſo oft as he hears of
other mens ſuffering in any of theſe
kindes, or ſo oft as he ſees a ſhip
ſafe in harbour, or lookes on the
Armour he wore in that battel, or
on the Chain he bore in Captivity,
ſhould be ſo oft uncovering his head
lift up his heart to God in thankfull
acknowledgement of the bleſſing,
and deſire of farther Protection:
would there be any thing in this, but
what beſeems a good Chriſtian,
when as neither <hi>words</hi> heard, nor
things ſeen are made any object of
the worſhip, but accaſionall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
and motives? How much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may this be done, when we hear
that name, which carries ſalvation in
it, ſee thoſe things which minde us of
the greateſt mercies, and therefore
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49289:72"/>
may move us: and all this the more
if the Prudence and Authority of the
Ch: has ſo determined. I have enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
this diſcourſe to inſtances beyond
the enjoyned Rites and practiſes of
this Church, to meet with that vain
plea of ſuperſtition and Popery char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

the beſt expoſitor of it: bringing
down nothing as of the ſubſtance of
Faith and Worſhip, but what is
clearly grounded on Scripture, and
giving clear light to thoſe darker

               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:49289:73"/>
Hence have we ſo many <hi>private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations</hi>

therefore upon neceſſity diſagreeing:

the <hi>Diſcipline, Scepter,</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
of Chriſt, and to advance <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>

of all Schiſmaticks, and it is the
Maſter-piece of Satans cunning (as

work under that pretence, but with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49289:73"/>
miſ-guided zeal, to purge, reform, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
a Church, and to out-ſtrip o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in that zeal, till they have
brought all to confuſion. But <hi>we
ſhould not be ignorant of his devices,</hi>
as the Apoſtle warns them in a caſe

was there playing his part as <hi>an

the Inceſtuous perſon; as he
did after in the <hi>Novation</hi> Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p>Theſe his <hi>devices</hi> we might indeed
have ſeen in thoſe Ancient Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<hi>Montanists, Novatians, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts:</hi>
and in thoſe more irregular of
the laſt Age, <hi>Anabaptiſts, Libertines,

and Follies were well ſilenced
by Learned Proteſtant Writers, but
now broken out again, when <hi>that
which did let</hi> (the Civil and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Authority) <hi>was taken away,</hi> or
ſo weakned, that it could not ſtop
the inundation of former Errors and
exorbitant phanſies flowing back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us from every corner, into which
they had retired; and working ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49289:74"/>
to confuſion,<note place="margin">Confuſion &amp; levelling upon level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> to a <hi>levelling</hi>
upon <hi>levelling,</hi> as in the <hi>State,</hi> ſo in
the <hi>Church</hi>-government and affairs.
The conſideration of the firſt is not
to my preſent purpoſe; but as for the
buſineſſe of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi>
I cannot but note, How they, who
firſt pretended to Reformation, (by
<hi>Covenant</hi> obliging themſelves and
others, and conceiving that <hi>Cov.</hi> in
ſuch generall terms, as might engage
men of all ſects and perſwaſions to
joyn with them in pulling down what
was eſtabliſht, &amp; invading the means
and revenues belonging to <hi>Cathedral</hi>
Churches) did not or would not (I
pray God they may yet) ſee <hi>Satans
device,</hi> by like principles and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and in ſuch general words to
have ſtill a new Reformation under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
and to <hi>level</hi> or pul down not
onely what the former had built, but
what they had left ſtanding of that
which was before. The firſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to Reformation, would caſt off
<hi>Biſhops</hi> (their lawfull Paſtors and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours)
invade their power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
and Government, &amp; have
their Revenues with thoſe of Deans
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49289:74"/>
and Chapters alienated; Now are
there riſen up men that would make
it a part of their Reformation, to
caſt off the Miniſtry of <hi>Presbyters</hi>
too, laying open the Office of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all gifted men: alſo to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their <hi>Tithes</hi> and maintenance,
putting them to live upon benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
if any will have them for
their Teachers. And as the firſt
had no conſideration of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral</hi>
Churches, no more have
theſe of the <hi>Parochial:</hi> but as if all
other Chriſtians were <hi>Infidels</hi> or
<hi>Heathens,</hi> they will <hi>gather Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
anew: the ready way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate
the Church of Chriſt, and
bring in <hi>Confuſion:</hi> But furthermore,
as the firſt Reformers of theſe dayes,
would have no reſpect to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
practice of the Catholike
Church, ſo have theſe as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
(and with farre greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
to the pattern of the other
Reformation, the <hi>Scottiſh Kirk.</hi>
Laſtly, As They firſt caſt out
Set-forms, and the Publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of this Church, ſo Thoſe
that came after, have caſt out
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49289:75"/>
their <hi>Directory,</hi> will not be bound up
by their Rules and Order: but as one
Error begets another, and is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
in its progreſs, ſo here from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
the Set-forms of the Church,
they proceed to an undervaluing the
<hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> as below them; and
ſome to advance themſelves above
Prayer it ſelfe, as needleſſe to them,
in that height of perfection they
conceive themſelves to have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
and this is the chiefe aime of
<hi>Satans device,</hi> to bring men by a
miſguided purſuit of purity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
to ſuch a pitch of ſpiritual
pride and ſelf-conceit, as if they had
<hi>already apprehended</hi>—which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
would not take to himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
               <p>Nor is it ſufficient to ſay, We are
not ſo: If you are not gone ſo far,
yet like Principles and Pretences,
which you went on againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and Lyturgie of this
Church, would carry you ſo far; for
what certain bounds are left to ſtay
any, when once ye have pull'd up
thoſe, that the above mentioned
Rules fixed? This being done in that
Covenanting pretended Reformation,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49289:75"/>
the way is laid open to others more
bold and heady, to run on farther.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees.</note>But let me argue it a little with
you, (you, that pretend to more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
and order in the <hi>Claſſical</hi> or
<hi>Congregational</hi> way, and make ſhew
of a more quiet ſpirit and temper)
and challenge you a little, as our

garniſhing the Sepulchres of the

and thoſe that followed Him: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

Let me therefore ask you, have ye
not the book of <hi>Martyrs</hi> in your

Doe ye not there read of the ancient

               <p>I ſpeake this not to the reproach
