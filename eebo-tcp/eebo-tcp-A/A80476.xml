            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Copie of a Letter ſent from a ſpeciall friend in COVENTRY, wherein is related the ſeverall paſſages betweene the <hi>Right Honourable the Lord</hi> Brook <hi>and the Earle of</hi> Northampton, <hi>three miles beyond</hi> Banbury, <hi>upon the conduct of certaine Peeces of Ordnance to</hi> VVarwick-Caſtle.</head>
            <p>VVE have had many and great troubles here, being never quiet night nor day, but full of fears and dangers; but I praiſe God I am reaſonable well and cheerfull. On <hi>Thuſday</hi> laſt, the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Dunſmore,</hi> with many other Gentlemen of the greateſt men in our Shire, having 3. or 400. Horſe, and 8. or 900. Foot, the firſt day at <hi>Southam,</hi> ten miles off <hi>Coventry,</hi> met to put the <hi>Commiſsion of Array</hi> in Execution; of which there came ſome out of <hi>Glouceſterſhire, Worceſterſhire, Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Northamptonſhire, Oxfordſhire, Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and other places. The Earle of <hi>Northampton</hi> is expected here every day, but we doe intend to oppoſe them when they come, and ſhall leave the iſſue to Almighty God, who hath wonderfully preſerved us that there hath been no blood ſhed before this. The laſt night the Lo: <hi>Brook</hi> ſent to me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that I ſhould ſend to him 10. Horſemen, with Muskets, well appointed, to wait on him to <hi>Banbury.</hi> My Lord going himſelfe, with many other Gentlemen, about 11. aclock at night, they being of company about 140. that went from <hi>Warwick</hi> with Horſe, Piſtols and Petronels, and Horſemen with Muskets, they comming to <hi>Banbury</hi> in the morning, to conduct certaine Peeces of Ordnance that were to come to <hi>Warwick-caſtle,</hi> comming from <hi>Banbury</hi> about 8. or 9. aclock this morning, with 350. well appointed, they had not come above 3. miles from <hi>Banbury,</hi> but there appeared a great Company of Horſe and Foot with the E. of <hi>Northampton.</hi> My Lo: <hi>Brook</hi> commanded his company to light, and tye their Horſes one to the other in the Field, and every one to charge and make ready to ſtand on their guard. His Lordſhip giving them great encouragement from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Cauſe, and that he would lead them, and come on in the firſt place, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be mounted 3. Peeces of Ordnance, and made them ready, both Companies being within 10. or 12. paces ſhot of Musket, my Lo: <hi>Brook</hi> and the E. of <hi>Northampton</hi> met ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight times, with three or foure other Gentlemen of each ſide to parley. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſent to my Lo: <hi>Brook</hi> 6. load of Harrows to keep off horſes, and a Cart load of Bread and Cheeſe, and great ſtore of Beere. My Lords Company did ſo increaſe, that before he went out of the Field, his 350. were neere 1000. The Companies ſtood ſo upon their Guard from 10. aclock in the morning, till 5. in the afternoone, ever expecting when they ſhould give fire, which if they had, many would have loſt their lives. Their agreement was, that my Lo: <hi>Brook</hi> ſhould returne to <hi>Banbury</hi> with the Peeces of Ordnance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his Honour to give the Lo: of <hi>Northampton</hi> three daies notice before he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them from thence toward <hi>Warwick,</hi> by reaſon of the imminent danger. All the Armes of the City was delivered me this day. I was forced to ſit up till 3. aclock in the morning to write Letters.</p>
