            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Pſalm 107. Verſe 2.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>Let the redeemed of the Lord ſay <hi>ſo,</hi> whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or as it is in the other Tranſlation:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and delivered from the hand of the enemy.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Pſalm doth in the moſt Lively and Glorious Colours, paint forth and adorn the admirable Kindneſs, and Tranſcendent Love of Almighty God; doth viſibly repreſent to humane Eye, the various and ſurprizing Scenes of Divine Providence; doth clearly evince and prove, That God <hi>who ſitteth in Heaven, doth ſo</hi> far humble himſelf, <hi>as to behold the Things upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61702:3"/>
Earth;</hi> that all the Viciſſitudes and Changes, all the great Revolutions and variety of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents in this World, are from the Hand of God; that all humane Affairs and Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are under his Providential Conduct, and Wiſe Diſpoſal: And therefore it is, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> gives us ſo many Illuſtrious Examples, ſuch manifeſt Teſtimonies of Providence, as are able to convince any conſiderate Perſon, that the World is not governed by Fate, or gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Chance, but by infinite Wiſdom and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs; that God preſides over his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures; that his Providence is deeply concern'd, and vigorouſly engaged in all the Changes and Chances of this Mortal Life: Thus from the <hi>Third to the Seventh Verſe,</hi> we have a ſignal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an Over-ruling, Omnipotent Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where we find the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wandering in the Wilderneſs, in a Solitary Way, depriv'd of the neceſſary Supports and Comforts of this Life; yet, upon their devout Addreſſes to Heaven in Prayer, found preſent Relief and Deliverance from their Preſſures; God, by his Gracious Providence, <hi>led them forth by the Right Way,</hi> and ſafely <hi>conducted them to a City of Habitation.</hi> Thus from the <hi>Tenth to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61702:3"/>
the Fourteenth Verſe,</hi> we find how God is pleas'd to diſcipline and exerciſe others with Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Afflictions, with Bonds and Impriſonments, becauſe of their Wickedneſs and Impiety; yet as ſoon as ever ſuch ſharp Diſcipline, ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Chaſtiſement has produc'd its deſir'd Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that is, brought them to a State of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Humility, Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; as ſoon as they thus endeavour to make this Atonement, God's Mercy then gets the Aſcendant of his Juſtice, and he becomes propitious and favourable to them; brings <hi>them out of Darkneſs, and the</hi> Shadow of Death, and breaks <hi>their Bonds aſunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>from the Twenty third to the Thirtieth Verſe,</hi> we read, that ſuch as go <hi>down to the Sea in Ships,</hi> and do Buſineſs in great Waters, ſuch have more than ordinary Experiments of the Providence of the Sovereign Mercy and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God; ſometimes they are Mounted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air, and then again go down into the Depths of the Vaſt Ocean, are at <hi>their Wits end,</hi> in the greateſt Amazement and Conſternation; but when they cry or pray unto the Lord, the Violent Storm then is turn'd into a perfect Calm, &amp; by gentle Gales, they are ſafely wafted to the Port they deſign'd to ſail to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61702:4"/>Now, What doth the Lord require at the Hands of ſuch as have the Characters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, ſo ſingularly and eminently engraven upon them; for whom he hath wrought ſuch Signal and Wonderful Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances?</p>
            <p>Nothing but the Tribute of Praiſe and Thankſgiving; that is, a grateful Senſe, and publick Acknowledgment of his immenſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; ſuch a Senſe, as darts a powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon their Life and Converſation; ſuch a Senſe, as obliges them to look up unto him as the Heroick Captain of their Salvation, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Honour due unto his Name, to praiſe him for his Goodneſs, from whom they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Protection, their Safety and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>O give Thanks unto the Lord;</hi> for he is <hi>good or gracious, and his Mercy endureth for ever; let the Redeemed of the Lord ſay ſo: Or let them give Thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Hand of the Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Words are theſe Two Obſervables:
<list>
                  <item>I. <hi>A Duty enjoin'd, together with the Object of it, and that is, to</hi> give Thanks unto the Lord.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61702:4"/>II. <hi>The Reaſon or Enforcement to the Practice and Obſervation of this Duty; and that is, the Conſideration of a</hi> Redemption or Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Hand of an Enemy: Let them give Thanks whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Firſt,</hi> of the Firſt Obſervable, <hi>A Duty enjoin'd, together with the Object of it, and that is,</hi> to give Thanks unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To give thanks,</hi> in this place, is, according to the Verſion <hi>of the</hi> LXX, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Word, which according to the Sence of the Ancient Interpreters, properly imports Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and in this Senſe I find it us'd by St. <hi>James,</hi> 5.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Confeſs <hi>your Faults;</hi> and indeed, before we offer up unto God, any Euchariſtical Sacrifice, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us to Confeſs and beg Pardon of our Sins, which hinder God's acceptation of our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; <hi>for if we regard Iniquity with our Hearts, the Lord will not hear us,</hi> Pſalm, 66.18. And here, by the by, we may admire the Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſion of Times and Seaſons. Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> a day of Sack-cloth and Aſhes, a day of Sorrow and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61702:5"/>
for Sin; to day, a day of Thankſgiving and Joyfulneſs.</p>
            <p>But, as <hi>Heinſius</hi> obſerves, according to the Modern Interpretation, the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth likewiſe import to praiſe, or <hi>give Thanks unto the Lord;</hi> and in this Senſe I find it, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>Jeſus rejoiced in Spirit, and ſaid, I thank thee, O Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>give Thanks unto the Lord,</hi> is a Duty frequently inculcated and preſs'd upon us in Holy Scripture; thus <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. <hi>In every thing by Prayer and Thankſgiving, let your Requeſts be made known unto God;</hi> thus <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Abounding therein with Thankſgiving;</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Prayer, and watch in the ſame with Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving;</hi> thus 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Every Creature of God is good, if it be received with Thankſgiving;</hi> thus <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Bleſſing, and Glory, and Wiſdom, and Thankſgiving, be unto GOD for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have not only Precepts for, but rare and illuſtrious Examples in <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> for the <hi>Practice and Obſervation of the Duty</hi> of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61702:5"/>Not to <hi>Multiply too many Inſtances;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where do we find a more Noble Pattern of Gratitude, than the Royal Prophet, <hi>King David?</hi> He thought no place unfit, no time unſeaſonable for the Practice of this Duty; he continually revolv'd in his Thoughts, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon his Memory, the Mercy and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Kindneſs of the Lord; it was his pious Reſolution to <hi>meditate or muſe upon all his Works,</hi> Pſal. 77.11.12. thus <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.2. <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his Benefits,</hi> which he expreſſes, <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. <hi>Who ſaveth thy life from Deſtruction, and crowneth thee with Mercy and loving Kindneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Thirdly:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who can look upon God as his Creator, and not at the ſame time think himſelf under an indiſpenſable and eternal Obligation to <hi>praiſe and give him thanks?</hi> Have we not the ſtrongeſt Obligations to thank and praiſe him, who is the Author of our Frame and Conſtitution? Who is the Preſerver of our Being? Who ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61702:6"/>
our Life by the continual Influence of his Love? Upon him we have a conſtant and a neceſſary Dependance; to him we owe the Common Protection of Life, the Mercies of Health and Liberty, and the reaſonable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of <hi>Happineſs</hi> hereafter: Can we then be ſo unnatural, ſo inhumane, ſo diſingenuous, as not to <hi>praiſe and give him thanks? It is he that has made us,</hi> ſaith the Royal Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.2. <hi>and not we our ſelves; we are his People, and the Sheep of his Pasture,</hi> upon this Foundation he ſuperſtructs our Duty in the next Verſe; <hi>O go your Way into his Gates with thankſgiving, and into his Courts with praiſe, be thankful unto him and ſpeak good of his Name!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We <hi>are his Creatures!</hi> A Word of the greateſt <hi>Emphaſis;</hi> a Word, that demands and extorts from us all imaginable Thankfulneſs, all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Praiſe and Adoration; being <hi>Creatures,</hi> ſhews us God's abſolute Soveraignty and Dominion over us; we depend upon him, as a Ray depends upon the Sun. When the Sun goes off the <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,</hi> the Rays periſh and vaniſh away: Thus if God ſhould withdraw his Influx from us, we ſhould inſtantly lapſe and return into our primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Nothing.

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61702:6"/>
               <hi>Fourthly;</hi> That we may be perſwaded to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up unto the Lord the Sacrifice of Praiſe <hi>and Thankſgiving,</hi> let us conſider, that by ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices we not only glorify the Lord, but our ſelves; we thereby purſue our own Eternal Wel-fare and Felicity; for God is ſo infinitely happy in Himſelf, ſo perfect and beautiful, ſo tranſcendantly glorious, that we can give no Addition, no Luſtre to his <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> by the greateſt Praiſe, and moſt Solemn Thankſgiving; No! God enjoins us to this duty of praiſe and thankſgiving, not for his, but our own Intereſt and Advantage. He would have us contemplate his Glory and Perfection, bleſs and praiſe him for no other end and purpoſe, but that thereby we may be excited to tranſcribe into our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Adorable Perfections, and thus fit and qualify our ſelves for Heaven, and the Joys of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Ties, theſe are Obligations ſtrong enough of themſelves to enforce upon us the Conſtant Practice of the Duty of <hi>Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe are not all;</p>
            <p>There is yet behind one Argument more; an Argument of no little Weight and Importance;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61702:7"/>
an Argument, which, if any thing can, muſt rouze and awake us to the Duty of <hi>Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> muſt perſwade us to entertain a grateful Affection, a deep Senſe of the Mercy and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Kindneſs of the Lord; and that is, the rare <hi>Accident of Divine Providence,</hi> our Miraculous Deliverance, for which we are this day met to praiſe the Lord: And which is the Second Obſervable in the Words of my TEXT; Namely,</p>
            <p>The Reaſon or Enforcement to the practice and obſervation of the Duty of <hi>Thankſgiving;</hi> and that is, the Conſideration of a Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or Deliverance <hi>from the Hand of an Enemy:</hi> Let <hi>them give thanks whom the Lord hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and delivered from the Hand of the Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I might Diſcourſe of the Univerſal <hi>Redemption</hi> of Mankind by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who paid the greateſt Price, who purchaſed our Liberty and Enlargment with his dear and precious Blood; who delivered us from our <hi>Spiritual Enemies; from the Principalities,</hi> and <hi>Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World; from Spiritual Wickedneſs in High Places,</hi> by recovering lapſed Man to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Capacity of Bliſs and Happineſs, by an Expedient as full of Wonder as Mercy, of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61702:7"/>
which we can never expreſs too grateful a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall only ſpeak of a <hi>Temporal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> or <hi>Deliverance;</hi> for to ſuch a Deliverance the <hi>Text</hi> directly points; <hi>Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed and delivered from the hand of the Enemy; E manu tribulantis, de manu anguſtiae, de potentia angustiatoris;</hi> Out of the hand of the Oppreſſor, out of our Diſtreſs, out of the Power of ſuch as vexed and afflicted us. This is that for which we are now to celebrate the <hi>Divine Goodneſs,</hi> to magnifie him who hath demonſtrated his <hi>Providence</hi> in ſo wonderfully relieving us in the time of Danger and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; <hi>Let us give thanks whom the Lord hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the hand of the Enemy;</hi> that is, from the deteſtable <hi>Superſtitions and Corruptions of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> from the intolerable Yoke of the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Church,</hi> which is our implacable Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; a Church, which is become our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for <hi>telling the Truth,</hi> becauſe we worſhip God <hi>after the way which they call Hereſy;</hi> a <hi>Church,</hi> which mortally hates us for recovering the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> to it's ancient Brightneſs and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Splendor; for profeſſing that Faith, <hi>which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61702:8"/>
was once delivered to the Saints;</hi> Is not this to hate us without a Cauſe? Becauſe we have accurately filed Religion, poliſhed and freed it from the Ruſt it had contracted, and ſet upon it its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Luſtre; becauſe we have fully diſcovered their horrible Cheats, and grand Impoſtures, by which <hi>they get their Wealth:</hi> The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> for theſe reaſons induſtriouſly endeavour <hi>to take away both our Place and Nation,</hi> to deſtroy not only our Holy and Excellent Religion, but our Incomparable Government, and <hi>to bring our independent Freedom into a Subjection to their Foreign and Antichriſtian</hi> Yoke.</p>
            <p>How many Efforts have been made? How many Arrows have been ſhot at this Glorious Nation, out of their Quiver of malice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? but all of them miſſed the Mark; it was God that covered this Nation with the Wings of his Providence, that Defended it <hi>from the Arrows that flew by Day, and from the Peſtilence that walked in Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It <hi>was in Eighty eight,</hi> when the <hi>Spaniſh invincible Navy</hi> came, like Great and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Caſtles, floating to our Coaſts, with Sails ſwell'd with fury, and puffed up with hopes of Victory; but the Lord fought for us
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61702:8"/>
by Fire &amp; Winds, by Rocks and Tempeſts; how did the Lord then diſplay his Wonders for us in the deep? How wonderfully did he then deliver us from the hand of the Enemy? <hi>Oh that men would therefore Praiſe the Lord for his Goodneſs, and declare the Wonders he hath done for the Children of Men!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was in the Reign of King <hi>James the firſt of Bleſſed Memory,</hi> that the Execrable <hi>Gun-Powder Plot,</hi> that damnable Contrivance, was formed under <hi>Jeſuitical Wings;</hi> but when it was grown to Maturity, and ready to be Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, GOD Cruſhed this <hi>Helliſh Project</hi> by a timely Diſcovery, and Delivered the Nation from the <hi>Hand of the Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was in <hi>Eighty eight</hi> too, that we as well as our Fore-Fathers, <hi>were redeemed and delivered from the hand of the enemy, from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great were the hopes that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had of introducing and ſetling their Religion; A <hi>Prince</hi> of their own Religion upon the Throne: A Zealous and an Induſtrious <hi>Prince</hi> too for propagating the Principles of his Religion: This gave them a Charming Proſpect of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; this made them leave no Stone unturned;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61702:9"/>
this made them, <hi>Jehu</hi> like, drive on with all imaginable Fury and Violence; this Emboldned them to put that galling and fretting Yoke upon our Necks, which neither we nor our fore-fathers were able to bear: <hi>Unhappy</hi> and <hi>Unfortunate Prince! How is the Mighty faln! I am Diſtreſſed for him.</hi> Who can reflect upon his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes without pity and perturbation of Mind? <hi>How would his Throne a' been Eſtabliſh'd in Righteouſneſs, had but the wicked been taken away from before him?</hi> Had but his <hi>baſe Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> been removed from his Court and Councils, the Hearts of his People would never a' been <hi>Alienated</hi> from him: Never <hi>Prince</hi> came to the <hi>Crown</hi> with more una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous and cheerful Acclamations; he was look'd upon as a <hi>Prince</hi> of no leſs Heroical Vertues, than Noble Extraction: He then <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that the Laws of</hi> England <hi>were ſufficient to make him as Great a Monarch as his Heart could wiſh, and therefore promiſed his Endeavours to Preſerve the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment both in Church &amp; State as by Law Eſtabliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all Probability he might have been the Greateſt, the moſt <hi>Triumphant Monarch</hi> that ever ſway'd the <hi>Engliſh Scepter,</hi> had not his Paſſion of Glory yielded to his Bigottry

and Zeal for his Religion; had he not put the Reins of Government into the Hands of a <hi>Fiery Jeſuit;</hi> who, <hi>Phaeton like,</hi> preſently ſet the Nation on a flame, put him upon ſuch Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Practices as prov'd deſtructive of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's Happineſs and Tranquillity, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him into the moſt calamitous and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>We have now ſeen by woeful Experience what the <hi>Prophetick Parliaments</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 80. Prognoſticated: We are now, I hope, highly ſenſible that they were compos'd of Perſons of greater Underſtanding and Integrity than the World at that time was pleas'd to repreſent them; 'tis now plain that the clear proſpect they had of the Kingdoms Intereſt conducted all their Conſultations; it now appears that the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> was carried on thro' a true Zeal for the Nations Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; Happineſs, for the Protection and Security of the Peoples <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> and for the Preſervation of, what ought to be dearer to us than our Lives, the <hi>Proteſtant Religion:</hi> But their weighty reaſons could make no Impreſſion, their Deſigns were all blaſted; and we may attribute it to the good and ſecret Hand of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61702:10"/>
               <hi>Providence</hi> that they were ſo; for probably, if they had taken effect, the Nation would have been involv'd in Blood and Confuſion, becauſe of its unbelief, That ever <hi>Popery</hi> could have produc'd <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> that ever <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> could have deſtroyed the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and unhing'd the <hi>Government:</hi> For though in Hiſtory we have Recorded many pregnant Inſtances, many ample Teſtimonies of <hi>Popiſh Perfidiouſneſs and Impiety;</hi> yet no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, no Teſtimony ſo convincing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive as Experience; <hi>Popery</hi> was never ſo generally underſtood as it is at this day; we now ſee the truth and certainty of this Maxim.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is impoſſible for the</hi> Proteſtant Religion <hi>to flouriſh under, or the preſent Conſtitution of the</hi> Engliſh Government <hi>to be preſerved by any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> whom <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſtamped her <hi>Proſelyte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas! What ſignify all the plauſible preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all the fair promiſes and aſſurances where <hi>Popery</hi> hath got the aſcendant? What ſecurity can there be to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> where there is a ſubjection to the <hi>Pope?</hi> Where <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Counſels influence and command? Alas!

            <p>Not to expatiate upon the <hi>Iriſh-Maſſacre.</hi>

            <p>Witneſs too, the late <hi>Perſecution</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Piedmont: O Barbarous and more than</hi> Scythian <hi>or</hi> Thracian <hi>Cruelty!</hi> Thoſe our poor Brethren had Edicts, Promiſes, and Oaths ſealed with the Holy Sacrament; but alas! as ſoon as ever an opportunity preſented it ſelf, they found that <hi>Popery</hi> can abſolve from the ſtricteſt Oaths, can tear in pieces the moſt Religious Seal, and cancel the ſtrongeſt Obligation.</p>
            <p>We have Inſtances enough at home, which plainly ſhew that <hi>Popiſh</hi> Engagements and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, are lighter than the very Breach that utters
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61702:11"/>
them: Did not Queen <hi>Mary</hi> promiſe the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> Inhabitants, and call'd her God to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs too, That ſhe would content her ſelf with the Private exerciſe of her own Devotion, and Preſerve the then Proteſtant Government, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>injur'd? and yet as ſoon as ever her Sovereign Power was ſecurely Eſtabliſh'd, the Maſque then fell off, Fire and Faggot then Illuminated the Peoples underſtanding; nay, thoſe very men, who rais'd her to the Throne, felt the moſt ſignal marks of her vengeance; they <hi>made Claim indeed of her</hi> former Promiſes, but <hi>were thought inſolent, and accounted as criminals for ſo doing;</hi> they found that no Merits or Service could ſecure any from the Cruelties of that Religion; for, her <hi>Princely gratitude</hi> for their Crowning her with a <hi>Diadem,</hi> Crown'd them with <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We our ſelves too, had promiſes of the like Nature, and thought we deſerved them; but alas! they proved as Quick-ſands, not the leaſt glimpſe of Safety to be repos'd in them, not the leaſt hopes to be built upon them: Had we <hi>not Aſſurances;</hi> and yet at the ſame time the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Invaſion of <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Privileges?</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Governing according to Law,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power</hi> ſet a foot as laid all the Laws

aſleep, as would preſently have laid in Aſhes, too, the beautiful Fabrick of our excellent Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and incomparable Government; <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes!</hi> it is the <hi>nature of the <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> firſt to deceive and then deſtroy;</hi> it is a Religion that <hi>Tranſubſtantiates</hi> the very Nature of him who embraces it; it is a Religion that acts in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe and maſquerade, changes frequently its colours, <hi>and puts out a falſe Flag to conceal the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;</hi> no! <hi>it is better to truſt in the Lord than to put any confidence in man; it is better to truſt in the Lord th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>What great Reaſon then have we to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify Divine Providence? What an obligation do we all lie under, to pay all imaginable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, all poſſible gratitude to the Lord who hath <hi>Redeem'd us</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> from a Remorſeleſs, Bloody, and Treacherous Religion? <hi>Let us give thanks whom the Lord hath ſo wonderfully delivered from the hand of the enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have the beſt <hi>Religion,</hi> the beſt conſtituted <hi>Government</hi> in the whole world; a Religion which meer fleſh and blood never revealed; a Religion, that is retrench'd from all Falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Superſtitious Practices; a <hi>rational Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> a <hi>reaſonable Service,</hi> againſt which our <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61702:12"/>
adverſaries have no exception, But that it preferrs the written Word before uncertain Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and the all-ſufficient blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> before the impure and imperfect works of Mortal Men.</p>
            <p>A Government too incomparable for its conſtitution; the <hi>legiſlative Power</hi> is ſo lodg'd, that nothing can be Enacted without <hi>the King and Parliament;</hi> thus as the inferiour Orbs do, by their tranſverſe and oppoſite motions, ſtay and moderate the rapid force of the <hi>primum mobile</hi> or firſt Sphere, ſo <hi>Parliaments</hi> by their <hi>Fabian Counſels,</hi> do temper and moderate the quick motion of Sovereign Power: All our Laws and Decrees, by which we are govern'd, are firſt of our own choice, and then confirm'd by the <hi>King;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the morning, nor the evening Star in the Heavens, is more beautiful than the frame and complexion of our Government; we have Laws that are ſufficiently able to make us a Nation of Righteouſneſs, if they be but actuated by men of impartial Juſtice and Integrity.</p>
            <p>Now! Was this our excellent Religion in danger of being overflown with the filthy ſtreams of Popery and Superſtition? Was this our incomparable Government brought by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61702:12"/>
Power</hi> to the very brink of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? And hath God preſerv'd both our Religion and Government? Have we now a bleſſed and a comfortable Hope of ſeeing our Religion and Government flouriſh? <hi>Of having our Judges reſtor'd, as at the firſt; and our Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, as at the beginning?</hi> Iſai. 1.26. How ought we then to magnify the Divine Goodneſs? How prudently and religiouſly have our <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> acted, in appointing this day of ſolemn <hi>thankſgiving,</hi> to pour forth our Praiſes to him, who hath ſo ſtrangely redeemed, ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly deliver'd us <hi>from the hand of the enemy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Redemption,</hi> that bears the moſt legible Characters of Divine Providence! That God ſhould ſend us over a <hi>Deliverer</hi> at a ſeaſon, when <hi>ſailing was dangerous;</hi> at a time, when <hi>the Waves of the Sea rage horribly and ſwell,</hi> when the Winds are moſt tempeſtuous, that moſt of our <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry,</hi> that <hi>a ſtanding-Army too</hi> (in which the Papiſts ſeem'd to repoſe the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, becauſe Numbers of their own Religion were mix'd with it, becauſe ſeveral Regiments therein were under the command and conduct of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Officers) ſhould concurr to our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that there ſhould <hi>be no effuſion of Blood;</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61702:13"/>
this was <hi>Digitus Dei,</hi> the Finger of God, and we cannot reflect upon it without Aſtoniſhment and Admiration.</p>
            <p>A ſudden and a ſeaſonable deliverance: A deliverance which argues the vigilant Eye of Providence, and the powerful Hand of God; the <hi>deep waters of the proud had gone even over our Soul; we eſcaped even as a Bird out of the ſnare of the Fowler; the ſnare is ſuddenly broken and we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;</hi> our enemies were ſtopp'd in their Career their undermining Projects and baſe Deſigns were prevented by a ſudden and an unexpected change of the Scene, by a moſt ſtrange and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing revolution.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord on a ſudden daſh'd in pieces the black contrivances of wicked <hi>Haman,</hi> when he had procur'd a Royal Decree, and fixed a time for the quenching of his thirſt with Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of <hi>Jewiſh Blood;</hi> thus the Lord diſcomfited the <hi>Egyptian Hoſt,</hi> diſpirited their Horſes, and affrighted <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with Thunder and Lightning; made the Sea to ſwallow him and his Army, when he was upon the heel's of the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> thus when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> had encamped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with a formidable Army, and had made all neceſſary preparations for a ſtorm,

            <p>It is true, God can blaſt a project, God can defeat an helliſh Deſign upon its firſt formation, in its very <hi>Embryo;</hi> but, to <hi>Illuſtrate his Providence,</hi> he generally ſuffers it to come to ſome ripeneſs and maturity, to the very birth, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives <hi>it of Strength to bring forth;</hi> permits the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters</hi> to mount up to the top of confidence, and then tumbles them down; ſtays till his innocent People are placed upon the very precipice, and <hi>then with his own right hand and his out-ſtretched Arm doth he catch hold</hi> of them, and ſaves them from the deſign'd deſtruction; when men are thus ſnatch'd, as it were, from the jaws of Danger, when both <hi>Church and State</hi> is, as it were <hi>pull'd out of the fire,</hi> they cannot but ſee that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath done it; unleſs they wilfully ſhut their Eyes againſt the light, they cannot <hi>but perceive that it is his Work;</hi> this cannot but enforce them to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Lord, and praiſe his Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61702:14"/>And ſuch a ſudden and an unexpected delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was ours; <hi>the Enemy cry'd, Come and let us root them out that they may be no more a People, and that their name may be no more in remembrance; our heart was diſquieted within us, and the fear of death was faln upon us, and an horrible dread overwhelmed us.</hi> Why? Becauſe Treaſon walk'd barefac'd in our Streets at broad noon-day with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt effrontery and impudence; becauſe <hi>unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was in the City;</hi> becauſe a falſe and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Religion wreſtled with our own, and endeavour'd <hi>to lay her honour in the duſt;</hi> nay! it was not only an open and a declar'd Enemy that ſtruggled with her, but even ſome who call'd themſelves <hi>her Children,</hi> who <hi>came to the houſe of God, and pretended to her Doctrine and Worſhip,</hi> and yet, <hi>(intolerable hypocriſie!)</hi> endeavour'd as much as in them lay, to throw down <hi>her Walls</hi> and deſtroy <hi>her Fences,</hi> to overthrow <hi>all her hedges, and break down her ſtrong holds,</hi> to take away ſuch neceſſary, ſuch good and wholſome <hi>Laws,</hi> as were her greateſt <hi>viſible Security and Protection.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus when our Church had Enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and (which is more dangerous) within, when no <hi>ſmall Tempest lay upon her, when all hopes of her being ſav'd were taken away,</hi> it pleaſed the Lord to viſit her, to ariſe <hi>and have mercy upon</hi> Zion, <hi>to redeem her from the hand of the Enemy,</hi> to ſtill the proud and inſulting Waves, to <hi>make the ſtorm to ceaſe, and to bring her to the haven where ſhe would be: Oh that we may therefore praiſe the Lord for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hath his Providence watch'd over us with a careful Eye? Hath he in the time of trouble and imminent danger rais'd us up <hi>a Prince;</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> of the greateſt Courage and Conduct, the Terror as well as the Envy of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> equal to His <hi>Anceſtors</hi> in all Noble and Vertuous Qualities, enrich'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61702:15"/>
with Wiſdom and the greateſt Integrity; a <hi>Prince</hi> of a Martial and Noble Temper, who will <hi>really venture his Life in Defence of this Nation, and in the preſerving of it in all its juſt Rights and Liberties;</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> who will be a Courageous <hi>Defender of our Faith,</hi> as well as of our <hi>Laws;</hi> who is reſolv'd to encourage and protect us and our excellent Religion?</p>
            <p>But here, Behold a Miracle indeed! Stand and admire the Divine Providence; God hath not only Bleſſed us with a <hi>Prince</hi> who will be a <hi>Nurſing Father,</hi> but alſo with a <hi>Princeſs</hi> who will be a <hi>Nurſing Mother</hi> of our Church; our Church was never more Bleſſed before; a <hi>Princeſs</hi> of our own <hi>Nation,</hi> as well as <hi>Religion;</hi> a <hi>Princeſs</hi> of exemplary Piety, and unparallell'd Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſay, hath the Lord given us ſuch <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings?</hi> What then ſhall we render unto him for all <hi>his Benefits?</hi> What return ſhall we make for this his tranſcendant Love, and admirable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
            <p>Nothing but <hi>thanks for his unſpeakable Gifts,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an heart poſſeſſed with a grateful Senſe and Affection, nothing but the Sacrifice of <hi>Praiſe and Thankſgiving: O then ſing unto God, and ſing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61702:15"/>
praiſes unto his name; praiſe him in his name; yea and rejoice before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all:</p>
            <p>We muſt praiſe the Lord our God, not only with our Lips, but in our Lives; We muſt not expreſs our Joy for our ſtupendious deliverance, by <hi>Rioting and Drunkenneſs,</hi> and ſuch like extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, but by walking in all Holineſs and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Converſation; let me beg of you, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to remember the Holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s humble and paſſionate requeſt, which is <hi>the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt ſentence in the Form of Prayer for the day, and the firſt verſe in the ſecond Leſſon: I beſeech you Brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the only way to endear us to the God of Heaven, and to entitle us to his Almighty Favour and kind Protection.</p>
            <p>We ſeem indeed to be the <hi>peculiar care of Heaven,</hi> to be the only <hi>Bleſſed Children of the Lord;</hi> yet if we live not as becometh a reformed and a <hi>redeemed People,</hi> if we live not as highly ſenſible of God's <hi>reiterated mercies,</hi> (which ſenſe we muſt demonſtrate by a life conformable to his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61702:16"/>
Divine Laws) then, though our <hi>Sky</hi> at the preſent is beautified with an <hi>Evening Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which ſpeaks the Clouds thin, and the Air pure; tho' our <hi>Firmament</hi> now looks bright and ſerene; yet God, if provok'd by our ingratitude and impiety, can, in the twinkling of an Eye, change it from <hi>an Evening to a Morning Redneſs;</hi> can in a moment make the Firmament <hi>lowring,</hi> by condenſing the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and veiling the <hi>Sky</hi> with darkneſs; will certainly bring us into worſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances than before, and pour upon us fiercer inſtances of his anger and heavy diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>But Laſtly:</p>
            <p>One word of Exhortation, and I a' done.</p>
            <p>As we are obliged to render unto God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty our moſt Solemn Thanks for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Mercy we this Day Celebrate, in the deliverance of this Nation from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> ſo let the ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thereof oblige us to hold the Faith in <hi>Unity of Spirit, and in the bond of Peace;</hi> to be <hi>like minded, to have the ſame love, to have no diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, to be perfectly joined together, in the ſame mind and in the ſame judgment, to live together in Brotherly love and Chriſtian charity. Charity!</hi> the Eſſential mark of a true Church; <hi>Charity!</hi> which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61702:16"/>
out-ſhines all other Chriſtian Vertues, and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Graces;</hi> it is the Characteriſtick of our Holy and Incomparable Religion, it is a <hi>Grace</hi> ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly eminent and ornamental, ſo neceſſary a Vertue, that without it all our doings are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, without it whoſoever <hi>liveth is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dead before God;</hi> without it no Beatifick Viſion, no Joys of Immortality: <hi>Charity</hi> is repreſented by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as a Vertue of the greateſt Beauty and Comelineſs, he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon it the moſt illuſtrious Character, as you may read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. where we find that it is a permanent and durable Vertue; all other Gifts and Graces of the Holy Ghoſt only diſplay their Glory in this ſublunary World, but <hi>this Grace, this Vertue, Charity,</hi> ſhall retain it's native ſplendor and dazling bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will be uſeful and neceſſary to us after our tranſlation from hence to the Manſions of Eternity; and therefore the <hi>Holy Apoſtle</hi> gives it the Honor of Precedency, the higheſt Encomium, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>And now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity, theſe three; but the greateſt of theſe is Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We <hi>have conſiderable Enemies</hi> both at home and abroad, who, as they envy, ſo no Queſtion will ſet all Engines at work, will ſtrenuouſly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61702:17"/>
endeavour to diſturb our Repoſe, and ruffle our Happineſs and Tranquillity. Now, nothing can be more pleaſing or grateful to them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can give them a better Proſpect of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs than Difference and Diſcord amongſt our ſelves; for where ſuch things are, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>but Confuſion and every evil Work,</hi> nothing but Miſery and Diſtraction: <hi>Emnity</hi> and Strife is the <hi>Rock</hi> they have all along endeavour'd to run us upon; and indeed, nothing can more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually <hi>ſplit</hi> our Religion and Government: <hi>A Nation divided,</hi> a Kingdom without Peace and Unity in it ſelf, cannot ſtand; This is the Voice of <hi>Truth it ſelf, If a Kingdom be divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf, that Kingdom cannot ſtand,</hi> Mark 3.24. It is not for nothing too, that the Royal <hi>Pſalmist</hi> cries out, <hi>Behold, how good and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> are very ſenſible that nothing conſolidates or fortifies a Nation more than Unity; and therefore it hath been their conſtant Practice to foment Diviſions, to enkindle Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, to ſet us at Variance one with another: But remember, Sirs, we are Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61702:17"/>Now, as we are <hi>not ignorant of their Devices,</hi> ſo let us ſtrive to live together in mutual Love and Charity: For if we keep <hi>Innocency,</hi> and preſerve <hi>Unity,</hi> we ſhall not only diſappoint our Enemies Expectation, and become invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but we ſhall alſo oblige Heaven to be our Succour and Defence; GOD will then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue His Mercy and Favour towards us, the Lord of <hi>Hosts</hi> will ſecure and protect us, will alwaies <hi>deliver us from the hand of the enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>Now to God the Father, to God the Son, and to God the Holy Ghoſt, be aſcrib'd, as is moſt due, bleſſing and glory and wiſdom, with thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, both now and for evermore: <hi>Amen.</hi>
