            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU know the Sacredness of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> Now all stragling Apologues fall to you as <hi>Lord of the Mannor,</hi> and the very Ghost of <hi>Aesop</hi> (no very agreable Appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you may imagin) of <hi>Poggius, Abstemius,</hi> and my own old blind Author too for Company, durst I with-hold the Due, wou'd e'ry Night draw my Curtains 'till You had Justice done You. Besides as Duty and real Interest are ever inseparable, so particularly in the present Instance it's the Privilege of Your humble Imitators that by doing You <hi>Fealty</hi> they challenge Your <hi>Protection, the very end of Government,</hi> when at the same time too our Tribute's but a <hi>Peppercorn-rent,</hi> make the best on't, and Your Subjects are more beholden to You for accepting, than You to them for paying their Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>I have frequently wonder'd at the Confidence of Authors in expecting to be gratify'd for their Dedications, and oftener at the Weakness of Patrons, that they'll vouchsafe 'em those dishonourable Encouragements. For first, it's Ten to One but the great Man <hi>catches a Tartar,</hi> or provides for a <hi>Bantling</hi> that is not worth a <hi>Clout:</hi> Or secondly, if he has reason to be proud of his Purchase, all the Glory and Encomium of the Epistle smells abominably rank of <hi>Confederacy</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Maecenas</hi> but spoils his own Market while he makes a liberal Art a mercenary one; and when the Orator or the Poet is to draw his Picture beyond the Life, he cann't be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented unless he set for't with a <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Bells</hi> forsooth! <hi>of his own providing.</hi> In a Word, the Fee shou'd rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the Patron from the Scribler, and little enough at last too considering what a Cause he's oblig'd to attend: Now my little harmless homely Ditty Petitions for no more than barely the benefit of the two Capital Letters aforesaid. It applys in <hi>forma Pauperis,</hi> and the Translator will mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify Your Charity both in his Author's Name and in his own, if You'll keep his <hi>Calliope</hi> in countenance <hi>gratis.</hi> Nay indeed the whole is but a <hi>Cur'sy to my Dancing-Master,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb facs="tcp:57171:3"/>
the levity of the Allusion. You were <hi>my Apollo, my Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and my Muses</hi>; that Ocean of true Wit and good Sense from which the Drill, as to all that's tolerable in it, derives it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and into which it as naturally returns, 'though at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of its <hi>Acrimony</hi> in the <hi>Circulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But hold! 'tis high time to enter upon the main Business of an Epistle Dedicatory, the <hi>Patron</hi>'s <hi>Apotheosis.</hi> And what now must I extol? Your <hi>Integrity, Constancy</hi> and <hi>Courage?</hi> Alas! 'tis a long time ago since these pass'd for recommendatory Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; nay of very dangerous Consequence might it prove to us Both, at this time o' Day, should I blurt out a Syllable in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of 'em. Your <hi>Letters</hi> then, your <hi>Iudgment,</hi> your <hi>Wit,</hi> your <hi>Prudence?</hi> That were as much as to say all the World did not already admire 'em, ever excepting my Brother <hi>C</hi>â€”; and I verily believe too, even he, cou'd the Man have as good an Opinion of any Body as of himself, wou'd entertain it of you.</p>
            <p>How then shall I manage my Address? Assume the modish Figure call'd <hi>Apophasis</hi> or <hi>Whispering aloud,</hi> and run you a long Division upon your several Excellencies with a <hi>Not to mention 'em?</hi> Or shall I tell you that your Modesty being a Nusance to the rest of your Virtues, I had rather be wanting in my Duty to Them, than most inhumanely torture That? Nauseous, vile, pedantick Forms! and as prostituted <hi>Common-places</hi> as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick itself! What remains therefore but the liberty of making this brief, bare, and simple, yet candid Profession, that I am,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentle Peruser!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the first place the Translator wou'd have thee know he never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Character of a Poet, and as he desires to 'scape the Scandal of the Name, so he will not value himself the more for any good Success, or the less for any Disappointment; seeing after all, in Things of this Nature, every Man will be his own Critick, and the People of nice Rule and quaint Observation, betray the vanity of their Maxims, while scarce a Couple in the whole Pack agree about the suitableness of any one <hi>Ingredient,</hi> but that which is most incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the true Scope of the Art, the Recommendation and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Immorality and Irreligion: However, finding himself dispos'd <hi>now and then</hi> to try his Skill, and observing the <hi>Canto-cut</hi> has of late carry'd the Day, he thought good to bestow a few Hours upon the Translation of a Poem which, and very deservedly, has been celebrated for many Ages; a Poem, which for neatness of Wit, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Description and regularity of Conduct, equals any part of the <hi>Iliads,</hi> perhaps excells any part of the <hi>Odysses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet as just and regular as I found this Poem, I perceiv'd it wou'd never jump in English with the Humour of the Age, till I had spoild it by some unwarrantable Alterations, which being printed in a smaller Character, the Reader may observe without the trouble of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring. The two most material of 'em are these; first, That whereas, according to my Author, the Frog seems not out of a treacherous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to have serv'd the Mouse as he did, I have made him design the worst all along, very consonantly too, if I mistake not, to the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter the Poet fixes afterwards upon him, where he makes him vindicate himself by that egregious Falsity, <hi>v. 146. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.</hi> And not injuriously neither to the Series of the Story: Then again, that almost upon the same Inducements I have made him improve or rather explain the Stratagem, by which, in the Conclusion of that Speech, the Frog proposes to defeat the Mice. Beside these many slighter Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations will occur, and here and there an Addition of my own, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Printed also in a small Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi>
               </note> but which I hope he can as readily forgive as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57171:4"/>For what relates to the Scope and Import of the Fable, I am not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded with <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> compos'd it only for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Exercise of School-Boys; the Design appears to have been more momentous, it carries a Face of Instruction upon the Matter of Civil Government, and the Moral is plainly Political. In the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the War between the Frogs and the Mice, we see with what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Consequences the generous Credulity of a Prince on one hand abus'd by the Craftiness and Treachery of a Neighbour on the other, is like to be attended. On the part of the Mouse, 'twas imprudent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose so great Confidence in a Politician of a distinct or rather opposite Interest and Temper, tho' on the part of the Frog 'twas not only a bold Violation of Divine and Humane Laws to play such a Game, but still more impolitick to stir up so Potent an Adversary, and dare the Vengeance not of Heaven alone (for he seems to have troubled his Head little enough about that) but withal of so many well-disciplined resolute <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers,</hi> of which Commotions the Issue will ever be fatal to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, how much soever Things may succeed to his Wishes for a Season. The great Distributer of Dues loves to defer his Inflictions as long as his Iustice will permit; but when that Period's once expir'd, he sends down both Principal and Interest upon the Heads of the Incorrigible. I confess, the Poet has not intimated so much; nay, has describ'd <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> as a malicious Enemy to the Mice. But then we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he had represented him before in a State of Indifference, resolv'd with his Family not to interpose in behalf of this Party or that, nor to concern himself otherwise than as an idle Spectator. Indeed, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the Poet took with his Gods, was, in respect of himself, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Presumption, and nothing ought to be built upon it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from it. Agen, the Consummation of the Fray gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, That Superiority and Dominion are the most slippery Things in the World, and have their Vicissitudes of Rising and Sinking as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily as <hi>two Buckets in a Well.</hi> The Mice at first are too hard for the Frogs, and 'twas but Reason to imagine 'em so 'till they had taken their just Revenge: But then the Crabs came upon the Mice in the very Pride of their Victory, and by a course kind of Argument, convinc'd 'em in their turn of the Instability of Human Affairs. Nay, there's yet a further meaning in the Close of the Allegory; for 'though the Frogs deserv'd ten times more than what they suffer'd from the Mice; yet we know, the Mice hod been as little remarkable for strict Morals as the most profligate Animals that e'r mov'd upon all Four. The Temptation of a mouldy Crust cou'd prevail with 'em at any time to break thro' all Obligations of Religion and Honour. The Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
<pb facs="tcp:57171:4"/>
of their Appetites they made the Rule of their Duty, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Privilege, under the Notion of <hi>Natural Freedom,</hi> to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>Landlords</hi> and <hi>One another</hi> as often as they pleas'd: How then were the Caitiffs rigorously dealt with? What reason had they to expect more favour than the Frogs? In good earnest, I think they had too much shew'd 'em before; and 'twas an Act of special Condescension in <hi>Jupiter</hi> to lay the Frogs at the Mercy of the Mice, and not the Mice rather at the Mercy of the Frogs. And so much by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</p>
            <p>If the Criticks shou'd be displeas'd at any Grammatical or Poetical Liberties I have taken, they'd highly oblige me. And the longer <hi>Bill</hi> the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> prefer, the better: Though let 'em distort Words, mangle Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, and misapply <hi>Aristotle, Horace,</hi> and <hi>Bossu,</hi> till they're out of breath, I'll lay 'em a Wager at last they cann't discover so many Faults in the Performance as <hi>their humble Servant.</hi> I earnestly beg of 'em to honour me with a <hi>Hiss,</hi> and shall be most proud of their <hi>Condemnation,</hi> well-knowing their Sentence is always to be constru'd, like <hi>Oâ€”ts</hi>'s <hi>Depositions,</hi> backward. Ever since I caught some ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magant Ones in a Club, undervaluing our new Translation of <hi>Virgil,</hi> I've known both what Opinion I ought to harbour, and what use to make of 'em, and since the Opportunity of a Digression so luckily presents it self, I shall make bold to ask the Gentlemen their Sentiments of two or three Lines (to pass over a thousand other Instances) which they may meet with in that Work.
