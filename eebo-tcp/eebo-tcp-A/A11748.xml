            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Faithfull Within this Realme,
shuld together, and at one time

not to take from vs the lyght of

But because that suche publicte
Supplicationes requyre alwayes
Fasting to be ioyned therewith,
And publict Fastynge craueth
a certane time and certane exercises
of godlynes then to be vsed with
greater streatnes then at vther ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
The whole Assemblie after
deliberation hath appointed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> last
Sonday of February, and the first
Sonday of Marche nixt following
the date of the said assemblie, to
that moste necessare exercise (as
<pb facs="tcp:13790:3"/>
tyme now standeth) of publict
Fasting. And further, did require
the same to be signified be all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to their people the Sonday
preceading the said last Sonday of
Februarie. But lest that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes
shall think that now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to authorise and praise that
which some tymes we haue repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and dampned in them. Or
els that the ignorant who knowe
not the commoditie of this moste
godlie exercise shall contempne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
same. We haue thoght expedient
somewhat to speak to the one and
to the vther. And vnto the
Papistes first we say, that as in puri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
of conscience, we haue refused
their whole abhominationes, and
amongest the rest, that their super<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sticious
and Pharisaicall maner of
Fasting: So euen vnto this day do
we continew in the same purpose,
boldely affirming that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
is no Fasting that euer God
approued, but that it is a deceauing
<pb facs="tcp:13790:4"/>
of the people, and a meare mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, which moste euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

we searche what is the ryght
end of Fasting, what Fasting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God, and which is it that his
soule abhoreth. Of Fasting in the
Scriptures we finde two sortes, the
one priuate, the vther publicte.
The priuate is that which man or
woman doeth in secrete, &amp; before
their God, for such causes as their

in the booke of the Iudges,

because that they menteaned wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

&amp; Fasted that day vnto the night,
for then began they to considder
Godes angrie face against them.</p>
            <p>In this last historie their appeareth
iust cause why the people shulde
haue rune to the onely refuge of
God, because that there first army
of fourtie thousand men wes vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie
distroyed. But what iust
occasion had Iosua so lamentablie
to complaine,<note place="margin">Let his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

were to accuse God, that he had
deceaued him in that, that against
his promeis he had suffered Israell
to fall before their ennimies. Wes
the lose of thrette men (no mo sel
that day in the edge of the sword)
so great a mater that he shuld dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
of any better successe, that he
shulde accuse God that he had
brought them ouer Iordane, and
that he shuld feare that the whole
army of the Lord shuld be inuero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:13790:9"/>
aboute, and consumed in the
rage of their ennimies, yea, if Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell

Nay, nay (deare brethren) it wes
an vther thing then the present

to complaine, weap, and owle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

For euerie commandement

which they fand not in the
<pb facs="tcp:13790:9"/>
beginning of their interpryses, and
therefore they did considder the
fearcenes of his displeasure, &amp; did
tremble before his angrie Face,
whose myghtie hand they fand to
fight against them, and that wes
the cause of their dolorous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes
and fearfull crying before
their God. What wes the cause
that God delt so framedly with
the one, and with the vther? we
may perchance somewhat speak,
when that we shall entreat of the
frutes of Fasting, and of those thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
that may holde back from vs

we prepare vs to put his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement

cause of publict Fasting, is Godes

shall he humble him self before his

perswaded, that there is mercy and

we finde our selues now

that shuld moue vs now to
<pb facs="tcp:13790:15"/>
humble our selues before our Go
by publict Fasting, more then tha
we did in the beginning? When
this Euangile wes now last offered
vnto vs, for then by all apperance,
we and it in our persones stoode in
greater danger, then we do yet,.</p>
            <p>We answer, that the causes are mo
then for greif of haert we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse.
First, because that in the
beginning we had not refused god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es
graces, but contrariwyse with
such feruencie we receaued them,<note place="margin">Causes that now moue vs to faste that moued vs not befor</note>
that we could beare with no kinde
of impietie: but for the suppressing
of the same, we nether had respect
to frende, possession, land or lyfe,
but all we put in hasard, that gode;
treuth myght be aduansed, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie
myght be suppressed.</p>
            <p>And therefore did our God by the
mouth of his Messingers, in all our
aduersities, assure vs that our enni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
shuld not preuale against vs,<note place="margin">Let the fath full call to mynde.</note>
but that they shuld be subdewed
vnder vs, that our God shuld be
<pb facs="tcp:13790:15"/>
glorified in our semple &amp; vpryght
dealing. But now sence that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
wisdome hath perswaded vs
to beare with manifest Idolatrie, &amp;
to suffer this realme that God had
ones purged, to be polluted againe
with that abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea, allace,
sence y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some of vs that God made
so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e tymes instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to suppresse
that impietie, haue bene the cheif
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct &amp; conuoy that Idole
throughout all the quarters of this
Realme, yea, to the houses of them
that sometymes detested the masse
as the Deuill &amp; his seruice. Sence
that tyme we say, haue we funde
the face of our God, angrie against
vs, his threatninges haue bene sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rpe
in the mouthes of his Messin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
which albeit for the tyme, we
dispysed &amp; mocked, yet the iust ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
conuicteth vs, that we
were wicked, &amp; that they in threa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tning
vs,<note place="margin">God grant that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may yet consider</note> did nothing but the dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Godes trew Messingers.</p>
            <p>And this is the second cause that
<pb facs="tcp:13790:16"/>
moue vs to this publict humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
rather now then in the beginning,
to wit, that then we followed god,
and not carnall wisdome, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made he few in nomber, feare
full to many, fooles before the
worlde to confound the wyse, and
suche as before neuer had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in armes, made God so bolde
and so prosperous in all their inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pryses,
that the expertest Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oures
feared the poore plowmen,
yea, our God faught for vs by sea,
and by land, he moued the heartes
of strangers to supporte vs, and to
spend their liues for our releif.</p>
            <p>But now allace we se no signe of
his former fauour, for wisdome &amp;
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>head, strength and freindes, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and blood ioyned with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes,
are fallen before our eyes,
to let vs vnderstand what shall be
our distruction, if in time we turne
not to our God, before that his
wrathe be further kindled. But
this is not the end. For esperance,
<pb facs="tcp:13790:16"/>
(or at least some opinion) had men
before, that God shulde moue th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that she shuld abandone all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie

hath giuen answer in plaine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
that that Religion in whiche
she hath bene nourished (and that

thereof, of laite dayes
there is erected a displayed baner

<pb facs="tcp:13790:17"/>
godly deaply to considder. But
let it be granted, that we had not
fallen back from our former ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie,
that we saw not Godes angrie
face, threatning vs with more fear
full plagues to follow, that the best
parte of our nobilitie wer not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled
this Realme, nether yet that
our Souerane were ennimie to our
Religion, and that she bare no
greater fauour to flattering freres,
and to corrupted Papistes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
she doeth to our poore Preachers.</p>
            <p>Supponing we say that none of
these foresaid causes we had to
moue vs (as that we haue them all,
and mo, if that we list to recompt
them) yet is there one which if it
moue vs not to humiliation, we
showe our selues more then insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.

we thinke that the verray blinde
may see what is purposed against

with crueltie, or els to make them
to worship that blasphemous beast
who being an Idole, vsurpeth to
him selfe the Name of vniuersall

the man of sinne and perdition,
will be holden for an Apostolick

they are yet fare from the end of
