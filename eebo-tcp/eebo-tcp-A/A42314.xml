            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this unquiet age, I conceive, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo pertinent to a mans felicity, next to the enjoying of happy places, as to know where they are. And to think our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Regions of <hi>Europe</hi> receive a greater ſhare of proſperity than we in <hi>England,</hi> is (without doubt) a great miſtake. Neither doth any part of the old World make ſuch promiſes to all ſorts of men as doth the New World, commonly called <hi>America.</hi> For he that ſhall deſire to advance himſelf by his labour, will finde many places
<pb facs="tcp:57131:5"/>
where he may do it with much qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe. He that ſhall deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy much land, and live in a Civil Government under others, may finde places enough for him to pitch upon. He that ſhall deſire to command a Countrey him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and get into poſſeſſion of it, without difficulty, wil finde many Iſlands fit for his turn, that are fruitfull and deſolate, wanting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, which at ſmall charge may be tranſported thither. He that ſhall deſire to be poſſeſt of great rich mines of gold and ſilver, and precious ſtones, and large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and withall hath but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, courage, and a reaſonable Engliſh Gentlemans Eſtate, may by an ordinary Providence over him, attain to theſe great matters. And that man that ſhall have ſtore of Commodities lie by him, which he cannot vent, although they are neceſſary for mans accomodation,
<pb facs="tcp:57131:5"/>
will finde here places, that he may exchange them at, to his great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>But if the Decipherers of this Orbe had been as cautious in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down truths, as they have been prolixious in impertinencies, our Nation would certainly ere this have made greater advantages upon thoſe Regions.</p>
            <p>For, my part, as I am an Engliſh man, ſo I deſire that name and people may grow great and famous and extend their authority and name beyond either <hi>Roman, Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Aſſyrian</hi> or <hi>Perſian</hi> Nations. And if from this diſcourſe they may draw any thing that may prove for their Honour or Profit, I have my aim. And I ſhall aſſure them, I have related nothing but what my own knowledg or good intelligence perſwades me is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, which my future acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Gods leave ſhall declare.
<pb facs="tcp:57131:6"/>
I have been plain in diſcourſe of the Forreign Commerce of our Nation. All which I intended in a larger Volumn, but the Flemmings and Iriſh taking me in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from thoſe remote parts of <hi>America,</hi> took from me that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relation, which I intended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this Epitomie from thence, which I preſent with a reſolution to ſubmit to that common cenſure all Book-makers muſt undergo, but with confidence I have in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed my ſelf</p>

                  <p>The trade of <hi>Europe,</hi> doth juſtly challenge a greater Commerce then any of the other parts have, although it be the leaſt. On this conſideration, the Ports are neer

adjacent, the people more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in procuring Merchandize, and and their Comodities more in uſe with us, and ours more wanting with them, as our broad Cloth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And from theſe conſiderations, I conclude, that unleſſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> there is no equality in the trade of our Nation with the other parts of the World.</p>

                  <head>The ſecond Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>Whether the loſſe be not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the gaines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o ſome of theſe places.</p>
                  <p>As the end of all trade and mens carnall thoughts are commonly for ſilver and gold, ſo that Countrey that hath moſt of it is accounted the richeſt. And indeed it is almoſt all things, for he that hath enough of that, cannot lack any worldly thing that can be had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57131:11"/>Upon which, I conceive, that the principall ayme of all forreign trade ſhould be to bring much of it in, and carry little of it out of our Countrey, and that Commerce that doth not is managed to the diſadvantage of our Nation, and ought to be rejected.</p>
                  <p>And upon examination it will be found, that the greateſt trade which we drive in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which is to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> either by the way of <hi>Bagdet, Caro,</hi> and the red Seas, or Cape of <hi>Bona Speranza,</hi> is with ready money.</p>
                  <p>I can with confidence ſay, it may be managed ſo to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our Nation, that we may have their Commodity for ours, and their Ports better traded. And whereas it hath been the practiſe of our people to carry much money thither, we may now fetch it home again.</p>
                  <p>And the trade of <hi>America</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57131:12"/>
very diſhoneſt, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſhonourable to our Nation. It is prejudiciall, in that it carrieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way daily ſuch men as might ſerve their Country, either in fighting to defend it at home, or elſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
                  <p>'Tis diſhonourable, in that we are upbraided by all other Nations that know that trade for ſelling our own Countreymen for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of thoſe places. And, I affirm, that I have been told by the Dutch and others, that we Engliſh were worſe than the Turks, for that they ſold ſtrangers onely, and we ſold our own Countreymen. And it is well known, that people in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſome that profeſſe much to Chriſtianity of thoſe parts, will hang a man for ſelling or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away an Indian that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Devill, when at the ſame time they allow others, and will themſelves buy of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57131:12"/>
which have moſt barbarouſly been ſtolne out of their Countrey.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis diſhoneſt, if murther be ſo, for when they have by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or lying tales, forced them aboard the ſhips, in their tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation onely, there is yearly many ſtarved to death, thoſe that remain are ſold to thoſe that wil give moſt for them; ſome for fourteen years, others for ten, and leſſe, but the leaſt four: and it were better for them to ſerve fourteen years with the Turks, then four in the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with moſt of the Maſters in thoſe places, eſpecially in <hi>Virginia,</hi> for beſides, their being back-beaten and belly-beaten, it is three to one if they live out their ſervitude, by reaſon of the unwholſomeneſſe of the Countreys.</p>
                  <p>In which diſaſters that happen to our Nation, I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole their misfortunes, as if we of all <hi>Europe</hi> were of the ſeed of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57131:13"/>
                     <hi>Cham,</hi> when the <hi>Spaniard</hi> at the ſame time managed their buſineſſe ſo well, that ſcarcely will one of them ſerve in the <hi>Indies,</hi> except it be the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> or ſome great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, and I know that Nation in nothing exceeds us, but in their keeping together as one people.</p>

                  <p>Is whether the trade of <hi>England</hi> may not be increaſed.</p>
                  <p>It is not hard to imagine, when we ſee the greatneſſe of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and the little Commerce that we have with them, that it may well be increaſed. And although the trade of <hi>Europe</hi> be much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reſt, yet doth it want much of that exactneſſe which we may have in it.

                  <head>The fourth Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>Is, how it hath been hindred, and what is the let in the growth of it?</p>
                  <p>The people generally ſuppoſe 'tis the danger of the ſeas, and the little ſecurity in the parts abroad, for the Merchants Goods and ſhips. In anſwer, I affirm, the trade of the Hollanders never flouriſhed ſo as in time of War, and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were more ſtrong at Sea then ours, upon which we may conclude, it is not that that is the true cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, I finde theſe other cauſes to be the obſtruction in the trade. The firſt is, the Companies of our Nation, which fort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I account a benefit of a loſſe, according as they are eſtabliſhed and managed, in which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of <hi>England</hi> have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, which appeareth in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57131:14"/>
generall damages which themſelves and Adventurers have had with them, and few publick memorials they have erected at home or abroad that hath appeared a publick good, but divers acts have ſeemed the contrary.</p>
                  <p>And on particulars we finde, there are five Companies that are well in years amongſt us, the other which was of later eſtabliſhment, which really was the beſt (the <hi>Giney</hi> Company) is diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>And to omit the general damage that all the <hi>Inland</hi> Companies do to our Nation, which is from my purpoſe now to treat of, the five Companies of exportation are: firſt, the Cloth Company that trade into <hi>Holland, Hamborough,</hi> the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Seas, and elſewhere, with all the white Clothes exported the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, the third the <hi>Turkey,</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57131:14"/>
the fourth the <hi>Muſcovia,</hi> the fifth the Company of <hi>Greenland, alias Grinland.</hi> Of which, I conceive, the Cloth Company to be the greateſt Monopoly, for this cauſe. Beſides the ingroſſing of the commodity of white Cloth to themſelves, which is a great barre to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Nation. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of them out of the Laud, is a pernicious thing to five ſorts of men, Merchants, Seamen, Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers, Sheare-men and Diers, which laſt people receive the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt damage, although they were accounted anciently the Staple-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of our Nation. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Cloth-dreſſers and Diers, appears in the carrying away from them forty Clothes white more then are worked at home, by which it appears, that where there is one imploy'd now in that courſe, there might be forty, if it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged at home.</p>
                  <p>

And although it be in others a fault to bring it from neerer places to hinder the trade to <hi>Greenland,</hi> yet 'tis reported, they are not bound by this Law, being forced for want of ſufficient from <hi>Greenland</hi> to ſupply the Engliſh at ſecond hand.</p>
                  <p>Now, as it is clear by this I have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57131:18"/>
ſaid, that theſe Companies are a great hinderance to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of our Nation. There is alſo another, which the Merchants complain of, and that is the Dutch Nation, that daily ſo inſinuate into the trade of all places where ever they are admitted, to the putting by of the Engliſh. And were it not that we ſell our Conntreymen for the Commodity of the Engliſh Plantations, I am fully perſwaded, within a few years, we ſhould be forced to have what comes from thence at a ſecond hand from the Dutch: which in reaſon ſeems ſtrange, conſidering they export nothing but what they import, and we export much which we need not import, &amp; how thoſe that have it at a ſecond hand, ſhould ſell a thing cheaper then him that hath it at the firſt, ſeems irrationall, yet they will do it, which is done by our ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity in trade, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57131:19"/>
that are the great Complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, are the chief cauſers of their own hinderance.</p>
                  <p>But upon Examination, it will be found, that the principall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the whole World is in hands of the Engliſh, and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Provinces. And what we loſe they get. And as it is their great care, by all means, to increaſe their own Commerce, though with the ruine of ours, ſo, I conceive, it is honeſt and honourable, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour our own good, although by their hurt.</p>

                  <p>Is, Whether there may not be a courſe taken to quicken the trade and Commerce of the Engliſh Nation?</p>
                  <p>As I apprehend the Companies to be a great cauſe of hinderance in our trade, with the ill managing of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57131:19"/>
the generall trade of our Nation, ſo I think theſe things I have offered, doe in part demonſtrate it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I conceive, that if they were taken away, with ſome irregularity in trade, our Nation would not be found wanting, either in inclination to trade, or abilities for trade to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our Commerce to what height we pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe there may ariſe an Objection againſt the overthrow of Companies, in regard we ſee the Hollanders have a very flouriſhing trade in the World, although it be managed by more Companies then we have.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall to that and the ſecond hinderance which is the trade of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> affirme, the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Companies were, or ought to have been eſtabliſhed to keep up a trade ſubject to alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without fortification, and ſtrength of ſhipping, for to thoſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57131:20"/>
places that give us an equall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement by oath of Princes, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours and Agents conſtantly Leger to ſee right, and performance of Articles, there is no need of Companies, or elſe, why are they not in <hi>Europe?</hi> And where there is this ful aſſurance 'tis contrary to all ſence, that there ſhould be a mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly of the trade, and where it is not aſſured this way, or by Forts, we lie at the mercy of thoſe Princes we trade with, that permit us but for their profit, and no longer, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it is madneſſe without aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of fortification, to aſſure Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants goods and ſhips to have any Commerce with ſuch men or Countreys. And it was for this reaſon, that the Companies of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> were firſt erected. For it was propoſed that private men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a voyage, and according to the loſſe or gain of that continue or forſake the trade, and although it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57131:20"/>
were profitable; yet want of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or will would hinder them from gaining that aſſurance for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which a joynt ſtock well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged would do. And although the Hollanders come far ſhort of that perfection in trade which they might have, yet are they in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumſpect. For the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Holland,</hi> do not only forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in moſt places, where they come; but gain whole Regions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which is ſtill managed to the advantage and honour of their Common-wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies have ſo much ſwerved from this intention of their firſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting, that whereas the Dutch keep the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Provinces in awe, we are miſerable ſlaves to them. For if a Prince of <hi>India,</hi> loſeth on the ſeas by Piracy of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh or any other people of <hi>Europe,</hi> what they have in their Countrey of the Engliſh Merchants wil ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57131:21"/>
make good their loſſe. Or in caſe an Engliſh power, or French, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying, he were Engliſh, ſhould come into the Red Seas, and take ſhips bound for any <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Port, or <hi>Cameron</hi> land, and deſire trade, &amp; be ſurprized, and getting free, revenge themſelves on the goods and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the <hi>Arabs</hi> or <hi>Turkes,</hi> the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Merchants in <hi>Turkey</hi> under the Command of the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, would ſurely pay for it in their perſons and goods.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greenland</hi> Company was firſt eſtabliſhed to bring in the whole Commerce of the Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhing into <hi>England,</hi> and with much honeſty might they have barred others from comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in regard, the Engliſh were the firſt Diſcoverers of it, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of going before others, we come behinde them, and far-ſhort of the Dutch, which appoint us their leavings, inſtead of taking ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57131:21"/>The Dutch which is a ſecond hinderance to us in our Commerce, overtop us very ſtrangely, if wee ſeriouſly conſider the people, and their Country, which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within the title of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces. In which lyeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Zealand, Holland, Friſland, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi> and theſe Provinces they have entirely, the biggeſt of them no greater then <hi>Kent.</hi> They have a little part of <hi>Eaſt Flanders, Brabant,</hi> and a good part of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> which places doth not afford them common neceſſaries, for they have moſt of their fleſh from <hi>Emden, Holſten</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> their Corn from the Countreys on the Baltick ſeas, for their houſing and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, their Timber and Iron from <hi>Norway, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Lukeland,</hi> their Hemp, Pitch, and Tar, as we from <hi>Muſcovia,</hi> or the Baltick Seas. And for commodities of exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to maintain the great trade,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57131:22"/>
they have at Sea, their land is as barren and deficient, ſo that their trade conſiſts meerly in what they get from one Nation, and ſell to another. And upon a true exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it wil be found, what they have gotten from us in the <hi>Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and in or about our Country, is the foundation of all their ſtaple manufacture.</p>
                  <p>And to come to ſome perticulars, we find that the Spices of the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> the Herrings they have on our Coaſts, and our white Cloth which they dreſſe and die, is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ground of all their Commerce, all which comes to them for little, or at leaſt, no viſible payment. For we get nothing for our Herrings nor for the Spices, they have from thoſe places, which formerly were ours, and though they ſpeak of their paying for them to ſome of our Nation, yet it is not viſible to us. And the white Cloth, they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57131:22"/>
have at the third part they make of it. And although with theſe, and the other Commodities of our Countrey, as Stockings, courſe Cloth, Stuffs, &amp;c. they make the moſt of their trades, yet for thoſe they buy from us, they have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt exception. Although it were neceſſary, we did make the beſt uſe of our native Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which we miſſe as much of, as if we had never known the way of adventuring from our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                  <p>And now I have ſaid this, it is likely, that there are many will affirm, that they knew as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I relate, but the remedy is not amply propoſed. But I to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my ſelf, ſay, that I have been often in diſcourſe of this ſubject, and have not heard as much as I here ſhew to you.</p>
                  <p>And the great Phyſicians ſay, it is harder to finde out the diſeaſe,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57131:23"/>
then to preſcribe a remedy.

And when the trade of our Nation ſhall be regulated to ſuch exactneſſe, as may procure a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall profit and honour to our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it will peradventure appear as ſmall and ordinary a matter as the Navigation of <hi>America,</hi> which is now a thing of little difficulty, but was formerly accompted an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to the diſparagement of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, and amazement of the preſent.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57131:24"/>
or French is not conſiderable to the reſt.</p>
               <p>This title of <hi>America,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends as well Iſlands, as Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, the Iſlands for the moſt part lieth in the Seas on this ſide the Continent. The other of the Weſt ſide are few and ſmall, the Seas that compaſſe this Continent on the Eaſt ſide, are commonly called the North Seas; On the Weſt ſide the South Seas, which lieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and on the North end it hideth it ſelfe under the Pole; and to the South of the ſtraight of <hi>Magellan,</hi> the North and South Seas meet together, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it from the South Pole.</p>
               <p>The Continent of <hi>America</hi> in ſeven degrees of North Latitude, is very narrow from ſea to ſea, that is to ſay, from <hi>Porto Bello</hi> to <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> eight leagues, a rough &amp; rocky paſſage, from whence both North and South, the Land groweth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57131:24"/>
broad to the North be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond knowledg, and to the South, one thouſand leagues, as 'tis gueſt.</p>
               <p>It containeth divers Regions and Provinces, in which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſome good and wholſome places, other bad and unwholſome, and as there is indifferents, ſo there is extreams.</p>
               <p>And as the beſt places are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Tropicks, ſo the more north or ſouth you goe, the more barren and cold you finde the Climates, even to unſufferable extremities.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Natives of <hi>America,</hi> at this day are of three ſorts; The firſt, that live the moſt civilly, are them that live within the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57131:25"/>
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after the ſame manner that they do, in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, building, trades and Religion. The ſecond ſort, are thoſe that live under the contribution of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, Portugals, Dutch, French, &amp;c. And theſe keep ſtill their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtomes, Religions, and Manners: and theſe I ſay are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided under ſeverall Governours, or Kings, and live in Towns, ſome of which are paled round, contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſes covered with Mats, their frames of Arbour works, the beſt are made more ſubſtantiall of great Poles and mats, covered with the bark of trees, their food is what the Woods, Seas and Rivers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords naturally, and their bread of that grain we call <hi>Virginia</hi> wheat, and of this their wives plant about their Towns, whom they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome alſo to do their other houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold work, the men ſpending their time in hunting and fiſhing, being
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57131:25"/>
attended by the boys, whom they breed up to this kind of life with themſelves. And this way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving runs throughout all <hi>America,</hi> North and South, for this ſort of people.</p>
               <p>The third kind of <hi>Indians</hi> which are on the land, they call in the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Dominions</hi> (where there is the moſt of them) <hi>Chickameckians,</hi> and in the Iſlands <hi>Canables.</hi> In which ſort of people, the <hi>Craibey</hi> Iſlands do ſo abound, that they prove bad neighbours to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and French, that are there ſeated, as thoſe in the land are to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And theſe <hi>Indians</hi> live upon what they get from the ſtrangers that are neer them, &amp; the other more civil <hi>Indians:</hi> and ſome of them are ſo inhumane, that they will eat mans fleſh.

                  <hi>CHAP. 3.</hi> Of Gold, Silver, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, Emraulds, and Pearl.</head>
               <p>THe gold is engendred in the Mountains, from whence by rains and flouds into the Plains, and rivers, where for the moſt part they find it. That of the plains, is in veines of hard earth that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth part pure grains of gold like pompeon-ſeeds, which is the beſt, but the moſt that is got in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> is in the Rivers, where it is found mixed with the ſand in pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even as the ſand it ſelf. They ſeparate it from the earth, and ſand, by waſhing in a bowle of the faſhion of a Barbers baſon. Where
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57131:28"/>
they finde it in hard veines, they break them with the Hammers, and make them fit to waſh: firſt, putting the earth or ſand into the baſon, and receiving water into one ſide of it, turn it out at the other, untill they have waſhed out the earth from the gold, which as the heavier ſubſtance remains behind at the bottome of the bowle.</p>
               <p>The ſilver Mine is found in the earth in veines or branches, much like the Tinne or Cole in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and is worked almoſt in the ſame manner under the ground.</p>
               <p>The way of ſeparating the ſilver from the droſſe, is firſt to take the oare, and break it in Hammer-mils, and grind it to powder, then ſift it through a Copper ſearſe, and put it into a furnace, under which they make a fire by degrees, mixing with every fifty quarts of pouder five of ſalt, and ſtirring it, together with quick-ſilver, which they ſqueeze
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57131:28"/>
through a piece of holland upon the ſaid pouder and ſalt, and when they finde the quick-ſilver, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently incorporate with the ſilver, then they put it altogether in a Cauldron, in which there is water, and a wheel, that going round, turneth out the earth and droſſe with the water, the quick-ſilver, and ſilver, as the more heavy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance remains behind, which they take from the Cauldron, and waſh it after the manner of gold, till they finde it clean from all droſſe, and filth, and then putting it into a cloth, they ſtrain forcibly from it ſome quick-ſilver, the remainder being as a leafe of ſilver.</p>
               <p>And to ſeparate the ſilver from the quick-ſilver, they put it into a violent fire, and cover it with an earthen pot of the faſhion of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar loa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which is alſo covered with coals, and kept very hot, and from a hole in the ſaid pot, to which is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57131:29"/>
faſhioned a pipe, like the pipe of a Limbeck, they receive the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, which evacuates by the ſame pipe, leaving the ſilver of the ſame form it was put in, but wanting much of the bigneſſe and waight.</p>
               <p>The Quick-ſilver and Vermilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is found together in Rocks, or very hard earth. That part that is found to contein the quick-ſilver, they break to pieces, and putting it into earthen fire-pots well luted, they ſet it on a violent fire (made in the <hi>Indies</hi> of ſtraw, which they find to be excellent for that work) whatof it evacuateth out of the pot, goeth up, till meeting nothing to receive it, it falleth down cold, in the ſame manner we have it. The remainner in the pot, being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſeparated from the droſſe and earth, the fire is taken away, and when it is throughly cold, they open the pot, and poure out the Quick-ſilver. into leather baggs,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57131:29"/>
which keepeth it beſt, conveighing it where they pleaſe in them. Thoſe that open theſe pots, and ſtirreth the ſilver and it together, in refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſilver, ſwallow a pellet of gold, that lying in the ſtomack, draweth the Quick-ſilver, which in time getteth into their bodies, from whence it goeth out with the ſaid pellet in excrement. And if the pot be not throughly cold, when 'tis open; it is two to one, if they loſe not their teeth or hair, diſ-figure their noſes and faces, and many times utterly ſpoile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Wherefore, they are very cautious in this action.</p>
               <p>The Emraulds are in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance in divers parts of the Spaniſh Countreys, they get them in veines of ſtone, that is almoſt like chryſtal, ſome as big as a hazel nut, and of ſeverall colours, as whitiſh, green and white, and the moſt perfect abſolute green.</p>

They be in the hand of the Spaniard, almoſt without peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> that is the chief, and in 18, 19, 20 degrees, and 150 leagues Eaſt and Weſt, hath but one City, no Town nor Village, but what is inhabited by Negro's, that are ſervants to the Spaniards. Here is a perpetuall Summer, the Winter being but the rain that falleth.</p>
               <p>This Land is exceeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57131:37"/>
and hath divers Vallies, one being ſo great, as to reach from the one ſide of the Island to other, that hath many golden rivers iſſuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, which Vallies are always ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with multitudes of wilde kine, goats, hogs, ſhag-hair'd ſheep and horſes, amongſt which, as their deadly enemy, are many wild dogs, that are bred of ſuch as have been loſt a hunting, and run away from the Spaniards: the woods have abundance of Oranges, Limons, Limes, Cotton-wool and Plantens, and many green Birds.</p>
               <p>The commodities the Spaniards yearly export from thence is Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Sugar, Cotton-wool, <hi>Caſſia, Fiſtula, Saſaprila,</hi> and <hi>Lignum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae;</hi> with Tallow, and a hundred thouſand hides, which are yearly gotten of thoſe wild cattell, which are the largeſt of the world.</p>
               <p>There are divers Rivers that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford gold, and ſome Mines which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57131:37"/>
are not now worked, great plenty of Copper and other minerall.</p>
               <p>The City where the Spaniards dwel, is called <hi>Santo Domingo,</hi> it ſtandeth on the South ſide of the Island neer the Eaſt end, on the Weſt-ſide, the River <hi>Oſama</hi> in 19 degrees and a half, fairly built with ſtone, and walled about with a Caſtle on the ſaid River, between the Town and the Sea. Here are reſident the Supream Council of the Islands, the Officers of the goods and royall treaſure, a Mint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and the Cathedrall, that hath for ſufferance the Biſhoprick, of <hi>Cuba Portrico, Feneſcula,</hi> and the Abbotſhip of <hi>Jamecca.</hi> Here are alſo Monaſteries of <hi>Franciſcans, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans,</hi> and Mercenaries; and two Nunneries, a Grammar-ſchool, and an Hoſpitall.</p>
               <p>The people in this City, live in great pleaſure, enjoying, beſide the foreſaid plenty of fleſh, many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

               <p>THis Island lyeth Weſt from <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and is 200 leagues long Eaſt and Weſt, the broadeſt part not 45.

but Copper is here in greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.

The other is a fountain of a kind of pitch which runneth continually. All the Natives here, as well as at <hi>Hiſpaniolia,</hi> are deſtroyed by the Spaniards, but in both places they have ſtore of Negro ſervants: their delicateſt fare in this Island is Patridges, which are in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.

               <p>This harbour is counted an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good one for ſecurity of Ships, but on the South-eaſt part of the Island, there is the harbour or port of Saint <hi>James,</hi> which for greatneſſe and goodneſſe, is eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one of the beſt in the World.</p>
               <p>It lyeth 40 leagues from Cape <hi>Tibron,</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> in 20 degrees. It hath the City of Saint <hi>James</hi> ſtanding on the ſide of it, two miles from the Sea.

It lyeth in 13 degrees 30 minutes, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly inhabited with Engliſh, and Negroes their ſervants. This Iland flouriſheth ſo much, that it hath more people and Commerce then all the Ilands of the <hi>Indies:</hi> Their principall Commodity is Sugar of the worſt ſort, <hi>Indico</hi> and ſome Cotton-wool and little To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco. Here are pieces of eight in greateſt plenty of any Engliſh
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57131:47"/>
Plantation in <hi>America.</hi> in ſo much that of late they buy and ſell moſt ſmall matters for ready money: it is ſtrong in men, but no fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yet perfected, and not eaſily brought under by a common way of war. There are ſtore of Oxen and Kine in this Plantation, as alſo Swine which they keep up in pends, &amp; horſes, but by reaſon of the great number of inhabitants and occaſion for Beaſts of draught and burthen, cattell is a good commodity, ſo is all kind of proviſion, and it yeildeth the beſt return. It hath divers fruits and poultrey: and as there is a greater trade here then in the reſt of the Islands, yet in regard the ſellers are, well matched by the buyers, I conceive it the worſt Plantation to goe to either to live or make a Voyage and returne. For what is here, is as well in the reſt of the Islands, and much more conveniency to plant, for here they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57131:47"/>
have too many people, and in them there is too few, and in moſt of them ground enough.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57131:48"/>
of the Indians make much of that tobacco, which is ſold in <hi>Spain,</hi> for Spaniſh tobacco, to the Engliſh, and others.</p>
               <p>The moſt Orientall part of it is the point <hi>De la Jaleria,</hi> from whence du North lyeth the ſmall Iland of <hi>Tobago,</hi> compaſſed with Ilets: in the South-ſide is the round point <hi>Andrada,</hi> and on the Weſt-ſide the gulf of <hi>Paria,</hi> which lyeth between it and the firm land: to the North are Saint <hi>Vincents</hi> and <hi>Granado,</hi> two little Ilands.</p>

is 16 leagues Eaſt and Weſt, and the half in breadth: it hath but little water, yet plentifull of paſture, and many Cattle, with two Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh towns, which ſtandeth neer the Sea: it hath a Fortreſſe to defend it, and a good harbour, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Town: in this Fortreſſe, reſides the Governour, and treaſure for the King of Spains cuſtomes, of Pearl, which is worth at the leaſt fifty thouſand pounds yearly.</p>
               <p>And two leagues from this town within the land is the other, whoſe inhabitants are moſt Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but that on the Sea is poſſeſt by Merchants, &amp; divers for pearls, which are in good plenty on this coaſt.

               </head>
               <p>THat which is moſt remarkable in this north part of <hi>America,</hi> is the ſtraight of the north weſt paſſage, which is generally talked of, and indeed is nothing but a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row difficult paſſage to <hi>Buttons</hi> Bay, the entrance being properly called <hi>Hudſons</hi> Straight, in regard of his firſt finding it: the mouth of this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57131:50"/>
ſtraight lyeth in 62 degrees, and becauſe of the impoſſibility of this Mathematicall ſtory, I ſhall ſay, there is certainly no ſuch Straight, as this which they call <hi>Anian,</hi> or the north-weſt paſſage: it hath been ſo thorowly ſearched into by our Nation that can give no incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to a farther trial, ſave that ſtory men tel of a Manuſcript in <hi>Portugall,</hi> ſhewed to one of our Merchants of the paſſage that way, of a Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſhip of the <hi>Phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ipinus</hi> droven from thence by foule weather, through this ſtraight to <hi>Portugall,</hi> but to men that know the diſtance between that ſtreight, and thoſe Ilands, it would ſeem the moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous ſtory in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the falſity of the Informers: the Greeks relation being a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtory, for he ſaith in regard he was taken by Squire <hi>Candis</hi> in the South-ſea, and loſt all he had, to procure ſome relief in his old age, he would adviſe the Engliſh a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57131:50"/>
way to the <hi>East-Indies</hi> then they now took. And this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he giveth after he is retired to his Native Country, to repoſe from his troubleſome way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing to Sea. From whence we may eaſily gueſſe, for the bad turn our Nation did him, he would not wiſh us a good one, but the ſcope of his intelligence being but to have a bill of exchange to receive money, as he pretended to come into <hi>England.</hi> But how likely it was, that he would leave thoſe rich parts of <hi>America,</hi> which he lived in with the Spaniards to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to his own Nation, and from thence to undertake a Voyage for us to the worſt place in the World, a rationall man cannot apprehend. But were there ſuch a paſſage, it would much more concern the Por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tugals, and the Spaniards, then it doth the Engliſh, for their trade is to the north part of the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57131:51"/>
and ours to the ſouth: theirs to the <hi>Moluccos, Philipinaes, Japan,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> whereas we ſeldome paſſe beyond <hi>Bantam</hi> in <hi>Java,</hi> but were there a paſſage that way, yet it were not to be choſen before the other, for could a man ſail in a ſtrait line: firſt, from <hi>England</hi> to the ſtraight, and then from the ſtraight to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> it would prove a farther way than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Cape of <hi>Bonaſpei.</hi> But thoſe that know any thing of thoſe ſeas, know that the ſea courſe to any part of north <hi>America</hi> is as low as 23, 24, 25, or 30 the higheſt. For the wind which bloweth in the ſouth ſea eaſt and weſt, as well as in the north, that is to ſay, for the moſt part weſt without the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, and almoſt conſtantly Eaſt within them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore you muſt go out of your way aſwell from the north part of <hi>America,</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:57131:51"/>
as from <hi>England</hi> to this ſuppoſed Straight: and there is as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in relation to pleaſantneſſe in voyages, as between ſummer and winter. For when you are clean of the Bay of <hi>Biſcai</hi> in all the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, by the Cape you find no cold weather till you return to the ſame place again, but to the contrary, is ſo cold &amp; icy about the Straight in the middle of Summer, that there is no making way without much difficulty and trouble.</p>
               <p>And in the ſouth ſea, where the Sun keeps the ſame courſe as in the north in <hi>June,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in compaſſing the world found ſo much cold in thirty eight degrees north latitude, that he was forced into a ſoutherly courſe.</p>
               <p>And this makes a ſtrong proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that there is no ſea to the north of <hi>America,</hi> but that the land of this New world reacheth by the north parts; even to the northward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And thoſe parts of <hi>America,</hi> that are in that height are cold, almoſt the whole year through, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers in the north paſſage plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, and this is cauſed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by the land-wind, which that height for the moſt part blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth weſt, and northwardly, which is ſo much more colder, in regard it cometh from thoſe vaſt Regions that are far thicker and untill'd

Quito</hi> lyeth between <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Popyan</hi> on the ſouth ſea, and far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land under the Equinoctiall line: and contrary to the opinion of the Ancients, it is a moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome temperate Countrey, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cold than hot in moſt parts of it. In thoſe places where the ſnowes continue all the year, it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from <hi>October</hi> to <hi>March,</hi> which they call winter: this province is rich in Mines of Emraulds, and

gold, ſilver and quick-ſilver, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull of Engliſh grain and cattle, horſe and ſwine. This Region is happy in the temperature of the air, there being neither extream cold nor heat, as lying Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to theſe Extreams, and which is moſt delightfull to mans nature always, a cleer skie. The Spaniſh towns are the City of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> 60 leagues from the ſouth ſea, and half a league to the north of the Equinoctiall: in it are reſident the Councill, the Officers of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Kings Revenues, and a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall with three Monaſteries. The town of <hi>Bamba</hi> lyeth ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt from <hi>Quito,</hi> on a river of that name. It is poſſeſt by Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and Indians, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream rich inſheep above any town of <hi>India.</hi> The City of <hi>Loxein</hi> ſtandeth in the way from <hi>Quito</hi> to <hi>Coſco:</hi> there are many other Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Inland towns which are great

               <p>It hath a good port on a river that runneth fair by the City fit for veſſels of great burthen.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Porto Vivegio</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on the ſea neer the borders of <hi>Peru,</hi> the Indians of this place have red warts that ſometimes grow on their Noſes and Foreheads, Cheeks and Chins, which eateth as a ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm with us, but far more to the diſ-figuring the face, and in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of pain.</p>
               <p>The river and port of <hi>Tombes</hi> is in 4 degrees, and ſouth of it the Ile of <hi>Pana,</hi> the port of <hi>Calaio</hi> in two degrees height ſouth latitude, by which ſtandeth the Ile of <hi>Plata,</hi>

               <p>This province hath formerly had great Gyants living there, as appeareth by the great bones often found, and pieces of teeth, which have weighed fourteen ounces.</p>
               <p>Neer the ſaid point of <hi>Helena,</hi> there are veins of Tar, which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth out of the earth, with which they commonly cank their ſhips.</p>
