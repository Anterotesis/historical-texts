            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRYAL OF PHILIP Earl of PEMBROKE, On Thurſday <hi>April</hi> 4. 1678.</head>
            <p>ABout Nine of the Clock the Priſoner with his Guard came from the Tower, with the Ax before him, and went into the Room appointed for him. Between the hours of Eleven and Twelve at Noon, the Lords, Judges, and Aſſiſtants of the Houſe, came in order, two and two, from the Houſe of Lords, to the Court erected in <hi>Westminſter-</hi>Hall, with four Maces before them, and before the Lord High-Steward four more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his own Serjeant and Purſe-bearer, with Garter King at Arms, and the Deputy Black-rod bearing the White Staff. After Obeiſance made to the Throne, each Lord, and the others, took their places, the Serjeants, with their Maces erect, kneeling, four on each ſide of the Throne.</p>
            <p>Then the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery on the right hand, and the Clerk of the Crown in the Kings-Bench on the left hand, making three Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to the Lord High-Steward, came up to his Seat, and there both kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery delivered the Commiſſion for the Office of High-Steward <hi>(pro hac vice)</hi> to his Grace, who delivered it to the Clerk of the Crown in the Kings-Bench to read, and then they both in the ſame manner went back to their Seats at the Table.</p>
            <p>Then the Clerk of the Crown in the Kings-Bench ſaid as followeth.</p>

               <speaker>Serjeant at Arms.</speaker>
               <p>O yes, O yes, O yes: My Lord High-Steward of <hi>England</hi> ſtraitly chargeth and commandeth all manner of perſons here aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to keep ſilence, and give ear to his Majeſties Commiſſion, unto my Lord High-Steward his Grace directed, upon pain of Impriſonment.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then all the Peers and Aſſiſtants ſtanding up, and uncovered, he read the Commiſſion <hi>in haec verbae.</hi>

            </sp>
            <p>Then Garter and the Uſher that held the Staff, making three Reverences to his Grace, Garter on his knees preſented him the white Staff, which his Grace delivered to the Uſher, who likewiſe kneeled to hold the ſame, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reſt of the Ceremony.</p>

            </sp>
            <p>The Conſtable of the Tower of <hi>London</hi> being a Peer, by Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> his Lieutenant returned his Precept, and with the Ax born on his left hand, the edge from him, the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> was brought to the Bar, the Lord High-Steward of <hi>England</hi> having then ordered the Judges to be covered, ſpake to the Priſoner as followeth.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord High-Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> Your Lordſhip is now brought before this Great Aſſembly in order to your Tryal, wherein you have to maintain all that can concern you in this World, your Eſtate, your Honour, and your Life it ſelf. There is no leſs a Crime charged on you, than the Murther of one of the King's Subjects, and this is not charged on you by common Voice and Fame, nor by the growing Rumour of the multitude, but by the grand Inqueſt of this County, which was made up of Gentlemen of good Quality and Conſideration. Though all this amount to no more than a bare Accuſation, (for God forbid that they who neither did nor could hear the Evidence on both ſides, ſhould any way prejudge your Tryal by their partial Examination) yet it hath produced the preſentment of ſuch a Crime, as is attended with extraordinary and unuſual Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>And now for this Fact your Lordſhip is to be tryed in full Parliament, and your Arraignment is to be made as full and as ſolemnly as is poſſible. The King (who will have a ſtrict account of the Bloud of the meaneſt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by whomſoever it is ſhed) hath for this purpoſe appointed an High-Steward: And now your Lordſhip is to be tryed not by a ſelect number of Lords, but by the whole Houſe of Peers, who are met together to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition for this Bloud.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs the ſhame of being made a Spectacle to ſuch an Aſſembly as this, and the having a man's faults and weakneſſes expoſed to the notice and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſuch a Preſence as this is, to a generous Mind muſt needs be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance worſe than death it ſelf; for he that outlives his own Honour, can have very little joy in whatſoever elſe he lives to poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a ſtate and condition as this is, it will be very fit for your Lordſhip to recollect your ſelf with all the care and caution you can; it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for you to make uſe of the beſt temper, and the beſt thoughts you have, when you come to make your defence; let not the diſgrace of ſtanding as a Felon at the Bar, too much deject you; no man's credit can fall ſo low, but that if he bear his ſhame as he ſhould do, and profit by it as he ought to do, it is in his own power to redeem his reputation. Therefore let no man deſpair, that deſires and endeavours to recover himſelf again, much leſs let the terrors of Juſtice affright you; for though your Lordſhip have great cauſe to fear,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99400:3"/>
yet whatever may be lawfully hoped for, your Lordſhip may expect from the Peers.</p>
               <p>It is indeed juſt cauſe of dreadful apprehenſions, when you conſider how ſtrict and impartial the Judicature is which you ſtand before, and how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it is that any Conſideration of your Lordſhips Relation or Family, ſhall have any kind of Ingredience into their Lordſhips Judgement; nay you have cauſe to fear all this will make againſt you, when you conſider how the Quality of the Offendor doth aggravate the Crime.</p>
               <p>You have reaſon to fear and be diſmayed again, when you conſider how ſevere, and how inexorable the Rule of Law is, in the Caſe of Bloud; and how certain it is that the Lords will make that Rule of Law the meaſure of your Life or Death: But yet, my Lord, there are other Conſiderations that may ſupport you.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip may be ſure that they will receive no proof againſt you, but direct and poſitive Evidence; it will not be left to any proof, but ſuch proof, as by the manifeſt plainneſs of it, deſerves to be called Evidence. In the next place, your Lordſhip ſhall ſuffer no prejudice for want of Councel, for where there are any advantages that the Law can give you, this Court takes it ſelf obliged in Honour to put you in mind of it; nor can your Lordſhip ſuffer an Inconvenience, by having Councel to plead againſt you, for no Arguments nor skill can pervert their Lordſhips Juſtice; you ſhall not fall by the charms of Eloquence; nothing ſhall load or preſs you but your own Crime, and even that burthen may be alleviated, if there be any room for an Abatement, ſo far as it doth not contradict what they owe to the King, to themſelves, to the Law, and to the Juſtice of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Hearken therefore (my Lord) to your Indictment with patience and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, give no Interruption to the Councel or Witneſſes that ſpeak againſt you, and reſerve what you have to ſay for your ſelf till the time come, when your Witneſſes ſhall be examined, and you make your Defence, of which I will give you notice. And this you may rely upon, that when you do come to ſpeak for your ſelf, you ſhall be heard with as much favour and candor as the matter will bear; and when my Lords have heard all that can be ſaid on both ſides, doubtleſs their Lordſhips will give ſuch a Judgement in the Caſe, as is fit for you to receive, ſuch a Judgement as becomes this great Court, and ſuch a Judgement as is ſuitable to that known Equity, which their Lordſhips do always obſerve in all their proceedings.</p>

            <p>Then Sir <hi>William Dolben</hi> Knight, the King's Serjeant at Law, Recorder of the City of <hi>London,</hi> opened the Indictment thus:</p>

               <speaker>Sir <hi>William Dolben.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace my Lord High-Steward of <hi>England,</hi> and the reſt of my Noble Lords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Montgomery</hi> ſtands indicted, for that he, the 4th. day of <hi>February</hi> laſt, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Martins in the Fields,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> of his malice fore-thought, did make an aſſault upon one <hi>Nathaniel Cony,</hi> in God and the King's peace there being; and that he the ſaid <hi>Philp</hi> Earl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with his right Fiſt, on the left part of the Head of the ſaid <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> then and there feloniouſly did ſtrike and bruiſe, and with his right Fiſt aforeſaid, him did caſt and throw down to the ground, and being ſo on the ground with his Feet did kick and ſtrike, of which ſaid ſtriking, bruiſing and kicking, the ſaid <hi>Nathaniel Cony,</hi> from the ſaid 4th. of <hi>February,</hi> to the 10th. of <hi>February</hi> following, did languiſh, and then died; and ſo the Jurors do upon their Oaths ſay, That the ſaid <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> &amp;c. the ſaid <hi>Nathaniel Cony,</hi> at the Pariſh and County aforeſaid, feloniouſly, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of his malice fore-thought, did murther, againſt the King's peace, his Crown and Dignity. To this Indictment the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> hath pleaded not guilty, and put himſelf upon his Peers for his Tryal: We who are of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99400:4"/>
Councel for the King, ſhall produce our Evidence to confirm this Accuſation, with what it is, and of what nature, his Majeſties Attorney-General will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaine your Grace, and the reſt of you my Noble Lords.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> (who being called by Writ, as Aſſiſtant to the Houſe, was within the Bar) opened the Evidence to this effect.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace my Lord High Steward of <hi>England,</hi> and the reſt of my Noble Lords; <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Montgomery</hi> ſtands here Indicted for the Murther of <hi>Nathaniel Cony:</hi> That my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> was the cauſe of his death, I humbly conceive will need very little queſtion before your Lordſhips, for we have ſuch proof that it was his hand threw him down, and his feet that trod upon him and kicked him, which was the cauſe of his death, that it cannot be denied: but whether or no this killing amount to Murther, may be a matter of further controverſie; and I hold it my duty to acquaint your Grace and my Lords, what the proof is, and then what we have to offer to prove it to be an offence even of this nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi> I know to maintain an Indictment of Murther, there muſt be a proof of Malice; but the Law is plain (your Lordſhips know it, and my Lords the Judges will tell it you) that there are two ſorts of Malice, the one is Malice expreſs'd, and that is when a man can be proved to have born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand an ill will and hatred to the perſon he killed; this ſort of Malice we pretend not to be in this caſe: But there is another ſort of Malice, which alſo in Law gives the denomination of Murder to the killing of a man, which is Malice implied, when any one ſhall without any provocation given by the party ſlain, bring another by violence to his Death: For our Law ſuppoſeth, and that upon good ground, that no man without a Provocation would kill his Brother, unleſs he had Malice to him before-hand; and that is the Malice that falls out to be the Ingredient of this caſe, for the poor unfortunate Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that was killed, did not for ought that did appear to me, (and I have had all the proof given at the Coroners Inqueſt under my Examination) give the leaſt Provocation to this Noble Lord. Some have thought that a perſon might be guilty of malicious Murther, though the party killed had given the Murtherer a blow; but I ſhall not contend for ſo ſtrict a conſtruction of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, for there was not in this caſe a blow ſtruck, no nor an angry word given: all that I can find came from Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> was, to complain that a Friend of his that came into the Company with him, was turned out of doors; and ſure ſuch a thing will never be taken to be a Provocation, at leaſtwiſe ſuch a one as will take away Malice implied. I ſhall now (my Lord) give your Lordſhips an account of the nature of our Evidence, as to the Fact, and that (my Lords) in ſhort; for as I ſhall not uſe any aggravation above what the Cauſe requires, ſo I ſhall not tire your Grace, and my Lords, with any long Speech, but barely open the Evidence, and tell you in ſhort what will come in proof before you.</p>
               <p>It was on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 3d. of <hi>February,</hi> that my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and his Company were drinking at the Houſe of one <hi>Long</hi> in the <hi>Hay Market,</hi> (I am ſorry to hear the day was no better imployed by them) and it was the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of this poor Gentleman, together with one Mr. <hi>Goring,</hi> to come into this Houſe to drink a Bottle of Wine; my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> ſaw them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and knowing Mr. <hi>Cony,</hi> was very importunate with him to joyn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: he at firſt refuſed, becauſe of his Friend, and told his Lordſhip they had buſineſs together; but no denial he would take, and ſo at laſt they did go
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99400:5"/>
into my Lord's Room. After ſome diſtance of time, when it was near twelve of the Clock at Night, there fell out a difference between my Lord, and Mr. <hi>Goring,</hi> (the Gentleman that came in with Mr. <hi>Cony)</hi> who (it ſeems) gave my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> ſome words, which provoked him to expreſs his diſtaſte of them, by throwing a Glaſs of Wine in his face; which injury Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> ſo far reſented, as that he was about to draw his Sword, but was prevented by ſome of the Company, and put out of the Room to avoid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief. This Gentleman Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> that was killed, was not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the matter of the difference, but only deſired to go out of the Room, that he might look after his Friend who was thruſt out of doors. He knew not why, (without any Provocation, as you will hear by and by) my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> falls upon him, ſtrikes him with one blow to the ground, and when he was there trod upon him on his Back, on his Belly, on his Side, and kicked him ſo that the poor Gentleman fell into a Swound, and was after ſome time, with ſome difficulty brought to himſelf again: after they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there was Life in him, they lifted him up, and laid him down on ſome Chairs that were in the Room, and thinking too much had been done by them already, they take their leaves of him, and commit him to the care of the Drawer. He was not (as it ſhould ſeem) ſo carefully attended by the Drawer, whoſe ignorance could not look after him as his condition required, and ſo fell down off the Chairs again divers times. After ſome time, early in the morning he was carried away in a Sedan to his own Lodging, and being there put to Bed, as he did grow a little more and more recovered out of his ſtupefaction, ſo he grew more and more in pain, and ſent for Doctors and Chirurgeons to conſult with, by whom he had all the means uſed that was poſſible to have ſaved his Life; but it proved there was ſo much Bloud forced out of his Veins, and gathered into one place of his Body, by thoſe Blows and Bruiſes, that he could not be recovered, and ſo after a Weeks time paſſed in intolerable pain, died: But yet all the time of his dying, and even conſtantly to his death, he did complain that it was my Lord's Bruiſes brought him into that condition. It will alſo be proved, that after his death, upon view of the Body by the Coroner and his Jury, there was the appearances of thoſe Blows and Abuſes, by broad Bruiſes in ſeveral parts of the Body, and this ſome of the Jury will teſtifie. This in ſhort is the matter of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which we ſhall briefly prove, and then ſubmit it all to your Lordſhips Judgment.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99400:5"/>
3d. of <hi>February</hi> laſt, dine in the City, we ſtayed very late there, and I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly confeſs, we had drank more than was fit for us to have done; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that (if it pleaſe your Grace) I offered to ſet down Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> at his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but he was ſo very ceremonious, that he would ſee me at home; it ſeems <hi>Long</hi>'s Houſe, the Tavern in the <hi>Hay-market,</hi> was in the way, and Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> would needs have us drink another bottle of Wine ere we parted: It was late, and the door ſhut, but we knocking pretty hard for admittance, did get it opened, and as ſoon as the door was opened, Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> went towards the Bar, and made ſome noiſe, being in drink; my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> was then in a low room in the Houſe, and knowing Mr. <hi>Cony,</hi> (as I thought) came and asked him, if he would come in and drink with him; he replied, My Lord, I am with a Friend, and we have ſome buſineſs together: At length my Lord asked me very civilly to come in, and we did after ſome time come in; and when we were in, my Lord drank to me, as I remember, and we ſtood round the Table a while, and at laſt ſate down in ſome Chairs, for we were not ſo much our ſelves as to be able to ſtand all the while; then there was, it ſeems, ſome Diſpute between my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and me, wherein my Lord did conceive I had done him ſome injury, and threw a glaſs of Wine in my face.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Goring.</speaker>
               <p>Truly (may it pleaſe your Grace) I cannot remember all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, becauſe I was ſo much in drink at that time; they ſay, it was about Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Play, I cannot poſitively ſay what it was; but after my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> roſe up to draw his Sword, and I laid my hand on mine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Well Sir; and what followed then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Goring.</speaker>
               <p>Captain <hi>Savage</hi> ſtept in between my Lord and me, and the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came buſtling about, and took me and ſhoved me out of the room; while I was thruſting out, I heard a noiſe behind me, and I ſee my Lord make ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what towards Mr. <hi>Cony;</hi> but more I cannot ſay what was done, becauſe Mr. <hi>Savage</hi> was between my Lord and me. When I was out of the room, I found my Sword gone, and my Hat and Perriwig; I then made a noiſe at the door, and would not go away till I had recovered my things; the Man of the Houſe (who was in bed, it ſeems, for he was then undreſt, and in his night-Gown) came and asked me, what was the matter? I told him, I had been in that room with my Lord of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> where I had received ſome ill uſage, and had loſt my Hat and Perriwig, and they had broken a piece of my Sword, and taken it from me, which I deſired to have again; and (ſaid I) Mr. <hi>Cony,</hi> I doubt, is in danger, for there is quarrelling within, and I deſired to come in to ſee what they did with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Well Sir; when you came in, what then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Goring.</speaker>
               <p>Upon this, the Maſter of the Houſe did deſire me to go into a room, and a Gentle woman (his Siſter, as I after underſtood) did alſo preſs me to go into another room, and promiſed they would bring Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> to me; upon which I went into a room there by, but it was ſomething long before I heard from them; and being under ſome impatience, they at laſt came and told me, Now, Sir, you may go in, if you pleaſe: when I came in, I found a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman lying along upon the Chairs, and no body elſe in the room; I began to be ſuſpicious (for I was then, as I thought, ſomewhat ſoberer) that he had ſome Wound, and took the Candle and walked about him, and would fain have awakened him, but could not by all my endeavours; the Drawer told
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99400:6"/>
me, he was only dead-drunk, and would in a little time come to himſelf; upon which I deſired them to lay ſome Blankets upon him, and ſome Pillows under him, and ſet ſome more Chairs, to make the place broader, that he might not fall down; and I ordered the Drawer to be ſure to watch, with him till he awaked, and make a good fire, which he promiſed to do.</p>
               <p>The next day Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> ſent to my Lodging to come and ſee him, but I did not that day, becauſe I did go out early, and did not return till late; but the very next day after, (being <hi>Tueſday)</hi> when I came to him, <hi>Harry,</hi> (ſaid he) I was very much abuſed the other night in my Lord's company; I am ſorry for that (ſaid I) with all my heart; and I asked him, how he came to be abuſed? My Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> (ſaid he) threw me down, and there ſome body trod upon me and kicked me, and he ſhall know that he has abuſed me, and that I expect ſatisfaction for it, I hope you will let him know ſo much, and carry him a Challenge from me: Mr. <hi>Cony,</hi> (ſaid I) who did tread upon you? I know not, (ſaid he) for I was in a ſwound, either my Lord of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> or ſome of his Creatures for him. I never had the honour to know my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> before, nor above one or two of the Gentlemen that were with him then in the company.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99400:6"/>
making a great noiſe at the Bar, my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> being in a lower Room, looked out at the door, and ſeeing who it was, my Lord ſaluted him very kindly, and told him he was glad to ſee him, and deſired him to wall into his Room. Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> told him he had a Friend at door, and deſired his Lordſhip to admit him, which my Lord embraced very kindly: and then Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> goes to the door and calls Mr. <hi>Goring,</hi> deſiring him to come in, and they came together into the Room; my Lord deſired them to ſit down and drink a Glaſs of Wine, which they did, and after ſome time falling into diſcourſe, Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> began to make uſe of ſome impertinent language to my Lord, and amongſt the reſt told him he was as good, or a better Gentleman then he was.</p>

               <p>Yes, <hi>Goring</hi> did; upon which my Lord threw a Glaſs of Wine in his face, and immediately ſtept back and drew his Sword: Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to draw, but I came up to him, and took his Sword from him, and broke a piece of it, and upon my perſwaſion my Lord put up his Sword again; but for fear there might be more words, I took Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> in my arms, and ſhoved him out of the Room: and whilſt I was thruſting him out of doors, I heard a noiſe of a Buſtle behind me, and leaving the Drawer to keep Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> out, I ſaw my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> ſtrike <hi>Cony</hi> with his right hand, who immediately fell down, and then gave him a kick; and ſo upon that, finding him not ſtir, I took Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> being on the ground, (I and my Lord together, for I was not ſtrong enough to do it my ſelf) and laid him on the Chairs, and covered him up warm, and ſo left him.</p>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Savage.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Savage.</speaker>
               <p>We laid him upon ſome Chairs gently, for his Pulſe was almoſt gone, that we could feel.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Not long; for I asked him if he knew me, he ſeemed to ſhake his head, as if he did, and then cloſed his Eyes again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Savage.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell, I was then putting <hi>Goring</hi> out of the Room, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the noiſe of my Lord's motion towards <hi>Cony,</hi> I looked back and ſaw my Lord ſtrike him.</p>

               <p>I went two days afterwards to ſee Mr. <hi>Cony,</hi> who told me he was then in a pretty good condition: He asked me whether my Lord had ſtruck him? I told him, yes: Truly ſaid he I did not know that my Lord had ſtruck me, but finding my ſelf ſo much in pain, I thought I had faln, partly through my drink, and partly through my Fits I uſed to have.</p>

               <p>I did (my Lord) ſee him kick him once, but not with any great force, as I conceive.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fitz-Pat.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I was in the Room at <hi>Longs</hi> with my Lord of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi> and my Lord was walking about the Room, and he hears a noiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and ſteps to the door, where opening the door half, he ſaw Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> at the Bar, who was juſt come in, and ſeeing my Lord, comes to ſalute him, my Lord returning into the Room, ſaid to him, Will you come in and joyn Company? Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> anſwered, I have my Friend here my Lord, and brings Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> to my Lord, who ſaluted him kindly, and deſired them both to walk in: Upon which, all we that were in the Room ſtood up, and the Drawer gave them Chairs; after the drinking about of a glaſs or two, Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> (both being drunk) ſaid, amongſt other diſcourſe, I will drink, I will play, I will fight with any man. Who is this Gentleman, ſaid my Lord of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> that I ſhould never hear of, or know him? How, ſaid <hi>Goring,</hi> ('S Blood) not hear of me? My Name is <hi>Goring,</hi> a Name and Family as good as any Gentleman's in <hi>England:</hi> There is no body doubts it, ſaid my Lord: Your Betters, ſaid <hi>Goring;</hi> and then my Lord threw the Wine in his Face; and <hi>Goring</hi> going to draw, was put out of the Room by Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> and my Lord, upon ſome words from <hi>Cony,</hi> ſtruck him down with his Hand.</p>

               <speaker>Fitz-Pat.</speaker>
               <p>When I asked my Lord the reaſon why he ſtruck <hi>Cony,</hi> he told me, it was becauſe <hi>Cony</hi> had told him <hi>Goring</hi> ſhould not go out of the Room till he knew the reaſon of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>No, not I, but my Lord upon my asking gave that for the reaſon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. St.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fitz-Pat.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> told him, <hi>Goring</hi> ſhould not go out of the Room, till he knew ſome reaſon for it: After my Lord had ſtruck him, I was on the other ſide of the Table, and could not ſee whether my Lord did ſtamp on him, or kick him; but I ſee my Lord's Knee ſtir, and if he did kick him, he kickt him but once, for we ran in and took him up to lay him upon the Chairs, and taking his Handkerchief out of his Pocket to wipe his face, we pluckt out of his Pocket with it ſome falſe Dice, which we afterwards put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Mr. <hi>Long,</hi> to prove that they intended and propoſed Play; and after we had laid him on the Chairs, and wrapt him up warm, we left him.</p>

               <p>He open'd his Eyes, but being very drunk before, could not keep them open, but ſhut them again; and we made a Bed for him on the Chairs, and having wrapt him up warm, we left him and ordered the Drawer to make him a fire.</p>

               <p>No, my Lord: Mr. <hi>Savage</hi> ſpoke to him, and asked him, if he knew him; he only lookt on him, and by a turn of his Head ſeemed to anſwer him yes.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace, All that I can evidence in particular of Mr. <hi>Cony</hi>'s Sickneſs was this: On Monday morning after his being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> I was ſent for to come to Mr. <hi>Cony</hi>'s Lodgings, and about Ten of the Clock I came; he was then in extremity of pain in both Shoulders, ſo that he could not move, and his pains were ſo acute; that he could not admit of touching: Upon the abating of thoſe pains by my applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the next day, he then began to complain of pains in his Belly, but thoſe not ſo extream as thoſe in his Shoulders; after ſome applications thereto, he complain'd of both, but in a little time was ſo eaſed, that he kept well all night, and till nine or ten the next morning. The next day, which was <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> when I came to ſee him, I told him of the common report of his being kickt; he ſeemed diſpleaſed that ſuch a thing ſhould be reported, and throwing down the Bed-cloaths, ſhewed me his Belly, but I could not ſee any blemiſh upon it then, either by diſcolouring or bruiſing; I found him indeed very backward in receiving Remedies, but left him then in a hopeful way of recovery, but ſaw him not after, becauſe being ſick my ſelf, I could not attend him.</p>

The <hi>Friday</hi> and <hi>Saturday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, I was with him all day, he complained of great griefs in his Belly, he ſaid, he had great torment there, and believed he had received ſome ill uſage lately, which occaſioned theſe pains.</p>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, I was one of the Coroner's Inqueſt, which after view of the Body went into another Houſe; but ſome of us ſeeing the Body ſwelled at that rate as it was, and being unſatisfied of the cauſe, went back again to look upon it, and there I ſaw upon his right Breaſt a great black Bruiſe; and I looked upon the Cawl, which was all waſted away; and on his left Side again a great black Spot, and in the bottom of his Belly a quantity of very ill-lookt Bloud.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wheeler.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; and as I was informed, that was occaſioned by his being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to lie on his Back continually, becauſe his pain would not ſuffer him to move: that on the Side, and Ribs, was a perfect Bruiſe.</p>

               <speaker>Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>I ſaw the Body after it was opened, and viewed the inward lower parts of the Belly, where there was a quantity of Bloud gathered together.</p>

               <speaker>Roberts.</speaker>

               <speaker>Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord; and (as I ſaid) in the lower inward parts black congealed Bloud.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace, on <hi>Monday</hi> the 4th of <hi>February</hi> I was ſent for by my Brother, about nine of the Clock in the morning, to come to ſpeak with him but not believing his buſineſs to be urgent, deferred my going; the Meſſenger immediately comes back again, and tells me my Brother was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ill: As ſoon as I came, I found him almoſt dying, his Eyes ſet, and he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99400:11"/>
extremely ill, but we recovered him in a little time: whilſt he complained of great pain, I examined what might be the cauſe, and where he had been laſt night, (for I underſtood he came not home till morning) and in what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. And when I was told of my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s company, who had ſtruck him down with a box of the Ear, both he and I quickly concluded how his ill came: But to be ſatisfied, (he telling me he could not remember what he did) we ſent for the Drawer, to know the truth of the matter: but in the mean tiem, to comfort him, I told him I hoped it was only a fainting Fit, which would be over again in a while. The Drawer came, and did aſſure me that my Lord did never ſtrike him; which upon aſſurance I did believe, eſpecially when he came again in tbe Afternoon, and told me the ſame ſtory. All the while he was in the horrideſt pain that could be, and could not be touched, but was forced to lie upon his Back. The Doctor told us, for application to eaſe his pain, the beſt thing to wrap him in was a whole Weathers Skin; which we did at two of the Clock in the Afternoon, by the help of a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, raiſe him up, and put on him. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning I ſent to know how he did, being neceſſitated to go another way; he ſent word back, he was pretty well at eaſe, and had reſted pretty well. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> he roſe, and ſat up; on <hi>Thurſday</hi> he was ſo well, that he would have ſome Friends to Dine with him in his Chamber; on <hi>Friday</hi> he was a little ill again, but on <hi>Saturday</hi> he was ſo well, that he would have gone abroad, and truly we did never (I'm ſure I did not) believe he would have died, till about two hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died. One day when Dr. <hi>Conquest</hi> came out of his Chamber, he ſeem'd to be in a Huff, and ſaid he was only kept there to do the Drudgery; and when I asked him, what he thought of my Brother? he anſwered me ſhort, <hi>I cannot tell whether it be a</hi> Pembroke<hi>-kick or no.</hi> And when I, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of my Lord's having abuſed him, (which yet upon the Drawer's anſwer I believed not) ſpoke to him about it, he would ſeem diſpleaſed any ſhould mention it: He once indeed told me, he had ſomething elſe to reveal to the Doctor, but what it was I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>The firſt occaſional I had to ſee Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> as a Phyſician, was about three months before this unhappy Accident; he was then in a fainting Fit at the <hi>Roſe-</hi>Tavern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where I was ſent for to him: He had for half an hour lain quite dead, as they thought, but with their rubbing him, and giving him ſome mull'd Sack, he was come to himſelf juſt as I came, but he had no Pulſe, and was relapſing into his Fit: I gave him ſome Drops and Cordials, and ſent him home pretty well again. We went from thence, and the next morning his Man came to call me, and told me his Maſter was dying, which was (as I take it) the 6th. of <hi>December</hi> laſt: When I came thither, I found his Man ſitting by the fire; and asking for his Maſter, he told me he was aſleep; I was ſomething vext at the Fellow for troubling of me ſo, and while I was ſpeaking to him, Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> at laſt heard my voice, and calling me to him, deſired me I would come again in the afternoon, for he had a mind to reſt this morning: I came at One of the Clock again, where I found him very ill, and very melancholy; he wept, and ſent his Man down ſtairs, and when the Man was gone, I asked him what was the occaſion? He told me, he found ſo great an oppreſſion at his Heart, that he could hardly ſpeak: I deſired he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99400:12"/>
would take ſome advice, and ſend for another Phyſician; but he would have none elſe, but would needs go abroad that afternoon: I deſired him all I could; but not prevailing with him, I gave him ſome Cordial Drops, and deſired him to return home betimes; but he did not, but, as I heard, drank very hard, and returned not till very late. In ſhort, in the ſpace of two months, I have been called out of my Bed above twenty times, to give him advice, and to recover him out of his Fits; but he would take no advice, do whatever I could. After this was his meeting with my Lord of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> which he thus gave me Relation of: He told me, he had been with Mr. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> in the City that day drinking hard, and when he came to <hi>Longs,</hi> he was ſo extreamly drunk, that he cannot remember any thing that was done there, but finding himſelf much in pain the next day; he was ſo ignorant of the Tranſactions there, that he only thought he had bad ſeveral Falls off the Chairs near the fire; he ſaid indeed, he afterwards ſent to enquire what had paſſed in his company that night, and he heard my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> ſhould give him a Box on the Ear, but he remembred it not. Two or three days after he ſent for me, and told me, now he would take advice of me, and enter into a courſe of Phyſick; but knowing his condition to be ſo bad, I would not venture upon it alone, and deſired that he would joyn ſome one elſe with me in conſultation: He asked me, what Phyſician he ſhould ſend for? I deſired him to name any one whom he had a mind to; he ſaid, he knew none, and therefore would have me take whom I would, and then named Dr. <hi>Lower,</hi> and obtained his conſent to have his advice, whom I brought with me to his Lodgings. And the <hi>Saturday</hi> before he died, as we were coming in the Coach, I told Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> what I had known of his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per before, and what might be the occaſion of it, which (when we came thither) I repeated again in Mr. <hi>Cony</hi>'s preſence, who did confeſs the whole to be as I ſaid, that he had been a very hard Drinker of Wine, and ſtrong Waters upon it, which had (he believed) cauſed a Stagnation of Bloud in his Body, which might be the occaſion of his fainting Fits. We conſulted the whole cauſe; he owned no Blow or Kick that he had received, neither did I believe his Intrals had received any ſuch prejudice, becauſe I ſaw him my ſelf take two or three Gliſters, as particularly that evening: Yet he would not be regular, but that night drank three whole Tankards of cold ſmall Beer, which did put him into a very violent Fit of the Gripes. He ſent for me, and having left him pretty well, I wondred what alteration could cauſe ſo violent a Diſtemper in him ſo ſuddenly: He fell a vomiting, and vomited all night; and when I came and found him in a dying Fit, I gave him ſome Drops I had about me, and fetcht him to life again; but ſtill he was very bad, and he had a Gliſter for the Gripes; he would fain have had ſome more ſmall Beer, which I diſſwaded him from, and adviſed him rather to white-Wine Poſſet-drink, but he ſwore a great Oath he would have ſmall Beer; Dr. <hi>Lower,</hi> I ſuppoſe, ſaw him that morning. An hour before he died I came again, and thought fit to bloud, and ſo he was; he bled about eight ounces, and was a little better, ſo I left him: An hour after I came again, and found he was dead; but for his complaining of any Bruiſe or Hurt that way received, I remember not.</p>

               <p>My Lord, There was clotted Bloud among the Bowels, that was extravaſated. My Lord, The breaking out of which, I did attribute to the great quantity of ſmall Beer he had drank, and the Grippings that followed upon it; but the Bowels were none of them touched, and he himſelf attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted his Fits to that.</p>

               <p>All the Account, my Lord, that I can give is, That the day before Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> died, Dr. <hi>Conquest</hi> did come to me to deſire me to go with him, and by the way (as he related) told me the manner of his Fits, and what he thought was the occaſion of them; and in that Diſcourſe we continued till we came to his Lodgings, where we found him in his Bed; and when he was up, Dr. <hi>Conqueſt</hi> repeated what he had told me before, and he acknowledged all that to be true: I my ſelf asked him many Queſtions how he found himſelf; he ſaid, thoſe Fits came upon him ſuddenly by ſickneſs upon his Stomach; but there was not any Diſcourſe in my hearing of any Bruiſe or Hurt that way, nor had I any reaſon to ſuſpect any ſuch thing ſhould be the cauſe of his Ilneſs, for he had no ſymptome of a Fever upon him, either in Tongue, Pulſe, or Urine, which would have been, had he owned his Diſtemper to any thing of that kind. The next day I was ſent for to him early, but my neceſſary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on other Patients would not let me come quickly to him: When I came I found him dying, and ſeeing no hopes of his recovery, left him; I was deſired to be preſent at the Diſſection, but becauſe of the rumour of this Buſineſs, I ſaid it would be a troubleſom matter, and therefore would purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoid it.</p>

               <p>No, my Lord, I did fear being troubled, and would have avoided it, but could not, it ſeems, for I am come here to teſtifie this.</p>

               <p>I viewed the Body (my Lord) before and when it was opened; and it was reported to me that there was a Bruiſe in each ſide of the Belly, of which thereupon I took a ſtricter view, and could find no blackneſs nor blewneſs, nor marks of Bruiſes; upon which the Body was opened, and there iſſued thence clotted Bloud: then I looked upon the Cawl, which was withered and conſumed, and the Heart was as looſe as a Rag, and his Lungs ſtuck to each ſide of his Ribs; and as to the matter of the Bloud, that was not an extraordinary thing, for it is known to Phyſicians, that in all Natural Deaths there muſt be extravaſated Bloud in the lower Belly.</p>

               <p>This Bloud I think (my Lord) muſt be extravaſated by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his Gripes, for it is proved he drank a great quantity of Claret, and afterwards of Small Beer, which ſet the Bloud upon a Fermentation, that ſet him a Vomiting, by the violence thereby uſed to Nature this Bloud was thrown down into the Belly: but in all Natural Deaths, if there be not ſo great a conſumption of the Bloud that there is none left, there muſt be ſome extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated; it is a clear caſe.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace my Lord, High-Steward of <hi>England,</hi> and my Noble Lords, that are now Judges of this Cauſe of Bloud; I ſhall with all faithfulneſs endeavour to diſcharge my duty in this Great Court, and confine my ſelf ſolely to the Evidence that hath been given, and I hope I ſhall not do this Noble Lord, the Priſoner at the Bar, any injury, by miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition. This Evidence, my Lords, that hath been produced for the King, to make it out, that the Priſoner at the Bar is guilty of Murder, doth (may it pleaſe your Grace) conſiſt of three parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt are contained thoſe Matters of Fact, which did ariſe at the time when the poor unfortunate Gentleman came into my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s company, and what happen'd before my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> did depart from that place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of the Evidence conſiſts of Matters that did ariſe by confeſſion of the Party, and his diſcourſing with perſons who came to viſit him, or were with him during the time of his ſickneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third part doth conſiſt of Matters ariſing! after his death, upon the view of the Body. Under theſe three heads are comprehended all the King's Evidence, and with humble ſubmiſſion I humbly conceive, that the Evidence doth reach the Indictment, which is for the Crime of wilful Murder. But when I have humbly ſtated the Fact, I muſt ſubmit it to the Judgement of my Noble Lords and Peers.</p>
               <p>But to take a due method, I ſhall begin with a word or two of what Mr. Attorney General was pleaſed to hint, when he opened the Cauſe, that is, to ſhew what Murder is, and wherein we conceive the Evidence comes up to the Indictment. Murder in our Law is, when one man kills another upon malice fore-thought; now that malice is comprehended under two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: The one is expreſt a former grudge, diſcontent, and hatred to a man, to lye in wait to ſlay him: The other is malice imply'd, and that is when a perſon will come and fall upon another, and kill him with violence, without any provocation; and that I take to be the Caſe now before your Grace, and theſe Noble Lords; whether this Noble Lord, the Priſoner at the Bar, be guilty of Murder, under the head of malice imply'd, having killed a man, without any provocation given; for if it ſhould be made appear, as I humbly conceive it hath, with ſubmiſſion, that Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> did receive his Wound, whereby his death came from the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> it is with our Law Murder.</p>
               <p>That my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> did invite him into his company, is ſworn by four Witneſſes; for when they came into the Houſe, they did not ſo much as enquire whether my Lord was there or no; and when my Lord asked him to come into the Room, Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> did excuſe it, in a manner, by having his Friend with him; pray bring your Friend in with you, ſaid my Lord: After a little while it was ſaid, there were ſeveral Diſcourſes paſs'd between my Lord and Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> concerning Play, and their Families; but the third Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth ſwear, that when they were ſpeaking of playing for 500 <hi>l.</hi> Mr. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> declined; my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> firſt called him idle Fellow, and that occaſioned Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> to give that language, which was not ſo fit for him to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99400:14"/>
give to a Noble Lord of his Quality. But may it pleaſe your Grace, let the Diſcourſe between Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> be what it will, the Queſtion will be, Whether or no the Party that was killed, gave my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> any provocation, or cauſe of diſcontent, which might make him give him that Blow? or whether or no the ſtriking or kicking was the cauſe of his death? That comes in the laſt place, for I am now under that head; there was no provocation given by Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> to my Lord to ſtrike him, and four Witneſſes there were to that, the perſons by at the time when it was given, who all as to the ſubſtance ſwear the ſame thing, only one or two Circumſtances come from ſome of them, that do not come from all. Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> a man of Quality, and an honourable Family, ſwears, That at the time when Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> was put out of the Room, he ſaw the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi> (turning his face) give <hi>Cony</hi> a Blow on the Head, and one Kick when he was down; the Queſtion was asked him, Whether he kickt him upon the Belly; but that he could not anſwer to; He likewiſe doth particularly ſay, After the Blow was given by the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> that ſtruck him down to the ground, he ſaw his Knee lifted up to kick him, higher than the motion of uſual walking, ſo that ſome violence was uſed as to that. Mr. <hi>Fitz-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi> though they all agree in ſubſtance, yet he hath one particular differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the reſt; he ſaith, That when my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> was asked why he ſtruck Mr. <hi>Cony,</hi> he anſwered, Becauſe he ſaid Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> ſhould not go out of the Room, without his knowing ſome reaſon for it; this he ſwears the Earl did ſay, but whether it was ſo or no is the Queſtion. <hi>Shelley</hi> ſays, No ſuch word paſs'd, nor doth <hi>Savage</hi> ſpeak of it: But be that Circumſtance true or not, (for all the Witneſſes agree in Subſtance, and may not be able to agree in all Circumſtances) yet under ſubmiſſion, I muſt leave it to the Judgement of my Lords the Peers, whether that be Provocation ſufficient to lay violent hands on a Man. <hi>Shelley</hi> indeed ſays the words were, I know not why my Friend is turn'd out of doors; now whether theſe are a Provocation, ſuch as in Judgement of Law can be deemed ſufficient to lay violent hands on a Man to kill him, is the Queſtion; we ſuppoſe it is not, but ſuch a ſtroke is given without a Provocation, in which the Law implies malice. This (may it pleaſe your Grace) is the ſum of that which I humbly take the boldneſs to remember your Lordſhip of, as to the firſt part of the Evidence.</p>
               <p>2dly. The ſecond part is upon what ariſeth after the Blow was given. My Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> that time was certainly apprehenſive he had done the Gentleman ſome wrong, and that is evident by his care of him after, for his own Witneſs <hi>Viner</hi> doth ſay, that my Lord bid him make a fire and watch with him; ſurely if my Lord had not been conſcious to himſelf, that he had done ſome thing extraordinary to the perſon of that Gentleman, that caution had not been given to the man: But beſides (my Lord) there are little Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which are always allowed for Evidence in ſuch Caſes, where men receive any Wounds, to ask them Queſtions while they are ill about it, who hurt them. Now as to this there are four Witneſſes alſo, Dr. <hi>Bruce,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hemes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> and <hi>Alice Avery.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Bruce</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>ſwears, That when he came on the <hi>Monday</hi> to enquire of Mr. <hi>Cony</hi> what his Ilneſs was, he did complain of ſoreneſs about his Shoulders, but did not make mention of the lower part of his Belly, or any diſcolouring there.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Henies</hi> the Apothecary ſays, He not only complained of extream pains
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99400:15"/>
in his Shoulders, but alſo of extream inward ſoreneſs in the lower part of his Belly, and this perſon was frequently with him, and the ſame complaints came from him, till he expired his laſt breath.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jackson,</speaker>
               <p>he did know him for a long time before; he ſaith indeed, He had about two or three months before a fainting Fit or two, but to this time he lookt upon him as a healthy man, and he continued with him off and on till he died, and to him he did declare he had received injury from the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> though he was very loth to ſay what: And he alſo tells your Lordſhips, that he ſaw the Bloud in his Belly after the Diſſection, which he imputed to ſome Hurt he had received. Indeed there is a Chirurgeon that tells your Lordſhips, that it is an ordinary thing, and that it is ſo in all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deaths, and it might be occaſioned by his drinking the Beer, which made him vomit, and concluded with theſe words, (I noted them.) 'Tis a clear Caſe; but the man not being upon his Oath, and giving it in as his ſingle opinion, I hope will not bear ſo much weight with your Lordſhips.</p>
               <p>The Nurſe that was continually with him to the laſt moment, ſwears, He did continually complain after he came into the Houſe, of pains all over his Body, and (as ſhe ſaith) continued in his ſenſes, and the right uſe of his underſtanding, till the laſt breath, but principally complained of ſoreneſs in his Shoulder, his Side, and his Belly, and did likewiſe often mention my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s unkindneſs to him, declaring about two hours before he died, that he thought in his conſcience the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> was the cauſe of his death.</p>
               <p>Theſe four Witneſſes ſwear what I have truely repeated, for I would be very unwilling in a Cauſe of Bloud, to miſrepeat the Evidence, either to the prejudice of a juſt Cauſe for the dead, or to preſs for unjuſt vengeance upon the living, it being my duty only to recollect what is ſworn, and leave it all to your Lordſhips Judgement.</p>
               <p>3dly. We have that which is Evidence in Law, upon the view of the Body after his death. It was viewed legally by a Jury of indifferent perſons, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by the Coroner; three of them being produced do ſwear, that there were a great many viſible Bruiſes upon the Body, and Swellings all about: And for the diſcolouring of the parts bruiſed, <hi>Roberts</hi> ſwears, the patch was about the breadth of his hand: <hi>Brown</hi> likewiſe ſwears, that he was black and blue up and down the Body in broad patches: Theſe are Jury-men, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted perſons. It is true, Mr. <hi>Cony</hi>'s Brother, the laſt Witneſs for the King ſaith, He knew nothing of the Buſineſs, for his Brother would never acknowledge any thing to him; but ſomething that he ſpeaks is very material, That Dr. <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> my Lord's Witneſs, coming out of the Chamber one day, ſeemed angry, and to have taken ſome diſtaſte, as if he were neglected, and uſed an expreſſion, which your Lordſhip may remember, upon Mr. <hi>Cony</hi>'s asking him what ailed his Brother, he could not tell he ſaid, it might be <hi>A Pembroke-Kick.</hi> And this is the ſum of the Evidence for the King.</p>
               <p>For the Evidence on the other ſide, I think the ſubſtance of it is only, That this Gentleman was uſed to have fainting Fits, and thoſe occaſioned, as they think, by his hard Drinking, and that might bring his death upon him; but they offer no Counterproof to the Fact.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is now, Whether or no this man came to his death by other means; for it is no Argument to ſay, becauſe a man is ſick, it is lawful to kill him; but we are to enquire, whether he came to his death by thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99400:15"/>
Blows given him by the Priſoner at the Bar? If then it be admitted that the Blow was the cauſe of his death, and the Kicks withall, I humbly then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to your Lordſhips conſideration, whether the Kings Evidence hath not reacht up to the Indictment: Here is Murther with Malice implied by the Law, for there is no colour of pleading a Provocation of the Blow, to be the cauſe of his death. Now whether or no it be ſo, I humbly offer theſe Reaſons for the Affirmation; this men was not look'd upon to be a man in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as to be a dying man, before the Blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But he was a great drinker, that brought him to thoſe Fits, and that haſtned his end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though he was ſo, yet from the inſtant that he did receive the blow, he never had any eaſe till he died, in ſo much that Mr. <hi>Savage</hi> tells your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, he took him up immediately after my Lord kicked him, and he was ſome minutes before he could get him to life again, and then he could not keep himſelf from Fainting again: ſo that upon the circumſtances of what the Witneſſes for the Priſoner have ſaid, and the Evidence offered in behalf of the King, if this were the cauſe of his death, we leave it to your Lordſhips conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whether it be not Murther in this Noble Lord the Priſoner at the Bar: To that determination we ſubmit the Cauſe, and whatever opinion your Lordſhips ſhall be of in the Cauſe, I have no more to ſay, but that the King's Juſtice in this Proſecution, was ſuitable to the Law given by the Almighty in the Infancy of the World, <hi>That whoſoever ſheddeth man's Bloud, by man ſhall his Bloud be ſhed.</hi>

            <p>Then the Lords went back in the ſame order they came in, and went into the Houſe of Lords; and from thence, after two hours debate, they returned into the Court, and Proclamation was made as followeth.</p>
