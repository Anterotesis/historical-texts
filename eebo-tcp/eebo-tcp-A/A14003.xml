            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The firſt and worſt are they, that reade to ſee, and ſee to carpe and cauil; like the <hi>Curre,</hi> that takes moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in biting and in baulling; or not vnlike the <hi>fleſh-flie,</hi> that delighteth alwaies in ſucking bloud, or ſitting on the ſore.</p>
            <p>The ſecond are they, that account more of ſmoake then fire, and of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming wit, then of ſolide wiſedome, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting nothing in a manner but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties &amp; new conceipts; how rotten, vaine, idle &amp; ſcurrilous they care not,
<pb facs="tcp:2636:9"/>
ſo they feed their fancie, and procure meriment; like the <hi>cow,</hi> that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drinke puddle then pure water.</p>

            <p>The fourth are they, that preferre the ſhell before the kernel, and the diſh before the meat, regarding the ſound rather then the ſence, &amp; the outward ſhape of the worke more then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubſtance; as if a man ſhould delight more in the colour then in the corps: and not much vnlike to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that turne ouer their bookes,

            <p>A fift kind there are, that reade much, but practiſe nothing; as if a man ſhould take meat into his mouth to pleaſe his taſt, but let none goe downe into his ſtomack to comfort na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

            <p>The ſixt are they, that had rather reade naturall or humane and ciuill hiſtories, and treatiſes of arts and ſciences liberall and mechanicall, then Eccleſiaſticall and diuine diſcourſes; it ſeemes eſteeming more of the <hi>Maide</hi> then of the <hi>Miſtris,</hi> of humanity more then of diuinity, &amp; of the body more then of the ſoule; like <hi>Aeſops Cocke,</hi> that ſet more by a barly corne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by all the <hi>gemmes</hi> and iewels in the

Though they deuoure whole bookes, yet are they (like <hi>Pharoahs kine</hi>) as ill fauoured, and as leane &amp; lank for true grace (as by their liues

As in the naturall body one member helpeth another: and as in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall body, one man ouerſeeth and gouerneth an other: ſo in the ſpiritual &amp; Eccleſiaſtical body, God hath wiſely ordayned that ſome of the members ſhould direct, relieue, inſtruct and nouriſh the reſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided alwayes, that they ſubiect themſelues vnto their King Chriſt Ieſus, that they gouerne by his Lawes, and by the Scepter of his word, and feede them with foode prepared out of it; and not with the dregges and drugges of mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, which may be ſweete ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the mouth, but are alwaies bitter in the maw, hurtfull vnto

Lamentable is the practiſe of too many, that hauing bin entertained into GODS <hi>Houſe</hi> for workmen, do lay downe their tooles, and fall to play, to pleaſure, and ayme at nothing more, then at their priuate profits.

The Miniſter is a workman, God hath hired him to worke in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.

               <p>NOw in a Labourer, theſe ſeuen things are required.

               <p>Fourthly, our labours are not ſpent vpon beaſts, but vpon men like our ſelues, and not about earthly things, but heauenly. Fiftly, our paines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long properly &amp; principally to Gods <note n="m" place="margin">Epheſ. 4 12.</note>

               <p>Sixtly, we ſhould conſider, that theſe about whome we labour, are ſubiect to many dangers.

               <p>Thirdly, we are taught to be fruitful vnto God in faith, loue, repentance, and obedience. The good ground, which receiueth good ſeed, is very profitable to the owner, ſending forth plenty of fruit. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo we being ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with the good and wholeſome ſeed of Gods word, we ought to bring forth fruit aboundantly, that our owner may haue a plentiful crop.

                  <hi>ſluggard,</hi> that is ouergrowne with thornes &amp; nettles. If a field be broken vp with the plough, and if good ſeed be not ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en therein, it will bring forth more ſtore of weeds, then if it had laine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plowed. So if the ſeeds of Chriſtian vertues be not ſowne in our heartes, and fructify in our liues now that we haue ben broken vp with the plough of Gods word, we ſhall more abound with the ſtinking weedes of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then if we had neuer felt that plough. Let vs therefore looke to our ſelues, and labour to be fruitfull in good thing, <note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 23.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Apply thine heart to inſtruction, and thine eares to the words of knowledge.</hi>

                  <hi>He that followeth after righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhall find life, righteouſneſſe, and glory.</hi> Now that we may be fruitfull, we muſt performe theſe duties following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we muſt roote thoſe ſinfull weedes out of our hearts, which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and choke them. <note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 4.4</note>

the thornes, Be circumciſed to the Lord, and take away the foreskin of your hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt labour to be partakers of Gods word, hungring and thirſting after it, as after food. It is the <hi>Plough,</hi> that muſt breake vs vp: it is the <hi>beetle</hi> that doth beat our clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hearts: it is the <hi>ſeed</hi> that muſt be ſcattered vpon them: and it is the <hi>raine</hi> alſo, that makes the ſeed ſpring vp and grow: It is the <hi>meanes</hi>; indeed the <hi>bleſſing</hi> is from the Lord. <note n="e" place="margin">Pet. 2.1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laying aſide all maliciouſnes, all guile, ſimulation, enuy, and all euill ſpeaking, as new borne babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, when the ſeed is ſowne, let it find roome within vs. Let vs giue it liberty to roote and ſpread it ſelfe in our heartes. As a ſhip cannot ſaile without <hi>ſea-roome:</hi> ſo the ſeed cannot grow without <hi>earth-roome.</hi> We muſt therefore giue the ſeed of Gods word roome in our heartes: we muſt yeeld vnto it, we muſt giue it paſſage in vs, we muſt locke it vp in
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2636:120"/>
the cloſet of a faithfull heart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it. The word hath bene <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 4.2.</note> vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to many, becauſe it was not mixed in them with faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we muſt not only heare the word, but we muſt let it worke in our liues, we muſt expreſſe it in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſations. <hi>Be ye doers of the word,</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Iam. 1.22</note> 
                  <hi>and not hearers onely only</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iames</hi>) <hi>deceiuing your owne ſelues. For if any man heare the word, &amp; do it not, he is like vnto a man, that beholdeth his naturall face in a glaſſe. For when he hath conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe, he goeth his way, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth immediately what manner of one he was.</hi> He that heares &amp; does not, is like him, that eates and thriues not.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, becauſe the bleſſing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from aboue, we ought therefore earneſtly to begge a bleſſing of God vpon the knees of our ſoules, that his word may take deepe roote in our hearts downewards, and bring forth fruit plentifully in our liues vpwards; and that as the Sunne doth whiten cloth, reſolue the ſnow, melt the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2636:120"/>
yee, and giue light vnto the world, ſo his word may melt our hearts, and whiten them; and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the darkeneſſe of our mindes, as that we may repent of all our ſins, and ſee the riches of his grace, and may haue light to come out of the waies of darkeneſſe, and to walke before him in the wayes of life.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we ſhould ſet before our eyes that great reward, which God will beſtow vpon all ſuch as are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in good workes, and abound in the fruites of the Spirit. They ſhall haue heauen, &amp; earth, and all things whatſoeuer are needfull and fitting for them. And the more they doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in grace, the more they ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in glory.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, we ought to conſider diligently the examples of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, dead and aliue, that haue bene &amp; are full of good fruits, good deeds, and who ſhine in Chriſtian graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other men: and hauing their patterns ſet before vs (as <hi>ſcholers</hi> haue their <hi>copies</hi>) we ſhould ſtir vp our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2636:121"/>
and ſtudy to reſemble them, yea &amp; go before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke skorn that any ſhould go beyond the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in fooliſh faſhions, and vaine attire; wherefore then ſhould we be content through our droniſh &amp; heauy diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that any ſhould ſtrip vs in the race of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and be more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ranke in bearing the fruits of righteouſnes, then we our ſelues are? eſpecially conſidering that we haue the plough of Gods word, the ſeed of wholeſome doctrine, &amp; the ſweet ſhewers of heauenly counſels, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, admonitions, and dehortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as plentifully among vs, as they haue amongſt them, and more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully too it may be. One man ſtriues to haue as good corne as another: why then ſhould not we labour to be as rich in grace as our brethren?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if we would be fruitfull, we muſt beware of the cares of the world, that they do not like thornes choke the ſeed that is ſowen in vs, &amp; ouerſhadow it. We muſt alſo take heed that it be not waſht away with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2636:121"/>
the waters of afflictions, &amp; skorched with the burning heat of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And finally we muſt take heed of the examples of the wicked, and that ſathan &amp; the birds of hel do not ſteale it from vs, &amp; pick it out of our hearts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, thoſe are to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">Vſe. 4.</note> that take vpon them the name of Gods field or husbandry, and will needs be reputed his ſeruants; and yet are either barren as an heath, or fruitfull in nothing, but in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful works of darknes; as drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ignorance, couetouſneſſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, enuy, ſwearing, pride, idleneſſe, and vncleanneſſe. <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 6.7 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The field that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the raine, that fals often on it, and brings forth herbes fit for the husbandman, receiueth a bleſſing of God: but that which bringeth forth thornes &amp; thiſtles, is reproued, and is neere a curſe: and the end of that field is burning.</hi> We are Gods field: his plough hath bene amongſt vs <hi>fifty</hi> yeares together, alwaies going vpon vs. His ſeed hath bene continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſcattered vpon vs all this time. He hath watered vs richly with
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2636:122"/>
the raine of heauenly inſtructions, and the <hi>Sunne of righteouſneſſe</hi> hath all this time ſhone vpon vs with his moſt glorious Goſpell. Now if we ſhall bring forth nothing (as too many do) but the thornes of iniquity, the thiſtles of vngodlineſſe, the <hi>nettles</hi> of fleſhly luſts, and the noiſome <hi>weeds</hi> of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, what can we looke for but a curſe? What do we elſe deſerue, but that he ſhould make vs deſolate as a deſert, and burne vs vp with the fire of his wrath? The Lord ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his vineyard in <hi>Iudea,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beſtowed much coſt vpon it, &amp; it brought forth nothing but <hi>wild</hi> &amp; <hi>ſowre grapes,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 5.5.6.</note> he would take away the hedge thereof, and breake downe the wall. Yea, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will lay it waſt: briars and thornes ſhall grow vp: it ſhall not be cut nor digged: I will alſo command the cloudes that they raine no raine vpon it.</hi> Wee are Gods <hi>Vineyard</hi> here in <hi>England</hi>: he hath hedged vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: he hath built a tower, &amp; made a wine-preſſe amongſt vs: he hath ſent his workemen among vs: he hath
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2636:122"/>
enuironed vs with many outward bleſſings: he hath ſet watchmen to keepe vs: and he hath long expected good grapes, and a fruitfull vinetage. But alas, our grapes are generally ſowre and wild: our grapes are the grapes of gall, &amp; our cluſters are bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: our wine is the poiſon of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and the cruell gall of aſpes. Our ingratitude is great, our enormities are horrible, our wickedneſſe is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. We walke according to the ſtubborneneſſe of our harts: we haue made our browes of braſſe, and our foreheads of marble. We draw on ſin as it were with cart-ropes, &amp; adde drunkennes vnto thirſt. Our dealings do teſtify as much to our faces. All the toile that hath bene taken with vs, doth ſeeme to be euen loſt in the moſt. The bellowes are burnt: the lead is conſumed in the fire: the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der melteth in vaine. The word of the Prophets is not regarded: the raine of their exhortations runs by vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is not receiued. And although we be continually dreſſed, &amp; daily pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2636:123"/>
by the word of God as by a ſprit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or pruning knife, yet are we full of ſuperfluous branches, &amp; our fruit is rotten, ſowre, vnwholeſome, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant. What may we now expect of God, if he ſhall deale with vs, as we haue dealt with him, but that he ſhould pull downe his hedge, breake downe his wal, and lay this vineyard waſte, and beſtow his paines vpon a people, that will bring forth better fruites? Let vs therefore repent before it bee too late: let vs labour againſt our barrenneſſe vnto good, &amp; againſt our vnfruitfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fruitfulneſſe in that which is euill. Shall we labour that our ſoile may be good and fertile, and ſhall we with patience ſee our ſoules ſterile &amp; vnfruitfull? Can we not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure our gardens to be ouergrowne with weedes, and ſhall we ſuffer our heartes to be defaced with ſin, which is more ſtinking and infeſtant then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weed is, or can be? Shall we deſire God to giue vs the firſt and the latter raine to water our grounds, and ſhall we not pray him alſo to water the dry
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2636:123"/>
ground of our hearts with the ſweet ſhewers of his graces, and to moiſten and ſoke vs with the water of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Shal we deſire God to ſhew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto vs in giuing vs the timely fruites of the yeare, and ſhall we be vnkind vnto him in keeping fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the timely fruits of our hearts? Do we diſlike ſlerility in our groundes, &amp; barrenneſſe in our ſheep and kine, &amp; ſhall we not as wel diſlike the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our hearts, and the ſpirituall ſterility of our ſoules? If we would ſhew our ſelues to be indeed the field of God, and would not ſhame his husbandmen, let vs ſtriue againſt our barrenneſſe: let vs lay aſide all the vnfruitfull works of darkeneſſe: and let vs labour to bring forth fruits in aboundance beſeeming repentance, and thoſe that profeſſe themſelues to be the field of the liuing God.
