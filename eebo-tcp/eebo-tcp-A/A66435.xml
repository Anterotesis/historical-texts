            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N compiling the <hi>History of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-Treason,</hi> published two Years since, I had a particular respect to Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Truth, that I might neither bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then nor abuse the Reader. How far I attained the former, the Book it self doth shew; and that I might not mistake in the latter, I did with good heed and diligence consult not only the Histories foreign and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick, but also all other Books which I could meet with, written <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> upon that subject. But all this while I had neither seen nor heard of the <hi>large Reply</hi> in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of <hi>the Catholick Apology,</hi> written by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of as great Wit as Honour; in which I afterwards found there was a particular Discourse upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I must confess that the Honourable Author hath as well acquitted himself as could be expected in a Case of this nature, and by the reviving and skilful disposing of what hath bin said by others, and starting many things not taken notice of, that I know of, before, hath put a pretty
<pb facs="tcp:95553:3"/>
Varnish upon the Cause, and made it passable with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate Persons. But if what is there said be warily view'd, I do not question, but it will appear to be founded rather upon conjecture, than solid History, and to have more of fancy than truth in it. But whether this be so or not, or whether what I have here said will make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or no, I must now leave to the Judicious and such as will be concerned impartially to inquire into the merits of the Cause. If it should be expected that I should have taken notice of some other late Books of our Adversaries that touch upon this Subject, I have only this to say, that I have not willingly overlooked any; and as for those that I have seen, I find little or nothing which is not the same with what is said in the foresaid Reply, and that hath not for the most part bin borrowed from it.</p>

            <div type="introductory_section">
               <p>THE Conspiracy of the <hi>Gunpowder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> carried in its front, so much of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural cruelty, that with all their Art the Party could put no colour upon it: and therefore there hath been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting amongst them to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themselves and their Religion from being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. Sometimes they will slander Authority, and make the Judges and Council to Conspire against them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the whole was the contrivance of a Minister of State. Sometimes the Traitors were but very few, and they such as were young and rash, quick to resent a provocation, and easily inclined to revenge it. Sometimes it was in those discontent, &amp; not Religion. And if any or all of these will serve to stop the mouths of their Adversaries and protect themselves, they will boldly stand up in their own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And that they have reason to say all this, is what they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95553:4"/>
do maintain. I shall therefore consider their several pleas, and do think that I shall take in all that they say, and shew it to be very weak and insufficient, if I make good,<list>
                     <item n="1">1. That this was a Plot of their own, and not contrived to their hands by their Adversaries,</item>
                     <item n="2">2. That more were concerned in it, than were at that time publickly known and accused.</item>
                     <item n="3">3. That those that fled and suffered for it were really guilty.</item>
                     <item n="4">4. That this Conspiracy was purely upon the account of Religion.</item>
                     <item n="5">5. I shall add, that they never yet gave to the world any real and good satisfaction of their abhorrency of it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Of what great use it will be, if they could prove the whole to be anothers device, I cannot well understand. For if it could be made as clear as the day that a <hi>Minister of State</hi> drew the Conspirators into the nooze, and had such as from time to time did give him intelligence how their affair stood, will it serve to clear their innocency, and make the Plot on their part to be none? was there all the while no evil inclination of their own to work upon, and no mischief intended by them? were they drawn in without their consent? or were they not drawn in at all, but the whole accusation a Fiction, and it no better than <hi>a seeming Plot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Catholick-Apology with reply.</hi> p 404.</note> as one suggests? If not, why is this so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously urged, and so much enlarged upon by our late Apologists? But yet how little shadow of proof there is for this, will appear if we consider how inconstantly these speak as to this matter.<note place="margin">p. 412.</note> For if we will hearken to the man <hi>of</hi> 70 <hi>years</hi> when he died (who is for that reason presumed to be a person of some credit in the case by the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author above said) he saith,<note place="margin">Mori <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

with the Conspiracy long before its discovery, who cunningly pretended ignorance that the more might be involved in it.</hi> It was in his time (it seems) a suspicion, and a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that that Noble-man knew of the Conspiracy, <hi>i.e.</hi> by the intelligence he kept with some of them. But in the current of ten or twelve years, from a suspicion it comes to a certainty; from his being privy to it, it comes to be his proper Invention. For now its said <hi>to be set a work by the discoverers; to be a trick invented by the States-man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apol. <hi>p.</hi> 403, 404. <hi>p.</hi> 538.</note> and <hi>to be a seeming Plot; and that they were drawn into it by the dexterity of a Protestant.</hi> It was in <hi>More's</hi> time some Noble man thus was suspected, but now upon the sole credit of Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> it must be the Treasurer (meaning I believe <hi>Cecil,</hi> tho at the time of this Treason he was Secretary only) and he for his good service was made an Earl, as our Author saith; altho as luck would have it,<note place="margin">Apol. <hi>p.</hi> 411. Baker's Chr. <hi>An.</hi> 1605.</note> he was so cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on the Saturday after St. <hi>George</hi>'s day, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1605, which was above six months before this Treason broke out.</p>
               <p>So inconsistent are Persons with themselves, when they have not truth on their side; and so apt are they to catch at any little thing, when they serve a Cause or a Party.</p>
               <p>For is it not an easie thing to raise such a report, and have we not reason to believe such will do it, whose inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest it is to discharge themselves of it, and who as they would deny it if they could, so would to be sure extenuat it when it is not to be denied? Can we think that they who contrived to <hi>cast the whole upon the Puritans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wilson</hi> great <hi>Brit.</hi> p. 32.</note> if it had succeeded, were not as able and willing when it miscarried to <hi>place the name of</hi> Cecil <hi>in their Register, as the Master-workman</hi> (as the above said Author saith that <hi>Sanderson</hi> doth acknowledg) and to make him the deviser of it?<note place="margin">p. 412.</note>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95553:5"/>
Furthermore is it not usual for such as would be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Men of Wit</hi> (which the <hi>Apol.</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for) to allow little of that in others;<note place="margin">Apol. p. 414.</note>
                  <note place="margin">P. 236</note>, and for such as pretend to be <hi>Inquisitive &amp; Politicoes</hi> (as the <hi>Apol.</hi> saith <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> did) to <hi>have every thing a Mystery</hi>? can we think that he that slubbers over what K. <hi>James</hi> did well, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually exposeth him in what he thinks he did ill; that will hardly allow him to have any sense of Honour and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; would not be shy also of allowing him one dram of sagacity above other men to find out a Riddle, or any greater title to divine Providence to help him to unfold it? Can we think that he, that was a <hi>frequenter of company, and inquisitive,</hi> (as this Author saith <hi>Osborn</hi> was) could be ignorant of such rumours as were scattered at that time abroad by the party concerned (if such there were); or that he that had a spite at the Court, would not malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously improve them? And is there any reason to believe the one or the other upon their bare affirmation? I do not think that the credit of such will pass at this time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without better Certificates, and therefore since this honourable Person is he alone that <hi>hath urged some Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 413.</note> as he affirms; I shall consider what he hath said.<note place="margin">P. 410.</note> And, in the first place, I think what he hath said concerning the Letter sent to the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> to be very remarkable, upon which he observes, <hi>That it's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to see in most of the Relations and Accounts of this Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, how the Letter appeared Nonsence forsooth to</hi> Cecil, <hi>and with what a particular adulation he seemed all along to admire the King's Comment and Exposition; for though his Majesty had as much Wit as any man living, yet the Affair was so plain, that one of a far less capacity could not miscarry in it.</hi> Herein I must confess he is very singular, and I am of his mind when he saith,<note place="margin">P. 413.</note> 
                  <hi>perchance I have bin the first that urged the

               </p>
               <p>From all which we may observe how much may be said by a man of Wit, to baffle any Cause that he undertakes to overthrow; since this that he hath said, is in the ground of it false (as hath elsewhere bin shewed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) and what if I had no proof of it, yet what this Honourable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95553:6"/>
Person saith, is far from proving what he designs.<note place="margin">History of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-Treason, p. 19.</note> For he discourseth as if no one ever had bin false to the Oath of secrecy which he had taken in any Conspiracy; or as if there were no persons in the World had ever done this with allowance. He discourseth as if no Person that had a Design to destroy multitudes without compassion, could not be over-ruled to spare one alone from a particular affection. He supposeth that no one in writing a Letter to that purpose could unwittingly let fall such things as might beget suspicion, and be a means of discovering the Design. He supposeth again that no one in so doing can be over-ruled by the Providence of God to go beyond what he did intend, and to betray what he resolved to keep secret. Now if any, or all of these things be true, the Letter might have bin written by one that was privy to the Plot, by <hi>Percy</hi> or any of the rest, without the help of his <hi>Machiavilian,</hi> notwithstanding what ever he hath bin pleased to say to the contrary. But if it was writ by him, why was it put into my Lord <hi>Monteagle's</hi> hand, who was a Roman-Catholick, and who must have bin a Confident of <hi>Cecils,</hi> and privy to the whole affair? or else it might have miscarried through the hands of the Person that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it, or the hands of him that received it (it being a kind of a Note, and delivered in the evening) or that Lord might have <hi>contemn'd the Admonition, as coming from an idle Fellow in the street,</hi> as this Authour saith,<note place="margin">P. 410.</note> and throw it aside; or he might have concealed and disowned it. Or if it had come safe, and that Lord did, as he did, discover and deliver it, yet the King himself might have happened not to have had the sharpness of our Authours wit, and bin alike dull as others; and then the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Letter had bin lost, which was as he saith, <hi>to have the thing discovered</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 411.</note> And so the Secretary had lost
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95553:7"/>
the opportunity of <hi>making his vigilance appear,</hi> and missed <hi>of the reward of being made an Earl for his Service</hi>; which are the reasons the above said Author gives of the whole. And now I should have dismissed this long Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Letter, but that he spends above a page in shewing the folly of giving ten days warning, if all had not bin by the design of the aforesaid Statesman. Why it was delay'd on the Secretary's part, <hi>Thuanus</hi> and others do give the reason, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King being then at <hi>Royston,</hi> they kept the Letter till his return, which was Friday <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1. when it was shewed him, and it was the next day brought into the Council, where it was ordered that search should be made, which was deferrd till Monday evening, that they might give no occasion to Rumour or Jealousie.</p>
               <p>And why it was sent so long before (if I may guess for once as well as our Author hath often) I conceive it might be that the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> might have time to find out some pretence for his absence, or because the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that wrote it had a sure hand to send it by.</p>
               <p>Having thus fixed upon one for a Contriver of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, and withal made him to be the Author of the aforesaid mysterious Letter, this ingenious Person did perceive that he had still said nothing, unless he was able to point to one that should be a constant spy upon the Conspirators, and an useful intelligence to the projecting States-man; and in so doing he spares not to charge one who may be well supposed as little liable to a temptation to be thus made use of, as any of the Fraternity, and that is Mr. <hi>Tresham.</hi> For what should induce him to so great perfidiousness?<note place="margin">Advocate for Liberty p. 226.</note> Could it be a vile education that should thus debase his mind to decoy his dear Relation (for I am told by a certain Author, that he and <hi>Catesby</hi> were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95553:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sisters Children) and intimate Friends into such a Design, and having thus decoy'd them to leave them to the rigor of the Law? This might perhaps lie against a <hi>Bates,</hi> who was but a menial Servant; but <hi>Tresham</hi> was a Gentle-man of an ancient Family, and had an education suitable to his extraction. Could it be necessity, and this a course made use of to patch up his broken Fortunes? This might have bin a reason for a <hi>Keyes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings p. 56.</note> whose Fortunes were sunk (as he acknowledged upon the Trial) but <hi>Tresham</hi> had a plentiful Estate and promised to contribute 2000 <hi>l.</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Design. Could it be a coldness in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that he really was of none? The contrary to that is evident, in that rather than put <hi>Garnet</hi> into danger, or not clear him of what he had before confessed against him, he chose to die with an apparent Lye in his mouth, and did pawn his Salvation to verify it.<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 177.</note> Could it lastly be from a doubtfulness of the issue, and a resolution to provide for his own safety? That we find not a title of; but that he might have done and provided for theirs too by obliging them to desist from their Design for fear of discovery; that he might have done and never disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd them, or taken such a base course to procure. So that if we consider the thing in it self,<note place="margin">Advocate of liberty. p. 225.</note> it might have bin as well <hi>Catesby</hi> or <hi>Percy</hi> (whom an Author of theirs would also fasten a suspicion in that kind upon) or any, as <hi>Tresham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are some Reasons offered from this suspicion; for <hi>Tresham was suspected by themselves</hi> saith the <hi>Apol.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apol. p. 416.</note> But what was he suspected of, not of being a Spy or a Setter, but of having sent the Letter to the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi>; So saith <hi>Tho. Winter</hi> in his confession; <hi>When</hi> Catesby, Tresham, <hi>and I met at Barnet, we questioned how this Letter should be sent to my Lord</hi> Monteagle, <hi>but could not conceive; for Mr.</hi> Tresham <hi>forsware it, whom we only suspected</hi>;<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 58.</note> and this he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95553:8"/>
might write, and be no such Person; nay it's certain if he had writ this Letter, he could be no Decoy, since there would then have bin no need to give his Lordship any such warning; when he, being privy to the whole Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, was sure that the Design would be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and prevented, and so neither the Lord nor any else, but the Conspirators, be in danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Apol. <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note>Well, but <hi>Tresham hanckered about the Court when all his fellow Conspirators fled,</hi> And so it's likely he did, that he might not by his flight give any suspicion; but when he was suspected, <hi>he shifted his Lodgings,</hi> saith <hi>Thuanus, and so for a time escaped.</hi> And surely this was more wisely done than to fly with the rest into the Country, where they could not but be discovered, and when nothing but plain force could secure them when discovered; and that they could have little hopes of, as long as King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and <hi>London</hi> were safe. But if he had bin a Decoy, what need he have hanckered about the Court, or sculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterwards for fear of discovery;<note place="margin">Advocate for Liberty. p. 225.</note> 
                  <hi>if he was</hi> Cecils <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and had access to him at midnight</hi> (as one, that is ready to swear to the certainty of whatever the foresaid honourable Author doth with greater modesty only sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and conjecture at, doth say) he knew where to be safe,<note place="margin">Apol. p. 415, 416.</note> and by whom to be received. But <hi>a Setter may be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his Patron's Art might not be suspected—and if his Creature will not be satisfied with words, and is like to be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and unruly, 'tis then only saying he died of a Strangury, or some sudden Distemper in Prison, as it happened here to</hi> Tresham, <hi>who, lest he should discover it, was never brought to a publick Trial, but was with another</hi> [nameless Person] <hi>sent to the Tower, and they were never seen afterwards, lest they should tell tales,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Advocate for Liberty. p 225.</note> as an excellent Romancer tells us. Surely <hi>Tresham</hi> was in the deepest Dungeon, where none but the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95553:8"/>
sowr Keeper could come to speak with him. Surely he never spoke word, but all on the sudden by the power of some poisonous Potion was made to sleep his last, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found dead, it was given out he died of the Strangury. But now what if this Man did indeed die of the Strangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? what if he did die while his Wife and Servant were with him? What if he did not die so suddenly,<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 176.</note> but that his Wife dealt with him to recant what ever he had said against <hi>Garnet,</hi> and to subscribe a Paper to that purpose? Why then it's to be feared that they must seek for another to bear the part of a Spy, and let Mr. <hi>Tresham</hi> die as the rest of the knot did, true so far to one another, tho never so false to their King and Country. And this I shall prove beyond any question; For if <hi>Cecil</hi> was the Contriver of this Plot (as they give out) then <hi>Tresham</hi> could not be his Agent; since the whole was communicated to <hi>Winter</hi> in the latter end of the Year 1603: but <hi>Tresham</hi> was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, nor taken in to the number till about <hi>August</hi> 1605, as appears from <hi>Winters</hi> Confession.<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 47, 56.</note> So that either the Plot must not be <hi>Cecils,</hi> or <hi>Cecil</hi> must carry it on for a year and a half without such a Factor, or else he must have another that he did thus employ than <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham.</hi> But if there was such a Satesman to contrive, and such an intelligence to carry it on; how came the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators, who had some suspition it seems of <hi>Tresham,</hi> not to make use of such a Plea to excuse themselves, or mitigate their Crime, either upon their Examination and Trial, or at their Execution? Whence again was it that those, that in those days writ Apologies for them, never offered at this, altho they were such as were furnished with Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence enough to have found it out, and Sagacity enough to have made use of it, if it had bin true? To the latter of these the answer is ready:<note place="margin">Apol. p. 411.</note>

                  <hi>For if it were lawful not to receive or repel him</hi> [<hi>K.</hi> James] <hi>(as the said Bulls do import) then it is lawful also to expel and cast him out.

But it seems the Pope had some broad intimation given him of King <hi>James</hi>'s affection both to his Holiness and his Religion; our Author calls it, <hi>an assurance of his being a Catholick under his own Hand and Seal.</hi> And truly if it had been so, I know no better Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate could be given at that distance; but this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Person did with caution add, [<hi>to the Kings Hand and Seal</hi>] <hi>that it was obtained by the fraud (as they said) of the Scotish Secretary of State.</hi> For indeed thereby hangs a tale, and tho the Intrigue of this matter hath been sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and made evident to the World by several learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Persons;<note place="margin">Bp. <hi>Andrews Tort.

               <p>In the year 1598, the Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> Secretary of State in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the instance of his Cousin Sir <hi>Edward Drummond,</hi> a professed Papist, did solicit the King to write a Letter to <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII in the behalf of the Bishop of <hi>Vaison,</hi> their kinsman, for a Cardinalship: suggesting withal that it would be a means to secure the succession of the Crown to his Majesty. But the King obstinatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing, they did contrive to shuffle in a Letter, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, amongst others (omitting the Titles given to the Pope and leaving room for their insertion afterwards)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95553:12"/>
and to wait when the King was ready to go on hunting to procure his hand to that with the rest. This Letter so obtained, <hi>Drummond</hi> carried to <hi>Rome</hi>; but within a while this being discovered to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> she in the year 1599 sent to the King about it. He thereupon questions <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> who absolutely denied it, and to give the King satisfaction sent for <hi>Drummond,</hi> who abjured it. Thus it continued, till in the year 1608, when Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> undertaking to reply to the King's Apology for the Oath of Allegiance, charged him with inconstancy upon the account of this Letter. <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> happen'd then to come into <hi>England</hi> about other matters; the first thing put to him at <hi>Royston</hi> (where the King at that time was) was the business of this Letter, which he then confessed. upon this he was remitted to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spotswood</hi>'s Hist. p. 510.</note> and Condemn'd; all the while acknowledging, <hi>as he wished God to have mercy upon his Soul, that his Majesty was wrongfully charged with the writing that Letter.</hi> And that he was so, (and so it could not be an argument for the Popes kindness to the King in those Breves) will be evident, if it be considered,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That in the year 1599 (as above said) the thing was known, and the whole denied and abjured by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons concerned, which the Pope could not be ignorant of. For <hi>Drummond</hi> was not only sent for over by <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> to forswear it, but was notwithstanding upon suspicion imprisoned,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Respons. ad Tort.</hi> p. 194.</note> and after he had obtained his Liberty, going to <hi>Rome,</hi> did, upon the importunity of <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> by some art procure that Letter, and sent it back to the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, as he confessed.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) While the Pope had this Letter, he did shew it to all Scotsmen that came to him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Id.</hi> 195.</note> enquiring if they knew the hand, and suffering some to take transcripts of it;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95553:12"/>
which if he had not suspected, he would certainly have kept to himself, or communicated only to such as he could trust such a necessary secret, as that was, with.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The Pope never did return an answer to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, nor did at all concern himself to do what he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of him; whereas if he had believed the Letter to be the Act of that King, he would not have so far neglected the interest of the Church, as to have slighted it.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) When not many years afterwards he,<note place="margin">Id. 196.</note> did upon his own accord write an obliging Letter to the King, he did not only omit the Title of Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he doth give to all Princes of their Communion; but also did not take any notice of that Letter pretended to be written; which would have been a very good ground to have fastened a desired correspondence upon.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) This was the sense of the Priests upon the point; for after this <hi>Parsons</hi> the Jesuit did declare that the <hi>King was an obstinate Heretick,</hi>

                  <hi>and that there was no possibility of his Conversion.</hi> And <hi>Garnet,</hi> when in the last days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> he was solicited by a Gentleman of his own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to favour the King's Title, answered, <hi>he would have nothing to do in it, for the King was so obdurate in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there was no hopes of his Conversion.</hi> Now,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>From which it appears that this Letter was the Letter of <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> and not of King <hi>James</hi>; and that the Pope had no more a respect to it in those Breves, then there was in them intended a kindness to that King. And from all that hath been said will also appear, how little reason there is to make any other a Contriver of this Treason than the Conspirators, and their own Party.</p>

up the established Religion to make thereby room for their own, and to disturb the Government in order to it; and this was not to be done by fourteen Lay-men, tho we cast in the four Jesuits also to their assistance. Whilst the Plot lay under ground, and was to be carried on by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there needed only a few heads to contrive, and a few hands to execute: and that part of it which required on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Match and the Tinder, a <hi>Faux</hi> alone was sufficient for; these might manage the more secret Negotiation.

               <p>The Persons concerned herein were not such Novices as to undertake so much upon no prospect of good and sufficient assistance. This they well foresaw, and did in the beginning advise about, as <hi>Winter</hi> confessed; <hi>Whilst we were together,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings p. 53.</note> 
                  <hi>we began to fashion our business, and discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what we should do after this Deed was done.

               </p>
               <p>This we find them consulting how to do without sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion; for <hi>Garnet</hi> did hereupon write to <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier Jesuit in the Low-Countries,<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 170.</note> in the behalf of <hi>Catesby,</hi> that <hi>one should move the Marquess for a Regiment of Horse for</hi> Catesby; <hi>not with any intent, as it was agreed, that</hi> Catesby <hi>should undertake the Charge, but that under colour of it, Horses and other necessaries might be provided without suspicion to furnish the Traitors.</hi> This we find further that they had done; for <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> Priests, at their apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did affirm that there was some Treason intended by the Jesuits, and then in hand; as for other Reasons, so for that <hi>they had collected and gathered together great sums of Money to Levy an Army therewith when time should serve:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings p. 123, 124.</note> 
                  <hi>and had both bought up store of great Horses about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95553:14"/>
and conveyed Powder and Shot, and Artillery secretly to their Friends, wishing them not to stir, but to keep themselves quiet, until they heard from them.</hi> And it seems that they had met with good success in it, for <hi>there was in</hi> June 1605 <hi>a Conference and Consultation betwixt</hi> Garnet, Catesby,<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 169.</note> 
                  <hi>and</hi> Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham <hi>concerning the strength of the Catholicks in</hi> England, <hi>to the end that</hi> Garnet <hi>might by Letters send direct Advertisement thereof to the Pope, for that his Holiness would not be brought to shew his inclination concerning any such Commotion, until such time as he should be certainly informed, that they had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and able Force to prevail.</hi> By which they must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose not only that the Catholick Party was strong in it self, but also that that strength should be in readiness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occasion, or else their message to the Pope had been to little or no purpose. This Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> in his Papers often glances at.

                  <hi>but the Lieutenant maketh all shew to me of the contrary; for, saith he, the Catholicks are so few in number, that they are not to be feared on any terms, for on his knowledg there were not above</hi> 4000 <hi>in all</hi> England. <hi>Besides, he said they were easily pacified; I would not at all argue the matter with him, but if the number should be objected to me,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby we may perceive what his opinion was in the case, who could not but understand in some measure what the condition and strength of his Party was, and what expectation they might reasonably have from it. The Catholicks were in his Judgment many, and to <hi>be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and he did apprehend they would not be wanting to their Cause or them in that juncture. Which agrees with what we find observ'd by the Secretary,<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 27.</note> that <hi>by diverse Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements from beyond the Seas, he understood that the Papists were making preparations for some Combination amongst them against this Parliament time, for enabling them to deliver at that time to the King, some Petition for Toleration of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: which should be delivered in some such order, and so well back'd, as the King should be loth to refuse their requests.</hi> It's likely that it was given out amongst, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that there was such a Petition preparing, and if they could but possess their own Party by that means, so as to be in expectation of it, it might serve to satisfie them about any report of an Insurrection; and keep them from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into that which they endeavoured to keep within the breasts of a few. And this will serve to give light to what I have before said at the beginning of this Section, <hi>viz.</hi> That more were concerned in this Conspiracy than were at that time publickly known, that is, more than we read of did

know of the very manner of a Plot, for the destruction of the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as those that were to surprize the next Heir;) and many more of a Plot to bring in and set up their Religion by force of Arms.

And upon the first of <hi>November Garnet</hi> openly prayeth for the good success of the great Action concerning the Catholick Cause in the beginning of the Parliament; adding these Verses of an Hymn in the end of his Prayer,—</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Gentem auferte perfidam</l>
                  <l>Credentium de finibus,</l>
                  <l>Vt Christo laudes debitas</l>
                  <l>Persolvamus alacriter.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This <hi>Garnet</hi> never denied, but pleaded that <hi>he went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a purpose to disswade Mr.</hi> Catesby,<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 216, 217.</note> 
                  <hi>when he should have come down — An Answer most absurd</hi> (as the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> replied to him) <hi>seeing he knew</hi> Catesby <hi>would not come down till the</hi> 6<hi>th of</hi> November, <hi>which was the day after the Blow should have been given; and</hi> Garnet <hi>went into the Country ten days before.</hi> If this had been his Errand, it would rather have kept him in <hi>London,</hi> where <hi>Catesby</hi> was, than carried him from it.</p>
               <p>As to the Prayer he used, he had prepared this Answer (as he told <hi>Hall</hi> in their secret Conference together) <hi>It is true</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I prayed for the good Success of that great Action, but I will tell them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings p. 189.</note> 
                  <hi>that I meant it in respect of some sharper Laws, which I feared they would then make against the Catholicks: And that answer shall serve well enough.</hi> In which (1.) he plainly grants that he had another end in reciting that verse, than he would own to them that should exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him upon it. (2.) It appears that the end which he did it for, was what he was very much afraid to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. As is evident from his own Letters, in one of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95553:17"/>
which he saith, <hi>I know not how I shall satisfie them about my Journey to</hi> Coughton;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Abbot to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilogia, p.</hi> 144 b. 145 b.</note> and in another, <hi>there is a rumour of a Sermon preached by me at</hi> Hall; <hi>I am afraid it's that which I made at</hi> Coughton. And he further said to <hi>Hall, If I can clear my self of this (which I hope to do) I care not what otherwise they have to object against me,</hi> &amp;c. And can we then think that it was <hi>by chance that he recited those Verses (being used in the</hi> Octaves <hi>of All-Saints day)</hi> as his Apologist saith;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apolog. pro Garneto. p.</hi> 201.</note> or that the Prayers then used were <hi>only for Toleration,</hi> as the English Apologist would have it. If this had been true,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cath. Apol. p.</hi> 436.</note> what need he be so careful about it, what need he take such care for an answer to it? If it had been by chance, the thing would have spoke for it self. Or if it had been for Favour and Toleration, it was not what they needed to be afraid to own: for how could it be more dangerous to pray to God for success in it than it would have been to frame a Petition and present it to their Prince for it? It sounds somewhat better, which one of the above said Authors doth frame upon further consideration; that <hi>when</hi> Garnet <hi>despair'd of hindring the Conspirators,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apolog. pro Garneto, p.</hi> 265, &amp; 320.</note> 
                  <hi>the good man having tried all humane wayes in vain, adds the publick prayers to his own,</hi> ut Deus, vel pestem eam averteret, vel si ita expedire videret, felicem certè funesto facinori exitum daret; <hi>That God would either divert it, or grant an happy conclusion to this Villanous Enterprize</hi>;<note place="margin">Ibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and that what ever happens it might turn to the good of the Church,</hi> as he again expounds himself. By which we see how much they are put to it that would give a colour to an ill action; how they say and unsay, (as this Author doth) one while its by chance, another while by choice; and how they contradict one another. Unhappy Man! that could not light upon these answers that are since made for him; and very fortunate are they that can frame
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95553:17"/>
Apologies for Actions which those that were intimately concerned in them never thought upon. But as long as this Prayer was then used, and no better account can be given of it by him or those that speak for him; we have all the reason in the world to believe it to have a respect to the Action that he, and the rest, were condemned for; and that this was a part of those <hi>Forms of Prayer, that were sent down and used for the success of that great Errand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Premoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs in K. <hi>James</hi>'s Works. p. 291.</note> as King <hi>James</hi> saith. It is granted then that there was an intimation given out of some great Design on foot against the Session of Parliament; but whether it did respect a Petition against, <hi>some sharper Laws at that time feared to be made against Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> (as Garnet said) or whether a <hi>Toleration</hi> (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother) or whether the Powder-Treason and an Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection upon it, I hope what hath been already said will help in good measure to resolve; although we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so particularly point to Time and Place, Persons, and Counsels herein concerned, &amp; what are indeed impossible, in our Circumstances, fully to discover. The Author of the Catholick Apology saith, that <hi>Winter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cath. Apol. p. 528.</note> 
                  <hi>in his printed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession descends to all particulars</hi>; which, if true, would have afforded an excellent light to us. But that is far otherwise, for that Confession was taken the 23 of <hi>November</hi> 1605, not long after his apprehension; and it was immediately published to give some satisfaction to the World;<note place="margin">Proceed. p. 46.</note> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imperfect, he was afterwards taken into further Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,<note place="margin">Abbati An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilogia p. 113. a p. 162. b</note> and many other things were confessed by him upon it. In his printed Confession, we have an account of the Beginning and Progress of the Gunpowder-Treason, (strictly so called), there we have an account of what was debated and projected by them in the Vault, and what Provisions they were further to make for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing the Design: but all the while there is not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95553:18"/>
a word of what was done in order to it. All this could not be done without Men, and Arms, Horses and Mony; but we read nothing then of the Levies that were made, of the Horses that were in readiness, nor of the Treasure that was provided (except what was subscribed by <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi> and <hi>Digby</hi>) and yet we are as sure that such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was not to be carried on without these, as we are that there was such a Design. Therefore it will be fit to enquire from whence it is that we have no fuller account as to these matters. And we shall be helped in this, if we consider,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That in the beginning of such a Design as this was, there was no need of many Assistants, (as I have before shewed) and so they took into it no more then they had present occasion for, either in working in the Mine, &amp;c. or bearing the Charge. Whatever Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices they had abroad, had nothing else to do, but to lye quiet, and wait till the hour did approach and the Signal was given. So <hi>Watson</hi> the Priest confessed, that <hi>they had brought up store of great Horses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceed. p. 124.</note> 
                  <hi>and conveyed Powder,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>secretly to their Friends, wishing them not to stir, but keep themselves quiet until they heard from them.</hi> From hence it was that either none were discovered but the head Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of it; or those, that upon presumption of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess above, got too early into arms, as <hi>Grant &amp;c.</hi> or such as being sure, if any, to be discovered got into a body, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured for that reason to provoke others to joyn with them, as <hi>Catesby,</hi> &amp;c. but the rest that were to lie still, and to <hi>keep themselves quiet</hi> till the Blow was given, thought it best in prudence, when it had miscarried, to continue so.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The encreasing of Assistants, and the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Counsels to many at the first, was so far from being needful, that it would have been dangerous. It
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95553:18"/>
would have endangered the whole, for by that means the Design might have got Air, and been defeated. It would have endangered their Friends (if it had been discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and needlesly exposed them. This was the reason that <hi>Owen</hi> gave,<note place="margin">Proceed. p. 56.</note> why Sir <hi>William Stanley would not be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any Plot</hi> (though a hearty Well-wisher to it) <hi>as having business a-foot in the Court of</hi> England, (for fear, <hi>i. e.</hi> if the Plot should be discovered, and he discoverd to be privy to it, he should then lose his Interest there) and not that <hi>he would not trust him with such a secret,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cath. Apol. p. 528.</note> as the Author of the <hi>Cath. Apol.</hi> would have it.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) When they did communicate their Design to any, and take them into their Counsel and Assistance, it was with all the Caution imaginable. For they took an Oath of Secrecy, and the Sacrament upon it;<note place="margin">Proceed. p. 41. p. 51.</note> the sum of the Oath was;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You shall swear by the blessed Trinity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceed. p. 166.</note> 
                  <hi>and by the Sacrament you now purpose to receive, never to disclose, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, by word or circumstance, the matter that shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to you to keep secret; nor desist from the Execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, until the rest shall give you leave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like care was taken with respect to <hi>Owen, Bates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 56. 104. &amp; 241.</note> and <hi>Digby.</hi> And <hi>Garnet</hi> himself confesseth, <hi>that by word and writing, he had often protested that he would never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tort. Torti. p. 286.</note> So that it seems they had obliged even Him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some solemn manner to Secrecy.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Their Caution was further remarkable, that, neither the manner of the thing was known to many, nor the Persons frequently to each other. It was enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Party by some general Intimation; but the <hi>How,</hi> or the <hi>What,</hi> or the <hi>Where,</hi> was what the principal Cabal
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95553:19"/>
and Consult kept for the most part secret to themselves. So much is acknowledged by Sir <hi>Everard Digby; As I did not know it directly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paper 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that it was approved by such</hi> (referring to some Persons of great authority either in point of Dignity, Wisdom, or Conscience) <hi>so did I hold it in my conscience the best,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paper 9.</note> 
                  <hi>not to know any more if I might.</hi> So again, <hi>This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> [of Garnet's] <hi>with Mr.</hi> Catesby'<hi>s proceedings with him and me, gave me absolute belief that the matter in general was approved, though every particular was not known.</hi> He that was privy to the main, and a principal Undertaker in one great part of the Design, which was to seize upon the Princess, and head the party that was thereabouts, was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in some other things relating to it. And what he did not desire to know if he might, others its likely might not know, if they desired it. Those that knew their own work, and were assigned to some particular Office, might know no more what <hi>They</hi> did, or were to do, who were above, than every little Officer in a Reigment, is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Debates and Resolves of a secret Council of War: and they that were ready to obey, and whose work it was to observe the motions of the Commander in their eye, might think no more of killing the King, or of blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Parliament, than that they should be blown up themselves. The good of the Catholick Cause, and an Insurrection for promoting it, is what perhaps such might be trusted with the knowledg of; but the Destruction of the Royal Family (excepting one whose name they were to make use of) and setting up a Protector, might be as little known to them, as their Commanders are to us. They might have an Intimation of a great Alteration coming on, and of the happy days that were approaching; and half a sentence might serve to break the business to them (whom they would prepare for it) and a nod to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95553:19"/>
supply what was farther to be revealed, but that should be left till time and success should interpret it. Thus speaks <hi>Henry Morgan,</hi> who being asked by <hi>Hammond</hi> the Jesuit (unto whom he amongst the rest made confession) what led him to joyn with <hi>Winter,</hi> &amp;c. answered, <hi>I did not,</hi> saith he, <hi>well understand it, but they told me that Religion and Life was at stake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abboti. Antilog. p. 154. b.</note> 
                  <hi>and so it was matter of Conscience induced me to it.</hi> When therefore the case is thus, we can have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information, or understand more from such, then they were permitted to understand.</p>
               <p>For the same reason was it, that,<note place="margin">Cambden. Eliz.</note> as it was in the Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1588, the Conspirators were not generally known to one another, unless those who were of the Cabinet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Every one knew his immediate fellow or partner, and perhaps his Commander; but the number and strength, or persons otherwise he could in such a case at best but suspect; so we find that neither <hi>Littleton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abbot. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilog. p. 164. b.</note> nor <hi>Rookwood</hi> knew <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi> And that they did practise according to this Principle is evident from <hi>Winter</hi>'s Confession, where we read that <hi>Catesby desired Leave, that he with Mr.</hi> Percy, <hi>and a third,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Winter</hi>'s Confession, in Proceed. p. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>whom they should call, might acquaint whom they thought fit and willing to the business: for many, said he, may be content that I should know, who would not therefore that all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany should be acquainted with their names.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paper 9.</note> So Sir Everard Digby, <hi>I knew,</hi> saith he, <hi>that</hi> Faux <hi>could reveal me, for I must make choice of two besides Mr.</hi> Catesby, <hi>which I did of him and Mr.</hi> Winter. He had a part which he would not have every one acquainted with.

                  <hi>I did ask Mr.</hi> Farmer [<hi>i. e.</hi> Garnet,<note place="margin">Proceeds p. 144.</note> for that was one of the six names he was called by] <hi>what the meaning of the Pope's Brief was; he told me that they were not (meaning Priests) to undertake or procure any stirs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and this answer, with Mr.</hi> Catesby's <hi>proceedings with him and me, gave me absolute belief that the matter in general was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,</hi> &amp;c. So that he understood <hi>Garnet</hi>'s meaning indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly only by the answer given to that question, and by the account which <hi>Catesby</hi> also gave him of the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al's opinion in the case. <hi>Catesby</hi> being his mouth to the Company, and giving them assurance that it was <hi>Garnet</hi>'s Judgment as well as his own. This <hi>Garnet</hi> doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in a Letter of his,<note place="margin">Tort. Torti. p. 286.</note> 
                  <hi>what should I do?</hi> saith he, <hi>first of all the other Conspirators did accuse me; and again,</hi> Catesby <hi>always made use of my Authority with them, by which means he perswaded almost every body to think well of the matter.</hi> Thus carefully did this subtile Man proceed, that he might preserve his own Honour and Life, and that which seemed to be as dear to him as both, the honour of his Order and Society. From all which we see, that though the party hung together, yet it was by such strings that few could perceive among themselves, the clue being in the hands of the Chief of the Conspiracy: and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently we cannot expect that full and clear Evidence, as we might have had, had such of them as <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Piercy</hi> lived to make discovery; or had such of them as lived to be examined and tryed, been inclined to it. But that we find otherwise. For,</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95553:20"/>
would confess none of his complices,</hi> till he was carried to the Tower and shewed the Rack. Thus resolved, we find Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> who saith,<note place="margin">Paper 1.</note> 
                  <hi>more reasons I had to perswade me to this belief, than I dare utter, which I will never to the suspicion of any, though I should to the Rack for it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paper 9.</note> So again, <hi>I will do as much as my Partner wisheth, and it will then appear, that I shall not hurt or accuse one man: and however I might in general possess them with fear, in hope to do the Cause good; yet my care was ever to lose my own Life, rather than hurt the unworthiest Member of the Catholick Church. Tell her I have ever loved her and her House,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I will not live to manifest the contrary.</hi> Where we find that they were much afraid of him, who was able to do them a great deal of mischief from the knowledge that he had of the Party and the Design; and who perhaps they thought might be induced to it from the desire of life, being but about 24 years old, and one of a plentiful estate;<note place="margin">Preface to his papers.</note> but he shews himself to be true to his Principles and Engagements. Of the like temper and resolution do we find Mr. <hi>Habing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mss. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </note> for saith he, <hi>My Lord Chief Justice fell in the end to two points. The one, If Mr.</hi> Tesmond <hi>ever moved me to joyn with Sir</hi> Everard Digby, <hi>Mr.</hi> Catesby, <hi>Mr.</hi> Winter <hi>and others in Rebellion against the King, but that they could not prove; the other If I knew of Mr.</hi> Garnet'<hi>s being in my house. I too confident they would not confess any thing against me, denied them both.</hi> He doth not deny but that the whole was true; only the one wanted proof, and he did believe the other would never be confessed. And he had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for it; for he tells us, that it was mutually resolved by <hi>Garnet, Hall</hi> and himself, that if those two were at any time taken in his House, <hi>we should,</hi> saith he, <hi>absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all knowledg and acquaintance one with another.</hi> Of this we have also another instance in one <hi>Owen,</hi> who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95553:21"/>
was <hi>Garnet's</hi> man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thuanus</hi>
                  </note> that rather then be tortured (which he was in fear of) and any thing should be wrested from him to the damage of his Party,<note place="margin">Abboti An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. p. 114.</note> ript up his own Belly, and so died; by the Wound, I say, which he gave himself, and not by having his Bowels forced out by Torture,<note place="margin">Apol. pro <hi>Garneto.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Garnet's</hi> lying Apologist would perswade the World.</p>
               <p>But amongst all their Accomplices they were most of all bent to conceal their Priests, and by no means to own any of them to be in the Confederacy. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> seem'd to be more concern'd to clear himself of the suspicion of offending in; <hi>As yet,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Paper 1.</note> 
                  <hi>they have not got of me the affirming that I know any Priest particularly, nor shall ever do to the hurt of any, but my self. And I have before all the Lords cleared all the Priests in it for any thing I know.</hi> And this he was so resolved in, that he would <hi>not utter any thing to the suspicion of any such, though,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Ibid. &amp; pap. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>I should to the Rack for it.</hi> And to testifie his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection further that way, he was resolved to clear them at the Bar, for thus saith he; <hi>Sure I am that I never did yet confess to know him</hi> [one that he calls Brother, who is a Priest,<note place="margin">Proceed. p. 166.</note> and, by his being said to <hi>give the Sacrament to five at one time,</hi> I conceive is meant <hi>Gerard,</hi> who did admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster it to <hi>Catesby</hi> and four others of the Conspirators at the beginning of the Plot] <hi>nor any of the three.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>I do it not in regard of my self, as it shall appear at the Bar: for whatsoever I could do for him or any of his</hi> [i. e. his Order] <hi>I would do it though it cost me never so much sufferance: but I have been sparing in that, because I may do more in publick, which will I think be best; as you wish, I will do,</hi> &amp;c. This also he did, <hi>seeking by Protestations to clear all Jesuites of those practices which they themselves confessed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paper 5.</note> 
                  <hi>ex ore proprio</hi>; as the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> said.<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 220.</note> In order to which they though it allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nay, praise-worthy, to lye, and perjure themselves.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95553:21"/>
As to the former we have too many instances in Sir <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard's</hi> Papers, for he denies that ever he took the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to keep secret the Plot; <hi>because,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Paper</note> 
                  <hi>I would avoid the question; at whose hands it were.</hi> He denied that <hi>Father Wally</hi> [<hi>i. e. Garnet,</hi> for that is another of his names] <hi>was at</hi> Coughton <hi>with him</hi>;<note place="margin">Paper 3.</note> though <hi>Garnet</hi> confessed it afterwards himself. He affirmed that he did not <hi>know Darcy</hi> [who was also so called] to be the same with <hi>Garnet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paper 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and that he did not take him to be a Priest</hi>; though he was very well acquainted with him. And if we will put their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to it, we may see how far they will go in <hi>Tresham</hi>; who when he had before let fall some words tending to make <hi>Garnet</hi> guilty of the Spanish Treason; rather than he would be guilty (as he and his Wife thought) of so great impiety, as to bring a Priest into danger by a true accusation, chose to perjure himself, and as he was a dying man (for within three hours after he died) and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for Salvation, did acquit him of it, saying, <hi>that he had not seen the Provincial in sixteen years before</hi>; whereas by <hi>Garnet</hi>'s own confession they had had frequent Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with each other for the three years last past. But if these Gentlemen (who usually stand upon the honour of their word) <hi>would go about to excuse all Jesuits how foul so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, out of an opinion that it is meritorious so to do,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceed. p. 220.1.</note> 
                  <hi>at such time as they had no hope of themselves,</hi> as the Earl of <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> observed: Then what may not be expected from the Jesuits themselves, who had so powerfully instilled these Principles into persons otherwise generous, and when their own life and honour, and the honour of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Society came deeply to beconcerned. We may then expect obstinacy and subtilty should meet together, and all that Art and Nature can do shall be made use of to clear them of the scandal and danger that would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

befall them. And we shall not fail of an example herein, if we do but peruse the Examinations, and Trial, the Answers, and Confessions of <hi>Garnet,</hi> who at this time was the Provincial of that Order in <hi>England.</hi> We shall find his great care was not so much to speak Truth, as to serve his Cause, and excuse himself; and if he could but dress up a Story,<note place="margin">Abboti An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. p. 137. a 146. b.</note> and make what he calls <hi>Formalis Fabula</hi> (in one of his Letters that was intercepted), he would not want Confidence, and the most powerful Asseverations to confirm it.

                  <hi>As when before the Lords Commissioners he truly and freely confessed his Treasons, being (as himself under his own hand confessed) overwhelmed, Tanta nube Testium, yet, ad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum populum,</hi> to delude the People and preserve his own Reputation; <hi>in his Letters which he wrote abroad, he cleareth himself of the Powder-Treason,</hi> as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> relates. These are Tricks not to be taken notice of in comparison of the boldness which he at other times did take to excuse and clear himself. Is he charged with having writ Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Greenwell,</hi> and when he had denied it, required to give his answer <hi>upon the word of a Priest</hi>?<note place="margin">Abboti.

                  <note place="margin">Proceed. p. 195.</note> Is he demanded whether <hi>Hall</hi> and He had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference together, and desired not to equivocate? how <hi>stifly did he deny it upon his Soul, reiterating it with so many detestable Execrations, as the Earl of</hi> Salisbury <hi>said, it wounded their Hearts to hear him</hi>; and yet when it was proved to his face, confessed the thing; as not only the <hi>Proceedings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abboti. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. p. 146. a.</note> but his own Letters do declare; coming off with this <hi>Salvo, That when any one is charged before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,

he is not bound to answer before Witnesses are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>;<note place="margin">Casaub. Epist. ad Ducaeum, p. 117, 118.</note> 
                  <hi>quia nemo tenetur prodere seipsum,</hi> because no one is bound to betray himself. This is a new way of arguing, but it's not the only singular thing befel him in that kind; For whereas all Mankind do practise Sincerity at their death; yet even then he could not forget to prevaricate; for he said upon the scaffold immediately before his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,<note place="margin">Proceedings <hi>p.</hi> 225</note>, that <hi>he only had a general knowledg of the Fact by Mr.</hi> Catesby, &amp;c. <hi>and what he knew in particulars was in Confession:</hi> when yet the <hi>King had under his own Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing to the contrary</hi> (as the Recorder wished him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) as shall be shewed in the next Section. So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole he abundantly made good what the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> said to him at his tryal, <hi>I confess that never any man in your state gave less hold or advantage to Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings P. 201.</note> 
                  <hi>than you have done in the whole course of Proceeding, to us that were in Commission: sometime by forswearing, as upon the Confession of</hi> Hall <hi>your fellow: sometime by dissembling, as about the places of your Rendezvous, which was the Lapwings Nest: sometime by artificial Equivocation: sometime by sophisticating true Substances: sometime by adding false quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: yet</hi> sat superest, <hi>as may appear, to the defeat of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and the defence of the Kings Majesty</hi>; quia magna est veritas, &amp; praevalet.</p>
               <p>Now if we lay all these things together, and consider, how few the design, (as far as it went), needed to have actually concerned in it, how cautious they were in choosing persons for their turn, and in obliging them to secrecy when they were chosen; how cunning they were to shew the Plot by parts, and in disposing of Persons; so that few amongst them did know, and so should not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray each other, (if through fickleness or fear they might be so disposed); how firm and resolute they were upon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95553:23"/>
discovery and apprehension; it is so far from being an objection against the History of this Plot, which makes it popish, that so few were discovered; that it's matter of wonder there is so much reason as there is to prove it to be so. Now it may be worth our while a little to consider how they came by so much evidence as they had in the Case.</p>
               <p>As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Some things were evident of themselves, and not to be denied, they being taken in the fact; as it was with <hi>Faux,</hi> and those of them that were openly in Arms.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Other things were confessed, for fear of the Rack, or the little tast they had of it; as it was with <hi>Faux</hi> in his first Confession.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) So much Intelligence being obtained; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners shewed this to the others, and so drew them on to confess more. This is one of the reasons <hi>Garnet</hi> gives to excuse himself for confessing so much as he did, in one of his Letters that was intercepted. This is the account he also gave of himself as to that matter at his death. Being upon the Gibbet he said— <hi>to whom</hi> [the Lords of the Privy-Council] <hi>I remember my humble duty, and I am sorry that—I did dissemble with them; but I did not think that they had such proof against me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings p. 227.</note> 
                  <hi>till it was shewed me: but when that was proved, I held it more honour for me at that time to confess, than before to have accused.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Sometimes it was by several Examinations, at some distance of time; this put <hi>Garnet</hi> to it; as he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in his Letter to Mrs <hi>Ann; Let any one think,</hi> saith he, <hi>after</hi> 23 <hi>several Examinations by the wisest men of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

                     <hi>Abboti An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. p.</hi> 137.</note> for sometime he would say <hi>Greenwel</hi> told him the business in Confession, sometimes it was by way of Consultation: one while upon the word of a Priest he burnt the Popes Breves as soon as King <hi>James</hi> was Proclaimed; another time he burnt them at <hi>Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Sometimes they did discover themselves through want of understanding one another.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tortura Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti. p.</hi> 285.</note> As it was with <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> who knowing <hi>Catesby</hi> was dead, and thinking <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> had made his escape, concluded he might then safely say any thing, and so would own no other knowledg of the Plot but what he had in confession: but afterwards understanding (through Misinformation) that he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, least <hi>Greenwell</hi> should confess and prevent him in it, he then acknowledged that he had it out of Confession.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Sometimes a Confession was extorted by confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Evidence. So when <hi>Garnet</hi> declared that he had no design of writing in behalf of <hi>Baynham,</hi> but to prefer him to a Command;<note place="margin">

               <p>The Author of the <hi>Cath. Apol.</hi> saith, <hi>that there were no more Conspirators, because no Gentleman was discovered,</hi> [besides those that were killed, and taken, and <hi>Owen</hi>] <hi>which could not happen out of design to save their Friends.</hi> This he offers two reasons for: (1.) <hi>Because several particulars (which might have been easily kept secret) were revealed, as may be found in their printed Confessions.</hi> (2.) <hi>The Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors did accuse their Confessors, and therefore certainly they would never have spared others, had there been any guilty.</hi> This cannot be supposed,<note place="margin">Rom. Chur. vindicated p. 65.</note> saith another, <hi>that they had not Tenderness enough to leave any other undiscovered; whose Conscience compelled them, to expose their own Confessors to their deserved Penalty.</hi> To which the last Author adds, (3.) <hi>That not one Nobleman, or any other of the Catholick Gentry did know or approve of that wicked conspiracy; because the Catholick Lords</hi> [all of them,<note place="margin">Cath. Apol. p. 406.</note> saith the Cath. Apol.] <hi>were to have undergone the same barbarous Fate with the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I cannot conceive the force of the first Argument; for what if there were <hi>several particulars revealed by them,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95553:24"/>
which might easily have been kept secret?</hi> Might not that be so, and yet there be nothing of Sincerity and Conscience in the case? Might it not be done for the connexion of one thing to another? (which often times makes Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be necessary, as it is there.) Might it not be done to impose upon the Examiners, and to let them think that when they are so exact in the less, they will not let slip the greater? And have we not just cause to think this to be the reason, rather than what the Apologist doth offer for it? If indeed these printed Confessions had been so exact (as he will needs suppose) then there had been some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for what he says; but when the contrary is manifest, his Argument falls of it self. And that this is so, appears from what I have before observed, for <hi>Faux</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> upon second Examination confessed more; and what they did afterward confess was so material, as could not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by them before, had they not been willing to have concealed it, if they well could. But again, where is the consequence (setting aside the conscience in it) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did sometimes let fall some things of little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, therefore they must needs also reveal things of an higher nature; therefore they must betray those Friends, who had not by any overt Acts discovered themselves? So that before this Argument must be granted, we must grant that <hi>Faux</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> were privy to the whole Plot; and that part in which they were not personally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as what they were. We must grant, that they made conscience of not concealing any part or particular of it, (as far as they knew); and we must further grant that all these particulars are contained in their printed Confessions. Or else we may safely conclude, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding there are <hi>several Particulars revealed in their printed Confessions (which might have been easily kept secret)</hi>

they might <hi>have a design to save their Friends</hi>; and there might be more Persons in the Plot than are recorded in their Confessions; and (which is pity) a pretty Argument is thereby lost; and which is worse than that, it might be a <hi>Popish and general Plot</hi> notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>But however, will they say, if they were sincere in those Confessions, then a part of it still remains good; and what greater Argument can there be for that they were sincere, than that <hi>they did accuse their own Confessors</hi> (which is a thing, that nothing but the power of truth can force them to) and if they did not spare them, they would certainly not spare others. In answer to which I shall consider,
<list>
                     <item>1. Whether they did thus accuse their Confessors?</item>

               <p>As to the first,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is notorious, that there were several of them did not at all accuse their Confessors; this is certain as to Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> that he (against his own knowledg) did all he could upon his Trial to vindicate them: And if we peruse the printed Confessions, we shall not find a word to that purpose. If <hi>Faux</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> did afterwards accuse any, it was what they were, if not very backward and cold, yet very imperfect in. For the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> tells Garnet;<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 194.</note> 
                  <hi>Let it not be forgotten that this interlocution of yours with</hi> Hall, <hi>overheard by others, appears to be</hi> digitus Dei: <hi>for thereby had the Lords some light and proof of matter against you, which might have been discovered otherwise by violence and coercion.</hi> Implying, as <hi>Morus</hi> observes, that they <hi>had not matter before sufficient to charge him with.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mori Hist. p. 315.</note> The great thing charged upon him seems to be, that some of the others confessed,<note place="margin">Antilog. p. 146. b.</note> that <hi>his name was used to them by</hi> Catesby <hi>to justifie the lawfulness of the Act,</hi> as <hi>Garnet</hi> in one

of his Letters doth say; but what he there adds, that <hi>All did so confess,</hi> is manifestly false. Since, besides what is abovesaid of Sir <hi>Everard, Morus</hi> doth declare,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mori Hist.</hi> p. 314.</note> that <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was confessed against the Jesuits, but what</hi> Bates <hi>said of Greenwel</hi> [or <hi>Greenway</hi>] viz. that he was in the company of the Conspirators; and which Sir <hi>Everard</hi> said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Digby's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> 3.</note> he heard he should confess of <hi>Wally</hi> (or <hi>Garnet.</hi>) So that when these late Apologists say <hi>the Traitors did all accuse and expose their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,</hi> its more than was true, and more than the Jesuits will thank them for. For all of them that hitherto pleaded the cause of the Jesuits do say the contrary;<note place="margin">Mori Hist. p. 313.</note> 
                  <hi>More</hi> shall speak for the rest; who saith, <hi>for ought I can perceive, the accusation of the Jesuits hath no other foundation than the Confession of</hi> Bates, <hi>who is said to have accused</hi> Greenway, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he would perswade us also, that <hi>Persons of good credit reported that while in Prison he confessed that he had accused him falsly.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 314.</note> How true this is I shall afterward consider; but I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this to shew what contrary things these men will say if it may serve their Cause; when in the last age it was pleaded none did accuse the Jesuits, and when in ours they would have it that they were accused by all.</p>
               <p>But (2.) Supposing they did accuse their Confessors, yet it was not because their <hi>Conscience did compel them</hi> to it; This <hi>More</hi> will have them so far from, that he saith, <hi>Bates did accuse them in hope of life, and afterward recanted.</hi> But whether <hi>Bates</hi> did so or no; yet in point of reason it is evident that it was not from any such motive: for then they that thus accused them would have repented of the Eact it self, and look'd upon it as an Evil, &amp; fit to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of. For what could move them in point of Conscience thus to <hi>expose them,</hi> if it was not that the Fact was evil, which their Confessors together with them had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated in?

                  <note place="margin">Proceedings p. 125 &amp; 126.</note> that <hi>he and</hi> Catesby <hi>had Sons, and that Boys would be Men, and that he hoped they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the Cause: Nay that God would raise up Children to</hi> Abraham <hi>out of stones.</hi> And they added, that <hi>they were sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that no body did set forth a Defence or Apologie of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but yet they would maintain the Cause at their deaths.</hi> And so it's likely they did,<note place="margin">K. <hi>James</hi>'s Premoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in his Works. p. 291.</note> for King <hi>James</hi> saith, that <hi>some of them continued so obstinate, that even at their death, they would not acknowledg their fault; but in their last words, immediately before the expiring of their Breath, refused to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themselves, and crave pardon for their deed, except the Romish Church should first condemn it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this we have a particular example in <hi>Grant,</hi> when being admonished just before his death by a learned and reverend Person to ask pardon of God for his offence; he confidently and readily replied;<note place="margin">Casaub. Epist. ad Ducaeum p. 91.</note> 
                  <hi>That he was so well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that there was no sin in the case, that on the contrary, he thought that he deserved so well for that generous and brave Attempt, that it would abundantly suffice for a satisfaction for all the sins of his whole life.</hi> So little did they generally repent of the Fact, and so little reason have we to think that what they confessed proceeded from compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Conscience; but rather that it was from some other reason; as fear of the Rack, or surprize, or because others had confessed, or that they themselves had given occasion from what they had before confessed for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

This Sir <hi>Everard</hi> foresaw, and therefore he took another course, (as is before observed) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that he had <hi>received the Sacrament at all upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</hi> Now that what I have before said is true,<note place="margin">Ibid. 152.

                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 154. a.</note> 
                  <hi>and resolve to defend it at his death.</hi> Truly I find none of them that had any touch of Remorse but <hi>Rookwood</hi> and <hi>Tho. Winter</hi>; and for the latter it is observable that when he said, <hi>I shall set down mine own Accusation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings p. 46.</note> &amp;c. <hi>which I shall the faithfuller do, since I see such courses are not pleasing to Almighty God</hi>; Yet was so far from doing so,<note place="margin">Ibid. 154. b</note> that he speaks there not one word of <hi>Gerard</hi> (whom upon a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Examination he discovered) or any other Jesuit; so that his Confession at that time seems rather to be owing to his second reason that he there gives, than his first, and that is, <hi>because the most material parts had bin already confessed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this, when the Traitors did accuse their Confessors, either they did this sincerely, and because <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by their Conscience,</hi> or not; if not (as I have shewed)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95553:27"/>
then what doth the Argument signify; that <hi>if the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Conscience did compel them to expose their own Confessors, then they would not have spared others.</hi> But if they did thus confess them sincerely and out of Conscience, then their Confessors were guilty of what these charged them with. And then let them take their choice.</p>
               <p>I shall now proceed to the consideration of the last Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which they would endeavour to prove that it was not <hi>a Popish Plot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> Ch. vindicated p. 64.65.</note> and, that not any besides the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Conspirators were concerned in this Treason, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>all the Catholick Lords were to have undergone the same barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fate with the rest.</hi> Supposing this was true (as it is not) yet is not the Pope's Interest to be promoted and the cause of the Jesuits maintained, though the Nobility of their own way be destroyed? Was there not a time when in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Invasion to be carried on by force from abroad,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Watson's Quodlibets</hi> p. 177.</note> and a secret Conspiracy at home, that it was not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons they regarded, but Interest? <hi>It was to make room, place and space for my Master,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceed. p. 156. &amp; p. 249.</note> said the Duke of <hi>Medina.</hi> And might not this be the case in 1605, as well as it was in 88? And so their Religion be thereby settled, and place and space made for the <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as <hi>Spain,</hi> and Authority and Power gain'd to the <hi>Society</hi>; it is no matter though the <hi>Innocent perish with the Nocent,</hi> and Friends as well as Foes fall by the same Stroak. This was foreseen in the present Conspiracy,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when it was made a case of Conscience by <hi>Catesby,</hi> it was resolved in the affirmative by <hi>Garnet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceed. p. 165.</note> that <hi>for the good and promoting of the Catholick Cause against Hereticks (the necessity of time and occasion so requiring) it was lawful among many Nocents to destroy and take away some Innocents also.</hi> So that it might be a popish Plot, though the <hi>Catholick Lords, and all the Catholick Lords</hi> were to perish with the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95553:27"/>
But notwithstanding what these Writers do say, that <hi>the Catholick Lords, and all the Catholick Lords, were to be thus barbarously dealt with</hi>: yet we shall find that this is a great mistake in matter of Fact also. The Confession of <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> (if they had read it) would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them otherwise; for, <hi>whilst we were in the Vault,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>we discoursed,</hi> saith he, <hi>what Lords we should save from the Parliament; which was first agreed in general; as many as we could that were Catholicks, or so disposed: but after we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to particulars.</hi> And Sir Everard Digby doth give a clear account of this matter; <hi>I dare not,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Paper 9.</note> 
                  <hi>take that course I could, to make it appear less odious; for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were to have been brought out of the danger, which now would rather hurt them than otherwise. I do not think there would have been three worth saving that should have been lost.</hi> To this purpose one of them that was privy to it took the way of writing to the Lord <hi>Monteagle.</hi> Other Lords, as the hour drew on, might be admonished of it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eudaem.

                     <hi>Cath. Apol.</hi> p. 408.</note> and which he thinks <hi>would certainly have kept the Person, to whom it was written, at home.</hi> By one, or the other, or the like waies, we see that care was taken to secure all those that would be true, or whom they could presume would be assisting to them. And when this was done, if the Author of the <hi>Catholick Apology,</hi> that tells us that <hi>the Catholick Noblemen then were not only considerable,<note place="margin">Cath. Apol. p. 400.</note> but the considerablest of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the first Marquis (there being at that time no Duke but the late King) the first Earl, and the first Baron being of that Profession</hi>; If after these, and the four other Lords he there names, he had filled up the Catalogue of all those
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95553:28"/>
that were professedly of his Religion (besides what were so disposed) we might by deducting of <hi>three</hi> (according to Sir <hi>Everard's</hi> calculation) have told him the number and quality of the Noblemen that were to be saved; and by doing so, have shewed him that it was so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, that <hi>all the Catholick Lords were to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,</hi> as he saith, that scarcely one of them would have undergone that Fate; and so it might be <hi>a Popish Plot, and an universal Popish Plot,</hi> without a <hi>contradiction</hi> or a <hi>riddle,</hi> notwithstanding what that Author hath said thereupon.</p>
               <p>As for what he there saith, that <hi>a Plot is looked upon as general, when a good number of the chief of a Party are intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued in the Design.</hi> I grant that such a Plot is general (if with them men of other states and degrees generally joyn with them in it) but yet it may be a general Plot of a Party, and the Nobility not be <hi>intrigued</hi> in it; and they may be intrigued, and yet it not be known. For what more common then to send a Forlorn-Hope before, that are willing to venture their Lives and Fortunes, and who if they perish, perish alone? What more common than for persons to have such intimations given them of a Plot as are sufficient to prepare them; and again to give such intimations of their consent and approbation, as shall be sufficient to assure the undertakers of their assistance; such as shall secure the one, if it should happen to be discovered; and warrant the other to go on with the greater resolution? What more common than to have a general notice of this, and to be willingly ignorant of the particulars (as hath been already observed?) And so the Lords might know of a Design in general; but that this was to be begun by blowing up the Parliament-House, it was not necessary they should know; because they were to be kept out of that danger; nor fit to know
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95553:28"/>
that they might not, if it miscarried, be brought into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What more ordinary than to raise and joyn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, and covertly to convey it, so that it shall serve the Cause without hurting themselves? And though this was not then publickly known, yet afterward their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Descendents found that it must be by some such secret ways that their Estates were broken and impaired; and I am assured that some of them (as Captain <hi>Dingly</hi> told a relation of his, whom he believed for that reason, and others to be concerned in it) did smell of Gunpowder some years after, if not to this day. And if this may be (as often it is) then a <hi>good number of the chief of the Party might be intrigued in the Design,</hi> and little knowledg of it come abroad then, or down to us now.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Proceed. p. 168.</note> as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> saith. The Jesuits by the management of <hi>Gerard,</hi> had been the means of bringing <hi>Watson's</hi> Treason to light,<note place="margin">

But now that all this was but a piece of Art, appears;</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Because all the while, even for twenty months space, <hi>Garnet</hi> kept <hi>Catesby</hi>'s practices secret; which, by his own confession,<note place="margin">Ibid.

               <p n="2">(2.) Because by the Pope's Letters to him it appears, tho care was taken as to <hi>general Commotions,</hi> yet as to particulars it was then said, there needed no prohibition, because what was said about generals would suffice.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid</hi> 139. b</note> The meaning of which, will appear from what Sir <hi>E. Digby</hi> saith, <hi>Paper</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It appears that the Commotions in <hi>Wales</hi> were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hush'd than disheartned, and rather put off than brought to an end. For we find, after the discovery of the <hi>Powder Plot,</hi> and the defeating that part of the Design, the Traitors had an expectation of assistance from <hi>Wales</hi>; and therefore <hi>Digby</hi> and <hi>Catesby,</hi> &amp;c. did write to <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> that he would go along with them thither, where they might expect help;<note place="margin">

If we now reflect upon what hath been said in this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and consider the Design it self, which, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning might be managed by few, yet, in the process of it, did require the help of many to take it up, to back and carry it on. If we further consider the persons at first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it; who were not only Men of experience, but also experienced in the same way, and would not venture upon such a Design without a sufficient Force.

by <hi>Dominick Wilkes,</hi> then Governour of <hi>Calice,</hi> and were pittied by him as they were thus forced to an Exile; one of them smartly replied, <hi>that is the least part of our grief; but that which doth afflict us indeed, is that we could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish so brave and good a Design.</hi> These were so daring as to own and glory in it; but, on the contrary, the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Greenwel,</hi> when it miscarried, and brought the ill opinion of the world upon them and their Society, did disown it, and would neither be said to encourage it or know it, however they might have been pleased with it, if it had succeeded. And therefore it will be necessary to shew that they were really as guilty, though they fled from the persuit of Justice, as the others that were taken and suffered by it: But because much of this story will fall in with <hi>Garnet's,</hi> I shall chuse rather to begin with his.</p>
               <p>That any of the Lay-men that suffered upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count were not really guilty, I think no body undertakes to prove. Only <hi>More</hi> doth offer somewhat to lessen the Guilt of Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Antilog. p. 110. a.</note> that he was privy to the <hi>Plot of Powder</hi>; but being herein confronted by the Testimony of <hi>Faux,</hi>

               <p>By which instance, we may conceive what kind of dealing we are to expect when we come to the case of the Persons of their <hi>own Order,</hi> when the Jesuits write after this rate about the case of those that are not. For of

                  <note place="margin">Proceedings p. 215.</note> This <hi>Garnet</hi> did offer in his own behalf, that he was bound to keep the secrets of Confessions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when asked by the Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Casaub. Epist. ad Ducaeum p. 137.</note> if <hi>one confessed this day to him, that to morrow morning he meant to kill the King with a Dagger, if he must conceal it?</hi> answered, <hi>that he must conceal it.</hi> Now, if this be true, what a case is the World in, that when a Design is laid to destroy the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family, the flower of the Nobility and Gentry, and thousands of persons besides; a Priest shall be obliged more to secrecy upon Confession, than to a discovery, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the mischief that shall thereby ensue. A prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple so much contrary to the peace of the World and the welfare of mankind, that I am confident if it was turned against themselves they would be the first that should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it; and that if such a Plot had been undertaken and carried on against <hi>the Pope and the whole Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Widdring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni Appen. p. 149.</note> (as <hi>Widdrington</hi> hath the Case) to send them out of the World by the like means, (as this was): neither his Holiness would have condemnd the Confessor if he had discovered it; or have commended him, if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it upon this reason, and thought himself obliged to him for his fidelity that way. Without doubt they would all say,<note place="margin">Proceed. p. 186.</note> as <hi>Garnet</hi> at last did—<hi>I must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,</hi> said he, <hi>that the Laws made against such concealing are very good and just, for it is not fit the safety of a Prince should depend upon any other man's Conscience.</hi> And if the Laws are good that make them guilty of Treason, who do (though upon account of Confession) conceal it, then those that thus do conceal it are far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, or fit to be inrolled amongst the number of Martyrs.</p>
               <p>But supposing it was only in Confession that they had any knowledg of it, yet there are several cases excepted
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95553:31"/>
and which it is lawful for them to divulge it in. Such a case is Heresie; according to that known verse amongst the Casuists, <q>Haeresis est crimen, quod nec confessio celat.</q>Thus <hi>Dominicus Soto</hi> determines,<note place="margin">Tort. Torti. p. 295.</note> (who is <hi>rigidior custodia Sigilli,</hi> as Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> saith of him) <hi>Such crimes are not to be concealed, but immediatly to be disclosed,</hi>

               <p>Such again is any crime that tends to the damage of a Community. Such again are all those crimes which are of pernicious consequence in themselves, and that are only in intention, but not committed by the Penitent.</p>
               <p>Such again are those where the Confession is not by way of Contrition, but Advice.</p>
               <p>In these and the like Cases the Casuists of their own Church have accounted it lawful and necessary to disclose them;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tort.

Apol. Paper 418.</note> So far is the Author of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Apology</hi> from speaking truth, when he saith that <hi>this Sacrament</hi> [of Confession] <hi>is of such reverence among</hi> us (unless he mean the Jesuits and some late Writters) <hi>that we cannot lawfully disclose a secret known by it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 426.</note> 
                  <hi>though 'twere to save Christianity from ruin.</hi> And so far is Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> from having nothing but <hi>Confidence, Malice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to drive him on,</hi> when he saith, their Casuists acknowledg, that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie told in Confession may be revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But; further supposing this was told in Confession, yet the <hi>Confessor is to disswade the Penitent from it</hi>;<note place="margin">Cath. Apol. p. 418.</note> (as the <hi>Catholick Apology</hi> at least seems to own,) and it is to be supposed, that if he is not to be disswaded; yet, then to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95553:32"/>
divert the mischief, the Confessor may and ought to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (for else he leaves the Case as he finds it, with respect to the Person or Persons concerned) provided, say their Casuists, that <hi>whilst he discovers the Crime, he doth conceal the Criminal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if all this be true, that a Secret may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in Confession, and the Confessor not sin in revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it; then what will it signifie that the Gunpowder-Treason was discovered in Confession, if the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed was of that kind as would make it lawful, fit, and necessary to be revealed? And certainly, next to <hi>the sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christianity from ruin,</hi> there can scarcely be a greater reason for breaking the Seal of that Sacrament (as they call it) than that a Royal Family, the Nobility (in great part) and Gentry, &amp;c. of a Nation would have bin by one blow destroyed. And yet this was patiently heard, and the Penitent not so much as really disswaded. For all that <hi>Garnet</hi> could say was, that he did <hi>oblige</hi> Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel <hi>to desist,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings p. 216.</note> 
                  <hi>and that he hoped that he had so done: and that he went unto Warwick-shire with a purpose to disswade Mr.</hi> Catesby;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antilog.</hi> p. 143 b.</note> though he knew <hi>Catesby</hi> would not come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till the day after the Blow was given; as hath been before observed.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But all this while this is far otherwise, it being very notorious that this Plot was discovered out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Greenwell, &amp;c.</hi> as will appear from the account which <hi>Garnet</hi> himself gives of it, (as far as he was concerned.) In which he delivers his mind very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly. Sometimes he saith, <hi>it was in Confession.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, he saith it was out of Confession, but it was with relation unto Confession; Sometimes it was by way of advice.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tortura Torti. p.</hi> 285.</note> Again, Let him be asked, what he thought of <hi>Greenwell</hi>'s intention in it? he saith, that perhaps <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:95553:32"/>
had no thoughts of Confession, but might discover it to him under a lesser Seal and Obligation of Secrecy. Now what can a person more discover himself by, than that in so solemn a thing as Confession, and such an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary case as was then revealed unto him, he yet knew not, if we may believe him, what the person confessing did intend, or in what way he himself received it; whether it was communicated to him as a Friend for advice, or as to a Confessor for the disburthing of the Conscience. But if we further enquire how this was discovered to him, we are still further to seek; It was first walking in the Field,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 296.</note> and afterward what they had frequent Conference about;<note place="margin">Antilog. p. 140. b.</note> as about the way of doing it, the progress in it, and the course they were to take after the first blow was given.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Widdrington App.</hi> p. 137.</note> This plainly proves it to be matter of Consultation rather than Confession; and that it was rather what he was pleased with, than what he sought to hinder. So that the whole story about <hi>Greenwel's</hi> Confession to <hi>Garnet,</hi> and <hi>Catesby</hi>'s Confession to <hi>Greenwel,</hi> seems to be no other than <hi>fabula formalis,</hi> a story of <hi>Garnet's</hi> own invention, as he in his private Letters doth acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Lastly, If we would understand the Case, let us follow him to his death; and yet there we are at a loss, where he saith, <hi>what he knew in particulars, was in Confession</hi>; and yet when minded by the Recorder,<note place="margin">Procee p. 226.</note> that the King had it under his own hand, <hi>that Greenway</hi> [or Greenwell] <hi>told him of this not as a fault, but by way of Consultation,</hi> &amp;c. he answered, <hi>whatsoever was under his hand was true.</hi> To which he added, that <hi>inasmuch as he disclosed not the things he knew, he confessed himself justly condemned,</hi> &amp;c. From which it appears, that either he thought it was lawful up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good Reasons to divulge what he heard in Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or else what was discovered to him was not in Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:95553:33"/>
(3.) But this was so far from being discovered to the Jesuits in Confession, that it was by them that the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the scrupulous were satisfied: As that of <hi>Catesby</hi> by <hi>Garnet</hi>; that of <hi>Bates</hi> by <hi>Greenwell</hi>; that of <hi>Littleton</hi> by <hi>Hall</hi>; and all of them at <hi>Holbeach,</hi> as far as Absolution for the Fact could do it, by <hi>Hammond.</hi> That <hi>Catesby</hi> was herein guided by the resolution and opinion of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>; both the Case he put to him, and the satisfaction that he (upon the Provincial's answer to him) gave to the rest, of the lawfulness of it, will sufficiently prove. The <hi>Catholick Apology</hi> doth say,<note place="margin">Cath. Apol. p. 422.</note> that <hi>nothing is more false than that</hi> Garnet <hi>should determine that the Innocent and Guilty might lawfully in this Plot be destroyed together, if it were for the greater good</hi>; and takes it upon the word of Father <hi>More</hi> and the other Apologists, that <hi>Catesby pretending to go a Souldier into the Low-Countries, did propose</hi> only <hi>what might be done in a just War, when in blowing up a Mine the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent would suffer as well as the Nocent?</hi> It is well he shifts it off to them, since this Person of Honour knows better, and cannot but be sensible that the Records of a Nation, and the proceedings of a Court of Justice in <hi>England,</hi> are much more to be heeded than a company of partial Apologists.</p>
               <p>But as it is plainly affirm'd all along in the <hi>Proceedings</hi>; so it is otherwise very evident, that this Case was not put by <hi>Catesby</hi> to <hi>Garnet,</hi> nor understood by <hi>Garnet</hi> himself, with respect to any War, or Employment, that <hi>Catesby</hi> pretended to have in it, in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> For (1.) if it had been so, <hi>Garnet</hi> would most certainly have pleaded after that manner, and not as he did; <hi>I thought,</hi> said <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, it had been an idle question,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 188.</note> 
                  <hi>though afterwards I did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily think, he intended something that was not good</hi>; Here is not a word of a War, or of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> or of his going thither. Nay, <hi>Garnet</hi> saith expresly, <hi>only Mr.</hi> Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95553:33"/>
                  <hi>asked him in general the question.</hi> But (2.) if this had been the case, and that it was so propounded by <hi>Catesby,</hi> as they would have it, yet what needed so great a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that he should come to <hi>Garnet</hi> by way of secret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession? Since the Case, as they now dress it up, is what might be put in any place or company.<note place="margin">Tort. Torti, p. 282.</note> (3.) If the Case was such what needed <hi>Catesby</hi> to be so solicitous in it; and after the first resolution of it by <hi>Garnet</hi> to come again upon the same business?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antilog.</hi> p. 137. b.</note> (4.) Especially considering that <hi>Garnet</hi> knew very well, if <hi>Catesby</hi> had put it after that manner,<note place="margin">Proceed. p. 170.</note> that he was not in earnest; for there was another reason for his pretence of obtaining a Regiment, and going to <hi>Flanders,</hi> as hath been before observed. (5.) Its a sign that the Case was not so put by <hi>Catesby</hi>; since it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by <hi>Garnet,</hi> that <hi>he did verily think,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eudaem. Apol</hi> p. 284.</note> 
                  <hi>that he in that queston intended something that was not good.</hi> Now how could he well discern so much from thence, if <hi>Catesby</hi> had pretended only scruple of Conscience about what he might lawfully do, now he was going to serve in the Wars. The question if put after that manner hath in it nothing but what is fair, and gives no reason to suspect any thing that is not good; and therefore its likely, to avoid the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that might be made against this way of framing the Case, it is that <hi>More</hi> adds, that Garnet <hi>discovered that</hi> Catesby <hi>had some great Design by frequent converse with him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mori Hist. p. 325.</note> And that indeed is also true, and it is as true that the Case was never so put under the disguise of a War. For lastly, <hi>Garnet</hi> himself doth acknowledg,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Casaub.

                     <hi>Tort. Torti.</hi> p. 282.</note> or <hi>that he should abuse his friend that trusted him above all the rest,</hi> from the knowledg and experience he had of him. It's

certain that when <hi>Rookwood</hi> made it a matter of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to take away so much blood,<note place="margin">Proceed. p. 105.</note> 
                  <hi>Catesby</hi> replied, that <hi>he was resolved and that by good Authority (as coming from the Superior of the Jesuits) that in Conscience it might be done, yea though it were with the destruction of many Innocents,</hi>

                  <hi>it was caused by certain belief that those which were best able to judge of the lawfulness of it, had been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, and given way unto it.</hi> And of this we have a clear proof from him.<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 168.</note> For whereas there was a Breve ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Pope by <hi>Garnet,</hi> for quieting some broils amongst the Papists in <hi>Wales,</hi> in <hi>May.</hi> 1605.

               <p>So <hi>Gerard</hi> did absolve and give the Sacrament to the five first of the Conspirators. The Author of the <hi>Catholick Apology</hi>

But in confutation of this, we have the Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Faux</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter,</hi> the only survivers of the five that did thus receive the Sacrament of <hi>Gerard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antilog.</hi> p. 159. b</note> and were absolved by him: whom though they did deny at the first to name, yet did afterward accuse him of it; and that he was thus charged by some, Sir <hi>Everard</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Paper 5.</note> he was told. As for his Appeal to Sir <hi>Everard,</hi> he knew that he might do it with safety and confidence, since that Gentleman had again and again satisfied them, that he would not confess his knowledg of any Priest,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> nor of Him above any. And if he could work thus upon another person to protest and deny, even to the death, it may well be supposed that he himself was not without those princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95553:35"/>
which be had furnished another with; nor would be wanting in the use of them, when his own life and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the honour of his Religion was concerned to have it remain a Secret. And this also is no new thing; for we find <hi>Fitz-Herbert</hi> taking the same course for his own vindication,<note place="margin">Antilog. p. 123. a.</note> in a charge of the like Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hammond</hi> the Jesuit is another, whom we find concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this capacity, who did absolve the Conspirators at the house of <hi>Rob. Winter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings P. 123.</note> when they were in actual Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: And for which the Apologist hath nothing else to say, but <hi>who can tell whether</hi> Hammond <hi>did not oblige them to lay down their Arms before he did absolve them; or whether they did not bring such Arguments for continuing in them, as might render it probable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eudaem. Apol. p. 273. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>and then he was bound to absolve them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to the former, it is certainly otherwise; for they not only continued in the same posture of Rebellion after absolution, which they were in before; But also <hi>Hammond</hi> advised <hi>Henry Morgan</hi> to <hi>defend the Cause to the utmost</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he absolved him.<note place="margin">Antilog. p. 154. b</note> Which is further confirmed by what <hi>Stephen Littleton</hi> did say; who when asked whether he was absolv'd for the Fact, or had his Conscience satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by any about it,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 155.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> at that time; answered, <hi>that he would rather dye than reveal the secrets of that matter.</hi> Which doth imply that he had bin thus absolved, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
               <p>As to the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of a probable opinion,</hi> it serves rather to condemn than excuse them; for if the opinion of a Doctor, or their own (and the good of the Cause shall serve to procure both) may make an Opinion probable, then <hi>Jac. Clemen<hi rend="sup">s</hi>,</hi> and <hi>Ravilliac,</hi> and all the Regicides in the World, may be defended, and defend themselves. But yet, even this will not salve the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95553:35"/>
of <hi>Hammond</hi>; for <hi>Rookwood</hi> believed his conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Treason to be a Sin, and confessed it so to him: but he absolved him from all his Sins notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without taking notice of this particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rookwood</hi> thought it to be unlawful, and yet <hi>Hammond</hi> absolved him, as if he never had so thought.</p>
               <p>Another of the Jesuits is <hi>Hall,</hi> or <hi>Oldcorn,</hi> who was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to it, and did satisfie <hi>Humphry Littleton,</hi> that did begin to suspect the lawfulness of the Plot, and to think God was not pleased with it from the disaster <hi>Catesby,</hi> &amp;c. met with;<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 172.</note> But <hi>Hall</hi> told him that <hi>we must not judg the cause by the event,</hi> and gave him several instances to confirm it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antilog. p.</hi> 150. b</note> This <hi>Humphry Littelton</hi> did confess. But saith the Apologist, he did at his <hi>Execution beg pardon of</hi> Hall <hi>for it.</hi>

                     <hi>Eudaem. Apol</hi> p. 270.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But if he did, he must ask his pardon for what was true; for <hi>Hall</hi> himself in the substance of it did confess what <hi>Littelton</hi> accused him of. But how could that be,<note place="margin">Antilog. p. 150. b</note> that he should beg pardon of him at the place of execution; when, though they suffered the same day at <hi>Worcester,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 151. b.</note> yet not at the same time, and <hi>Littelton</hi> was dead before <hi>Hall</hi> came thither.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Jesuits did not only satisfie the Consciences of others and absolve them; but also were parties in the Treason themselves. I shall not here insist upon what <hi>Smith,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> said of <hi>Gerard,</hi> that he <hi>boasted that he had largely sweat with working in the Mine</hi>; because I find it not upon Record. But there are several things laid to their charge that will sufficiently prove, that they were actually concerned in it. As,<note place="margin">Antilog. p. 160. a</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) We find that at the first beginning they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at their most private Consultations;<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 113.</note> and so intimate in that juncture was <hi>Gerard</hi> with <hi>Catesby,</hi> that he lodged with him in <hi>Percy's</hi> house, as <hi>Faux</hi> confessed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:95553:36"/>
(2) We find that some of them administred the Oath of Secrecy to the Conspirators;<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 113.</note> So <hi>Gerard</hi> to <hi>Catesby,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Greenwel</hi> to <hi>Bates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) They were also busie in buying up store of Horses and Arms; and <hi>Gerard</hi> was more particularly imployed herein,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 124.</note> as he had skill, and pretended to teach the riding of the great Horse.<note place="margin">Antilog. p. 160. b</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) That they had frequent consultations about it;<note place="margin">Proceed. p. 167 &amp; 169.</note> as <hi>Garnet</hi> with <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Tresham</hi> about the strength of the Catholicks: <hi>Greenwel</hi> with <hi>Garnet</hi> about a Protector. And <hi>Garnet,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 125.</note> Gerard</hi> and <hi>Greenwel</hi> with Sir <hi>Everard Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antilog.</hi> p. 160. a</note> &amp;c. for they seem to be the <hi>Three</hi> whom Sir <hi>Everard</hi> is so careful to conceal; and whom he therefore is so careful to conceal,<note place="margin">Pap. 5. Compared with pap. 3.</note> because of some particular charge that might be brought against them, for what was said or done when together with him; as may be collected from his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) When the Conspirators were in Arms, <hi>Greenwel</hi> came to them from <hi>Garnet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proceedings.</hi> p. 216, 218.</note> and so had <hi>Garnet</hi> come like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but for fear his order might irreparably suffer by his appearance. <hi>Greenwel</hi> went from them to raise a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and make an Insurrection. And <hi>Hammond</hi> continued with them.</p>
               <p>Now if to satisfie the scrupulous and absolve the guilty, and to oblige to Secrecy; if Consulting, Advising, Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and accompanying with the Traitors will bring the Priests into the number; then they will be guilty. And its not all their own Declarations, or Apologies writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by others on their behalf, will make them innocent, as long as such a Charge remains upon Record against them.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder then,<note place="margin">Casaub. ad Ducaeum. Proceedings p. 173.</note> that <hi>Garnet</hi> after all his confidence, should profess that he <hi>would give all the world to clear his Innocency</hi>; and that he that hoped at the first to <hi>escape for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95553:36"/>
Want of proof</hi>; should have nothing to say for himself,<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 196, &amp; 174.</note> when he was overwhelmed, as he said, with <hi>so great a Cloud of Witnesses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which evidence, as he did at last confess, what they could from other proof charge upon him; so from his own confession given under his hand, he was, when he would have stray'd from the path of Truth at his death, forced into it again by the admonition of the Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then present. For a little to palliate his case and clear himself, he said, that <hi>what he knew in particulars was in Confession,</hi> which was contrary to what he before had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in four points; as the Recorder then shewed;<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 225.</note> and how he could thus equivocate or worse, and yet <hi>behave himself like a faithful Servant of Jesus Christ at his death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 420.</note> as the Author of the <hi>Catholick Apology saith,</hi> all mankind, but themselves, cannot, I believe, understand.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV. This Conspiracy was purely upon the account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</head>
               <p>AS our Adversaries before have done what they could to cast off the <hi>odium</hi> of this Conspiracy from the Party in general, and from the Jesuits in particular, by making a few Gentlemen only and their dependents concerned in it: So they use as much Art to clear their Religion from the guilt of it; being sensible that if this be found faulty, the others are not to be defended, but the whole Party must fall under censure. Therefore they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might and main to acquit themselves well herein, and tell us that as these persons were few in number,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95553:37"/>
so they did proceed upon discontent, and not upon the score of Religion.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they plead,<note place="margin">Proceed. p. 127. Eudaem. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. p. 233. Ibid. p. 290.</note> the King did before his coming into <hi>England</hi> give them good hopes of the exercise of their Religion, which when deceived in, they were exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated. Sometimes their Persecutions were so great, <hi>that they almost hated life it self for their sake.</hi> Or as the Author of the <hi>Catholick Apology</hi> words it;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cath. Apol.</hi> p. 416.</note> 
                  <hi>That which drove these Gentlemen into this wickedness, was the want of Christian patience, or a despair of any ease by this King from Queen</hi> Elizabeth's <hi>cruel and horrid Laws,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now supposing (1.) that thus it was, that the King had before promised favour to them, and instead of that had permitted <hi>the horrid and cruel Laws,</hi> as he calls them, to have their course; is this sufficient to excuse their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Design, or to prove that Religion was not concerned in it? Was it upon any other account (if we grant this) than Religion, when they hoped for Toleration; and was it not Religion that put them upon Rebellion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had not that Toleration?</p>
               <p>But (2.) indeed there was no such reason for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy; for they had no such assurances from the King. Such a report was spread abroad by themselves, as <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> doth acknowledge;<note place="margin">Antilog. p. 137. b</note> but with what truth will appear not only from <hi>Watson's</hi> Confession, who two days before his death protested upon his Soul to the Earl of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that <hi>he could never draw the smallest comfort from him in those degrees</hi>;<note place="margin">Proceedings p. 137.</note> but also from <hi>Watson's</hi> Treason, who would never have attempted that, if he had been satisfied of the King's good intentions towards those of his Religion. It is not unlikely but that the King, who after his coming in did receive them freely and favourably, might before treat them after the same manner; but how far it was from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95553:37"/>
any promise, <hi>Watson</hi> further declares,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>I could never draw more from the King,</hi> saith he, <hi>than that he would have the Catholicks apprehend, that as he was a stranger to this state, so till he under stood in all points how those matters stood, he would not promise favour any way</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how far the King was from affording them any such favours, as they pretend, is further declared in a <hi>Memorandum</hi> in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi>; For some of the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans having spread a rumour, that the King intended to grant a Toleration to Papists, the Lords severally decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how the King was discontented with the said false rumour, and had made but the day before a Protestation to them, <hi>that he never intended it,</hi>

But (3.) There could be no such reason for this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy; for they had laid the foundation of it, and were carrying it on before the King was settled in his Throne.

                     <hi>Tortur. Torti. p.</hi> 83.</note> and the Powder Treason it self was formed in the first year of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign.</p>
               <p>We see then they had no such provocation given them as is pretended, and that if they had, it doth not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that they engaged upon this Design not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion. But if we should grant that they had such a provocation, and that the provocation and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not go together in it: Yet we have other reasons to shew, that it was upon a religious account that this was undertaken, and that I shall make evident,

                  <hi>what a large liberty is by this Doctrine left to Church-men, to hatch or foster any treasonable attempts against Princes, I leave it to your</hi> [speaking to Monarchs, &amp;c.] <hi>consideration, since do what they will, they are accountable to none of us: nay all their treasonable practices must be works of Piety, and they being justly punished for the same, must be

               <p>If this be their practice, that Traitors are thus excused and protected; and the Principles upon which they acted not recalled or censured; We have little reason to think the World secured against practices of the like kind, when time shall serve and the necessity of things, in their estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so requires.

Now because of the relation which, this way that they have taken, hath to the Design that I have pursued in this Treatise; I shall add somewhat by way of answer to it, and in doing so,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I shall consider the case as laid down by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I shall shew that there is not so much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Plot and Plot, betwixt the Criminals then and Conspirators now, as there is an agreement; which I shall do by my making a parallel betwixt the one and the other.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:95553:41"/>
3. I shall shew the ground of that difference which is betwixt them; and how that what hath been said in their way of comparison, to invalidate the discovery made of the present Plot, serves little to the purpose it was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for.</p>
               <p>There are four things,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>New Plot.</hi> Ibid.</note> which the foresaid Author doth collect from the History of the Powder Treason.<list>
                     <item n="1">1. There was then visible the overt act of Barrels of Powder laid in the place.</item>
                     <item n="2">2. There was a flight of some of the Conspirators, and their resistance at their taking.</item>
                     <item n="3">3. Those that were Executed, did all confess the fact at the time of Execution.</item>
                     <item n="4">4. All persons indifferently, both Papists and Protestants, Forreigners and Natives believed the thing, &amp;c.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And from this he doth proceed to shew, that <hi>all things in the present Conspiracy run counter to every particular in that.</hi> When he begins to discourse upon the first, he saith, <hi>This hainous Plot is built upon the bare testimony of the Swearers,</hi> and that <hi>there is not any matter of Fact visible and apparent, that has any proper tendency, or relation to a Conspiracy for destroying the King, and levying of War.</hi> Indeed he cannot deny, but that there are two things, which if they could be proved to be done by them, as well as it is manifest that such things were, would be just matter of accusation; and they are the death of Sir <hi>Edmonbury Godfry,</hi> and the <hi>Consult</hi>: but he can put off these (he thinks) with a wet finger; and if this be done, leaves all the world to challenge them further with any thing of that nature. <hi>Let not the death of Sir</hi> Edmond <hi>be urged,</hi> saith he, <hi>as matter of Fact, because the unfortunate end of that Gentleman, as to the true manner of it, is a Mystery yet unreveal'd, and is laid at the Papists door, just as Antichrist is charged upon the Pope.</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:95553:42"/>
But is the death of that Gentleman so easily to be put up? Or is it indeed <hi>a mystery yet unrevealed?</hi> Was it not plainly made out that this Gentleman was murdered, and that he could not both strangle and thrust himself through? And was it not so revealed that <hi>Bedlow,</hi> that was to have been one of the Assasinates, and did see his body when dead, did of his own accord confess it? and <hi>Prance</hi> that had an hand in his death did upon his apprehension also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it? And was it not so reveal'd that some fled for it, and others that were taken, after an open Trial accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to course at Law, were Executed for it? And shall it be still <hi>a Mystery unrevealed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But saith he, <hi>there are few unbiassed and discerning men, that are convinced, that these poor Creatures, that suffered upon that account, were truly guilty.</hi> What in the mean while doth he make of the Judges and the Jury, were they neither <hi>unbiassed nor discerning?</hi> or shall they be neither, who do believe them to have been guilty upon the same Evidence which the Court was then satisfied with? But what should hinder <hi>unbiassed and discerning</hi> men from being <hi>convinced?</hi> was there reason to think the matter of the Evidence not to be sufficient, or the Persons giving it not to be of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Credit? Let us consider the case, and that will best inform us. The persons were such as were either actually engaged, or invited so to be; that either helped to do it, or did see it when done: Both, though not known to one another, concurring, as far as they were concerned, in the same circumstances, as to the Person murdered, the posture of his Body, the place where it was, and the way in which it was to be disposed of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as they did not vary from one another, so not from themselves, in above one point, that the Adversaries (as I remember) can after all their diligent search find them out in, (if that be true
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95553:42"/>
too) and all this fortified by several Collateral and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring Testimonies. Whilst in the mean time, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners were manifestly convinced of the contrary; saying and unsaying, affirming and denying the same things: Sometimes <hi>Berry</hi> did know <hi>Prance</hi> as he passed up and down the house only; at another time he knew him so,<note place="margin">Tryals of <hi>Green,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 24. p. 49.</note> as often to drink with him. Sometimes he never had such an order, as he had the 13<hi>th</hi> and 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> to suffer no Strangers, nor any Persons of Quality to come into <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset-House</hi>; at another time he had received such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before. Sometimes <hi>Hill</hi> knew not <hi>Kelly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 41. &amp; 48, Compared.</note> at another time he owned that he knew him, (for 'tis <hi>Kelly</hi> and not <hi>Girald</hi> that he speaks of more expresly,<note place="margin">

But however <hi>he is not rationally to be believed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">New Plot.</note> saith the Author, <hi>until he shall in the same circumstance of dying, declare their guilt, in which they so solemnly declared their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.</hi> By which way of arguing no man can ever dy with a Lye in his mouth; nor is any person or company

of men to be believed, in whatever they affirm against such an one, or upon what grounds soever they affirm it, unless they are, or till they come to be in the same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances with him, that did thus deny it; which is very absurd to say.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prances's</hi> Narrative. p. 24, 25.</note> But to put it so far out of question, we are not without this kind of evidence also; for <hi>Prance</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when his Life was despair'd of, continued to affirm the truth of whatever he at first deposed, and as soon as he was recovered, did own it afresh before the King and Council.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And lastly, here is the affirmation of such Persons, who had no Principles of Religion to lead them thus to affirm, against them, whose Principles did encourage them thus to deny.

to gain credit and belief; when we have no such thing as a Dispensation before-hand or Absolution after it, without detestation, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> to befriend us. Now whether <hi>Berry</hi> did declare himself a Protestant, and deny the Fact upon their Principles; or whether he did deny the Fact upon no Principles, is one in effect as to the present case: But that he did deny what he knew to be true, besides the Evidence otherwise against him, we have no little reason to think from his silence at his death,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>when he said not any thing, either in asserting his innocence as to the murder of Sir</hi> Edmund, <hi>neither as to the Religion he died in</hi>; As one that was present, and not a little concerned to observe, doth affirm. It looks very odd that he should profess so much remorse for his dissimulation in his Religion, and so much innocency in the point he was condemned for; and yet at his Execution, should not clear himself, but pass by both as if he had not bin concerned. This is so irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable either to his sincerity in the one, or innocency in the other, that it was foreseen; and therefore as a Speech was prepared for <hi>Hill,</hi> before his death, so another is made for <hi>Berry</hi> after it. <hi>He then declared himself both innocent and a Protestant,</hi> saith one:<note place="margin">New Plot. Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>He absolutely denied at the very Gallows, the Fact: Nay, as the Cart was drawing away,<note place="margin">Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. p. 20.</note> he lifted up his hands, and said, as I am innocent, so receive my Soul, O Jesus</hi>; as another telleth us. And yet he spoke not one word to either. Now what reason have we to believe his silence beyond others protestations at their death? and yet some Mens Protestations of that kind are no more to be believed by this Author, (as that of the Lord <hi>Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven's,</hi> which he mentions) than we believe those of <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Green.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So far then we are not without Reason to convince us, that these persons were some of Sir <hi>Edmund's true
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95553:44"/>
Murderers.</hi> But then if we shall add to this, the strange circumstances of <hi>Prance's</hi> apprehension, and the description <hi>Bedlow</hi> gave of such a person before it. If we consider what Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> himself did foretell about his being the <hi>first Martyr</hi>;<note place="margin">Tryal of <hi>Whitebread, &amp;c.</hi> p. 26.</note> and the notice that <hi>Dugdale</hi> gave of his death, two days before it was known at <hi>London</hi> what became of him, and many other circumstances which might easily be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; We have good marks to find out the Murtherers by, and <hi>the door, at which his death is to be laid.</hi>

               <p>The second thing owned by the abovesaid Author for <hi>an overt Act,</hi> is the Consult in <hi>April</hi> 24 (not the 14th as he mistakes) But that he would have to be only a <hi>Triennial meeting</hi> in course.

But what hath been said already is sufficient to shew, how little truth there is in what the abovesaid Author doth fantastically affirm,<note place="margin">New-Plot. p. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that the charge of the Plot <hi>is only supported by the breath of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses coined into Oaths.</hi>

2. He saith that in the Powder-Treason <hi>there was the flight of some of the Conspirators, and the resistance at their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But <hi>not one Person in this pretended Conspiracy did either fly, or abscond (except only the Priests, who were obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Law for their Priesthood) nay the greatest part of them, upon the first rumour of their accusation, came in and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I deny, (1) that its an undoubted mark of a person's Innocency, that he did not fly when a Treason was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and he had an opportunity of making his escape. For the case may be, that he may not be charged with it, and then if he flys he brings it upon himself. So <hi>Tresham</hi> in the Powder-Treason <hi>still continued about the Court,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. p. 74.</note> 
                  <hi>that he might thereby seem wholly free and innocent</hi>; as an Author above quoted observes. (2.) He may stay and yet be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, upon a presumption that the Charge may not be made good, and he may escape <hi>for want of proof,</hi> as <hi>Garnet</hi> hoped. (3.) He may stay and yet be guilty, as presuming, that though the Charge be made good; yet he hath persons of power and interest great enough to interpose betwixt him and danger. And therefore rather than be declared guilty by flight, or betray and discredit his Cause, or distrust his Friends, he may choose to stay, though he be no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent than those that fly.</p>
               <p>But after all, is <hi>it not possible that not one should be found, whose guilt, or fear did prevail upon him to fly and secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> &amp;c. as he saith it is not? He grants the Priests did fly; but <hi>it was because they were obnoxious to the Law for their Priesthood.</hi> If that was the reason, then there had been no Priest but what would have fled; those that were not charged with this Treason, as well as those that were: for, setting aside this new charge, all as Priests are alike obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and yet we find all did not alike fly.</p>

                  <hi>those that were executed for the Powder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, did all confess the Fact at the time of Execution</hi>:<note place="margin">Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. p. 75.</note> 
                  <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as those that have been executed for this Plot have at their Deaths denied the Fact, and resisted all temptations of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Reward,</hi> &amp;c. That the Traytors in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Treason did confess the Fact, we readily own; if they mean thereby the Treason, as it was at first hatched: But that they did thus confess, and not persist in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of their Innocency to the Death, was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>their Consciences would not dispense with it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Compend. p. 73.</note> 
                  <hi>or their Religion not permit them to be obstinate and for swear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> (as a late Author of theirs would have us believe) but for other reasons; as I have shewed at large before<note n="*" place="margin">V.

For I question, not but that as <hi>Faux</hi> did <hi>lay the blame at first wholly upon himself:</hi> so he would have sworn to it also, if it had not been the Torture that he stood more in awe of, than his Conscience. It was upon this score and not his Religion, as the Author of the <hi>Compendium</hi> doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that <hi>the Lords laught at his Huffing and Bravadoes,</hi> since otherwise they would rather have put him to his Oath,<note place="margin">Compend. p. 73.</note> than to the Rack, to have extorted a Confession from him; and therefore to make use of his case amongst others,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95553:45"/>
as the abovesaid Author doth, to oppose to the case of the Persons that were lately executed, and that denied the Fact at their Execution, is nothing to the purpose. Before Their case then will be of use to the vindication of These, now, they must prove that the whole Plot was at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by the Conspirators, that they never denied any thing which they were upon Oath charged with, and that they had no Principles to warrant them if they did. But the contrary to these is manifest, as hath been already shewed, and so can do them little service.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> pag. 35. &amp;c.</note> Without doubt had the Traytors then had as much Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the whole, as they did the greatest part of it, and could as well have kept to themselves what they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, as well as what they did not, we had been little the wiser. They then were of the same Religion, &amp; acted upon the same Principles as the others now; and therefore that they then did confess, and these did not, was because their Circumstances were different, and not because They were guilty, and These were innocent. For if the other had been in these Mens condition, I do not doubt but they would as obstinately have denied; and if These had been in their condition, I as little doubt but that they would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed according as they did then. The others denied, as long as Denial would do them good, and till they saw it could not be denied, having clear proof against them: And these did deny and obstinately persist so to do, for want of other proof than the Oaths of others; and so their denial being opposed to the others affirming, their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing it to the other Oaths, their dying words to the others that were to live, they did not question but the World would believe they had Truth on their side. And when the Principles and Honour of their Religion, their own Credit, and safety of their Friends, and the fear
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95553:46"/>
of Damnation to boot (which often prevails with Men more then the hopes of a present Reward) do engage them; it's not impossible that they should deny, and dye in the denial of what is true.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The abovesaid Author adds, that <hi>all persons indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, both Papists and Protestants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>believed the thing</hi> [the Powder-Treason] <hi>and no soul living did deny it.</hi> Deny it; how could they, since there was Powder, and Match discovered, and <hi>Faux</hi> was apprehended upon the Place? Deny it how could they, since some of the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were actually killed, or taken in an Insurrection; and those that were taken did confess it more or less? But what the Conspirators would have done themselves, and what others also of the same perswasion would have said, if there had been nothing, but the Oaths of Witnesses against them, we must go to their Principles and Practice to conjecture. But though they could not deny the matter of Fact, yet they have done what they could towards it; For some tell us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Compend.</hi> p. 74.</note> as hath been shewed, that <hi>Cecil (to ruin the Party) drew those fiery men in by his subtile tricks and artifice.</hi> Others,<note place="margin">Advocate of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence p. 226.</note> that <hi>this desperate Attempt seemed rather of a private kindred or acquaintance, than of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Nay they have the Confidence to say, <hi>That the true Priests and Catholicks of</hi> England <hi>knew them</hi> [the Traytors] <hi>not to be Papists</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they were never Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenters of Catholick Sacraments with any Priest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. &amp; A Plea for <hi>Engl.</hi> Priests printed 1621. p. 55, &amp; 58.</note> &amp;c. If men will dare to say these things, when their own Writings are against them, and when we read there of the great endearedness 'twixt <hi>Catesby</hi>'s family and the Jesuits, 'twixt <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Garnet, twixt</hi> Sir <hi>Everard</hi> and <hi>Gerard,</hi> &amp;c. they may as well deny the whole, and we may thereby know what they would do if they had not matter of Fact, and <hi>overt Acts</hi> too visibly and apparently in their way. If
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95553:46"/>
they will say things so notoriously and evidently false,<note place="margin">New-Plot. p. 12.</note> what may we not expect when a Plot is made out <hi>purely by the dint of swearing?</hi> (as one doth phrase it): Though in our present case there is <hi>more then the Credulity of people to corroborate</hi> that Testimony, notwithstanding whatever he is there pleased to say.</p>
               <p>From what hath been said, we may see how little foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation there is for the opposing the Plot of the Powder-Treason to the late one amongst our selves; and how little the Proceedings and Confessions of the Conspirators in the former, will serve to clear the Innocency of those that suffered in the later.</p>
               <p>But because they have thus opposed the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I shall on the otherside, before I conclude, consider how they do agree; and that we may observe,
<list>
                     <item>1. As the Plots were in prosecution, &amp; before discovery.</item>
                     <item>2. In the way by which they were discovered.</item>
                     <item>3. In the event, and what happened upon and after Discovery.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In the first of these, I have the way in part traced out by Sir <hi>Samuel Baldwyn, one of his Majesties Serjeants at Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tryals of</hi> Ireland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 12.</note> in Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Trial, who doth there mention two or three Particulars, in which this Plot doth resemble that of the <hi>Powder-Treason.</hi> And that it doth, in the matter of it, the principal Agents concerned in it, the Principles which they proceeded upon, and the way in which it was managed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) There is an agreement in the matter, so saith that worthy person, <hi>that horrid Design</hi> [of the Powder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son] <hi>was to take away the life of the then King, to subvert the Government, to introduce the Popish Religion, and to destroy the established Protestant Religion in</hi> England; <hi>and so we think our proofs will make it out, that in each of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95553:47"/>
this Design is the same that that was.</hi> Thus far he. That it was so in that former Plot is universally acknowledged; and that it was so here is what the Evidence doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in. How far it was to introduce the Popish Religion, Mr <hi>Colemans</hi> Letter doth shew,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coleman's</hi> 2<hi>d</hi> Letter in his Tryal. p. 69.</note> who saith, <hi>we have here a mighty work upon our hands, no less than the Conversion of three Kingdoms, and by that means the utter subduing of a pestilent Heresie which has domineer'd over a great part of this Northern World a long time; there was never such hopes of success since the death of our Queen Mary, as now in our days.</hi> And how all this could be done without subverting the Government, or how both the one and the other could be done without taking away the Life of his Majesty, is not easie to be understood.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) There is an agreement in the principal Agents concerned in it. <hi>The great Actors in the Powder Treason,</hi> saith Sir Samuel, <hi>were Priests and Jesuits,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and so are they in this. That chiefly guided and managed by</hi> Henry Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, <hi>Provincial of the Jesuits in</hi> England; <hi>and the great Actor in this design is Mr.</hi> Whitebread, <hi>Provincial of the same Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) There is an agreement in the Principles which they proceeded upon. As first in General, <hi>that any thing is lawful which may serve the Cause,</hi> and in particular that <hi>an Heretick Prince may be deposed and killed; That an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick People may be destroyed; and that a Forreign Force, to serve those ends, may be invited over, and introduced.</hi> That these were the Principles which they in the Powder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son went upon, is evident from the History it self, and what hath been said before <note n="*" place="margin">p. 25, 46, 48, 56, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>: and they were the same considerations which gave birth and encouragement to the present Design,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stayley's</hi> Tryal p. 5.</note> as we may see throughout the Trials. This was the ground of <hi>Staley's</hi> displeasure against the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95553:47"/>
King, <hi>that he was an Heretick</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fitz Geralds Nar.</hi> p. 7.</note> this was the ground of the other practices against him not only here, but also in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And <hi>the subduing the pestilent Heresie which domineer'd here,</hi> was the great reason of Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> correspondence with the French King's Confessor, and of soliciting <hi>Aid and Assistance</hi> from thence.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) There is an agreement in the management of both' (1.) In point of secresy, obliging one another by Oaths and the Sacrament. I have shewed that so it was in the Powder-Treason. <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="5">(5.) They agree in the State they were in, and the little provocation that was given them to begin and form such a Design. So it was in the Powder-Treason, when they <hi>had not so much as a pretended cause of grief,</hi> as K. <hi>James</hi> in his Speech said, but were obliged by him, as I have shewed <note n="†" place="margin">Trials of <hi>Whitebread,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 10, 11.</note>. And so it had been here: For whereas by the Statute of 25 <hi>Eliz. the Priests might be tried as such, and ought to die for it, yet they at this time have been so mercifully dealt with, as they have been suffered to live amongst us under the danger of the Statute,</hi> as Sir <hi>Creswel Levins</hi> observed: and the Laity hath been little disturbed by the enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Laws made against them.<note place="margin">

               <p n="6">(6.) There is an agreement in the Prophecies (as they would have them accounted) of the great Change that would happen in a short time. So it was before the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Treason,</hi> as I have shewed <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 16, &amp; 25.</note>. And so it was now;

what Cardinal <hi>Barbarin</hi> should say of this nature, hath bin deposed before the Lord's,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Smith's</hi> Narrative p. 27.</note> and Reports of the same kind have been very common at home and abroad, as hundreds can testifie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there was an agreement in the state of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was discovered; so there is no little resemblance in the way by which they were discovered. For, was there a Letter writ? so were here Papers found of <hi>Coleman</hi>'s, and <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s. Did there some confess then? so some did here. Did some of them fly and abscond for it then? so they have done here also; as I have shewed before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is great resemblance in the Event, and what happened and was done upon and after the discovery. As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) More was left undiscovered than was discovered. What kind of help the design of the Powder-Treason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in it self, and what Intelligence the State had then of Forces, Arms, Horses and Moneys, I have before shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note n="*" place="margin">p. 20, &amp;c.</note>. And yet little of any of these was found out; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as an Apologist of theirs doth venture to plead, as to one Branch,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eudaemon</hi> Apol. p. 278.</note> 
                  <hi>Where was that great sum of Money, talk'd of, found?</hi> or, <hi>how much of it was confiscated and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings Exchequer?</hi> And so it happened now; for tho the Design could not be carried on without, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation accordingly hath been given of Provisions made in that kind; yet what from the pretences those Forces and Moneys were raised under (as we have the Account<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Fitz. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi>'s infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. p. 11. <hi>Smith's</hi> Narrat. p. 30. Compend. p. 85.</note>) what from the distribution of Arms into several hands, without keeping Stores and Magazines; what from the timely notice they had to dispose of them; not so much hath been discovered, but that also an Advocate of theirs, doth plead after the like manner as before, <hi>There has not been found any ill Letter, any Commission, any Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, any Mony, any Arms, any Horses, or any thing else suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:95553:48"/>
With how much tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> this is said in all respects, <hi>Coleman's</hi> Letters, and Arm in some quantities taken, and other particulars, do prove. But yet it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that though much is proved against them, yet more is still undiscovered than discovered.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) There is a great resemblance in the ways taken to fling off what hath been discovered, and to conceal what hath not. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By charging it upon others. Thus we find them practising in the business of the Powder-Treason. If it had succeeded, the whole was to have been laid to the charge of the Puritans; and when it did not succeed, they tell us it was <hi>the trick of a Minister of State,</hi> and that <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators were not Papists,</hi> as hath been before declared. And that same method hath been observed now. For if the present Design had taken, and the King had been kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bedlow's</hi> last Examinat. p. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>they had settled some, whom they should pitch the Action upon,</hi> and intended <hi>to lay it upon the Presbyterians,</hi> as hath been deposed. But since its now broke forth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dugdale's</hi> Informat. p. 5.</note> and hath not hitherto succeeded, they have taken care to charge as much of it as they can otherwhere. First, There is a <hi>sham-Plot</hi> started, and a Design laid to make the Presbyterians,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's</hi> Nar.</note> or whomsoever they pleased so to call, to be the only Conspirators. And because the death of Sir <hi>Edmund-bury,</hi> if found upon them, would lend us a great light toward the revealing the Plot,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dugdale's</hi> Informat. p. 8.</note> and be no little inducement to mankind to believe it, they had thoughts of charging it <hi>upon debauched persons, of whom he was a prosecutor.</hi> When that was not likely to take, they did endeavour to make the <hi>Earl of Danby</hi> the Contriver of it.<note place="margin">Reflections on the E. of <hi>Danby.</hi>
                  </note> And because that was soon disproved, then, its said, that his own Party did murder him, and laid it upon the Papists to make them odious.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:95553:49"/>
2. There is the like method taken to avoid the Charge, <hi>by calumniating of Authority.</hi> So they did in the Powder-Treason: Then the Judges were <hi>Lyars</hi>; the Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors <hi>cruel,</hi> for ordering <hi>Garnet,</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> &amp;c. to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured; (as they published, but publish'd falsly to the World, as hath been shewed before <note n="*" place="margin">Hist. p. 26. Vindicat. p. 13. &amp; 36. <hi>Eudaem.</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel <hi>Torti,</hi> &amp;c. p. 261. Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. p. 16. &amp; 67.</note>.) And the publick Writings, and what was justified to be true by Authority, were said to be <hi>forged.</hi> In like manner have they now proceeded, for they tell us that those that suffered by the Sentence of the Court <hi>were innocent in the judgment of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biassed and discerning men.</hi> That <hi>Prance</hi> was <hi>threatned by the Lords that went to examine him,</hi> and was <hi>tortured</hi> to make him accuse others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To avoid or weaken the Charge,<note place="margin">Malice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. p. 3.</note> false reports are raised upon those that amongst themselves do confess. So in the Powder-Treason we are told that <hi>Bates</hi> and <hi>Littleton recanted,</hi> and that what ever <hi>Bates</hi> accused the rest of was <hi>through the hopes of life,</hi> as hath been shewed before. <note n="*" place="margin">P. 63, &amp; 65</note> So they have proceeded at this time mnch after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Not to repeat all the stories that they have made, or made use of to impair the Credit of the Witnesses; nor to undertake to distinguish betwixt what's true and what's false in this matter, I shall only instance in that which is made publick to the World. Of this kind was the Design which was laid to charge <hi>Oates</hi> with <hi>Sodomy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Narat.</note> and him and <hi>Bedlow</hi> with a <hi>Conspiracy against the Lord Treasurer.</hi> And, which is somewhat a kin to this, the tampering with <hi>Bedlow,</hi> to recall what he had said, or to make him <hi>easie</hi> in what he should say against the great Conspirators;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>'s Trial.</note> that so they might either make him theirs, or render him less able to hurt them, when they could accuse him of listning to such Proposals.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They did endeavour to disguise and conceal it, by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95553:49"/>
being obstinate when apprehended. This hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore discoursed of with respect to the Gunpowder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note n="*" place="margin">P. 34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 63, &amp; 84.</note> when they denied whatever could be denied, and equivocated in what was not to be denied, even to the death. And thus it was in this present Plot. Without doubt had <hi>Coleman's</hi> Letters not been taken, all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence that was maintained in that way betwixt him and the French King's Confessor, would as obstinatly be denied, as it was by him, that any such was continued after 1675, which was the year the last of those Letters was dated in. Or had not the Letter been found amongst <hi>Harcourt's</hi> Papers, which mentions the Consult <hi>April</hi> 24th, they would sooner have denied the thing, than have rack'd their Wit to have put it upon the score of a <hi>Triennial meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Things that were not to be denied, 'tis no wonder if they do confess; but things that depend upon yea and no, 'tis no wonder that they do deny. This <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Garnet</hi> did practise, and the same liberty that they took, 'tis likely the persons of late amongst us also did use, when they have the same Principles, to allow it.</p>
               <p>From what hath been said we see, that the Powder-Treason and this present Plot do agree in far more Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances than they differ, and those that they differ in are not so great but they are capable of an easie accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation. And this leads me to the</p>
               <p n="3">3. General. To shew the ground of that difference which is betwixt Plot and Plot, Criminals and Criminals. And the great instance is, the Confession of the one, and Denial of the other.<note place="margin">New Plot p. 16.</note> This an Author of theirs doth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in; <hi>I challenge,</hi> saith he, <hi>all mankind to assign a Cause of this difference with the least colour of Reason and Humanity.</hi> But, as I have before said <note n="*" place="margin">p. 85.</note>, He must first prove that the Conspirators then did confess ingenuously, candidly and freely. For if they confess'd what they could not deny; if
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95553:50"/>
they again would have denied what they had confessed; if, further, they did often equivocate when they did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to confess; if, lastly, they did deny and conceal more of what they knew, then they did confess and discover, as I have made it evident they did <note n="*" place="margin">p. 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>: Then <hi>Garnets</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is equal to <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Denial; and <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Denial differs not materially from <hi>Garnet</hi>'s Confession. Both these may be,<note place="margin">New Plot. Ibid.</note> and yet there be <hi>no new Creed, nor new Faith since those days amongst them</hi>; as the aforesaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would infer there must, upon this different event, if we allow not both to be innocent. Denying and confessing are indeed in themselves incompatible, and had it bin true which the above-cited Authors do say, that <hi>all of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators in the Powder-Treason did acknowledge their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and asked God and the King pardon</hi> (which I have shewed to be otherwise <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 46.</note>) and impartially confessed all that they knew of that matter; then their Confession might be well opposed to these men's Denial: but when the Confession was so restrained and qualified (as I have above shewed) it's a plain sign, that had there bin nothing but Conscience and Principles in their way (as these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) they would have taken another course; and the <hi>Scaevola Faux,</hi> that had the Courage to say, and without doubt to do what he said, that <hi>if he had happened to be within the House,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceed. p. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>as he was without, when they took him, he would not have failed to have blown up Himself, Them, House and all:</hi> and he that also <hi>laid all the blame upon himself,</hi> and would <hi>own no Complices,</hi> would have died with the same Roman resolution, had not the Rack brought him to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manners <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>As I before observed p.</hi> 84.</note>. This Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> did believe of him, <hi>I knew,</hi> saith he, <hi>that he [Faux] had been imployed in great matters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Paper</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and till Torture, sure he carried it very well.</hi> There is a time that it is either not possible, or to no purpose to deny, and then there can be no trial of a Man's Principles.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95553:50"/>
Thus it was with <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clark</hi> in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, who knew that they were betrayed by the Jesuits, and so were thereby disabled to <hi>prevent the danger and scandal likely to befal their Party by their Confession,</hi> had they been willing to <hi>swear they were innocent, and to take it upon their death.</hi> There was not an opportunity for them to make that Experiment upon themselves, nor to give us an Evidence how far <hi>their Consciences would have dispensed with so doing.</hi> And so it was no fit case for the above said Authour to oppose to this at present for that reason as well as another, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were not Jesuits, nor of their Party. They must make the circumstances the same, and shew that what was then confessed, was sincere &amp; free, full and particular; that they never did deny when asked upon Oath, nor equivocate in what they did confess, nor ever unsay what they had said;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Compend.</hi> P. 73.</note> before we can believe they did confess meerly because <hi>their Consciences could not dispence with so horrid a thing</hi> (as that Author calls it) <hi>as swearing they were innocent, and taking it upon their death.</hi> But if they cannot prove this, and the case is apparently otherwise, as I have before shewed; then for all this discourse and bustle of theirs, <hi>in comparing the Powder-Treason with this Plot, and the Passages and Comportments of the Criminals upon that occasion, with these of our modern pretended</hi> (as they say) <hi>Conspirators,</hi> we are still where we were, and have good reason to believe that both Those then, and These now did act by like Principles and Measures; and that they did confess or deny with the like sincerity that our Author gave a Book that he writ in defence of the Papists and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Traitors, the Title of <hi>the new Plot of the Papists, to transform Traitors into Martyrs</hi>; and call'd that a <hi>New Plot,</hi> which we in <hi>England</hi> know to be as ancient as the days of <hi>Thomas a Becket.</hi>
