            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT <hi>zeal</hi> and unwearied diligence which your Honour has on all occaſions demonſtrated to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and prevent the ſtill advancing Plots of <hi>bloody Papiſts,</hi> has moſt juſtly rendred all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants your Debtors, and fill'd them with veneration for your name and perſon. Were <hi>all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men</hi> endued with a like prudence, and integrity, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh plot had long ſince loſt <hi>its Head,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured (as with a Brazen Wall) againſt all the malicious effects of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Trojans</hi> of old had not been deſtroyed, had they not truſted to <hi>Sinon</hi>'s flatteries, and admitted the <hi>fatal Horſe,</hi> cramb'd with <hi>treacherous Greeks,</hi> within their Walls. Nor can <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> become enſlaved to the Pope, or any other Forrein power, unleſs ſome of our own (intruſted ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately with the Adminiſtration of affairs) clandeſtinely joyn with our open enemies. But where <hi>Thieves</hi> keep the keys, well may the houſe be rifled; and if <hi>Wolves,</hi> though in <hi>Sheeps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathing,</hi> be once made Shepherds, 'tis not difficult to imagine what will become of the <hi>flock.</hi> Nor can that Nation but be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd in a condition deplorable, and on the very precipice to wilful ruin, where 'tis a matter of <hi>greater hazard to diſcover</hi> Treaſons, than to <hi>contrive</hi> them.</p>
            <p>The following Narrative will partly ſhew the <hi>figure</hi> which potent Papiſts have made for ſome years paſt in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and what influence they have had (like malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Planets) to blaſt and cruſh all that durſt go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their diſloyal Helliſh deſigns. It will here appear, that
<pb facs="tcp:98956:3"/>
there hath been for many years a <hi>Treaſonable</hi> Conſpiracy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on in that Kingdom, and that the Popiſh <hi>Iriſh</hi> were in an expecting <hi>readineſs</hi> to give the blow, and act over their Butcheries of 41, but with greater barbarity: Only one thing there was that hindred, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> (a powerful Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant State, <hi>very powerful</hi> till ſome late Jeſuitical deſigns weakned them) muſt firſt be ruined.</p>
            <p>So that it ſeems the project was general to <hi>root</hi> out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Proteſtants throughout <hi>Europe;</hi> for this declaration to me was made in the year 1672, a time when <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were ſo <hi>hopefully</hi> united, and vigorouſly engaged in a War with <hi>Holland,</hi> and the ſame juncture when the never to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be forgotten <hi>Camp</hi> at <hi>Blackheath</hi> was on foot.</p>
            <p>What Intervening accidents might make the Conſpirators defer their riſing in Arms, or whether my making this diſcovery might not cauſe them to be more <hi>wary,</hi> though through ſome peoples kind connivance, it rendred them never the more <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled</hi> to have gone on, I determine not: 'tis enough that as I knew it my duty to divulge it: ſo, although meerly for the ſame I have now paſt through a <hi>Nine-years. Purgatory,</hi> and am thereby reduced to poverty, debt, and great extremity; yet were it ſtill to do, I would diſcharge my conſcience, though a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Popiſh Lords</hi> were concern'd to be angry, and I were ſure not only to loſe my <hi>Livelyhood,</hi> but my <hi>Life</hi> likewiſe on that account.</p>
            <p>At your Lordſhips feet I humbly lay theſe papers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſhelter them into the world under the patronage of your truly Honourable Name; as well becauſe your Lordſhip is ſo excellently qualified to judg of the truth of them by your <hi>great inſight</hi> into the complexion of <hi>affairs</hi> and <hi>perſons</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> (which had the honour of having your Lordſhip for ſome <hi>(too ſhort)</hi> time her Lord Lieutenant) as in regard of my <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular obligation,</hi> that the ſame might remain as a <hi>publick teſtimony</hi> of my gratitude.</p>

And this Informant ſaith, that upon his return from <hi>Portumna</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> aforeſaid, through his duty and allegiance to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and natural affection to his Country-men, the Proteſtants of that Kingdom, reſolving to reveal and, make known ſuch the Treaſonable and dangerous words of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> did immediately repair to one Dr. <hi>Topham,</hi> a Maſter in <hi>Chancery,</hi> before whom the Informant did upon his corporal Oath declare and make the ſame known: and ſaith, that preſently after this Informant was ſent for, and did accordingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Lord <hi>Berkley,</hi> his Majeſties then Lord Lieftenant, and the Council at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and by them examined touching the Premiſes, which this Informant again confirmed upon three ſeveral Examinations before the ſaid Lord Lieftenant and Council: and after that this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant was ſent for before.

And this Informant ſaith, that ſoon after this Examination aforeſaid, a certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, who, as this Informant was informed, had been an old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, or Officer, and lived in, or about the County of <hi>Wicklow</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whoſe name this Informant hath forgot, came alſo before the ſaid Lord Lieftenant and Council, and there upon his corporal Oath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there were ſome certain <hi>Iriſh-</hi>men about the time of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen</hi>'s Speeches, offered him a Commiſſion to raiſe men, and alſo to impower him to give Commiſſions for that purpoſe to whom he ſhould think fit; and adviſed him to get all the aſſiſtance he could, and told him, he ſhould be ſupplied with money to carry on the buſineſs, and they ſhould be in a readineſs within twelve days, then next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for that they expected about that time to riſe, and be up in Arms againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland:</hi> and ſaith, that about three Weeks or a Month after, all the ſaid <hi>Engliſh-</hi>mans Stock, Cattle, Goods and Subſtance were taken from him, whereby he was ruined and quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: And although the ſaid <hi>Engliſh-</hi>man Petitioned the Lord Liefte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Council for relief, in ſuch his diſtreſſed condition, yet could he not obtain any relief, as the ſaid <hi>Engliſh-</hi>man declared, and told this Informant, who ſince that time could never ſee him, or hear any thing of him. And this Informant ſaith, that being, as aforefaid, engaged by the ſaid Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Booth,</hi> to proſecute the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> a Purſevant was accordingly ſent for the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> but he could not be found; and immediately after this Informant ſaw the ſaid <hi>Allen</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> together in the ſaid Earls Coach, come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the ſaid Earl appeared with the ſaid <hi>Allen,</hi> as his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;

and the ſaid <hi>Allen,</hi> together with this Informant, preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the ſaid Lord Lieftenant and Council, and by them was examined concerning the ſaid Treaſonable words and Speeches ſo by the ſaid <hi>Allen</hi> ſpoken, as aforeſaid: all which the ſaid <hi>Allen</hi> denied; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo denied, that this Informant, or his ſaid Father was, or were at the houſe of him the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> or in <hi>Portumna,</hi> at the time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid: whereupon this Informant being again examined, in the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen</hi>'s preſence, did again confirm the truth of the Premiſes, and then alſo proved, that this Informant and his ſaid Father, were the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> in the houſe of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> in the Town of <hi>Portumna.</hi> And this Informant the better remembers it to be on the day and year aforeſaid, for that he had a Bond which was then and there ſealed and delivered to this Informants uſe, where <hi>Simon Allen</hi> a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> had ſet his name as a witneſs. And upon this Informants then producing the ſaid Bond, and ſhewing the ſame to the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> he could not deny the hand-writing of his ſaid brother. Thereupon the ſaid Lord Lieutenant and Council declaring they were very well ſatisfied of the truth of this Informants evidence, did preſs and importune the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> to make an open and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous confeſſion of the whole truth of the matter; telling him if he did not confeſs, it would be worſe for him. But the ſaid <hi>Thomas Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> notwithſtanding obſtinately perſiſting in his ſaid denial, was by the Lord Lieutenant and Council ordered to ſtand committed cloſe priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without Bail or Mainpriſe, and ſo commanded the Gaoler to take him away. Nevertheleſs the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> was the very ſame day, by the prevalency, intereſt, means and procurement of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> or otherwiſe, ſet at liberty upon his giving his own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of One-hundred pounds penalty, perſonally to appear within ten days next after notice ſhould be given for that purpoſe, to be left at the houſe of one <hi>Thomas Lowe,</hi> ſcituate in St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Street in <hi>Dublin,</hi> before the Lord Lieutenant and Council, and not to depart without licenſe.</p>
            <p>And this Informant further ſaith, That ſome ſhort time after this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant and his ſaid Father having further occaſion to travel in the ſaid County of <hi>Galway,</hi> they came to the River <hi>Shannan,</hi> where the wind being very high, it was late before the Ferry-boat could paſs them over to the ſaid Town of <hi>Portumna,</hi> where they arrived on a <hi>Saturday</hi> in the evening; but finding the inhabitants there to gaze upon them, and draw tumultuouſly together, conceived it altogether unſafe to lodge there; and therefore altho' they were both very wet and weary, did rather chuſe to travel four miles further, to a lone houſe on the road to <hi>Loughreak,</hi> and ſix miles ſhort of <hi>Loughrea,</hi> whither they intended that night to have gone, had they not been prevented by the delay of the Ferry-boat, as aforeſaid; and the next morning, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eleven a clock in the morning, they came to <hi>Loughrea,</hi> wherethey reſted that day and night; and yet at or by the inſtigation of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> or others his Accomplices, the Conſtable of <hi>Loughrea</hi> and ſeveral other perſons with him, came very
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98956:5"/>
early the next morning, being <hi>Monday,</hi> to the houſe where this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant and his ſaid Father lodged that night in <hi>Loughrea</hi> aforeſaid, and there very rudely throwing open the Chamber-dore, frightned them out of their ſleep, and there by virtue of a Warrant from one <hi>Iames Donnallan,</hi> then a Steward alſo to the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> a Papiſt, but yet a Juſtice of the Peace living near <hi>Loughrea,</hi> ſeized this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant and his ſaid Father upon a pretence that they travelled on the Sabbath or Lords day, whereas ſeveral of the Inhabitants there tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled and came all that Sabbath-day into <hi>Loughrea,</hi> with their Carts and Horſes Loaden from <hi>Athlone</hi> Faire, Twenty Miles diſtant from <hi>Loughrea,</hi> and yet none of theſe inhabitants were any ways troubled or moleſted for their ſo travelling on the ſame Sabbath day. And the ſaid Conſtable and thoſe perſons with him, then alſo ſeized and took away a Caſe of Piſtols, and two Swords belonging to this Informant and his ſaid Father, then lying on the Table in their Chambers, and ſaid this Informant and his Father intended to kill ſome body with the Piſtols and Swords, whenas in truth they only carried the ſame about with them for their own defence. And this Informant nor his ſaid Father could never get their ſaid Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols or Swords reſtored again to them. And the ſaid Conſtable, and thoſe other perſons then with him, as aforeſaid, having ſeized and forced this Informant and his ſaid Father out of their bed, did alſo then force them to travel ſix miles to one Dean <hi>Peirſe,</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, living at that diſtance from <hi>Loughrea;</hi> and the ſaid Juſtice of the Peace, or Miniſter, reproving this Informant and his ſaid Father for ſuch their travelling on the ſaid Sabbath-day, told them withall, That he had heard they had given in evidence againſt the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickard,</hi> and thereupon committed this Informant and his ſaid Father to the Gaol at <hi>Loughrea</hi> aforeſaid, whither he commanded the Conſtable to carry them, and gave him private directions, as this Informant knows, becauſe he overheard him, that <hi>no bail ſhould be taken</hi> for them, or either of them, altho' he the ſaid Juſtice or Miniſter juſt before pretended to this Informant and his ſaid Father, that they might <hi>give bail.</hi> And this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant further ſaith, That he and his ſaid Father being accordingly carried by the ſaid Conſtable and thoſe with him, into the ſaid Gaol in <hi>Loughrea,</hi> were by the inſtigation, prevalency, and directions as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, there kept cloſe priſoners for about five or ſix days, and by the Keepers of the ſaid Gaol denied and not ſuffered to have any bed to lye on, but only the ground in the ſaid Gaol wherein they were ſo kept; nor any clothes to cover them, ſave only their own wearing clothes on their backs: and altho' they earneſtly requeſted to have ſome ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins-brought to cover them from the cold, yet could they not obtain leave to have the ſame done: neither would the ſaid Keeper, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſuch directions as aforeſaid, ſuffer any Friend to come into or near the ſaid Gaol or Priſon, to ſpeak with, or do any thing for this Informant or his ſaid Father, or to bring them any relief, or ſuffer them to have any victuals or drink; neither had they any whilſt they continued there, but what they could privately get of the poor priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the ſame priſon. And altho' this Informant juſt as he and his ſaid Father were ſo brought to, and going into the ſaid Gaol, did employ an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98956:5"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, a perſon living in <hi>Loughrea,</hi> and gave him money, and lent him this Informants Horſe, to convey or carry a Letter from this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant and his ſaid Father to <hi>Galloway,</hi> but Fourteen Miles from <hi>Lough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea;</hi> yet within an hour or two after, fearing the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard's</hi> diſpleaſure, being (as this Informant hath great cauſe to believe) charged by ſome or other of the Earls Agents or Tenants there, at his Perril, as he told me, not to convey or carry the ſaid Letter, did return this Informant his money again, and ſaid, that the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, <hi>Chriſtopher Poor</hi> by name, and a Popiſh Conſtable in <hi>Loughrea,</hi> told him, the ſaid perſon, that if he ſhould carry the ſaid Letter, or any other ways appear to do any thing for this Informant or his ſaid Father, that the ſaid <hi>Earl of</hi> Clanrickard <hi>would ruin him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:</hi> And the better to colour the ſaid malicious and injurious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions againſt this Informant and his ſaid Father, ſeveral perſons by ſuch inſtigations and prevalencies as aforeſaid, were procured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that this Informant's ſaid Father had a deſign to <hi>burn the ſaid Town of Loughrea;</hi> and that beſides the ſaid Information againſt this Informant and his ſaid Father for ſuch their travelling, as aforeſaid, on the Sabbath-day, there would be <hi>ſeven</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> other Indictments preferred and proſecuted againſt them, at the then <hi>Galloway</hi> Aſſizes: and in ſuch Condition this Informant and his ſaid Father lay in the ſaid Goal or Priſon in <hi>Loughrea,</hi> aforeſaid, for ſome conſiderable time, and perhaps might there have layn (if not deſtroy'd or famiſh't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by their cruel uſages) had not this Informant, through a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the ſaid Priſon, accidentally ſeeing a ſtranger riding by, conveyed to him a Letter, directed to ſome friends of theirs, then living in <hi>Galloway,</hi> where, by ſuch means, the ſaid Letter was received, and underſtanding thereby ſuch the ſad Condition of this Informant and his ſaid Father, their ſaid friends did preſently make application to the Judges of the Aſſizes, then ſitting there at <hi>Galloway,</hi> and of them obtained an Order for the removal of this Informant and his ſaid Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thither. And they being by the ſaid Keepers of the ſaid Goal thereupon brought to <hi>Galloway</hi> at night late, were put in the vileſt Priſon in that Town, amongſt the condemned Malefactors, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any accommodation at all; and the next morning they were brought before the ſaid Judges, Baron <hi>Heu</hi> and Judg <hi>Cuſack</hi> in the Court of Aſſizes, they then ſitting, where an Indictment was then preferred and read againſt this Informant and his ſaid Father, for ſuch their travelling, as aforeſaid, on the Sabbath-day; and another mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Indictment was then alſo preferred there, and read againſt this Informant's ſaid Father, whereby it was charged, That he as before (which was moſt falſly and maliciouſly reported) had a deſign to <hi>burn Loughrea.</hi> And to the firſt of the ſaid Indictments this Informant and his ſaid Father upon the Courts demand ſubmitted; and to the laſt, this Informants ſaid Father put in his Traverſe; and altho' no proſecutors or witneſſes then appeared againſt either of them; yet were they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to give <hi>One thouſand pounds</hi> Security not to depart the ſaid Town of <hi>Galloway</hi> without leave of the ſaid Court: and ſome time
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98956:6"/>
after, on the laſt day of the ſaid Aſſizes, they were ordered by the ſaid Court to give, and accordingly did give <hi>new Security</hi> to appear there again at the next Aſſizes, and to keep the peace, and be of <hi>good behaviour</hi> in the mean time; and having given ſecurity, and the ſaid Aſſizes being ended, they then repaired to <hi>Dublin,</hi> which is about <hi>one hundred miles</hi> from <hi>Galloway;</hi> and from thence were forced to repair back again at the next Aſſizes accordingly to <hi>Galloway,</hi> to their great trouble and charge; and when they came there, none appeared to maintain the aforeſaid Indictment. But as if all theſe malicious and moſt vexatious proceedings had been nothing, this Informant was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain arreſted the fourth of <hi>November</hi> following, in an Action of <hi>Ten thouſand pounds</hi> in the name of <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being hurried to priſon, within four days procuring Bail, he was again detained on another Action in the ſaid Earls name, of <hi>Twenty thouſand pounds,</hi> bearing date the eighth <hi>ditto;</hi> and being ready to come forth again, was a <hi>third time</hi> detained at the ſaid Earls ſuit in an Action of <hi>Thirty thouſand pounds,</hi> in all amounting to <hi>Sixty thouſand pounds,</hi> laid upon him on purpoſe to ruine him utterly. And further ſaith, That within fourteen days, or thereabouts, after, the Informant procured a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to be brought to the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> Bar, where tendering Bail to all the ſaid Actions, the ſaid Earls Council moved for time to conſider of the ſufficiency of the ſaid Bail; which was granted them till the next day, when and where this Informant was again brought; and then the ſaid Earls ſtanding Council told the Judges, That they had no directions or inſtructions to proſecute this Informant from the ſaid Earl; and that they conceived ſome perſons had proſecuted him out of malice only to curryfavour with the ſaid Earl; and therefore deſired he might be diſcharged of the foreſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and accordingly he was diſcharged paying his Fees; but then left without all <hi>remedy</hi> to recover his charges and damages; the ſaid Earl being at the ſaid Bar, declared to be <hi>no proſecutor,</hi> tho' the ſaid Actions were in his name, and carried on by ſecret order (as this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent has all the reaſon in the world to think, and does moſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe). But all theſe vexations ſufficed not, but being fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the deſtruction of this Informant, and a diſcouragement to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; For his innocence, though zealous in performance of his duty in revealing the ſaid Treaſonable words, he was again ſhortly after ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by a Writ of Two thouſand pounds out of the Kings Bench, at the ſuit of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanrickard;</hi> to which he gave bail; and again in ſome ſhort time was arreſted at the ſuit of the ſaid Earl, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Action of Two thouſand pounds out of the ſaid Court, to which he alſo gave bail: and being bound, as aforeſaid to appear at <hi>Galloway</hi> Aſſizes, this Informant and his ſaid Father did accordingly attend, and were there cleared, as appears by the the following Diſcharge.</p>

            <p>The firſt of the laſt mentioned Actions being laid for two thouſand Pounds damages, was diſmiſs'd for <hi>Non-</hi>Proſecution: On the ſecond Action of two thouſand Pounds was declared, that this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant had ſcandalized the ſaid Earl to the damage of the foreſaid Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and though the ſaid Actions were taken out of the Kings Bench, <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the Declaration fyled there; yet the ſaid Earls Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil moved the Court, that the <hi>Venire</hi> might be laid in <hi>Galloway,</hi> and the Action tryed there: Whereupon this Informant petitioned the Court that the <hi>Venire</hi> might abide at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and be tryed there; ſetting forth, that <hi>Dublin</hi> was the place where he had made diſcovery of the Treaſonable Words ſpoken by <hi>Allen,</hi> on which the ſaid <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Clanrickard's</hi> Action was pretendedly grounded; and that his Witneſſes to prove the ſaid <hi>Allen</hi> had ſpoke thoſe words, were in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin:</hi> That <hi>Galloway</hi> was a place where the ſaid Earl was very <hi>Potent,</hi> and above an hundred miles diſtant from this Informants and his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Habitations, which Journey would be to their great coſts and charges, beſides the imminent danger of their Lives in going thither, or coming from thence, by thoſe rude and exaſperated perſons that live on the way: That what he had done was in diſcharge of his duty to his Majeſty, and preſervation of the Proteſtants, and wherein he had done the ſaid Earl no wrong. But if the ſaid Earl were <hi>ſlandered,</hi> or was any wiſe ſcandalized, it was by the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> his Tenant or Steward, againſt whom in Right and Juſtice he ought to have taken his Remedy (if he had thought it ſafe ſo to do) and not againſt this Informant: Yet (notwithſtanding) ſeveral Petitions, and ſome Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits taken in Court, and alſo pleaded by this Informants Council, Sir <hi>Richard Reynolds,</hi> and Counſellor <hi>Whitfield,</hi> to have the Tryal kept at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98956:7"/>
the <hi>Kings Bench Bar, Dublin,</hi> they were ſtill put off and denied by Juſtice <hi>Oliver Jones,</hi> an Iriſh Man, a reputed Papiſt; and there being no other Judg on the Bench, He in a great paſſion adjourned the ſaid Court from Ten of the Clock till the next day, and continued the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journments for two or three days together, merely upon the motions of this Informants Council, to have the ſaid Tryal held at the Bar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper place; but the ſaid Judg ſtill denying it, anſwered, he <hi>had reſolved to the contrary;</hi> and thereupon this Informants ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil told him, they had loſt the Judges favour for that Term, for being ſo much concerned for the Informant, and likewiſe aſſured this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant it was contrary to Law and Juſtice, and common practice, for the Judg ſo to do. Then this Informant was forced with his ſaid Father his Witneſs, to Travel to <hi>Galloway</hi> to attend the ſaid Tryal there; where though he was there three days before the day of Tryal, yet could he not get any <hi>Council for money</hi> to plead his cauſe. Then at the appointed time, Petitioning the Judges to aſſign him Council, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one day to adviſe with them; Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> would allow no time. The Earls Council urged there were three Councils unretained by the ſaid Earl, whom this Informant did retain, giving them their fee, eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Shillings each man, with the Breviates of his Cauſe, which were drawn by Counſellor <hi>Whitfield,</hi> the Informant being forced to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the ſaid Council, who were all Iriſh Papiſts. The only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and iſſue for this Informant was, to prove that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> had ſpoken the ſaid Treaſonable Words, which was ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his ſaid Father his Witneſs, that one of his Council told the Court the Evidence was ſufficient, but was over-ruled by the ſaid Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> ſaying, That that was not the caſe now; and beckoning with his hand to this Informants Council when he ſpoke the words; ſo that none of the Informants Council ſpoke a word more on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half at that time. But Judg <hi>Povey</hi> declared to the Court, that it was ſufficiently proved that <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> had ſpoke thoſe words; however the Jury being ſome of them outlaw'd, and moſt of them Papiſts, and ſome of them Tenants, others Bayliffs, and all of them ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther related to the ſaid Earl, who was then preſent at the ſaid Tryal, brought in a Verdict againſt this Informant for two thouſand pounds Damages, and ſix pence coſt; upon which the ſaid Earl hath ſince in <hi>Dublin</hi> obtained a Judgment againſt this Informant for the ſame to his utter Ruine, the ſaid Earl being a dangerous Papiſt, of great power in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and as this Informant is credibly informed, he then was and ſtill is Admiral of the Iriſh Seas belonging to <hi>Galloway</hi> under the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and it was then reported he was to be Governor of <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> in the Year 1672.</p>
            <p>And this Informant further ſaith, That at <hi>Galloway</hi> the ſame day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Tryal was over, he was endeavoured withal to be perſwaded to ſubmit himſelf to the ſaid Earl, and to declare what he had done <hi>was at the inſtigation of ſome others,</hi> as being his only way to be ſafe; and that the Earl would then pay him his Charges, and diſcharge him of the ſaid Verdict, which he only obtained for his credit: And it was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98956:7"/>
then alſo added, by <hi>John Carrol</hi> Clerk of the Crown, that otherwiſe, Let this Informant return to <hi>Dublin</hi> which way he would, there were thoſe Related to the ſaid Earl would wait <hi>to do his Buſineſs for him.</hi> Whereunto this Informant replyed. That he never was put on by any one; That what he had declared was no more than what the ſaid <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Allen</hi> had ſaid; and that if it was to do again, he would do it; looking upon it a duty incumbent upon every good Subject, and that he would take the beſt care of himſelf he could in returning home, truſting in God to preſerve him from ſuch as ſought unjuſtly to do him hurt: And to that purpoſe finding himſelf <hi>often threatened,</hi> and many times abuſed in <hi>Galloway,</hi> he was forced, together with his ſaid Father, to get thence <hi>by Night,</hi> and forſake the common Road, and to go all the <hi>by-ways</hi> they could to ſecure their lives; they having ſince been credibly informed, that they were purſued by <hi>ſeven Perſons near ſixty miles,</hi> to have done them miſchief; and lately this Informant was credibly informed, that there was a Life-Guard man hired to kill him upon the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard's</hi> account at, <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, In <hi>November,</hi> 1678. the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that this Informant and his ſaid Father had made a Relation of their great ſufferings by the ſaid Earls unjuſt Proſecutions, and the great charges and damages they had thereby ſuſtained; he the ſaid Earl on the thirtieth of <hi>November,</hi> took out Writs of <hi>one thouſand pounds</hi> out of the Kings Bench againſt this Informant and his ſaid Father, and by virtue of the ſame Arreſted his ſaid <hi>Ancient Father,</hi> and there moſt inhumanely abuſed him, and laid him in Priſon from the Thirtieth of <hi>November</hi> till the expiration of two Terms, before an appearance could be allowed of in the Kings Bench; and alſo another Writ out of the Common Pleas of <hi>one thouſand pounds</hi> laid upon this Informant's ſaid Father, which occaſioned his Impriſonment until the twelfth of <hi>May</hi> following, to the great charge of this Informant.</p>
            <p>And this Informant further ſaith, That one <hi>Burke,</hi> a Steward or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent unto the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> declared to his face, that he would be <hi>the death of this Informant</hi> if he could conveniently light on him; and to accompliſh in part his bloody Reſolution, did ſo ſeverely ſtrike this Informants Wife, who was the Daughter of Captain <hi>Thomas Ellis,</hi> Merchant of the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that from that time ſhe lay in a languiſhing Condition until ſhe dyed, being the Second of <hi>November,</hi> 1680. it being in the houſe of this Informant that he committed the ſaid Aſſault, he the ſaid <hi>Burke</hi> bringing Bayliffs and ſub Sheriffs Officers, eight in number, to aſſiſt him; and this Informant by great Providence eſcaped from them, and ſince for ſeveral months they have been ſeen to watch for him, inſomuch that he durſt not appear or converſe with any, fearing his Life or perpetual Impriſonment by the ſaid Earl or his Confederates, until he made his eſcape for <hi>England</hi> to make known his grievances.</p>
            <p>Two years ſince alſo this Informant was ſet upon by ſeveral <hi>Papiſts</hi> near the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and received <hi>Wounds,</hi> but narrowly eſcaped his life by Gods Providence; and the ſaid Earl for further vexation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98956:8"/>
hath lately fyled a large Declaration in the Common-Pleas, ſtuft with many falſe ſuggeſtions, containing near three Skins of Parchment, it being an Action of Slander, grounded upon the Statute made at <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and laid to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formants ſaid Fathers charge, damages to the value of One thouſand pounds, to which the Defendant pleaded the General Plea <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and then there was no further proſecution, as by the Records may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear.</p>
            <p>Whereupon this Informant and his ſaid Father preſented ſeveral Petitions unto the Lord Lieutenant and Council at <hi>Dublin</hi> about <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> laſt, repreſenting and ſetting forth their damages, and the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Suits brought againſt them for many years paſſed, and prayed that the before mentioned <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> might be ſent for, and the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> living in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and that we might be ordered to appear and prove theſe Treaſonable Words which the ſaid <hi>Allen</hi> ſpoke, and have ſatisfaction; and thereupon we might be diſmiſſed from thoſe unjuſt Proſecutions from the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanrickard;</hi> but nothing would be done, ſave leaving them to the <hi>Common Law;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Informant and his Father being ſo ruinated as aforeſaid, are not now in a capacity to proſecute or deſend themſelves againſt the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> he being a near Relation to the Duke of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the twelfth day of <hi>May,</hi> 1680. one Mr. <hi>Robert Downing</hi> came to this Informants Houſe, and ſhewed him a Paper written, which was as he ſaid by the Earls Order <hi>(viz.)</hi> That if this Informant and his ſaid Father would give under their Hands and Seals, that they do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe in their Conſciences, that the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanrickard was not any ways guilty of the Things</hi> ſpoken of him in the Affidavit againſt the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> that then the ſaid Earl would forbear all further proceedings, and diſcharge them from all things paſt, by ſealing mutual Releaſes to each other: But this Informant refuſing ſo to do, declared he had good grounds to believe to the contrary, and did hope in time to have ſatisfaction for the great damages he ſuſtained by the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanrickard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Robert Potts</hi> ſworn before two Juſtices of the Peace, the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1679. and declared he heard one <hi>John Venge,</hi> a Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith of <hi>Portumna,</hi> ſay, That he had fixed up for the ſaid Earl <hi>five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Fire-Arms</hi> about five or ſix years ſince, and that he had a great many more to fix up for the ſaid Earl; and that the ſaid Gunſmith and his men with Forge and Tools did work in the Caſtle of <hi>Portumna,</hi> belonging to the ſaid Earl. This Informant Petitioned the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and Council for a Copy of <hi>Potts</hi> Affidavit, and ſome other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies he thought neceſſary, but the Clerk of the Council ſaid my Lord <hi>would not grant them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Informant further ſaith, that in the Year 1678. there were Proclamations to <hi>diſarm Papiſts</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and baniſh Popiſh Prieſts, Jeſuits, and Fryars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this Informant hath been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed, that ſeveral Papiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having not obeyed the ſaid Proclamations have been ſeized on, but producing Licenſes from the

Lord Lieutenant have been diſcharged and ſet at liberty; inſomuch, that the ſaid City and Country <hi>ſwarms with them,</hi> and that there are ſeveral <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Officers lately come into <hi>Ireland,</hi> Papiſts, and by the names of Collonels, Majors, Captains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor were any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers permitted to ſearch the ſaid Earls Caſtle, or ſeize any Arms to him belonging, being prohibited ſo to do, as follows.</p>

            <p>Another Inducement of his diſcovery, was the bloody Maſſacre that broke forth there in the year 1641. which will never be forgotten by the Proteſtants, nor ever be repented of by the Papiſts: And that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the preſent apprehenſions of great danger from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Plot, there are in, and about the City and Suburbs of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> divers <hi>Maſſ-houſes,</hi> publickly frequented by Hundreds and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, connived, at although ſeveral Proclamations have been iſſued out againſt them.</p>

               </gap>t would certainly have been by them ſeverely and deſervedly puniſhed.</p>
            <p>But let all moderate Proteſtants, and true <hi>Engliſh</hi> men conſider the calamity that this Informant and his Father have ſuffered in making the ſaid diſcovery, and the neceſſity he is reduced to for ſo doing; for all the proccedings have been (as you may obſerve) managed againſt him with that cruelty and injuſtice, the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> ſhewing his implacable wrath and malicious hatred to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, as he hath in the former Rebellion given ſufficient demonſtrations of his bloody-mindedneſs towards the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants in all parts: when old <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lick,</hi> Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> living in the beginning of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in <hi>Portumna,</hi> and ſometimes at <hi>Loughred;</hi> did endeavour to ſave ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, and commanded his Nephew, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Earl, ſo to do; but the new Earl refuſed to obey his Unckle, old <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lick,</hi> but went to the Army of the Rebels, and inſtead of being kind to the Proteſtants and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he moſt cruelly handled them in all parts whereſoever he found them, and was always found to be moſt cruel and unmerciful in the time of the Maſſacre and Rebellion, and ſo hath continued ever ſince upon all occaſions, as you may ſee in his late paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages concerning this Informant. Many other cruel and unjuſt actions in that County hath he done to many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſince he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, eſpecially to a Gentleman of Quality, and a Juſtice of peace in that County, becauſe he lived in an Abby which ſtood upon Land that he bought with his money, and refuſed to give it to Popiſh Clergy and Fryars; they made the Earl to begin a Suit againſt the ſaid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, to his ruin, by hiring Witneſſes to teſtifie for the Earl: the ſaid Judg <hi>Jones</hi> was the Judg for the ſaid Earl, who never makes any ſcruple to give judgment againſt a Proteſtant; which all <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtants have reaſon to take notice of.</p>
