            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His comes not to beſpeak you <hi>Patron</hi> of the Book to which it is prefixed; but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and to make known unto the world, That you have been both a <hi>Faithful Friend</hi> to the <hi>Great Author</hi> thereof, in Conſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and alſo a <hi>Publick Benefactor</hi> in producing the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> here printed in this and the precedent Volume, the <hi>Tenth</hi> and <hi>Eleventh Books of His Commentaries upon the Creed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, though I think I have done you ſome ſmall right in making this Acknowledgment; I fear, by occaſion thereof, you may be thought by others, to have done the Author and your ſelf no ſmal wrong. <hi>The Point</hi> wherein your Judgement may ſuffer, will be, The Concrediting ſo Precious <hi>Depoſita</hi> to ſo mean a Perſon as my ſelf. And yet to vindicate your ſelf, and to comfort me, The enſuing <hi>Narration</hi> may give ſome <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Hope,</hi> That this was not done <hi>(ſine Numine)</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the contrivance of Divine Providence, firſt putting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diverſe ſmall particulars, and then advancing them to the effecting of a Work not ſmall.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtone of this Work was laid ſome 44 years ago, in my <hi>School-Acquaintance,</hi> with a Vertuous and ſtudious young Gentleman Mr. <hi>Ro. Nettleton</hi> of Yorkſhire. This Friendſhip being intermitted by the ſpace of fourteen yeers (he going to <hi>Oxon,</hi> and I to <hi>Cambridge, Anno</hi> 1617.) was afterwards renewed by meeting and Conference; which, though Caſual and ſhort, did ſoon diſcover <hi>(as the Ointment in the right Hand will not long be hid)</hi> That we had all this while been Diſciples to <hi>One Man,</hi> though we had lived ſo many years (without any the leaſt <note place="margin">Dr. Iackſon.</note> Intelligence or Commerce) in Two ſeveral Academies. After <hi>This,</hi> there followed a ſecond Pauſe or Ceſſation of Twelve or fourteen years more: Towards the end of which ſpace, <hi>The Difficulties of the Times</hi> brought me to ſeek retirement in <hi>Oxon;</hi> where, by the Mediation of Mr. <hi>Benſon</hi> (a very Ingenuous
<pb facs="tcp:32220:3"/>
perſon, and <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> to Dr. <hi>Jackſon)</hi> I made ſuit to Dr. <hi>Newlin</hi> (Succeſſor to our Author in the Government of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr. Iackſon</hi> made <hi>Dr. Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Dr. Newlin</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors of his Will, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers with them.</note> 
               <hi>Colledg)</hi> to view ſome Papers for my private Information, but could not obtein, though upon condition to peruſe them only in his own Lodgings; So careful and cautelous was that <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man,</hi> for which I honour and commend him.</p>
            <p>This juſt and kind denyal ſharpned my former deſires, and made me ſeek out a <hi>Precator</hi> (a very Grave and Learned Man, well known to your ſelf) by whoſe Mediation I might obtein <note place="margin">Dr. Lany.</note> from you, or by your help, what I could not otherwiſe get. Whereupon you were pleaſed to give me ſo fair an Advouſion of your Favour, as ſupported my hopes for the ſpace of three yeers more, when returning to <hi>Oxon</hi> and miſsing your ſelf, I made means a ſecond time to <hi>Dr. Newlin,</hi> and got a ſight of ſome of <hi>Dr. Jackſons</hi> Papers. This was in the Year 1646.</p>
            <p>In the year 1651, Mr. <hi>Nettleton</hi> being in <hi>London,</hi> and being very diſirous of the thing, intreated me to expend that ſmall Acquaintance I had with the <hi>Learned and Pious Dr. Hammond,</hi> in obteining of your ſelf, and by your Mediation of <hi>Dr. New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> a ſight of ſuch Papers as <hi>Dr. Jackſon</hi> left behind him; which you granted and effected with ſo memorable alacritie, as did both <hi>mcourage Him,</hi> (divers others aſsiſting the deſign alſo) to contribute towards the reprinting of the firſt three Books ill <note place="margin">See the Preface to the Firſt Book.</note> printed in <hi>Quarto;</hi> and after that, towards the publiſhing of the <hi>Tenth,</hi> (beſides ſome charge in writing out part of this Eleventh Book;) and <hi>obliged me</hi> to aſsiſt the beſt I could in doing of them all.</p>
            <p>I have great cauſe to bleſs the Almighty for many bleſsings at all times, but ſignally for <hi>Three</hi> beſtowed upon me in theſe ſad times of publick calamitie. 1. That he hath ever fed me with <hi>Food convenient for me;</hi> mine own bread being <hi>the Bread of my Deſires.</hi> 2. That he hath repaired my other loſſes with a great ſupply of Learned and Pious Acquaintance, greater perhaps, then the times continuing proſperous would ever have afforded me; (ſo true is the Good Word of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 30.) <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That though I was forced from <hi>My Neſt,</hi> (wherein <hi>I ſaid I ſhall dye)</hi> yet he ſuffered me not to be utterly deprived of all opportunities to do him ſervice. And I think my ſelf bound to profeſs, that in this <hi>Price</hi> (which God by your hand hath put into mine) I take moſt comfort, as hoping that my Negotiation therewith, by Gods gracious acceptation, will abound to mine Account, and paſs for a ſupplement or
<pb facs="tcp:32220:3"/>
ſubſtituted Commutation of ſuch duties as I have otherwiſe been defective in. And I earneſtly beſeech all ſuch as were ever committed to my <hi>Tuition</hi> in the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> or to my Charge in Cure of Souls in the <hi>Countrie,</hi> to ſerve themſelves of theſe my endeavors (in another mans Labors) ſo as out of them to repair all their dammages ſuſtained by my negligence, omiſſions or deficiencie in duties towards them.</p>
            <p>And now (Honoured Sir) if I have not wearied you with this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as it is very nauſeous to my ſelf) I can ſubjoyn <hi>a ſecond Series of Arguments,</hi> That Gods good hand of Providence was in this Buſineſs throughout. If I ever made any high me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, or had Projects of doing any thing worthy a Clerk, the very thoughts thereof before I die, are periſht. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came juſtly frighted into this humbled deſpereing Temper, partly, by converſing with this <hi>Great Authors</hi> Works, publiſhed twentie years ago, where I read this Paſſage (and I cannot but ſubſcribe to it:) <hi>[If the ſins of this Land for forty years paſt were</hi> 
               <note place="margin">See his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons upon <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. p. 32. See this Book, fol. 3716.</note> 
               <hi>divided into ten parts, the ſins of the Pulpit and of the Preſſe would make</hi> A Large Tenth.] Had not this <hi>Good Man</hi> been taken away from the evil to come, but lived to hear the <hi>Pulpitings,</hi> and read the <hi>Printings</hi> of theſe laſt <hi>twenty years,</hi> what would he have ſaid? Would not he have reckoned them, <hi>Nine parts of ten?</hi> Being then reſolved, <hi>Periturae parcere Chartae,</hi> never to increaſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Bundels of Supervacuous Books by any compoſure of mine, I acknowledg my ſelf (as <hi>Caelibes</hi> and <hi>Improles</hi> are in a more eſpecial manner bound to aſſiſt the Widow and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan) obliged to help out the more profitable works of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men deceaſed.</p>
            <p>As God, by convincing me of diſabilitie, hath taken away all hopes and deſires of publiſhing any Work of mine own; So he hath given me an extraordinary delight of ſerving out the works of this Man; and this delight hath made me able to take more pains in <hi>this,</hi> then ever I took in any other <hi>Book-buſineſſe</hi> throughout my whole life. Yea, God ſeems to have given me life beyond all expectation, partly for effecting this Work. I <hi>ſaid</hi> (in the year 1649) I <hi>ſhall certainly go down to the grave;</hi> God ſtrangely brought me back from the Gates of Death (He only knows what more to ſuffer) I cannot ſee at preſent what elſe to do, but to publiſh theſe Tracts, the Quinteſſence of which is, That of <hi>The Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have yet <hi>Two Things</hi> to trouble your patience with. The <hi>Former</hi> is, To ſecure you, that I have made no Merchandize,
<pb facs="tcp:32220:4"/>
no baſe Gain, no gain at all (for any would be baſe in me) of thoſe Jewels you committed to my Truſt. The <hi>Later,</hi> To aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, That I have dealt as carefully and faithfully in the Publication of <hi>Theſe Tracts,</hi> as I would (if the Caſe had ſo been) the Author ſhould have done in mine. And yet if this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction be too general to ſtay that wonderment which haply will ariſe in your mind, when at the end of <hi>Chap.</hi> 43. you ſhal find <hi>A Fragment of the Authors</hi> interſerted: Be pleaſed over and above the Reaſons there given, to accept of this Following. The Opinion, <hi>[That the ſins of thoſe Jewes who crucified our Saviour,</hi>

               <hi>(perſecuted his Apoſtles, and ſtoned S.</hi> Stephen) <hi>were not viſited upon them; but that the Plagues reſpectively due for doing ſo, were fended off or ſuperſeded by the ſignal vertue of Chriſts Blood ſpeaking better things then that of</hi> Abel, <hi>and ſpecial Efficacie of His Prayers for them]</hi> was new, and ſeemed, though quaint, yet very uſeful for us of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I am ſcrupulous of loſing any <hi>Fragment</hi> of this <hi>Authors,</hi> but was highly tender of leaving out in that place, the leaſt Grain of weight that might adde any ſhew of proof to <hi>His intended Concluſion;</hi> which I would fain have rendred as probable as might be: That we, who are to fill up the leavings of Chriſts afflictions (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>If this will not ſatisfie you, I have no Refuge left, but to fly to the Sanctuary where the Authors aſhes lye, and to beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of you, in whom, by conſignment of Will, his Perſon lives; which I preſume you will the ſooner grant upon condition I ceaſe to trouble you further.

               <hi>About the</hi> Order <hi>obſerved in</hi> This Book, <hi>there is ſo much ſaid upon ſundry occaſions in ſeveral</hi> Tranſitions, <hi>as hath prevented (for though it follow in reading, it was printed before</hi> this Preface) <hi>the pains here.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the Short or ſum of what is conteined in the Five firſt Sections.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The whole Book conſiſts of Six Sections.</note> 
               <hi>The Sixth and Laſt conſiſts of Thirteen Select Sermons, the fitteſt I could chuſe out, to aid and accompany the precedent Diſcourſes; eſpecially to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Tracts, Of</hi> Chriſts coming to Judgment; <hi>Of</hi> the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; <hi>Of</hi> Life and Death Eternal; <hi>which, as they moſt flagrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth</hi> THE TERROR OF THE LORD, <hi>ſo are they moſt likely, by ſtartling and amateing the Conſcience, to prepare mens minds, that the Impreſſions of thoſe Sermons may be moſt penetrative and permanent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As, in the laſt mentioned Tracts, me-thinks I find A Particular Summons directed to my ſelf,</hi> Prepare to meet thy God; Give an <note place="margin">The Uſe of the laſt Section.</note> Account of thy Stewardſhip; <hi>So in the annexed Sermons I find pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and proper Remembrances of ſeveral things wherein I have done very fooliſhly, deeds that ought not to be done. For this cauſe I bow my knees (and pray the Reader to lift his heart up in my behalf) to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for Pardon and Peace; and that what I have here printed in this Book, may ſo be written in the Table of my heart, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, that I may not only wait for, but haſte to the Coming of the Day of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having transferred theſe things unto my ſelf, and thus far made the</hi> Reader, <hi>yea, the World it ſelf, my Confeſſor, I hope none will offend if I ſhew what reſpective parts of the enſuing Work, may by others be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applyed to themſelves.

               <hi>from what Our Author hath written, About</hi> Judgment, Reſurrection <hi>and the</hi> Life to Come: <hi>Whereas he that adds ſin to miſerie and wrath, may certainly preſume all the Deſolations and Deſtructions God hath brought upon the Earth, as ſo many Taſtes and pledges of Greater to enſue. The Woes paſt, are but Schiographies and portendments, ſcarce beginnings of future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.

            <p>
               <hi>The Section</hi> Of Chriſts coming to Judgment, <hi>is very uſeful for ſuch as take upon them places of Judicature, and moſt uſeful for ſuch as judge in matters of Higheſt Nature and Difference.

               <hi>The Tract</hi> Of the Reſurrection, <hi>who can expreſs the uſe of it? An a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing Meditation it is to think, I now ſee, as ſurely the eyes of ſome ſhal ſee, thoſe Chriſtian brethren that fel in any late Battail, &amp; were buried where they fell, riſing out of their places of Burial, (whether impleading or forgiving one another) and with haſte marching into the</hi> Valley of Jehoſhaphat, <hi>to ſee the day won or loſt there; and whoſe Heads ſhall then be crowned with Glory. Yet is this but as the drop of a bucket to the Ocean of that days Terrors.</hi>

               <hi>The</hi> Sermons <hi>upon that Precept of Chriſt, (I might ſay of</hi> Noah <hi>and</hi> Tullie) Do as you would be done to <hi>are worth their weight in Gold of</hi> Ophir, <hi>and uſeful for all Chriſtians of what condition ſoever.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>There came out a Book ſome ſixteen years ago; intituled,</hi> Autocata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſis Ladenſium; <hi>To the Partie or Perſons that Compoſed or applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Book (wherein Our Author is named) I would eſpecially recommend His Diſcourſes upon Rom.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>preſuming that that thoſe (with the Verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of them exhibited in theſe late Revolutions) will convince Him or them ſufficiently, That it is no difficult matter to compile a Larger Volume of Particularities, wherein they that have judged others, have, by doing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over, again and again, the ſame things, or things more then equivalent, condemned themſelves, and juſtified thoſe whom they have condemned.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>The</hi> Sermons <hi>upon</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. <hi>and Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>contein very ſound reproof of the Phariſaical Duplicitie, of ſuch as built the Sepulchres of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and yet perſecuted the preſent Prophets; and therein of ſuch as in our dayes commend the Lives, and condemn the Authors of the Deaths of Biſhop</hi>

Cranmer, Hooper, Ridley, Ferrar, <hi>Father</hi> Latimer, &amp;c. <hi>And yet deſtroy their ſucceſſors in Order, Diſcipline and Doctrine. I call heaven and earth to Record this day (not to</hi> condemn <hi>ſuch, but to</hi> convince <hi>them that they may be ſaved) That</hi> Thoſe Men <hi>whom they have caſt out as enemies to the Church of</hi> England <hi>(and in Effect, by driving them out from the Inheritance of the Lord, tempted,</hi> ſaying, Go ſerve other Gods!) <hi>are</hi> The Men <hi>that bear the Burthen and heat of the day in all Conteſts betwixt parties of the Engliſh and Romiſh Churches, and that preſerve their undoers from being overborn with Romiſh Errors; And this they do upon diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages unimaginable (ſave only to ſuch as have experimented them) for want of their own Libraries, Their former accommodations of</hi> Seceſſus &amp; Otia, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſides, Thoſe Sermons will ſhew,</hi> That the guilt of Blood will lye long upon a Nation; <hi>That it juſtly may, and certainly will, be required of late Poſterity, unleſs</hi> A Signal Repentance <hi>of the ſame, and eſpecial abſtinence from the like ſins intervene. I appeal to the meekeſt</hi> Moſes <hi>upon earth, what Degree of Guilt he would apportion to that</hi> Communitie <hi>(ſuppoſe it in any Forrain Kingdom) or the</hi> Poſteritie <hi>thereof, which being not only A Pretender to Chriſtianitie but to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie thereof, did Sit as a Spectator, whilſt a Tumultuous Tempeſt of People for divers hours together did hunt and chaſe an Aged man (were he good or bad) unto the Death. Yet was this thing done in our</hi> Metropolis <hi>(which is a kind of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

               <hi>Fact: But Who ever ſorrowed for the Joy conceived at it? Theſe two ſeem to have been</hi> Portentuous Aboadments <hi>of Calamities enſuing; (as the daily viſible deſolation and Profanation of Gods Houſe, is of future woe:) And I remember them not,</hi> as making Interceſsion againſt Iſrael, <hi>or as things I have whereof to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe mine own Nation with delight, but upon the ſame account that I call mine own ſins to remembrance, that God may be intreated for the Land, to blot them out of His. And I beſeech the Infinite Mercie to pardon theſe and all others, as fully, freely, and upon the ſame termes I deſire pardon for mine own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have but</hi> Two Things <hi>more to ſay (and the One concernes the Vulgar Reader)</hi> 1. <hi>That this Book ſeems no way lyable to the</hi> Objection <hi>of Obſcurity, which hath been ſometimes made againſt ſome other parts of this Authors Writings; the Style here being more eaſie and Popular, as firſt prepared for</hi> His Charge at Newcaſtle: <hi>Though to ſay the truth, The Darkneſs was moſt-what in the Readers Eye, and not in the Object, or Authors Writings.</hi> 2. <hi>That the longer the world laſts, the more ſeaſonable every day then other will this Book be; yea, ſo it muſt needs be, the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential parts thereof treating of, and proving,</hi> Chriſts Coming to Judgement, The Reſurrection, <hi>and</hi> Life Everlaſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any One ſhall either by reading the Book or the Preface be any thing bettered, I beſeech him make his Return in Prayers for the Church of</hi> England <hi>(once the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie and Fear, now, by the folly of her own children, made the ſcorn of her</hi> Aemula) <hi>That the Lord would ſo build up her walls, ſet up her Gates, and erect her Towers, That Her</hi> Militancie <hi>in his ſtrength may be victorious for His</hi> Truth, <hi>and at laſt changed into a Triumph in His</hi> Glory, <hi>Which ſhall be the earnest Requeſt of</hi>

That Philoſophical Principle, <hi>[Deus et Natura nihil faciunt fruſtra]</hi> divinely improved. Gods ſpecial and Admirable works have ever a Correſpondent; that is ſome extraordinary end. How ſin is taken away by Chriſts Death; How by his Reſurrection. How we are juſtified by Chriſts Reſurrection. How we may try our ſelves and know, whether we rightly believe this Article of the Reſurrection or no. p 3455</item>

The importance of the phraſe <hi>[Dead to ſin]</hi> No Chriſtians in this life ſo dead to ſin, as to come up to the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Death natural. True Chriſtians dead to ſin, in a proportion to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil death. All Chriſtians (at leaſt all the <hi>Romans</hi> to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes, did ſo) in Baptiſm profeſſe themſelves dead to ſin, and vow death to ſin by a true Mortification thereof. All have in Baptiſm, or may have a Talent of Grace as an Antidote or Medicine againſt the deadly Infection of ſin, as a ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to make us victorious over ſin.</p>
                  <p>Three Motives to deter us from the ſervice of ſin. 1. It is fruitleſs. 2. It is ſhameful; 3. It is mortiferous; Two Motives to engage us in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, 1. Preſent and ſweet fruit unto holineſs. 2. Future happineſs. p 3469</p>

               <item>18. Of the fruitleſneſſe of ſin. Of the ſhame that followes and dogs ſin, as the ſhadow doth the body; what ſhame is, whence it ariſeth, and what uſe may be made thereof. Of fame, praiſe and honor. Satans ſtales, falſe ſhame and falſe honor. The character of both in Greek and Latin. Of <hi>Pudor,</hi> which is alwayes <hi>Male Facti;</hi> of <hi>Verecundia,</hi> which may ſometimes be, <hi>de modo recte Facti. Periit vir cui pudor periit. Erubuit ſalva res eſt.</hi> p. 3477</item>
               <item>19. We are many wayes engaged to ſerve God rather then to ſerve ſin, though ſin could afford us as much fruit &amp; reward as God doth. But there is no proportion, no ground of compariſon between the fruits of ſin, &amp; the Gift of God. The caſe ſtated betwixt the voluptuous, ſenſual life, and the life truly chriſtian. Satans Method and Gods Method. A complaint of the neglect of grace. p. 3484</item>
               <item>20. The firſt and ſecond Death both literally meant, <hi>The wages of ſin;</hi> Both deſcribed, both compared and ſhewed, how and wherein the ſecond Death exceeds the firſt. The greater deprivation of good, the worſe and more unwelcom death is. Every member of the bodie, every faculty of the ſoul, the ſeat and ſubject of the ſecond death. A Map and ſcale: the ſurface and ſolidity of the ſecond Death. Pain improved, by enlarging the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the patient, and by intending or advancing the Activitie of the Agent.

               <item>21. Eternal life compared with this preſent life: the ſeveral tenures of both; The method propoſed. The inſtability of this preſent life. The contentments of it ſhort, and the capacities of men to enjoy ſuch contentments as this life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, narrower.

True belief of the Article of everlaſting life and death is able to effect both Abſtinence from doing evil, and ſufferance of evil for well-doing. The ſad Effects of the misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or unbelief of this Article of Life and Death Eternal. The true belief of it includes a taſte of both. Direction how to take a taſte of death eternal without danger. Turkiſh Principles produce Effects to the ſhame of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Though hell fire be material it may pain the ſoul. The Story of <hi>Biblis.</hi> The Bodie of the ſecond death fully adequate to the Body of ſin. <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> his Story. A General and uſeful Rule. p. 3519.</item>
               <item>24. The Bodie of Death being proportioned to the bodie of ſin, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Meditation muſt apply part to part, but by <hi>Rule</hi> and in <hi>Seaſon.</hi> The dregs and relicks of ſin be the ſting of Conſcience, and this is a prognoſtick of the worm of Conſcience which is a chief part of the ſecond death. Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions how to make right uſe of the fear of the ſecond death, without falling into deſpere, and of the hope of life eternal, without mounting into preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Beware of immature perſwaſions of certainty of ſalvation. 2. Of this Opinion, That all men be at all times either in the eſtate of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or Reprobates. 3. Of the irreſpective Decree of Abſolute Reprobation. The uſe of the taſte of death and pleaſures. The Turkiſh uſe of both. How Chriſtians may get a reliſh of Joy eternal by peace of Conſcience, joy in the Holy Ghoſt and works of Righteouſneſſe. Affliction uſeful to that purpoſe. p. 3529</item>
               <item>25. The coldneſs of our hope of Eternal Life, cauſeth Deviation from the wayes of righteouſneſs, and is cauſed by our no-taſte or ſpiritual diſreliſh of that life. The work of the Miniſtry is to plant this taſte, and to preſerve it in Gods people. Two objects of this Taſte. 1. Peace of Conſcience; 2. Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. That Peace may beſt be ſhadowed out unto us in the known ſweetneſs of temporal peace. The paſſions of the natural man are in a continual mutiny. To men that as yet have no experience of it, the nature of joy in the Holy Ghoſt may beſt be exemplified by that chearful gladneſs of heart, which is the fruit of Civil Peace. It is the prerogative of man to enjoy himſelf, and to poſſeſs his own ſoul. In the knowledg of any truth there is joy; but true joy is only in the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, and of ſaving truths. The difference between <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Gladneſſe</hi> in Engliſh, Greek and Latin. p. 3538.</item>
               <item>26. Whether the taſte of Eternal Life once had, may be loſt. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. How temporal contentments and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin, coming in competition, prevail ſo, as to extinguiſh and utterly dead the heavenly taſte, either by way of <hi>Efficiencie</hi> or <hi>Demerit.</hi> The Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages diſcovered by which a leſſer good gets the better of a greater. p. 3547.</item>
               <item>27. About the merit of good Works. The Romaniſts Allegations from the force of the word <hi>[Mereri]</hi> among the Antients, and for the thing it ſelf out of the holy Scriptures; the Anſwers to them all reſpectively: Some prove <hi>Aut nihil, aut nimium.</hi> The different value and importance of Cauſal Particles, <hi>For, Becauſe, &amp;c.</hi> A Difference between, <hi>Not worthy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</hi> Chriſts ſufferings, though in time finite, yet of value infinite. Pleaſure of ſin ſhort, yet deſerves infinite puniſhment. Bad Works have the title of <hi>Wages</hi> and <hi>Deſert to Death,</hi> but ſo have not <hi>Good Works</hi> to <hi>Life</hi> Eternal. p. 3558.</item>
               <item>28. Whether <hi>Chariſmata Divina,</hi> that is, The Impreſsions of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Favour may be merited by us. Or whether the ſecond, third and fourth
<pb facs="tcp:32220:8"/>
Grace and Life Eternal it ſelf may be ſo. About <hi>Revival of Merits.</hi> The Text <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>[God is not unjuſt, &amp;c.]</hi> expounded. The Queſtions about <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> and <hi>Juſtification</hi> have the ſame Iſſue. The Romiſh Doctrin of Merits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from Chriſts merits. The Queſtion (in order to Practiſe or Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) ſtated betwixt God and our own ſouls. Confidence in Merits, and too haſty perſwaſions that we be the Favourites of God, two Rocks. God in puniſhing Godly men reſpects their former good works. p. 3568.</item>
               <item>29. Three points: 1. Eternal Life the moſt free gift of God, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Donor</hi> and of the <hi>Donee.</hi> 2. Yet doth not the ſovereign Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gift, exclude all Qualifications in the <hi>Donees;</hi> rather requires better in them then in others which exclude it, or themſelves from it. (Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Kingdom of Heaven was prepared for All, or for a certain number) 3. The firſt Qualification for grace, is to become as little children. A parallel of the conditions of Infants, and of Chriſtians truly humble and meek. p. 3578</item>

The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution thereof. Controverſies about the ſentence. Three concluſions in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the deciſions of thoſe Controverſies. 1. The Sentence of life is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded <hi>Secundum Opera,</hi> not excluding faith. 2. Good Works are neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>Neceſsitate Praecepti &amp; Medii:</hi> (And to Juſtification too; as ſome ſay, <hi>Quoad praeſentiam, non quoad Efficientiam.)</hi> The third (handled in the next Chapter) Good Works though neceſſary, are not <hi>Cauſes of,</hi> but the <hi>Way to</hi> the Kingdom. Damnation awarded for Omiſsions. Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> ſaying, <hi>[Bona Opera ſequuntur Juſtificatum, &amp;c.]</hi> expounded. Saint <hi>James</hi> 2. 10. <hi>[He that keeps the whole Law, and yet offends in one point, &amp;c.]</hi> expounded. Why Chriſt in the final Doome inſtances only in Works of Charity, not of Piety and Sanctity. An Exhortation to do good to the poor and miſerable; and the rather, becauſe ſome of thoſe duties may be done by the meaneſt of men. p. 3587</item>
               <item>31. <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Obſervation and Diſputation [about <hi>Merit]</hi> exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and convinced of Contradiction to it ſelf, and to the truth.

This Precept, <hi>Do as ye would be done to,</hi> more then equivalent to that, <hi>Love thy neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> for by good Analogy it is applicable to all the Duties of the firſt Table which we owe to God for our very being and all his other Bleſſings in all kinds beſtowed on us. Our deſires to receive good things from God, ought to be the meaſure of our <hi>Readineſs to return obedience to his will,</hi> and all other duties of dependance upon his Grace and Goodneſs. God in giving <hi>Iſaac</hi> did what <hi>Abraham</hi> deſired; and <hi>Abraham</hi> in offering <hi>Iſaac,</hi> did what God deſired. Two Objections made and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, 1. That this Rule may ſeem to eſtabliſh the old Pythagorean Error of Retaliation, and the new one of Parity in Eſtates. 2.

Two readie wayes to the Dutie. 1.

Two Inconveniencies ariſing from accerſite greatneſs or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, 1. It makes men defective in performing the Affirmative part of this Duty; 2.

But the <hi>Almighty,</hi> unto whoſe future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns the Rites and Cuſtoms of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were (haply) praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned, needs no Defendant, no aſſiſtant, either on the <hi>Right-hand,</hi> or on the <hi>Left.</hi> The former occaſion of imbecillitie, or need of Defendants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet apart, as the <hi>Right-hand</hi> is ordinarily more worthy then the <hi>Left,</hi> ſo to be on the <hi>Right-hand</hi> of Supreme Honour is ſimply more honourable, then to be on the <hi>Left;</hi> ſpecially according to the Cuſtome of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Sons of Zebedee,</hi> or their Mother, or both, were not ignorant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect of the general matter, but in the particular Form, or Manner, or Circumſtance of their Petition; when they deſired that <hi>the one might ſit on their Maſters Right-hand, and the other on the Left in his Kingdome.</hi> To <hi>ſit by him</hi> in his Kingdom, was, to their apprehenſion, and according to the cuſtome of their Native Country, a greater Dignity then to <hi>ſtand by him,</hi> or to <hi>go in and out before him.</hi> To <hi>ſit on the Right-hand,</hi> was affected by the Mother, as a place of praecedence for her elder Son, and therefore rank't <note place="margin">See Gen. 48. 13, 14, 17.</note> in the former place in her Petition. She ſaith not, <hi>That the one may ſit on the Left-hand, and the other on the Right;</hi> but <hi>that one may ſit on the Right-hand, and the other on the Left,</hi> Mat. 20. 21. That to ſit on the <hi>Right-hand</hi> of Majeſty, was the greateſt honour, whereof any Subject, or inferiour Prince in <hi>Jurie,</hi> was capable, may be gathered from the honour which <hi>Solomon</hi> did unto his Mother <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 19. The King <hi>roſe up to meet her, and bowed himſelf unto her, and ſate down on his Throne, and cauſed a ſeat to be ſet for the Kings Mother, and ſhe ſate on his Right-hand.</hi> Nor hath the <hi>Royall Pſalmiſt</hi> any better place for the Spouſe, whoſe <hi>Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> he ſought to emblazon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 9. <hi>Kings daughters were among thine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable women, upon thy Right-hand did ſtand the Queen in a veſture of gold of Ophir.</hi> To have the power of ſuperiours on the <hi>Right-hand,</hi> or for the enemy to have the <hi>Right-hand,</hi> is, in Sacred Heraldrie a ſign of victory or pre-eminence, whether in Civil or Warlike proceedings. The greateſt plague, and root of curſes, which <hi>David</hi> did wiſh unto the enemies of his God, and which did afterwards fall on <hi>Judas</hi> the greateſt enemy of <hi>Davids Son and Lord,</hi> was, that <hi>the wicked might be ſet over him,</hi> and that <hi>the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary might ſtand at his Right-hand,</hi> for ſo he knew that he ſhould be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, when he was judged,</hi> and that <hi>his prayers ſhould be turned into ſin,</hi> Pſal. 109. 6, 7. The ſureſt Anchor of <hi>Davids</hi> Confidence, was, Gods being <hi>on his Right-hand,</hi> Pſal. 16. 8. <hi>The Lord is at my Right-hand, therefore I ſhall not</hi> ſlide, or <hi>fall.</hi> And the final Conſummation of all the happineſſe which he hoped for, whether in his own perſon, or in the perſon of <hi>his expected Son, the Meſſias,</hi> was, to be placed at the <hi>Right-hand</hi> of God. <hi>In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is fulneſſe of joy, and at thy Right-hand there are Pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Pſal. 16. 11.

So then, <hi>This Article of Chriſts ſitting at the Right-hand of God,</hi> is as <hi>A Trophie of his Victory</hi> gotten over death, and over all the temptations of the World, and the divel, whileſt he lived on earth; and a certain <hi>Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick of his final Triumph</hi> over all his ſucceeding enemies: for he muſt <hi>ſit at the Right-hand of God, until all his enemies be made his foot-ſtool.</hi> But, before we come to decypher the <hi>Real Dignity</hi> here deſcribed, it may be queſtioned, whether the <hi>Deſcription</hi> it ſelf be meerly <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> or <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical;</hi> that is, a language borrowed from the viſible cuſtomes of men

               <p n="3">3. But when it is ſaid that <hi>Chriſt ſitteth at the Right-hand of God,</hi> this muſt be underſtood of God the <hi>Father,</hi> not of God <hi>the Son,</hi> for ſo it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> that <hi>The Son of God, who was Crucified, dead, and buried, and who roſe the third day from the dead, now ſits at the Right-hand of God the Father Almightie.</hi> Now if God the Father have no bodie, no <hi>Right-hand,</hi> or <hi>Left-hand,</hi> as God the Son hath; the caſe ſeems clear, that <hi>Chriſts ſitting at the right-hand of the Father</hi> muſt needs be <hi>a ſpeech meerly Metaphorical,</hi> borrowed from the cuſtom of earthly Princes, to be placed at whoſe <hi>Right hand</hi> is the greateſt honour that can be to their chief Peers or Subjects. This is moſt certain, if we ſpeak of the Nature or Eſſence of the <hi>God head,</hi> or of the Divine Perſon of the Father. Yet all this hinders not, why the Divine Majeſty, or Perſon of the <hi>Father,</hi> who is every where Eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent, may not be more Conſpicuouſly preſent (in reſpect of created ſights) in ſome <hi>viſible heavenly Throne,</hi> then in any other place.

though more admirable, then the Church militant hath had here on earth?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not then altogether ſo clear that this Title, of <hi>Christs Sitting at the right hand of God the Father,</hi> is borrowed from the Rites or cuſtomes of the Kings of <hi>Judah;</hi> as it is queſtionable, whether this Rite or cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them were not framed after the Patern of the heavenly Thrones or repreſentations of coeleſtial dignities; ſo we know the earthly Sanctuarie was framed according to the patern of the heavenly Sanctuarie. <hi>Our Fathers had the tabernacle of witneſs in the wilderneſs, as he appointed, ſpeaking unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that he ſhould make it according to the faſhion that he had ſeen, Act.</hi> 7. 44. Ex. 25. 40. And our Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>Thoſe ſerved unto the patern or ſhadow of heavenly things, as Moſes was warned by God, when he was about to finiſh the tabernacle. See (ſaith he) that thou make all things according to the patern ſhewed to thee in the mount.</hi> But it may be the patern ſhewed to him in the Mount, was but a <hi>Shew,</hi> or Mathematical Draught of the material <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> which he was to erect; and yet is ſtiled an <hi>heavenly patern,</hi> or heavenly thing, becauſe it was repreſented from heaven by God himſelf; yet ſo repreſented without any real Tabernacle anſwerable to it in heaven. I could ſubſcribe to this interpretation, if the <hi>Apoſtles Inference, Heb.</hi> 9. 23, 24. did not prove or preſuppoſe ſomething more. <hi>It was then neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the ſimilitude of heavenly things ſhould be purified with ſuch things, but the heavenly things themſelves (are purified) with better ſacrifices then theſe; for Chriſt is not entred into the holie places made with hands, which are ſimilitudes of the true Sanctuarie, but is entred into very heaven, to appear now in the ſight of God for us.</hi> But hath he the whole heavens for his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? or is there as real a Diſtinction of places, or Manſions in the heavens, as there was of <hi>Courts</hi> or <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> in the material, or in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple? <hi>We have ſuch an high Prieſt</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) as ſitteth at the right hand of</hi>

                  </gap>, in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places. Some Diſtinction, between the Throne of Majeſtie, and Chriſts humanitie, was apprehended ſurely by Saint <hi>Steven,</hi> Act. 7. 55. <hi>He being full of the Holy-Ghoſt, looked ſtedfaſtly into heaven, and ſaw the Glory of God, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God:</hi> the Object of his ſight was ſurely Real, not a meer viſion in the air, for <hi>he ſaw the heavens open,</hi> and by their opening found opportunity to prie with bodily eyes (but bodily eyes extraordinarily enlightned by the Spirit of God) into heaven it ſelf, and to take a view of the land of Promiſe, and the <hi>Sanctuary pitched</hi> in it. The Divine Eſſence, or Perſon of God the Father, he could not ſee; and yet <hi>he ſaw the Glorie of God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt at the Right-hand of this Glorie.</hi> But he ſaw Chriſt <hi>Standing,</hi> and not <hi>Sitting,</hi> as here it is ſaid. All is one, It is the height of <hi>Chriſts Exaltation,</hi> that <hi>He</hi> hath the pre-eminence to <hi>Sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne</hi> in the immediate preſence of <hi>God the Fathers Glorious Throne.</hi> But this prerogative of <hi>Sitting</hi> upon his Throne, doth not tye him to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Reſidence,</hi> that he may not <hi>Stand</hi> when it pleaſeth him; and it ſeems it was at this time this great <hi>Judge</hi> his pleaſure to <hi>Stand,</hi> as a <hi>Spectator</hi> of his bleſſed Martyrs Combat, and for the preſent, as a <hi>Witneſs</hi> againſt theſe <hi>his</hi> malicious Enemies, which afterward were to be made <hi>his</hi> Foot-ſtool. Now was that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 19. verified, <hi>He hath looked down from the height of his Sanctuarie, out of the heaven did the Lord behold the earth.</hi>

5. But if <hi>Chriſt</hi> have a <hi>Viſible Throne</hi> or Sanctuarie in heaven, how is it true, which Saint <hi>Steven</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 48, 49. <hi>The moſt high dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, as ſaith the Prophet: Heaven is my throne, and earth is my foot-ſtool, what houſe will ye build for me, ſaith the Lord? or what place is it that I ſhall reſt in? hath not my hand made all theſe things?</hi> And if God dwell not in any Sanctuary which he hath made, how can he have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Viſible Sanctuary</hi> in heaven? For even the heaven of heavens, every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether viſible or inviſible, are the works of Gods hands. To this, the <hi>Anſwer</hi> is eaſie, when the Prophet ſaith, <hi>God dwelleth not in Temples made with hands,</hi> he excludeth only <hi>the works of mens hands,</hi> not all created <note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Places appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate.</note> Thrones or Sanctuaries made immediately by God himſelf. For, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Chriſt is a Miniſter of the Sanctuary, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man.</hi> And, Hebr. 9. 11. <hi>Chriſt, being come a high Prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands; that is, not of this building</hi> &amp;c. Thus much of the <hi>Grammatical,</hi> or <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> meaning of theſe words. As for this Opinion of <hi>Diſtinction of Thrones in heaven,</hi> as I dare not boldly avouch it, ſo I am afraid peremptorily to deny it.

However, <hi>The Point</hi> which all of us are bound abſolutely to Believe, is, <hi>That this Article, of Chriſts ſitting at the Right-Hand of God,</hi> doth contain the height of His Exaltation, <hi>far above all princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come,</hi> Eph. 1. 20. <gap reason="foreign">

And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Order of <hi>miniſtring Angels;</hi> whereas our Apoſtles ſpeech is general, that <hi>All the Angels</hi> (and under this univerſalitie he comprehends even the moſt noble Order of heavenly creatures) <hi>are miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth for our good.</hi> If they, which are ſaid in Scripture to <hi>ſtand before God,</hi> be either <hi>Angels</hi> or created ſubſtances inferiour to <hi>the Son of God,</hi> they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, at leaſt by courſes, <hi>miniſtrantes,</hi> miniſtring ſpirits. So that to <hi>ſtand before God,</hi> or to <hi>miniſter for our good,</hi> is no true note of any <hi>Diſtinction of Order</hi> betwixt Angels, but only of the viciſſititude of their ſervice. They, which are to be <hi>ſent forth, ſtand in the preſence of God</hi> to receive their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and at their return, <hi>ſtand</hi> before God to deliver the effect or iſſue of <note place="margin">Job 1. 6.</note> their Embaſſage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But as diverſe writers in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> not balancing other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture with <hi>this Place</hi> of our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> laſt cited, have fram'd a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of Orders amongſt the Angels: So ſome others, oppoſite enough to them, offend no leſſe by weighing this place alone. For ſo far hath the miſapprehended Doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and <hi>Certaintie</hi> of their own Eſtate in Salvation, miſſwaded ſome, as they have not been affraid to affirm, That <hi>the Angels are in ſome ſort inferiour to themſelves,</hi> becauſe <hi>They miniſter to them</hi> as they are <hi>Heires of Salvation. Miniſters</hi> they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, yet not to us, but to God or Chriſt, though for our good; So is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1</note>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The next <hi>Point</hi> to be examined is, the <hi>Extent of this our High Priests Exaltation;</hi> about the Bounds or limits whereof, the Controverſies are more then any difficulties in the Rule of Faith do miniſter; (but not ſo many as men of raſh or audacious underſtandings make;) and the moſt of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with greater vehemencie of contention, then the ſpirit of ſobrietie, which ſhould be in every good Chriſtian, will approve. The <hi>Questions</hi> of more profitable Uſe, are generally <hi>Two;</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> concerns the <hi>Logical Subject of Chriſts Exaltation</hi> comprehended in this Title, of <hi>Sitting at the Right-hand of God,</hi> and the like: And the Iſſue is this, <hi>Whether Christ be exalted only as he is the Son of David, or as he is the Son of God?</hi> or <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both his natures, as well Divine, as humane?</hi> The <hi>ſecond Quaerie</hi> is, about the <hi>Extent or Limits of the Exaltation of his humane Nature.</hi> The <hi>one Queſtion,</hi> as Logicians ſpeak, is about the <hi>Extent</hi> or limit of the <hi>Subject;</hi> The <hi>other</hi> about the <hi>Extent</hi> or limit of the <hi>Attribute.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted</hi> according to his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> or as he was the <hi>Son of David,</hi> all Chriſtians agree. But that he ſhould be exalted as <hi>God,</hi> or according to his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which is abſolutely Infinite, may well ſeem <hi>impoſſible</hi> for <note place="margin">Chriſt was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted according to both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> the <hi>matter,</hi> and for the <hi>Phraſe</hi> very <hi>harſh.</hi> Howbeit, this is avouched by many Orthodoxal and worthy Divines. And if <hi>Christ</hi> be, as moſt Proteſtants avouch, <hi>our Mediator, Secundum utr amque naturam,</hi> according to <hi>Both Natures,</hi> why may he not be ſaid to be <hi>Exalted</hi> according to <hi>Both Natures?</hi> Yet a Difference there is, which will disjoynt this Conſequence; For to be a <hi>Mediator</hi> betwixt two, doth not neceſſarily include any <hi>Defect</hi>
                  <pb n="3314" facs="tcp:32220:15"/>
or inequalitie in the partie mediating, in reſpect of the parties between whom he is a <hi>Mediator.</hi> Whereas to be <hi>Exalted</hi> doth neceſſarily include, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe, ſome <hi>Lower degree,</hi> from which he is <hi>Exalted to an higher.</hi> And if <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> be alwayes equal to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he was, and is, and ſhall be <hi>Abſolutely Infinite.</hi> And <hi>Abſolute Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> cannot admit of any Degrees, ſpecially of <hi>Exaltation.</hi> This neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily argues, that <hi>Chriſts Divine Nature</hi> could, in it ſelf, receive no Degree of Diminution, or <hi>Exaltation.</hi> If then according to his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> he was <hi>exalted,</hi> this <hi>Exaltation</hi> was not by any Real Addition of Dignitie to his <hi>Nature,</hi> but only <hi>quoad nos,</hi> in reſpect of us. And it is (perhaps) <hi>one thing</hi> to ſay, that Chriſt was <hi>Exalted according to his Divine Nature; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to ſay, That Chriſt was <hi>Exalted as he was the Son of God.</hi> However, thus much we are bound to believe, and thus much we may ſafely ſay, That <hi>Chriſt as God, was exalted</hi> in the ſame Senſe and manner, that he was <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as God.</hi> Now, that the Son of God, who was as truly God, as God the Father; truly equal to God the Father, did truly <hi>humble himſelf unto death, even to the death of the Croſs;</hi> was in the firſt Chapter of our Eighth Book, deduced out of the <hi>ſecond to the Philippians.</hi> Nor did he humble himſelf only according to his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> for <hi>he humbled himſelf,</hi> not only by his life and death here on earth, but <hi>by taking the Humane Nature,</hi> in which he was humbled. The <hi>Humane Nature</hi> could not be humbled by being united to his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> but rather <hi>Exalted.</hi> So that the firſt and <hi>Prime Subject</hi> of his humiliation was, if not his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> yet his <hi>Divine Perſon.</hi> The Perſon of the Son of God was humbled by his <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> or <hi>Conception,</hi> by his <hi>Birth,</hi> by his <hi>Life,</hi> by his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Paſſion.</hi> And for every degree of his humiliation, there is a correſpondent degree of his <hi>Exaltation,</hi> by his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> by his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> into heaven, and by his <hi>Sitting at the Right-hand of God the Father.</hi> In what Senſe our Apoſtle ſaith, He was <hi>humbled</hi> according to his <hi>Divine Perſon,</hi> hath been diſcuſſed at large before. The ſum was this; If he, that <hi>thought it no robberie to be equal with God,</hi> had been at any time pleaſed to have aſſumed a body or created ſubſtance into the unitie of his Infinite Perſon, ſuch Glorie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was unto that his bodie or created ſubſtance due, as exceeds the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and honour of all other bodies, or created ſubſtances, infinitely more then any creature can poſſibly exceed another. And yet we know that the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who was from Eternitie equal to his Father, did <hi>in the Fulneſſe of Time</hi> aſſume into the unitie of his Divine Perſon, a Bodie and Soul ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to all the infirmites (ſin only excepted) that humane nature is capable of: And by aſſuming ſuch a bodie, and by expoſing it to all the miſeries of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, <hi>the Son of God</hi> was truly ſaid to be <hi>humbled:</hi> and the Degrees of his <hi>humiliation</hi> were as many and large, as are the Degrees by which his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal glorified Bodie doth exceed his mortal Bodie; as many and large, as are the Degrees of Honour, and Excellencie betwixt that <hi>Royal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> which now he exerciſeth; and the <hi>Form of a Servant</hi> wherein he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. So that not only the <hi>Humane Nature of the Son of God,</hi> but the <hi>Son of God in his Humane Nature, is truly exalted</hi> according to all the Degrees of his former Humiliation. But is this all that we are bound to believe, or may ſafely acknowledge concerning the <hi>Exaltation</hi> of Chriſt, both as he was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and as he was the <hi>Son of David?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If this were all, then his <hi>Exaltation</hi> as the <hi>Son of God</hi> ſhould meerly conſiſt, in the Abdication or putting off the <hi>Form of a Servant.</hi> It could not include, or preſuppoſe, any poſitive Ground of any new and Real At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
<pb n="3315" facs="tcp:32220:15"/>
but only a Relation to his former humiliation. Some good Divines (as well Ancient as modern) ſuppoſe, that albeit man had never ſinned, yet ſhould the <hi>Son of God</hi> have been incarnate; that is, have taken our nature upon him; yet our nature not humbled or obnoxious to death, but alwaies clothed with glorie and immortalitie. For Illuſtration or <hi>Example</hi> ſake; Suppoſe the <hi>Son of God</hi> had taken an humane bodie altogether as glorious as now it is, from the very firſt moment of its aſſumption into the unitie of his Divine Glorious Perſon; Could the aſſumption of ſuch a bodie, how glorious ſoever, or how perpetual ſoever its glorie had been, have added a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny leaſt degree of <hi>Exaltation</hi> unto the <hi>Son of God?</hi> It could not. There had been indeed an <hi>Exaltation</hi> of the bodie ſo aſſumed, but none of the Nature or Perſon aſſuming it. How then is the <hi>Son of God</hi> ſaid now to be <hi>Exalted,</hi> by his bodily Aſcenſion into Heaven, or by his <hi>Sitting at the Right-hand of the Father</hi> in our Nature, wherein he was formerly humbled? Take the <hi>Reſolution</hi> plainely thus. God the Father had remained as glorious as now he is, although he had never <hi>created</hi> the world. For the <hi>creation</hi> gave much even all they had, to things created; it gave nothing unto God, who was in <hi>Being</hi> infinite; yet if God had created nothing, the <hi>Attribute</hi> of <hi>Creator</hi> could have had no real Ground, it had been no real <hi>Attribute.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Suppoſe the <hi>Son of God</hi> had never condeſcended to take our nature upon him, he had remained as Glorious in his Nature and Perſon, as now he is; yet not glorified for, or by, this Title or <hi>Attribute</hi> of <hi>Incarnation.</hi> Or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he had not <hi>humbled himſelf unto death</hi> by taking the <hi>Form of a Servant</hi> upon him; he had remained as glorious in his Nature and Perſon, and in the Attribute of <hi>Incarnation,</hi> as now he is: but without theſe glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of being <hi>our Lord and Redeemer,</hi> and of being the <hi>Fountain of Grace and Salvation</hi> unto us. All theſe are <hi>Real Attributes,</hi> and ſuppoſe a <hi>Real Ground</hi> or foundation; and that was, <hi>his humbling himſelf unto death, even unto the death of the Croſs.</hi> Nor are theſe Attributes only Real, but more Glorious, both in reſpect of God the Father, who was pleaſed to give his Only Son for us; and in reſpect of God the Son, who was pleaſed to pay our ranſome by his humiliation, then the Attribute of Creation is. <hi>The Son of God then, not the Son of David only, hath been Exalted ſince his death, to be our Lord, by a new and Real Title, by the Title of Redemption and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> This is the Sum of our Apoſtles Inference concerning our Saviours <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,</hi> Phil. 2. 11. <hi>That every tongue ſhould confeſſe that Jeſus Chriſt is The Lord unto the Glorie of God the Father.</hi> To ſhut up this Point; Though <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> be both our <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> and Lord, not only as he is the <hi>Son of David,</hi> but as he is the only begotten <hi>Son of God,</hi> and ſo begotten from all Eternitie: yet was he neither <hi>begotten a Prieſt</hi> nor <hi>Lord</hi> from all Eternitie, but <hi>made a Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>made a Lord</hi> in time. <hi>The Word of the Oath,</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 28.) <hi>which was ſince the Law, maketh the Son a Prieſt, who was conſecrated for evermore.</hi> And in the very ſame Charter, wherein this <hi>Word of the Oath,</hi> or uncontrollable <hi>Fiat,</hi> for making the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> an <hi>Everlaſting Prieſt,</hi> is contained; this <hi>Peculiar Title of Lord is firſt inferred:</hi> For ſo that 110<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalm begins: <hi>Jehovah ſaid to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, untill I make thine Enemies thy foot-ſtool.</hi> Not that <hi>Adonai</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth leſſe Honour or Majeſtie then <hi>Jehovah</hi> doth; as the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ignorantly and impiouſly collect; but with purpoſe to notifie, that this Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Adonai,</hi> was to become as peculiar to <hi>Jehovah the Son of God,</hi> as the Title of <hi>Cohen</hi> or <hi>Prieſt.</hi> But this Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> as peculiar to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> will require, and doth well deſerve, a peculiar diſcourſe; and

Or in caſe any poor dejected ſoul ſhould be ſurprized with diſtruſt or jealouſie leſt his Lord, in ſuch infinite height of <hi>Exaltation</hi> and diſtance, ſhould not from heaven take notice of him thrown down to earth; let him, to his comfort conſider; That the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Glorie</hi> (to the end he might aſſure us, that he was not a <hi>Lord</hi> more <hi>Great</hi> in himſelf, then <hi>Gracious</hi> and loving unto us) was pleaſed for a long time to become a <hi>Servant,</hi> before he would be made a <hi>Lord;</hi> and a Servant ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to multitudes of publick deſpights, diſgraces, and contempts; from which ordinarie ſervants, or men of forlorn hopes are freed. If he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly became <hi>ſuch a Servant</hi> for thee, to whom he owed nothing, wilt not thou reſolve to make a vertue of neceſſitie, by patient bearing thy meanneſſe or misfortunes for his ſake, to whom even Kings owe themſelves, their Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all their worldly glorie? But though it be a contemplation full of comfort to have him for our Supreme Lord and Protector, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was a Servant cruelly oppreſſed by the greateſt Powers on earth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any power of man to defend or protect him; yet the ſweet ſtreams of joy and comfort, flow more plentifully to all ſorts and conditions of men from the <hi>Attribute of his Royal Prieſthood.</hi> To be a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> implies as much as to be a <hi>Mediator</hi> or <hi>Interceſſor</hi> for averting Gods wrath, or an Advocate for procuring his Favours and bleſſings. * And what could Comfort her ſelf, wiſh more for her children (ſuppoſe ſhe had been our mother) then to <note place="margin">See 8.

<pb n="3317" facs="tcp:32220:16"/>
the end that being <hi>thus conſecrated</hi> he <hi>might become a merciful and faithful High-Prieſt;</hi> a Prieſt not only able to ſanctifie our afflictions to us, but to conſecrate and annoint us through patient ſuffering of afflictions, to be <hi>more then Conquerors,</hi> even <hi>Kings and Prieſts to our God.</hi> So he ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to ſit with me in my throne, even as I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and ſit with my Father in his throne.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> remarkable Speech of our Apoſtle is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Albeit he were The Son, yet he learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered.</hi> Being <hi>infinite</hi> in knowledge <hi>as he was God,</hi> and of moſt <hi>perfect</hi> knowledge <hi>as he was man,</hi> he could learn nothing by converſing here on earth with men, but only <hi>Experience</hi> of Godly grief and ſorrows for our follies and impieties. Such ſorrows were the proper fruits of our Sins: we brought them forth, and he did taſt the bitterneſſe of them. <hi>This then is our Comfort, That whatſoever he could learn on earth, he cannot poſſibly forget in heaven;</hi> we have, and ever ſhall have him, whileſt he is in heaven and we on earth, <hi>An High-Prieſt, which will be touched with compaſſion of our miſeries.</hi> The End of his coming down from heaven, and his inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture in the <hi>Form of a Servant,</hi> was, that he might be <hi>Conſecrated through af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> here on earth, to be a <hi>merciful and faithful High-Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and man.</hi> And this Conſecration, which was the End of his coming down, being accompliſhed; the End of his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and of his <hi>Sitting at the Right-hand of God</hi> in our nature, was, that he might make <hi>Interceſſion</hi> for us, out of the freſh, and never failing memorie and <hi>Experience</hi> of his own former grief and ſorrows for our ſins. And what good thing is it then, which he will not ask of his Father for us? And what is it, that our heavenly Father for his ſake will not give us? Nothing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth, if we aske it in Faith, and as we ought.</p>

But without diligent examination it was eaſie for others to miſtake their <hi>meaning,</hi> when as <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> a man otherwiſe as moderate as Learned, did lay thoſe opinions to the <hi>Lutherans</hi> charge; which, as his dear Friend <hi>Bucer</hi> (who tendred his ſeven years ſervice for making a friendly Comprimiſe in this Controverſie) ſeriouſly proteſts, he never could perceive that any <hi>Lutheran</hi> Miniſter did maintain. Nor did he write otherwiſe to <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> then out of diligent Examination of their own writings, and as in his own Conſcience he was perſwaded: for he thus ſubſcribes another Letter of the ſame Purport, ſent to the <hi>Italian</hi> Churches: <hi>Ita ſentio, &amp; in hac ſententia opto venire ad tribunal Domini.</hi> The ancient <hi>Lutherans,</hi> it ſeems, affected a language of their own, or a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to expreſſe their meditations concerning the Dignitie or <hi>Exaltation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Humane Nature</hi> after another manner, then the <hi>Ancients</hi> had done, or many Modern Writers could well brook. And this Libertie being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed them; eſpecially by the Churches of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> they ſought in the iſſue, to draw or <hi>tenter</hi> their matter to that frame of ſpeech, which they had not ſo warily conceived; And ſo at length, <hi>the factious induſtrie of ſome German Court-Divines did hatch a Theological endleſſe quarrel, out of a Verbal and Grammatical Controverſie.</hi> It fell out ſo in the oppoſition of theſe <hi>German Princes</hi> and their <hi>Courts,</hi> as it doth between the Factions of rank <hi>good-Fellows</hi> and nice <hi>Preciſians</hi> in <hi>Colledges</hi> or Corporations: The one ſort alwayes provoking the other to be more <hi>Prophane;</hi> and then taking occaſion by the increaſe of their prophaneneſſe to be more irregularly <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</hi> Both parties being by their daily Bandyings far worſe, then being ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred they would have been: Whileſt in the mean time <hi>true Religion, and ſober Devotion ſuffers on both hands</hi> betwixt them.

                  <pb n="3319" facs="tcp:32220:17"/>
the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches took occaſion to grant a leſſe meaſure of Dignitie then was fitting; and the leſſe <hi>They</hi> granted, the more the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the advancement of his <hi>Humanitie,</hi> or the miraculous manner of his <hi>Bodily Preſence in the Sacrament;</hi> as if they had thought themſelves bound in conſcience to make a Super-allowance for the others Arrears or detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they at leaſt conceiv'd.

               <p>To add any <hi>Excellencie</hi> to Chriſts <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> by derogating from his <hi>Humanitie,</hi> we cannot: for being Infinite, <hi>It</hi> cannot admit of any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And to derogate any thing from his <hi>Humanitie,</hi> whereof it is, or (for ought we know) may be Capable, from <hi>That Special Union,</hi> which it hath with the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> we dare not. For this were to derogate from, or deny the <hi>Power of God.</hi> But doth he derogate any thing from Chriſts <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> that denyes it to be <hi>Infinitely Exalted? It may be he doth,</hi> that doth deny the <hi>Exaltation</hi> of his <hi>Humane Nature</hi> (ſince his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> and <hi>Sitting at the Right-hand of God the Father)</hi> to be in <hi>Any ſort Infinite.</hi> The diverſe acceptions of <hi>Infinitie,</hi> or diverſe branches of <hi>it,</hi> to mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, are almoſt infinite; more by many, then are fit to be diſplayed or mentioned in this place. It ſhall therefore ſuffice, <hi>Firſt,</hi> to ſhew, <hi>In what Senſe we muſt denie Chriſts Humane Nature, to be infinitely Exalted:</hi> And this muſt quaſh the Laviſh <hi>Hyperboles</hi> of ſome modern <hi>Lutherans.</hi> Secondly, <hi>In what Senſe Chriſts Humane Nature may be ſaid to be, or at leaſt may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to be infinitely Exalted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſts Bodie</hi> may be conceived to be <hi>Abſolutely Infinite,</hi> or to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually Infinite only, but not abſolutely;</hi> or to be <hi>Potentially Infinite only.</hi> To be <hi>Abſolutely Infinite, or to be Infinite Simply in Being, is proper to God, who is Very Being it ſelf:</hi> and as he hath no Cauſe of <hi>Being,</hi> ſo he can have no limits or bounds of <hi>Being,</hi> either for number of ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Being,</hi> or for degrees of ſeveral Perfections. What kind of Perfection ſoever we can conceive to be in any created Subſtance, that we muſt acknowledge to be Infinitely greater in him. Again, we may conceive an <hi>Actual Infinitie of Being</hi> only in <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two Kinds;</hi> as in reſpect of <hi>Place,</hi> of <hi>Strength or Power.</hi> And though God be not <hi>Infinite</hi> only in reſpect of theſe <hi>Two Branches</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> yet he <hi>Only</hi> is <hi>Actually Infinite</hi> according to theſe <hi>Two Branches</hi> of <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi> The One we call his <hi>Immenſitie,</hi> the other his <hi>Omnipotencie.</hi> No created ſubſtance can actually be every where at once. No creature can be Omnipotent, or actually Infinite in ſtrength; for ſo it ſhould be as ſtrong as God, though not ſo wiſe or eternal as God. Now upon theſe <hi>Two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Divine Infinitie,</hi> that is, upon his <hi>Immenſitie</hi> and <hi>Omnipotencie,</hi> the modern <hi>Lutherans</hi> make the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of Chriſt, to incroach as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Participant, or equal ſharer with the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> or Bleſſed Trinitie, if we may judge of their <hi>meaning</hi> by their <hi>words,</hi> or of their intended <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,</hi> by their <hi>Premiſſes</hi> expreſly avouched, and ſtiffly maintained. After their Doctrine of Chriſts <hi>Real preſence in the Sacrament</hi> by <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> began to be impugned and ſhaken, the later <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſought to ſupport it by <hi>A new Buttereſſe</hi> or pillar, which the Ancienter did not rely upon in this Argument, and that was the <hi>Ubiquitie</hi> of Chriſts Bodie, or Humane Nature. Indeed if Chriſts Bodie were <hi>every-where</hi> preſent, it ſhould be <hi>Conſubſtantially preſent in the Sacrament;</hi> But ſo it ſhould be preſent in many other places, where <note place="margin">Chriſts Bodie is not every where.</note> none of the Ancients did ever imagine it to be, where no good Chriſtian is bound to ſeek it.</p>

5. But to hunt out their <hi>Meaning,</hi> at leaſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> concerning which, their <hi>Meaning</hi> I hope is better then their <hi>Expreſſion;</hi> When they ſay, <hi>Chriſts Glorified Bodie is Every-where,</hi> they grant it to be in <hi>Heaven.</hi> They ſhould then in the <hi>Firſt place</hi> tell us, whether, in heaven, it be not as viſible and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to Angels and Saints, as it ſhall be to all men at his coming to Judgement? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether this Viſibilitie of it, doth not include a viſible or comprehenſible <hi>Diſtinction of parts</hi> in it, as of his Head from his Feet, or his Right-hand from his Left. This I preſume they will not deny; for Chriſt ſhall only viſibly change the place of his Reſidence, not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, form, or faſhion of his Bodie, when <hi>he ſhall come from the Right-hand of God, to Judge the quick and the dead.</hi> This being granted, when they ſay, <hi>Chriſts Bodie is every where,</hi> they ſhould in <hi>the Third place</hi> tell us, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Every-where</hi> according to this <hi>Diſtinction of Parts</hi> or no. <hi>Si di Chriſti,</hi> If that of Chriſt, which they hold (as ſomewhat of Chriſt beſides his Divine Nature, they hold) to be <hi>Every where,</hi> have <hi>no Diſtinction of parts:</hi> Let them call it what they liſt, it is not in any Language (beſides their own, and the Modern <hi>Romiſh</hi> Churches) a <hi>Bodie;</hi> as having no Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perties of a Bodie. If they will be content to deny all <hi>Diſtinction of parts</hi> in <hi>That of Chriſt,</hi> which they make to be the Subiect of this <hi>Ubiquitarie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> we ſhall be content to take this their Real denyal, for an approach to a <hi>Comprimiſe,</hi> or agreement. If they will call that <hi>A Bodie,</hi> which we would call <hi>A Spiritual Influence,</hi> or a <hi>Virtual preſence,</hi> (ſo we may know what they really mean by this Word <hi>Bodie,)</hi> let them enjoy their Dialect. If they admit a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of Parts in that, which they call <hi>Chriſts Bodie,</hi> and which they make the Subject of this <hi>Ubiquitarie preſence,</hi> they ſhould tell us, whether it be <hi>Every where preſent according to every part?</hi> or whether it be <hi>Every where preſent according to all its parts reſpectively?</hi> As whether the Hands of Chriſt be <hi>Every where,</hi> his Heart <hi>Every where,</hi> his Head <hi>Every where?</hi> or whether there be no place in the world wherein ſome Part of Chriſts Bodie or Humane Nature is not; yet ſo, that they will have his Head to be in <hi>one</hi> part, his Feet in <hi>another,</hi> his Right-hand in a <hi>third,</hi> and his Left-hand in a <hi>fourth</hi> place or dimenſion of this viſible world. If they ſay, <hi>Chriſts bodie is, in this Latter ſort, preſent Every where,</hi> they make him a Gyant, not ſuch a Man as we conceive him to be; they do not <hi>Exalt,</hi> but rather <hi>Extend</hi> him according to his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> the intire frame of whoſe bodie no man ſhall ſee, no not at the day of Judgement; and yet (by this Tenent) according to ſome parts of his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> he ſhall be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantially preſent with the Damned in hell. If they ſay that <hi>Chriſts whole bodie is intirely Every where,</hi> or <hi>every part of it Every where,</hi> then either he hath no Right-hand, or his Right-hand is in his Left; either he hath no Humane Bodie, or elſe his whole Bodie is in his Little Finger. But to be after this manner intirely <hi>Every where,</hi> is Proper only unto God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It may be we ſhall hit their Meaning better by tracing their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps.

                  <hi>Chriſt according to his Humane Nature ſitteth every where;</hi> and if his Sear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Humane Nature be <hi>every where,</hi> his Humane Nature is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>every where,</hi> for Seſſion or Reſidence, according to his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, includeth his Preſence according to his Humane Nature. <hi>Firſt,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the <hi>Major [The Right-hand of God is every where]</hi> were abſolutely true, according to the literal meaning of this <hi>Article,</hi> they ſtand bound by
<pb n="3321" facs="tcp:32220:18"/>
the Rules of Logick to rectifie the <hi>Minor,</hi> and make it thus; <hi>[But Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Humane Nature is the Right-hand of God]</hi> And if Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Humane Nature be the Right-hand of God, then if the Right-hand of God be <hi>every where,</hi> it would directly and <hi>perpendicularly</hi> follow, that Chriſt is <hi>every where</hi> according to his Humane Nature. But, this <hi>(i. e.</hi> the words of the minor) they will not ſay; Now the <hi>minor</hi> not being thus rectified, the <hi>Concluſion</hi> muſt be corrected, and, in ſtead of ſaying <hi>[Chriſts Humanitie is every where,]</hi> it muſt be taught to ſay, <hi>[That Chriſts Humanitie, or Christ according to his Humane Nature, Sitteth at that, or by that, which is every where.] Secondly,</hi> If we take that <hi>Definition,</hi> which ſome good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines make of <hi>Chriſt's Sitting at the Right-hand of God the Father,</hi> that is <hi>[to be a perſon equal to the Father, by whom the Father doth immediately rule the world, but the Church eſpecially;]</hi> the Inference will be a <hi>Fallacie à rebus ad voces.</hi> The <hi>Connexion</hi> between the <hi>Terms,</hi> howſoever placed, will be no better, then if a man ſhould naile a piece of ſolid timber at the one end to the Aire, and at the other end to the Water. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If by the <hi>Right-hand of God</hi> in this place be Literally meant, <hi>A viſible or comprehenſible Throne, wherein the God head is after the like</hi> (but a far more glorious) <hi>manner conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly preſent,</hi> as <hi>it was in the Ark of the Covenant here on earth:</hi> then the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor propoſition,</hi> on which the whole ſtructure of Chriſts <hi>Ubiquitie</hi> according to his Manhood depends, will be a great deal too narrow; for, the <hi>Right-hand of God the Father Almighty,</hi> taken in this Senſe, is not <hi>every where.</hi> That <hi>Glorie of God</hi> at whoſe <hi>Right-hand</hi> Saint <hi>Steven</hi> ſaw <hi>Christ ſtanding,</hi> was not on earth, but in heaven; nor in every place of heaven, but in that place only, where <hi>he ſaw the heavens to open, and on which he fixed his eyes.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. But they further add, <hi>That Chriſts Humane Nature is glorified with that Glorie, which he had with the Father before the world was made.</hi> Now <note place="margin">A <hi>Lutheran</hi> Objection, that proves, <hi>aut ni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hil, aut nimium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For his <hi>Divine Perſon</hi> was glorified by the glorification of his <hi>Humane Nature;</hi> that is, The world ſhould not have known the Glorie of the Son of God, or of him as their <hi>Lord and Redeemer,</hi> unleſſe this <hi>Glorie</hi> had appeared in his Man-hood or <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> Now if the <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> were glorified with <hi>that Glorie, which was before the world,</hi> it was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with an <hi>uncreated Glorie:</hi> And <hi>uncreated Glorie, is Abſolutely Infinite.</hi> If this <hi>conſequence</hi> were ſound, the <hi>Firſt Branch</hi> of it would be <hi>This,</hi> That <hi>Chriſts Humane Nature was glorified with Infinite glorie before the foundation of the world;</hi> and ſo the <hi>concluſion</hi> ſhould contradict the <hi>Article of Chriſts Incarnation in time,</hi> as alſo the whole courſe of his Humiliation here on earth. The ſame Arguments which they bring to prove the <hi>Glorie</hi> of his <hi>Humane Nature</hi> to be <hi>Infinite</hi> in reſpect of <hi>place</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> will prove his <hi>Humane Nature</hi> to have been <hi>Infinite</hi> and glorious in reſpect of its <hi>Duration;</hi> or <hi>Chriſt as man</hi> to be Co-eternal with God the Father, or elſe they prove juſt nothing at all. That <hi>Real communication of the Divine Attributes,</hi> which they ſo eagerly contend for, is but a dream or Fancie, which could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="3322" facs="tcp:32220:19"/>
have come into their brains, but either for want of Logick, or of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. The root of their Error is, that they diſtinguiſh not between the <hi>uncreated Glorie,</hi> (which is the Incomprehenſible Fountain, by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation whereof Chriſts Humane Nature is immediately Glorified) and the <hi>Participation</hi> or Communication of it. The <hi>Glorie of the God-head,</hi> which dwelleth <hi>Bodily in Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>Infinite.</hi> But it is not Communicated to <hi>Chriſts Humane Nature</hi> according to its <hi>infinitie;</hi> The Communication of it, or the Glorie communicated is Created, and therefore finite. The Sun truly and Really Communicates his light unto the Moon, and we properly ſay, That the Moon is enlightned or made glorious by the light of the Sun; yet will it not hence follow, That the Light Communicated or imparted to the Moon, is equal to the light of the Sun, which doth communicate it or impart it: Much leſſe will it follow, that the Glorie wherewith <hi>Chriſts Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature</hi> is glorified, ſhould be equal to that <hi>Glorie of the God-head,</hi> which doth communicate or impart Glorie unto it; or from which, all the Glorie, which it hath above other Creatures, is derived. To conclude this Point; The beſt Frame, whereunto the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Arguments in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie can be drawn, is this; <hi>The glorie of God is infinite.; Chriſt as Man is glorified by the glorie of God:</hi> Ergo, <hi>His glorie as Man is infinite;</hi> Yet the <hi>connexion</hi> is not as good as this following. <hi>The light of the Sun doth by his preſence make the day, but the Moon is enlightned by the light of the Sun:</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Moon by preſence of its light makes the day.</hi> Sooner ſhall the <hi>Lutheran</hi> turn night into day, by this or the like Sophiſm, then prove <hi>that Real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Divine Attributes to Christs Humane Nature,</hi> which he dreams of; As, <hi>that Chriſt as man ſhould be Really preſent every where, or Omnipotent; becauſe the glorie of God wherewith he is glorified, is every where;</hi> or becauſe the Power or Right-hand, by which he is ſtrengthned, is a Power Omnipotent, Omnipotencie it ſelf. Thus much of that <hi>Abſolute Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> or <hi>Infinitie in Act,</hi> unto which Chriſts Humane Nature was not <hi>Exalted;</hi> and yet it was <hi>Exalted</hi> in ſome ſort <hi>Infinitly</hi> above all other created ſubſtances: and ſo <hi>Exalted,</hi> or at leaſt declared to be ſo <hi>Exalted,</hi> ſpecially, by the <hi>Aſcenſion of it into heaven; and by its Sitting at the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. That is <hi>Infinitum actu,</hi> or actually Infinite, <hi>Extra quod nihil est;</hi> which is ſo perfect and compleat, that nothing in the ſame kind can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto it: That is <hi>Infinitum potentia,</hi> or potentially Infinite, unto which ſomewhat may ſucceſſively be added without end or ceaſing. Thus <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi> have taught; that, <hi>In continuâ quantitate non datur minimum; in diſcretâ, non datur maximum.</hi> There is not the leaſt quantitie, but is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible into infinite parts. There is no member ſo great, but may ſtill be made greater by Addition; and albeit <hi>Addition</hi> were made every moment unto the worlds end, yet the <hi>Product</hi> could not be actually infinite; ſome number might be added unto it, which as yet is not contained in it. In this manner the participated Power or Glorie of God, or the participation of this Power or Glorie may be infinite. The participation of this Power or Being, may every moment, whileſt the world laſteth, or whileſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall creatures continue in being, be greater then other, and yet never come to be ſo great, but that it may be augmented or bettered; and <hi>that, which may be augmented or bettered, cannot be actually Infinite.</hi> The leaſt parcel of earth could not ſubſiſt without the participation of Gods Power or Being, and the leaſt or dulleſt part of the earth, which participates of his Being, doth in a ſort <hi>infinitly exceed Nothing,</hi> or that which is not. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="3323" facs="tcp:32220:19"/>
could have any Being, but by participating of his Being, who is infinite. No power beſides Infinite Power could out of <hi>Nothing</hi> produce <hi>Something.</hi> Trees, and plants, and other workes of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> dayes creation excell the earth; Beaſts of the field excell them; Man excelleth the beaſts of the field, and the Angels excell man in nobilitie and dignitie of being; And yet the moſt excellent amongſt the Angels is but a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Gods Power or Excellencie; and as Divines collect, God hath not made any creature ſo excellent, but he may make it more excellent every day then other; yet (this ſuppoſed) ſhould not the Excellencie of it be <hi>Actually infinite,</hi> becauſe it may be ſtill bettered; Yet may <hi>that,</hi> which is not <hi>actually infinite in any one kind,</hi> or according to any one branch of <hi>Infinitie,</hi> actually contein greater Excellencie or perfection in it, then the addition of perfection unto ſome other creature, though by ſucceſſion infinite, can attain unto. And thus <hi>Chriſts Humane Nature,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Perſonall Union</hi> which it hath with <hi>the Godhead,</hi> or with the Son of God, containes greater Excellencie in it of diverſe kinds, then any other created ſubſtance not ſo united, though the faculties or perfections of it were continually bettered, could reach unto.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But, omitting <hi>the Dignitie of Chriſts humane Nature</hi> in the general, it will be a more profitable ſearch to examin the particular Effects or Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> now Exalted, hath in reſpect of us. Theſe may not be meaſured, much leſſe limited, by other mens moſt noble Faculties or perfections. The moſt dull ſight on earth may ſee as far as the Sun or Starrs; and the moſt quick ſight cannot ſee beyond them.

to his protection. We may not collect, that <hi>Chriſts bodie,</hi> becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the heavens, can exerciſe no reall Operation upon our bodies or ſoules here on earth; or that the live Influence of his glorified Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature may not be diffuſed through the world, as he ſhall be pleaſed to diſpenſe it, or to ſow the ſeeds of life iſſuing from it, ſometimes here, ſometimes there.</p>

This kind of <hi>Infinitie</hi> of his Preſence can ſeem no <hi>Paradox</hi> or improbable Imagination to any good Chriſtian, that will but raiſe his thoughts above the earth by this or the like Experiment of nature. Albeit this bodily Sun, which we dayly ſee, were much further diſtant from the earth, then now it is, yet could we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conceive it to be of force and efficacie enough to enlighten the earth, whereon we dwell, and thoſe coeleſtial Spheres, which are, or might be, as farre above it, as it is above the Center. And in the greateſt diſtance we can imagin it is, or might be, diſtant from the earth; it would give life and vigour to things vegetable, or capable of vital heat. It were a ſilly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to infer, that becauſe the hotteſt fire on earth, cannot impart his heat to bodies 10 miles diſtant from it, therefore the Sun cannot communicate vital heat and Comfort to vegetables more then ten-hundred-thouſand miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from it: <hi>This Inference</hi> notwithſtanding is not ſo fooliſh in <hi>Philoſophie, as This</hi> following is in <hi>Divinitie.

The <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the <hi>Prime Fountain of Life</hi> to all, but, though inexhauſtible in it ſelf, yet a fountain whereof we cannot drink, ſave as it is derived unto us through <hi>the Humane Nature</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Although it be moſt true which <hi>Tertullian (in the</hi> 17 Chapter <hi>of his Apologie)</hi> hath obſerved, <hi>That even thoſe Heathens, which adored</hi> Jupiter Capitolinus, <hi>and multiplied their Gods according to the number of the places wherein they worſhiped them, when they were throughly ſtung with any grievous affliction or calamitie, were wont to lift up their eyes and hands, not to the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Capitol, but to heaven</hi> it ſelf; <hi>as knowing that, by inſtinct of nature, to be the ſeat or throne of Divine Majeſtie,</hi> And <hi>the Hill from whence came their help:</hi> Yet (notwithſtanding the truth of this Obſervation, and the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſe, which that <hi>Father</hi> there makes of it) it was an extraordinary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they were permitted and inſtructed to worſhip God in his Sanctuarie, and to preſent their devotions towards the Ark of the Covenant, or the Mercy-ſeat, before which they might adore him in ſuch manner and ſort, as they might not in any other place, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3325" facs="tcp:32220:20"/>
any other creature. They knew, much better then the heathen, that Gods Throne of Majeſtie was in heaven, and yet were to tender their devotions unto him as extraordinarily preſent in his Temple or Sanctuarie here on earth. For as our bodily ſight doth ſcatter or dazle, without ſome ſenſible Object to gather and terminate it; So our cogitations, though of heaven and heavenly things, do float or vaniſh without ſome determinate and comprehenſible Object, whereon to faſten them. Now, albeit the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wherein Gods People only were to worſhip, were long ſince demoliſhed; yet the Sanctuarie, wherein they were to worſhip God, is rather tranſlated or advanced from earth to heaven, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; For <hi>it was Gods Preſence, that made the Temple;</hi> and <hi>That</hi> is more extraordinary in <hi>Chriſts Body</hi> (which the Jewes deſtroyed, but which he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again in three dayes) then ever it had been in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple; in the Glorie of whoſe goodly ſtructure and manifeſtation of Gods Glorie in it, the true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did much rejoyce, and the later <hi>Iewes</hi> too much boaſt and glorie. But <hi>this Prerogative</hi> we have in reſpect of the ancienteſt and trueſt <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that, ſince the vail of the Temple was rent, we may at all times (reflecting upon that modell the Scripture hath imprinted in our mindes) look within the vail, and behold the Ark or Mercy-ſeat; and uſe the moſt holy Sanctuarie, or inner place made with hands, as a <hi>Perſpective Glaſſe</hi> or inſtrument for ſurveying the heavenly <hi>Sanctuarie, which God hath pitched and not man. This hope have we</hi> (ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul, Heb. 6. 19.) <hi>as an anchor of the ſoul both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entreth into that within the vail, whither the fore-runner is for us entred, even Jeſus made an high Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedek.</hi> He is gone before us into the Sanctuarie to make perpetual interceſſion, who before had made an everlaſting attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us here on earth. He is now become to us the Temple of God, the Ark of the Covenant, the Propitiatorie, or Mercie-ſeat, the fulfilling of all things: and unto him, now placed in his Sanctuarie at the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of God, we are not only to direct our <hi>Cogitations</hi> or devotions, but to tranſmit our <hi>affections</hi> to the Divine Nature by him. The Son of God after he had ſuffered in <hi>Our fleſh</hi> (and made a full ſufficient ſatisfaction for all our ſins) did in <hi>our nature</hi> riſe again, did in <hi>our nature</hi> aſcend into heaven, and in <hi>our nature</hi> ſitteth at the Right-hand of God, not only to gather our ſcatered <hi>contemplations</hi> and broken <hi>notions</hi> of the Godhead, but withall to draw and unite our <hi>affections</hi> unto him, which otherwiſe would flagg, droop, or miſcarry, if we ſhould direct them to heaven at large, or to the incomprehenſible Majeſtie of the Godhead, without <hi>a known Advocate</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor to preſent them, and to return their effects or iſſues. Hence ſaith our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> Coloſ. 3. 1. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt,</hi> that is, if you ſted faſtly believe that Chriſt, who was the Son of God (and as incomprehenſible for his Divine Nature as God the Father, to whom he was equal) did dye in your fleſh and comprehenſible nature, and in the ſame nature did riſe againe from the dead, <hi>then ſeek thoſe things, which are above; where Chriſt ſitteth at the Right-hand of God: Set,</hi> (or ſettle, or faſten) <hi>your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.</hi> And as we are to ſettle our deareſt <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on him,</hi> ſo are we to direct our <hi>prayers unto him</hi> in his heavenly San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That we may direct our prayers unto <hi>the Bleſſed Trinitie</hi> according to the Rule of Faith (which is the firſt Degree of <hi>praying in Faith)</hi> take, for the preſent, theſe <hi>ſhort Directions.</hi> The <hi>Firſt and Fundamental Object of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as Chriſtian, is the acknowledgement of the Bleſſed Trinitie.</hi> And by this
<pb n="3326" facs="tcp:32220:21"/>
Belief we acknowledge ſuch a <hi>Diſtinction of Perſons,</hi> or Parties, between <hi>God the Father, God the Son,</hi> and <hi>God the Holy-Ghoſt:</hi> that God the <hi>Father</hi> doth Perſonally, and in proprietie of Perſon, exact Satisfaction for all the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces committed againſt the God-head or Bleſſed <hi>Trinitie:</hi> and that the <hi>Son</hi> of God doth by like Perſonal Proprietie, undertake to make Satisfaction and Reconciliation for us. He it is that doth avert the wrath of God from us, and inhibit the proceedings of Divine Juſtice againſt us. We are then in the <hi>Firſt place</hi> either expreſly or implicitly to direct our prayers to God the Father, that he would be pleaſed to forgive us our ſins, to be reconciled unto us, and beſtow ſuch bleſſings upon us, as he hath promiſed to ſuch as ſhall be reconciled unto him. In the <hi>Second place,</hi> either expreſsly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, we are to beſeech him to forgive us our ſins, to be reconciled and bleſſe us for the merits of his only Son, who hath made ſatisfaction for us. This is a Point, which every Chriſtian is bound expreſſely to believe, that God the <hi>Father,</hi> doth neither forgive ſins, nor vouchſafe any Term or Plea of Reconciliation, but only for the <hi>merits and ſatisfaction</hi> made by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the <hi>Son of God, who by the eternal ſpirit offered himſelf</hi> in our humane nature upon the Croſſe. In the <hi>next place,</hi> we are to believe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that as God the Father doth neither forgive, nor vouchſafe Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, but for the merits and ſatisfaction of his <hi>only Son;</hi> ſo neither will he vouchſafe to conveigh this, or any other bleſſing unto us, which his Son hath purchaſed for us, but only <hi>through his Son;</hi> not only <hi>through him as our Advocate</hi> or <hi>Interceſſor,</hi> but through him as our <hi>Mediator,</hi> that is, through <hi>His humanitie, as the Organ</hi> or Conduit, or as the only Bond, by which we are united and reconciled unto the Divine Nature. For although the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> or Third Perſon in <hi>Trinitie,</hi> doth immediately and by Perſonal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie, work faith and other ſpiritual Graces in our Souls, yet doth he not by theſe Spiritual Graces unite our ſouls or Spirits immediately unto <hi>himſelf,</hi> but unto <hi>Chriſts Humane Nature.</hi> He doth as it were till the ground of our hearts, and make it fit to receive the ſeed of life; But this ſeed of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe immediately flows from the Sun of Righteouſneſſe, whoſe ſweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence likewiſe it is, which doth immediately ſeaſon, cheriſh, and ripen it. The Spirit of life, whereby our Adoption and Election is ſealed unto us, is the real participation of <hi>Chriſts Bodie,</hi> which was broken, and of <hi>Chriſts Blood,</hi> which was ſhed for us. This is the true and punctual meaning of our Apoſtles ſpeech, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. <hi>The firſt man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living ſoul,</hi> or, as the Syriack hath it, <hi>Animale Corpus,</hi> an enlivened bodie; <hi>but the ſecond Adam was made a quickning ſpirit;</hi> and immediately becometh ſuch to all thoſe, which as truely bear his image by the Spirit of Regeneration, which iſſues from him, as they have born the Image of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by natural propagation. And this again is the true and punctual meaning of our Saviours words, <hi>John.</hi> 6. 63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing; the words that I ſpeak unto you are ſpirit and life.</hi> For ſo he had ſaid in the verſes before, to ſuch as were offended at his words, <hi>what if you ſhould ſee the Son of man aſcend up where he was before?</hi> The <hi>Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> conteined in the <hi>Connexion</hi> between theſe two verſes, and the precedent is this; That Chriſts <hi>Virtual preſence,</hi> or the influence of life, which his Humane Nature was to diſtil from his heavenly Throne, ſhould be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to ſuch as were capable of it, then his <hi>Bodily preſence;</hi> then the <hi>bodily Eating</hi> of his fleſh and blood, could be, although it had been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible into their bodily ſubſtance. This diſtillation of life and immortalitie from his glorified Humane Nature, is that, which the Ancient and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxal
<pb n="3327" facs="tcp:32220:21"/>
Church did mean in their Figurative and lofty ſpeeches of <hi>Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſence,</hi> or of <hi>eating His very Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drinking His very Blood</hi> in the Sacrament. And the Sacramental Bread is called <hi>His Bodie,</hi> and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Wine <hi>His Blood;</hi> as for other reaſons, ſo eſpecially for <hi>This,</hi> that the vertue or influence of his Bloody Sacrifice, is moſt plentifully, and moſt effectually diſtilled from heaven unto the worthy Receivers of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> And unto this Point and no further will moſt of the Teſtimonies reach, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his books of the Sacraments, or <hi>Maldonat</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the ſixth of Saint <hi>John,</hi> do quote out of the Fathers for Chriſts <hi>Real Preſence by Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> or which <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> that Learned <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran,</hi> in his Books, <hi>De duabus in Chriſto naturis,</hi> and <hi>de Fundamentis ſanae doctrinae,</hi> doth avouch for <hi>Conſubſtantiation.</hi> And if thus much had been as diſtinctly granted to the Ancient <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> in ſome places doth, the controverſie between the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and other Reformed Churches, had <note place="margin">Beſides what may be found in <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex.</hi> See <hi>Cyrill Hieroſol.</hi> in Catecheſ.

At the tenth verſe you may read, how our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had ſatisfied five thouſand hungry ſouls, with five barley loves and two fiſhes; and filled twelve baskets with the fragments: upon the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of this ſtrange wonder, this great multitude ſought <hi>to make him their King.</hi> A good Project, I muſt confeſſe, if we value it onely by the uſual meaſure, or aime of popular Elections. What people would not be willing to have ſuch an one for their King, as were able to feed a whole Armie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Contribution, Tax or Toll from them; without any further toil, and care, either on their part or his, then giving of thanks, and diſtribution of extemporarie proviſion by his Miniſters? <q>But beſides this politick motive, they had a <hi>Prenotion,</hi> that <hi>their expected Meſſias or King, ſhould enter upon his Kingdom at the Feaſt of the Paſſover,</hi> a little before which time, this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was wrought. And it was a received Opinion (as <note n="*" place="margin">Hiſt. lib. 5. So. Suetonius in Veſpaſ.</note>

Lord <hi>evermore give us this bread.</hi> But when our Saviour comes from the <hi>Theſis</hi> to the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> or from the general Doctrine which they ſo well approved, to make this particular Application, <hi>I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt,</hi> ver. 35. They leave their queſtioning, and fall to murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, taking a ſudden occaſion, or ſtrange hint of offence at his perſon or <note place="margin">Of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar affections. See Book 10. Ch, 23. f. 3073</note> Parentage. Whereas before they were forward to make him their King, they now reply, <hi>Is not this Jeſus, the ſon of Joſeph, whoſe father and mother we know?

               <p n="3">3. Thus, their fathers had murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, one while for want of bread, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 2. accounting their eſtate in Egypt much better than their preſent condition in the wilderneſſe. Another while they murmur for water, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 24. And again <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this that thou haſt brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our Children, and Cattle with thirſt?</hi> Thus they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom they had ſeen to work ſo mightie wonders. And thus their fooliſh poſteritie mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt Him, whom (for the former miracle) they had acknowledged, the <hi>great Prophet</hi> whom God had promiſed to <hi>raiſe up unto them like unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
                  <pb n="3330" facs="tcp:32220:23"/>
                  <hi>in all things,</hi> and therefore like unto him in <hi>this,</hi> in that he endured their <hi>murmurings</hi> againſt him with greater patience and meekeneſſe, than <hi>Moſes</hi> did; albeit they had no ſuch occaſion of murmuring as their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had. For their Fathers murmured in their hunger or thirſt, whereas this great <hi>Prophet,</hi> had prevented this occaſion of murmuring, by feeding them plenteouſly before they had ſought to him for food. That which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith unto the murmuring Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 8. was now exactly fullfilled; <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>heareth your murmurings which you murmur againſt him; and what are wee? Your murmurings are not againſt us, but againſt the Lord.</hi> Theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> murmur againſt the ſon (as they ſuppoſe) of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> leſſe weening that in murmuring againſt him they did perſonally murmur againſt the Son of God, then their Fathers did, when they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they had murmured againſt their God. But the ſame Lord which heard their murmurings then by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preſence or infinite knowledge of his God head, heares them now with <hi>the eares of man,</hi> as immediately and as ſenſibly, as <hi>Moſes</hi> heard their Fathers murmur. Now, as God in the wilderneſſe, though he heard their Fathers murmurings, did yet grant them their deſire; <hi>[at evening ye ſhall eat fleſh, &amp; in the morning ye ſhall be filled with bread, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord your God.</hi> Exod. 16. 12] So the ſame Lord now, albeit this fooliſh people murmur againſt him to his <hi>face,</hi> (not for denying, but for proffering them the true food of life) is ſo farre from chiding them as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, that he preſſeth them, to make try all of his bountie, and to accept his proffer, with greater vehemency of words, yet with more meekneſſe of language, than <hi>Moſes</hi> did at any time uſe. <hi>Murmur not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>amongſt your ſelves,</hi> ver. 43. &amp;c. <hi>I am that bread of life; your fathers did eat Manna in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe and are dead. This is the bread which cometh downe from heaven,</hi> that <hi>a man may eat thereof and not dye. I am the living bread that came downe from heaven,</hi> if any <hi>man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my fleſh, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I will give for the life of the world.</hi> 48, 49, 50, 51. And here again they increaſe their murmuring, for they ſtrove among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſaying, <hi>how can this man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> v. 52. Thus, as their Fathers tempted God in their hearts by <hi>asking meat for their Luſt,</hi> Pſ. 78. 18. ſo have their poſteritie. They fought him out, that they might have their bellyes filled with corporal bread, and yet when he had given them <hi>this</hi> in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, by meanes miraculous, they will not beleive that he is able to give them what he promiſeth, <hi>bread from heaven, or his fleſh to eate</hi> (which is the bread or ſtaff of life.) So incredulous their Fathers had been, that after the ſight of many miracles in Egypt, they would not truſt him in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; after the experience of one miracle in the wildern eſſe, they would not truſt him for a ſecond. <hi>They Spake againſt God, they ſaid, can God furniſh a table in the wilderneſſe? Behold he ſmote the Rock, that the waters guſhed out and the ſtreames over-flowed, but can he give bread alſo, can he provide fleſh for his people? therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth; ſo a fire was kindled againſt Jacob, and anger came up againſt Iſrael becauſe they beleived not in God, and trusted not in his ſalvation;</hi> But now this <hi>Salvation</hi> of God, even God himſelf made their <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or Salvation (for all is one) is come neerer unto this later people: and yet they will not beleeve him, they will not truſt in him. Yet his anger is not preſently kindled againſt them for not belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: The more they doubt, the more they queſtion, the more they murmur or ſtrive; the more he preſſeth the neceſſitie of eating his fleſh, upon them, firſt Negatively, <hi>verily, verily: I ſay unto you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>
                  <pb n="3331" facs="tcp:32220:23"/>
                  <hi>yee eat the fleſh of the ſon of man and drink his blood, yee have no life in you:</hi> then Affirmatively, <hi>Who ſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> verſ. 53, 54. And laſtly, he gives the reaſon, as well of the negative as of the affirmative, <hi>For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,</hi> verſ. 55. So that in him, theſe Jewes were to expect the fulneſſe of the <hi>body</hi> of all thoſe <hi>contentments</hi> for whoſe ſhadowes their Fathers ſo greedily longed in the wilderneſſe, and for want of which, they ſo murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> as theſe men now do againſt <hi>the Lord,</hi> which appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> for giving them aſſurance of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In what ſenſe <hi>Chriſts fleſh</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>truely meate,</hi> and <hi>his blood to be truely drink,</hi> I have ſhewd elſwhere. The ſumme was this. <hi>His fleſh is meat indeed, his blood is drink indeed, non Formaliter ſed Eminenter;</hi> meat indeed and drink indeed, not in reſpect of the natural qualities of corporal meat and drink, for theſe muſt be ſwallowed, concocted, digeſted, and finally converted into our bodily ſubſtance. That <hi>Chriſts fleſh</hi> according to theſe qualities, is <hi>truely meat,</hi> or <hi>his blood truely drink,</hi> the Romiſh Church doth not avouch. For if his body ſhould be concocted, or digeſted, or converted into our bodily ſubſtance, it ſhould ſuffer corruption. And to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only and not concocted, is no propertie of meat or drink. <hi>Chriſts Fleſh</hi> then is ſaid <hi>truly meat,</hi> and <hi>his blood drink indeed, in reſpect of the End</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all manner of food is deſtinated. The beſt End of all bodily food, is to preſerve or continue bodily life. And that is the beſt food or diet, which moſt effectually procureth this End. Howbeit bodily life cannot be firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or implanted by the beſt bodily meat that is, but only continuated or preſerved: But <hi>Chriſts Fleſh</hi> was given not only to <hi>continue</hi> life, but <hi>to give life unto the world:</hi> it is the <hi>root</hi> of life, as well as the <hi>food</hi> of life; If we <note place="margin">John. 6. 32, 33, 41, 48, 50. &amp;c. 1. Cor. 15. 45.</note> ſpeak of life ſpiritual or Everlaſting, which onely is <hi>life indeed.</hi> And in as much as his fleſh and blood are the rootes and fountaines of this kind of life, the one is moſt truely ſaid to be <hi>meat indeed,</hi> the other moſt truely, <hi>drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> That is, meat and drink more effectuall and more neceſſary for the attainement of everlaſting life, than bodily food is for life temporal. Again, Temporal or bodily life cannot be continued or preſerved otherwiſe than by the corruption or deſtruction of the bodily meate which preſerves it. But <hi>Chriſts fleſh and blood preſerve</hi> life ſpiritual, or <hi>our ſoules and bodies unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> becauſe they are incorruptible and cannot be changed, be not ſo <note place="margin">So the Church Leiturgie, in the words of miniſtration.</note> much as ſubject to alteration. Now if all other meat beſides this, muſt ſuffer corruption and loſe its nature before it can become a cauſe or meanes of preſerving bodily life; Such meat cannot be truely ſaid <hi>to remain in us;</hi> much leſſe can wee be ſaid <hi>to remain</hi> or <hi>abide in it.</hi> But <hi>of Chriſts fleſh and blood,</hi> he himſelfe here ſaith it; <hi>He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him:</hi> and for this reaſon <hi>his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed,</hi> the onely meat and the onely drink which men ſhould hunger and thirſt after. Other meates and drinks ſhould be ſought for, yea life bodily it ſelf ſhould be deſired, onely to this End, that by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing of it, wee might be partakers in greater meaſure of this meat and drink, which preſerves the Bodie and ſoul unto everlaſting life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Queſtions then to be diſcuſſed are Two.</hi>

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>All agree that there is <hi>A Twofold eating of Chriſts Bodie,</hi> and <hi>A Twofold</hi>
                  <pb n="3332" facs="tcp:32220:24"/>
                  <hi>drinking of his Blood.</hi> One meerly <hi>Sacramental,</hi> and another, <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Which agreement notwithſtanding, There ariſeth, <hi>A Third Queſtion;</hi> viz. <hi>What manner of eating Chriſts Fleſh and drinking his Blood, is, in this place,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</note> 
                  <hi>either onely or principally meant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Reſolution of this <hi>Queſtion</hi> we are breifly to explicate each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this <hi>Diviſion,</hi> viz. 1. <hi>What it is to eat Chriſts Bodie and drink his Blood Sacramentally onely.</hi> 2. <hi>What it is to eat his Bodie and Drink his Blood Spiritually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then; <hi>All that are partakers of this Sacrament, eat Chriſts Bodie, and Drink his Blood ſacramentally:</hi> that is, they eat that Bread which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally</hi> is his Bodie, and drink that Cup which <hi>Sacramentally</hi> is his Blood, whether they eat or drink faithfully or unfaithfully. For, <hi>All the Iſraelites</hi> 1 Cor. 10. <hi>Drank of the ſame Spiritual Rock, which was Chriſt</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally: <hi>All</hi> of them were partakers of his preſence, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſmote the Rock. Yet, with <hi>many of them, God was not well pleaſed,</hi> becauſe they did not <hi>faithfully</hi> either Drink or participate of his preſence. And more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed he is with ſuch as eat Chriſts Bodie and Drink his blood unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, though they eat and drink them <hi>Sacramentally:</hi> For eating and drinking <hi>ſo onely,</hi> that is, without faith, or due reſpect, they eat and drink to their own Condemnation, becauſe they do not <hi>Diſcern,</hi> or right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem Chriſts Bodie or preſence in the H. Sacrament.</p>
               <p>May we ſay then, that Chriſt is <hi>Really preſent</hi> in the Sacrament, as well to the unworthy as to the faithful receivers? Yes, this we muſt grant: yet muſt we add withal, that he is <hi>really preſent</hi> with them in a quite contrary manner; <hi>really preſent</hi> he is, becauſe <hi>virtually preſent</hi> to both; becauſe the operation or efficacie of his Bodie and blood is not <hi>metaphorical,</hi> but <hi>real</hi> in both. Thus the bodily Sun, though locally diſtant for its ſubſtance, is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See Book 10. f. 3298, &amp; 3304.</note> 
                  <hi>preſent</hi> by its heat and light, as well to ſore eyes, as to clear ſights, but <hi>really preſent to both, by a contrarie real operation;</hi> and by the like contrary operation, it is really preſent to clay, and to wax, it really hardneth the one, and really ſofteneth the other. So doth Chriſts Bodie and Blood, by its inviſible, but <hi>real influence,</hi> mollifie the hearts of ſuch as come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with due preparation; but harden ſuch as unworthily receive the conſecrated Elements. If he that will hear the word, <hi>muſt take heed how he hears,</hi> much more muſt he which means to receive the Sacrament of Chriſts bodie and blood, be careful how he receives. He that will preſent himſelf at this great Marriage Feaſt of the Lamb without a wedding garment, had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be abſent. It was alwayes ſafer, not to approach the preſence of God manifeſted or exhibited in extraordinarie manner, (as in his Sanctuarie or in the Ark) then to make appearance before it in an unhallowed manner, or without due preparation. Now when we ſay, that Chriſt is <hi>really preſent</hi> in the Sacrament, our meaning is, <hi>that as God,</hi> he <hi>is preſent in</hi> an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie manner, after ſuch a manner, as he was preſent (before his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) in his Sanctuarie, in the Ark of his Covenant; and by the Power of his God-head thus extraordinarilie preſent, he diffuſeth the vertue or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Humane Nature, either to the vivification or hardning of their hearts, who receive the Sacramental Pledges. So then, a man by eating Chriſts bodie <hi>meerly Sacramentally</hi> may be hardned, may be excluded from his gracious preſence. But no man hath Chriſt dwelling in him, by this <note place="margin">Eating and Drinking meerly Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, not meant in St. <hi>John</hi> 6. 56.</note> manner of eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood, unleſſe withal he eate the one, and drink the other <hi>Spiritually.</hi> The Eating then of Chriſts bodie, and drinking his blood, <hi>meerly Sacramentally,</hi> is not the eating and drinking here meant.</p>

6. They are ſaid to eat Chriſts Fleſh and drink his Blood <hi>Spiritually,</hi> which rightly apprehend his Death and Paſſion; which by Faith meditate and ruminate upon them, making application to themſelves aſwel of the great danger, which may enſue upon the neglect of ſuch great benefits as he hath purchaſed for them: as of the ineſtimable good, which alwayes accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the right eſteeme, or contemplation of his Bodie, which was given for them, and of his Blood which was ſhed for them. He which <hi>thus</hi> eateth Chriſts Fleſh and drinketh his Blood <hi>by Faith,</hi> although he do not (for the time preſent) eat his Bodie, or drink his blood <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> hath a true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this promiſe, <hi>[He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me, and I in him,]</hi> ſo he do not neglect to eat his Bodie and drink his Blood <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> when occaſion requires and opportunitie ſerves. So that <hi>Spiritual eating and drinking Chriſt by Faith, is the true preparative for the worthy receiving of his bodie and blood Sacramentally.</hi> He that doth not ſo prepare himſelf for the receiving of his body and blood, doth receive him unworthily whileſt he receives him <hi>Sacramentally.</hi> The main <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, <hi>Whether Chriſts words be to be underſtood at all of Sacramental eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

The Reaſon which enforced theſe two great Divines, to ſlight the authoritie of moſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their own Church, and to <hi>wave</hi> the authoritie of moſt ancient Fathers (which it is evident do underſtand this place of <hi>Sacramental</hi> eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) was, becauſe they ſaw no poſſibilitie how to maintain the peremptorie decrees of the Councels of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> concerning Communion under one kind, if the words of our Saviour, <hi>ver.</hi> 53. of this Chapter, be to be underſtood of <hi>Sacramental</hi> eating and drinking. For it is granted by all, that the Conſecrated bread is <hi>Sacramentally</hi> his Bodie, not his Blood; and that the Cup is <hi>Sacramentally</hi> his Blood, not his Bodie: And yet our <hi>Saviours</hi> words are expreſs, <hi>Except ye eate the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> So that all which hope to have life, muſt <hi>Sacramentally</hi> drink his blood, aſwel as eat his fleſh, if this place be meant of <hi>Sacramental</hi> eating.

                  </gap> modern Prieſts and Jeſuites uſe for eluding, rather then anſwering this Objection, was too palpable in the Judgement of theſe two great Divines, as it ſince hath ſeemed to others of that Church, which yet maintain that the former words of our Saviour, are to be underſtood of <hi>Sacramental</hi> eating Chriſts fleſh, and drinking Chriſts blood. The evaſion of modern Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits is, that he which <hi>Sacramentally</hi> receives Chriſts Bodie, under the <hi>ſhape</hi> or <hi>form</hi> of Sacramental bread, doth with it receive his blood <hi>per Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantiam, by way of concomitancie,</hi> becauſe there is blood conteined in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which they thus receive. But this cannot ſatisfie any Romiſh Divine,
<pb n="3334" facs="tcp:32220:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which underſtands himſelf, or the ancient Doctrine which that Church pretends to follow. For this device of receiving Chriſts blood in the bread <hi>per concomitantiam,</hi> was but a late invention, little above 200. years before <hi>Janſenius</hi> or <hi>Heſſels</hi> lived. And the newneſſe of this imagination or inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which was generally applauded in the Romiſh Church in his time) was one ſpecial motive, why that <hi>Reverend Paſtor of Bleſſed memorie, Mr. Gilpin,</hi> did diſclaim the Romiſh Churches Doctrine in the Point of Tranſubſtantiation, as Biſhop <hi>Tunſtall</hi> his Uncle before him had done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Admitting the bread were turned into Chriſts very bodie, and after this converſion, had blood in it as truly as fleſh and bones, yet all this would not ſalve the <hi>literal ſenſe</hi> of our Saviours words in the 53<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe, if the eating and drinking which he there ſpeaks of were <hi>Sacramental.</hi> For ſuppoſe a man ſhould feed upon raw fleſh, or upon fleſh which had viſible or material blood in it, we might ſay indeed that he did eat blood <hi>per concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, by way of concomitancie,</hi> becauſe the fleſh which he eats had blood in it: But no man would ſay, That he did drink blood <hi>per concomitantiam.</hi> For <hi>eating and drinking are two diſtinct acts, and incompatible at one and the ſame time.</hi> He that eateth fleſh with blood in it, doth not eat the fleſh and drink the blood whileſt he only eats, but eats both together, the one as principal, the other as an appurtenance, if he eat as a man, and not as Swine do draugh, which is no more an eating then a drinking. Or if a man ſhould drink blood mingled with ſome ſmall portions of fleſh, we might ſay, He did drink fleſh <hi>by way of Concomitancie;</hi> but no man would ſay that he did eat blood <hi>per con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitantiam,</hi> albeit there were fleſh in the blood which he drinks, for he drinks both together, he doth not eat either.

But the further Diſcuſſion of <hi>this Point</hi> belongs more properly to the words of the Inſtitution. The <hi>other Point</hi> of expounding <hi>et,</hi> by <hi>vel,</hi> or of ſhuffling in <hi>Or</hi> for <hi>And,</hi> belongs to the <hi>Cognizance</hi> of the 53, and 56. verſes. <q>To juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this expoſition, Cardinal <hi>Tollet</hi> would perſwade us, That St <hi>Johns</hi> Greek Text is full of Hebraiſmes, and there is nothing more familiar with
<pb n="3335" facs="tcp:32220:25"/>
                     <hi>Moſes,</hi> or with other ſacred Hebrew writers, then to uſe <hi>And</hi> for <hi>Or, Et</hi> for <hi>Vel.</hi>
                  </q> And he brings divers inſtances to this purpoſe: As for example, that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 17. <hi>He that curſeth father</hi> And <hi>mother, ſhall ſurely be put to death.</hi> So it is word for word in the Hebrew, and yet our Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as the Vulgar Latin, renders the Original thus, <hi>He that curſeth father</hi> Or <hi>mother, ſhall ſurely be put to death.</hi> And it would be an ungodly Evaſion for any Magiſtrate, not to cenſure him as a tranſgreſſour of this Law, which curſeth his father, albeit he do not curſe his mother; or which curſeth his mother, albeit he do not curſe, but rather bleſſe his father. But muſt the true interpretation of ſuch as are to judge according to this Law, be derived from the peculiar phraſe, or dialect of the Hebrews? No, this was Cardinal <hi>Tollet's</hi> Errour; for the Rule of Interpretation (ſo the matter or circumſtance be the ſame) would hold as true in any dialect or language whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion then is, What certain <hi>general Rule</hi> we have, when, or in what caſes, the conjunctive particle <hi>[And]</hi> doth produce this, or the like <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive ſenſe,</hi> or may warrant this, or the like Expoſition of this Law. <hi>[He that curſeth father</hi> And <hi>mother, ſhall ſurely die; that is, he which curſeth</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>father</hi> Or <hi>mother, ſhall ſurely die.</hi> For the like Expoſition, the Rules are Two. One General and infallible Rule is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whenſoever the particle</hi> And, <hi>doth couple not two parts of one and the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but two intire propoſitions together, [That which is thus conjunctively</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A Rule to know when <hi>And</hi> may may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into <hi>Or.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>affirmed of two propoſitions coupled together, muſt be disjunctively expounded of either propoſition divided one from the other.]</hi> Now when it is ſaid, <hi>He that curſeth Father</hi> And <hi>Mother ſhall die,</hi> there be two intire propoſitions cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together by this particle <hi>And,</hi> implicitly; the explicit ſenſe or Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which ſpeech is this, <hi>He that curſeth his Father, ſhall ſurely</hi> die; <hi>And he that curſeth his Mother ſhall ſurely</hi> die. And if both theſe propoſitions conjunctively taken, be true, this disjunctive will be as true, <hi>He that curſeth either father or mother ſhall die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Rule is univerſally true; <hi>When two incompatible attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A Second Rule, when <hi>And</hi> muſt be turned into <hi>Or.</hi>

                  <hi>are conjunctively avouched of one and the ſame ſubject in one and the ſame ꝓpoſition univerſally taken, the particle</hi> And <hi>in this caſe muſt be reſolved into the particle</hi> Or, <hi>when the univerſall ꝓpoſition or ſubject of it is divided into its parts. Quae dicuntur conjunctim de genere, dicuntur diviſim de ſpecie.</hi> As for example, the Philoſopher deſcribing the native propertie of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, ſaith <hi>maximè proprium eſt quantitati, ut ex ea dicantur res aequales &amp; inaequales.</hi> But in as much, as equalitie and inequalitie, are <hi>incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,</hi> if wee apply them to <hi>the the ſame particular things</hi> which are compared together for quantitie; hence it is, that every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſubſtance, which is compared to, or meaſured with another, muſt either be equal or unequal unto it. That one and the ſame particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhould be both equal and unequal to another for quantitie, is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. So the Philoſopher ſaith, (and it is a naturall truth, which none can deny) that <hi>the living or ſenſitive creature</hi> univerſally taken, is <hi>rational and irrational;</hi> but becauſe one and the ſame living Creature, cannot be both ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and irrational, when wee deſcend to particular living creatures, wee cannot ſay that any of them is <hi>both</hi> rationall <hi>and</hi> irrationall, but <hi>either ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> or <hi>irrationall.</hi> Yet in as much as every particular living creature, is either endowed with reaſon, or not endowed with reaſon; the <hi>living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> univerſally taken, that is, as it comprehends every particular living creature, muſt be <hi>both</hi> rationall and irrationall: For, <hi>Quicquid dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>
                  <pb n="3336" facs="tcp:32220:26"/>
                  <hi>diviſim de Specibus, dicitur conjunctim de Genere.</hi>

But beſides the former plunge, whereto the beſt Scholars in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church are put, in juſtifying their practice for Deteining the Cup from the Laitie, if <hi>This Chapter be meant of Sacramental eating,</hi> there is another Difficultie, which neither the late Device of Drinking Chriſts Blood <hi>per con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitantiam,</hi>

nor the Cardinals interpretation of <hi>ver.</hi> 56. by <hi>Disjunction,</hi> will any way touch, much leſſe ſatisfie.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Difficultie is this,</hi> If theſe words be literally meant of <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A difficultie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the words, if lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally meant of Sacramental eating.</note> eating and drinking, their literal ſenſe muſt be as plain, and as void of all Trope or Metaphor, as the words of the Inſtitution related by Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chap. 26. 26. are by them ſuppoſed to be. Now when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith in Saint <hi>Matthew, That the bread is his Bodie,</hi> this ſpeech, in the literal ſenſe (as they contend) inferreth a <hi>ſubstantial</hi> change of the <hi>Bread</hi> into the ſubſtance of his bodie. Now our Saviours words are in <hi>this place</hi> as plain and as certain as in <hi>that. He</hi> avoucheth again and again that <hi>he is the bread of life, that the bread which he will give is his fleſh, that his fleſh is meat indeed, that his blood is drink indeed.</hi> Now, if the ſacramental bread, in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Matthew,</hi> cannot literally be ſaid to be his body unleſſe it be converted into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his body, then cannot Chriſt himſelfe literally be ſaid to be bread, unleſſe his ſubſtance be converted into the ſubſtance of bread. His fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>literaly</hi> be ſaid <hi>meat indeed,</hi> unleſſe it be really and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially converted into <hi>meat;</hi> his blood cannot be ſaid <hi>drink indeed,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be really tranſubſtantiated into drink.: If they grant theſe words to be meant of Sacramental eating, or to be equivalent to the words of the Inſtitution. Now to deny theſe words to be meant of <hi>ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall</hi> eating is every way leſſe expedient for reformed Churches than for the Romiſh. And yet to reſtrayn them either to <hi>Sacramental</hi> eating onely, or to <hi>Spirituall</hi> eating excluding ſacramental, is worſt of all. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conſider, that <hi>ſacramental</hi> eating and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> eating, are not <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite</hi> or incompatible, but <hi>ſubordinate.</hi> Our eating of Chriſts body and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Chriſts blood are then compleat, when they are Sacramentally ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, or ſpiritually ſacramentall. For as <hi>Calvin</hi> excellently obſerves (albeit ſuch as profeſſe themſelves zealous followers of him, either do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, or do not ſecond him) <hi>to eat Christs body and drink Chriſts blood [Sacramentally] is more then to beleive in Chriſt, more than to have our faith awaked or quickned by the ſacramentall pledges.</hi> For no man can <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> eat Chriſt, but by beleeving his death and <hi>paſſion;</hi> yet <hi>ſacramental</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting addes ſome what to <hi>ſpiritual</hi> eating, how quick and lively ſoever our faith be whileſt wee eat him onely ſpiritually. For though our faith were in both the ſame, as well for degree as qualitie: yet the <hi>object</hi> of our faith is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the ſame, at leaſt the <hi>Union</hi> of our faith unto the ſame object, is not altogether the ſame, in <hi>ſacramental</hi> and in <hi>ſpiritual</hi> eating. Chriſts body and blood are ſo preſent in the Sacrament, that wee receive a more ſpeciall influence from them in uſe of the ſacrament, than without it wee do; ſo we receive it worthily, or with hearts prepared by <hi>ſpiritual</hi> eating precedent, that is, by ſerious meditation of Chriſts death and paſſion. It is not all one, either not to think on Chriſts death and paſſion out of the ſacrament, or to think on them negligently or not reverently, and to receive the ſacrament of his body and blood unworthily, negligently or irreverently. Now as the effects or conſequence of the unworthy Receiving the Holy Sacrament is more Dangerous then the Effects or Conſequence of not eating Chriſt <hi>Spiritually,</hi> or of Careleſs Meditation upon Chriſts death and paſſion; ſo the Effect of Sacramental Receiving worthily and faithfully performed, is a Greater refreſhing to the Soul, then the effect of Receiving Him <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> onely, though reverently and as becomes us. Now unto the reverent and worthy Receiving of Chriſts Bodie and Blood <hi>both ways,</hi> that is, both <hi>Spiritually</hi> and <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> as being the moſt complete performance
<pb n="3338" facs="tcp:32220:27"/>
of the <hi>Condition</hi> required, is the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of our Saviour moſt immediatly annexed; <hi>He that</hi> So <hi>eateth my Fleſh and drinketh my Blood</hi> Dwelleth in Mee and I in Him.

He that <note place="margin">The Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on relating to the 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> General.</note> intends aright to eat Chriſts fleſh and drink his Blood <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> to his Souls Health, muſt come prepared by a right and worthy receiving of Both, <hi>Spiritually.</hi> Now we <hi>Spiritually</hi> eat Chriſts Fleſh, and drink his Blood, as often as we reverently, and faithfully meditate upon Chriſts Death, and remember it aright. And this we do, when we take a true <hi>Eſtimate of our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and of <hi>his death</hi> and ſufferings for us. For this is both duely to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our ſelves,</hi> or our own ſoules; and rightly to Eſteem or <hi>Diſcern the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Two <hi>Duties.</hi> 1 To examine our ſelves. 2. To Diſcern The Lords Bodie.</note> Lord's Bodie. To <hi>Diſcern his Bodie</hi> from the bodies of other men, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; unleſſe we believe and acknowledge it to be <hi>The Bodie of the Son of God, The bodie of God Bleſſed for ever:</hi> as was ſhewed at large before in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tracts, and in the fore-part of this Book. And this we may do, and yet not rightly eſteem that Love which Chriſt ſhewed unto us, in offering his Bodie and Blood, in reſpect of the love of others which would perhaps adventure their Bodies, and ſhed their blood for us.</p>
               <p n="12">12. To remember a <hi>A Good turn</hi> done by a friend, and not to value and prize it as we ought, is rather to forget then to remember his Friendlineſſe. Now no man can rightly prize the Death of Chriſt and the benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, unleſſe he truely believe that <hi>Chriſt Dyed for him.</hi> But is <hi>Every one</hi> bound to believe <hi>This?</hi> Yes. He that doth not believe <hi>This,</hi> doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>that Chriſt is The Meſſias,</hi> or the Redeemer of the World. <hi>To doubt of This, is a degree of Infidelitie: to denie it, is more then Hereſie, a point of Jewiſh Infidelitie.</hi> Yet to believe thus much, and no more, doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately make a good Chriſtian, or worthy receiver of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What more then muſt every one believe? That Chriſt dyed for him <hi>in particular?</hi> certainly he muſt. Nor doth the belief of <hi>This</hi> make him ſure of his Salvation. <hi>Every one</hi> muſt believe <hi>that Chriſt dyed for him in particular,</hi> that he may be a worthy Receiver; And <hi>Every One</hi> muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily receive this Holy Sacrament, that is, worthily remember Chriſts death, that he may make his Election ſure.</p>
               <p>But in what ſenſe muſt Every one believe <hi>that Chriſt dyed for him in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular?</hi> not <hi>Excluſively,</hi> as if he dyed not for others as well as for him: for this were <hi>to have the faith of Chriſt with reſpect of perſons;</hi> without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <note place="margin">Of the firſt part of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, or the Ranſom paid <hi>for all.</hi> See Book 9.

But if he died for <hi>all men,</hi> how is he ſaid to die for thee and me <hi>in particular?</hi> Verie well; <hi>Thus.</hi> Though He dyed <hi>for all</hi> as well as for Thee or me, yet did he not Die <hi>partly</hi> for thee, and <hi>partly</hi> for me, and <hi>partly</hi> for others, but <hi>intirely for every one.</hi>

               <p>Howbeit, as well as they who hold <hi>That Chriſt died for the Elect only,</hi> as they which teach, <hi>That he dyed for all,</hi> muſt beware, leſt they miſ-apply <hi>That Rule of Seneca's,</hi> touching ordinarie benefits, or Common courteſies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Extraordinarie loving kindneſſe of Chriſts ſufferings: <hi>Quod debeo cum multis, ſolvam cum multis;</hi> That which I owe amongſt others, I will not pay alone. His meaning is, That for Common benefits he is only bound to pay his ſhare or portion.

And if the value of Chriſts ſufferings cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into parts, <hi>Everie one</hi> muſt acknowledge, that He paid an infinite price for his Redemption <hi>in particular.</hi> A price leſſe then infinite could not have Redeemed any one of us, and a price more then infinite could not be given for all. If Chriſt became a <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> to die and ſuffer <hi>for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming man,</hi> he dyed and ſuffered for <hi>all men,</hi> for <hi>every man,</hi> albeit the number of men which proceed from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> could be infinite. Had it been the Will or Purpoſe of the Son of God, to have taken upon him the Form of a Servant, immediately upon the Firſt Woman's ſin of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his ſufferings for her could not have ſufficed, unleſſe they had been of value infinite: And being of value infinite for her, they had been of the ſame value for everie living Soul that iſſued from her to the Worlds end.</p>
               <p>If then, the price he laid down for thee were infinite, that is, without meaſure or Bounds, thy Love and thankfulneſſe to Him muſt be without Stint or limit. Though He died for others as well as thee, yet art thou bound to love Him no leſſe, then if he had died for thee alone. Thus muſt Thou think of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion if thou remember it aright: <q>And as often as thou Readeſt, Heareſt, or makeſt Confeſſion with thy Lips <hi>That Chriſt's Blood was ſhed for thee,</hi> make this Comment or Paraphraſe in thine heart, He ſhed his whole Blood for me, every drop that fell from Him, either in the Garden or on the Croſſe, or elſewhere, was poured out for my ſake, for me <hi>in particular.</hi>
                  </q> Yea, every one which hears of Chriſt is
<pb n="3340" facs="tcp:32220:28"/>
bound to believe that he dyed <hi>for him,</hi> and <hi>as for him,</hi> that the benefit of his Paſſion redounds <hi>et mihi, et tanquam mihi:</hi> and charitie, if it ſpring from Faith, will teach us to exclude none from Title to the benefits of Chriſts Death and ſufferings.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt's Dying for All,</hi> of His purpoſe to diſſolve the works of Satan <hi>in all,</hi> I am bold to profeſſe in every place where Chriſt's Name is called upon, in every place where I have or may have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to make Chriſt known: The bolder, becauſe it ſets forth, not only the Love and <hi>Mercie,</hi> but the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, a great deal more, then the contrarie Doctrine can do. It makes mans ſinfulneſſe and <hi>unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> appear much greater, then by the contrarie Doctrine can be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended or acknowledged. Beſides, it makes <hi>our Miniſtrie</hi> of preaching more uſeful then otherwiſe it could be. For, if we grant <hi>That Chriſt dyed only</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Three Uſes of the Doctrine, that Chriſt paid the Ranſom for all.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Elect,</hi> we might acquit our ſelves with ſafetie of Conſcience from the burden of preaching or Catechizing, ſave only in thoſe Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we know to be of the number of the Elect, or men alreadie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. Howbeit even in reſpect of <hi>Them,</hi> our preaching could not be ſo uſeful, as it would be harmful to others. We could but teſtifie <hi>that</hi> to the Elect which they already know, that is, that they ſhall be ſaved. But if once we teach that the Elect only or ſome few (perhaps one of a Thouſand, not one of five hundred) have any intereſt in Chriſts ſufferings, every man which is not as yet regenerate nor in the ſtate of Election, would forthwith conclude, that it is a thouſand to One (more then five hundred to One) that he can receive no benefit from Chriſts ſufferings, having no intereſt in the everlaſting inheritance purchaſed by them. And were it not much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be ſilenced, then by our preaching to put ſuch ſtumbling-blocks in their wayes whom we are ſent to call unto Chriſt? For we are not ſent <hi>to call the righteous,</hi> or men alreadie regenerate, <hi>but ſinners to repentance,</hi> to the ſtate of regeneration.</p>
               <p>How true ſoever in the Event it may prove, That but a Few ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in reſpect of them that periſh, though the moſt part of men do die in their ſins, yet their blood ſhall be required at their hands, who have taught, that they could not be ſaved, that Chriſt did not die, did not ſuffer for them. But if we teach, as God in his Word hath taught us, That Chriſt Dyed and ſuffered for <hi>all men,</hi> no man can doubt whether Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 29 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15 Heb. 2. 9 2 Pet. 2. 1</note> for him or no; and not doubting that Chriſt dyed for him, he need not Diſpair of Salvation by him: we leave him without excuſe for not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſeeking Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, This ſame Doctrine ſets forth the Glorie of God much more then the other can. For, albeit Gods mercies unto One man be truly infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, or rather infinite in themſelves, yet, if according to this infinitie they be extended <hi>unto all,</hi> they are extenſively much greater. If God had created only theſe inferior Elements, and man; their creation would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily infer the infinitie of his power (for without infinite power nothing could have been made of <hi>Nothing)</hi> but yet his praiſe or glorie would not have appear'd ſo great in the creation of Earth and Water, as it doth in the creation, not of them only, but of the whole heavens with all their Hoſts and furniture. The more Gods creatures be, the greater be his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for this Tribute he ought to receive from all of them, for their verie <hi>Being.</hi> In like manner, though the Redemption of one or ſome few men, do truly argue the value of his ſufferings to be truly infinite; yet, the more they be for whom he dyed, the more is his glorie, the greater is his praiſe:
<pb n="3341" facs="tcp:32220:28"/>
For all are bound joyntly and ſeverally to laud and magnifie his Name for the infinite price of their Redemption.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Laſtly, <hi>This Doctrine</hi> is ſo neceſſarie for manifeſting the juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their unthankfulneſſe which periſh, that without <hi>This</hi> we cannot take ſo much as a true Surface of it; not ſo much as the leaſt Dimenſion of Sin. <q>Some there be which tell us, that we had power in <hi>Adam</hi> to Glorifie God, but, that finning in <hi>Adam,</hi> our ſin is infinite, becauſe againſt an infinite Majeſtie: For ſo it is, that the greater the Partie is whom we offend, the greater always the offence is.</q> And thus by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they gather, that everie ſin againſt the infinite Majeſtie of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth infinitie of Puniſhment. But, albeit, the degrees of Sin, which <note place="margin">See Book 8. pag. 142.</note> accrue from the degrees of Dignitie in the perſon whom we offend, be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively infinite; yet becauſe theſe Degrees are indeterminate, every man, which hath any skill at all in <hi>Arguments of Proportion,</hi> muſt needs know, that it is impoſſible for the wit or art of man to find out the true <hi>Product</hi> of ſuch Calculatorie Inductions, or to conjecture unto what ſet meaſure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, theſe infinite degrees will amount. It is not the ten-hundreth-thouſandth part of any Sin that can be truly notifyed unto us by inferences of this kind. How then ſhall we take the true meaſure of our Sinnes, or the full Dimenſion of our unthankfulneſſe? From the Great Goodneſſe of God in our Creation, and the unmeaſurable Love of Chriſt in our Redemption. If God in our Creation <hi>(as the Pſalmiſt ſaies)</hi> did make us but litle lower then the Glorious Angels, that the might afterward crown us with Glorie everlaſting: if, when, through the Firſt mans follie we had loſt that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; he made his <hi>Onely Son</hi> for a litle while, for 33. yeares ſpace, lower then the Angels, that he might exalt Him above all Principalitie and Power, and in <hi>Him</hi> recrown us with Honour and Glorie aequal to the Angels, Their Sin is truly infinite, <hi>their unthankfulneſſe is unexpreſſible,</hi> and juſtly deſerveth puniſhment everlaſting, who voluntarily and continually deſpiſe ſo great Salvation which by Chriſt was purchaſed for them. No Torment can be too great, no anguiſh too Durable, becauſe no Happineſs could be in any degree comparable, much leſſe equal, to that which they refuſed, though treaſured up for them in that inexhauſtible fountain of happineſſe Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, our God, and our Redeemer.</p>
               <p>To conclude this meditation: It is a thing moſt ſeriouſly to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That though Gods mercies in Chriſt can never be magnified too much, yet may they be apprehended amiſſe: And, that, as it is moſt Dangerous to ſink in Deep waters wherein it is the eaſieſt to Swim; ſo, the more infinite Gods mercies towards us are, the more deadly ſin it is to Dallie with them, or <note place="margin">Dangerous to Dallie with Gods mercies.</note> to take incouragement by the Contemplation of them to continue in Sin. <hi>The contemplation of their infinitie is then moſt ſeaſonable, when we are touched with a feeling of the infiniteneſſe of our ſins.</hi> In that caſe, we can not look upon them but we ſhall be deſirous to be partakers of them, and that upon ſuch Termes as God offers them, <hi>the forſaking of all our ſinnes.</hi> Pro. 28. 13.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But is this all that thou art to remember, when thou art, by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eating and drinking Chriſts fleſh and blood, a preparing thy ſelf for Sacramental and Spiritual receiving him together in The Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? is it enough to acknowledge, that he payd as great a Ranſom for thee as he did for all Mankind in general? <hi>No! This is but the firſt part of thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:</hi> and this firſt part of thy redemption was intirely, and alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, and moſt effectually wrought for thee, before any part of thy bodie was framed, before thy Soul was created: it was then wrought for thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="3342" facs="tcp:32220:29"/>
any endeavour or wiſh of thine: No more was required at thy hands for this work, then was required of thee for thy creation. But there is <hi>A ſecond part of thy Redemption,</hi> of which that ſaying of <hi>A Father,</hi> is true, <hi>Qui fecit te ſine te, non ſalvabit te ſine te,</hi> He that made thee without any work or endeavour of thine, will not ſave (wil not Redeem) thee, without ſome, endeavour at leaſt, on thy part.</p>
               <p>What then is <hi>the ſecond part of the Redemption,</hi> which wee expect that Chriſt ſhould yet work in us and for us? or what is the endeavour on our parts required that he ſhould work it in us and for us? <hi>The ſecond part of our Redemption,</hi> which is yet in moſt of us to be accompliſhed, is, <hi>The Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of our Bodies,</hi> the diminiſhing the Reign of ſin in them; in a word, our Sanctification or Ratification of our Election. Theſe are wholly Chriſt's <note place="margin">See Book 10. Chap. 31.</note> workes, the ſole works of God, for <hi>it is He that works in us both the will and the Deed:</hi> and yet are we commanded to <hi>work out our own Salvation; to make our Election ſure.</hi> But how ſhall we do this, which is wholly Gods work? or what are we to do, that theſe works may be wrought in us? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the renewing of the Aſtipulation or anſwer of a Pure Conſcience, and Reſumption of our BAPTISMAL VOW, heretofore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; we are to humble our ſelves mightily before the Lord, by a meek <note place="margin">Book 10. Ch. 50</note> acknowledgement of our vileneſſe, and ſincere confeſſion of our ſinnes. And if we <hi>ſo</hi> humble our ſelves, <hi>Hee that giveth Grace to the humble will lift us up; if we confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe:</hi> not only to remit and cover our iniquities, but to purifie our hearts, and renew our ſpirits and mindes, that they ſhall bring forth fruits unto holineſſe. We are to call upon God by the prayer of faith and perſeverance: <hi>Turn thou us Good Lord, and ſo ſhall we be turned; Speak but Thou the word, and Thy Servants ſhall be whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. Thus we may eſteem of Chriſts love to us, and yet not examin or judge our ſelves as wee ought before we eat This Bread and Drink this Cup. <note place="margin">A Second <hi>Duty</hi> to Examine our ſelves.</note> To examin and judge our ſelves aright, requires theſe <hi>Two meditations,</hi> or <hi>Two parts of one and the ſame meditation.</hi> Firſt, How farre wee are guilty of Chriſt's Death by our Sinnes. But this falles under the former Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That Chriſt Dyed for <hi>us all,</hi> not onely <hi>all</hi> joyntly conſidered, but for <hi>everie one in particular,</hi> or as alone conſidered: and if he dyed for <hi>everie one in particular,</hi> or as alone conſidered, then everie one may and muſt thus judge, <hi>Then were all dead,</hi> and everie one in particular was a true cauſe of His Death. And this Meditation will make eaſie way to the Second, or <hi>ſecond part of the ſame Meditation,</hi> which is This: <hi>Wherein,</hi> or in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, <hi>everie one of us doth wrong Christ Jeſus more,</hi> or may do him more wrong <hi>then they did, which actually wrought his Death:</hi> that is, then <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> then the Scribes and Phariſees, then the Prieſts and Elders that plotted and conſpired it, did.</p>
               <p>But, doth any man which Profeſſes Chriſtianitie at this day, wrong Him more then <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and their aſſociats did? Yes, a great many! All that both daily and hourely do that which is more againſt <hi>his moſt Holie will,</hi> then all that <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and the Roman Souldiers did unto <hi>Him,</hi> wrong <hi>Him</hi> more then they did in putting <hi>Him</hi> to Death. <q>The only Rule for meaſuring any perſonal wrong, is the oppoſition which the Act or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe bears or includes unto the will or liking of the partie which is diſpleaſed or wronged.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To apply this to our preſent purpoſe. <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, did our Saviour more wrong, then <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>Abel</hi> his innocent Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="3343" facs="tcp:32220:29"/>
when he took away his life. For, Death, eſpecially a violent death, was as bitter unto Chriſt, as man, as it was to <hi>Abel.</hi> So were the revileings, the ſlanders, and the defamations, which the people (by the inſtigation of the Prieſts, Scribes, and Phariſees) caſt upon him, moſt diſpleaſing to His Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Will. Yet were all theſe perſonal wrongs more unpleaſant to his moſt Holy Will as he was <hi>The Son of God,</hi> then unto his Humane Nature, then unto his diſpoſition or affection, as <hi>He was the Son of David.</hi> And albeit he ſuffered nothing which his heavenly Father had not fore-determined, yet he that would excuſe his perſecutors from doing him wrong, were worſe then an Infidel. Neither will this excuſe us from doing him greater wrong then theſe his perſecutors did, if we do thoſe things which are more diſpleaſant to Him, more contrarie, not only to his <hi>Divine,</hi> but even to <hi>His Humane Will</hi> and Nature now Glorified in Heaven, then all the wrongs which Satan and his inſtruments did unto Him, whileſt He lived here on earth, whileſt He was partaker of mortalitie with us.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But what do we? or what can we do more diſpleaſant to <hi>His Holie Will,</hi> then what they did, who maliciouſly accuſed <hi>Him,</hi> who more maliciouſly ſought his condemnation, who after. His condemnation, did more mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and Inhumanely treat and perſecute Him, then any Barbarian would do a Malefactor which had yeilded himſelf to a Legal Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?</p>
               <p>Surely, if we do thoſe things which <hi>He</hi> is more unwilling we ſhould do, then He was to ſuffer all the indignities which the Scribes and Phariſees could put upon Him, then all the torments which the Roman Laws could inflict upon Him; we wrong Him much more, then either the Jews or the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Souldiers did. For He did not ſuffer, either the Torments which ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon Him whileſt He was upon the Croſſe, or in the Garden, becauſe <hi>He</hi> could not avoid or reſiſt them, but becauſe He was more willing to ſuffer all theſe, then a greater inconvenience, which ſhould have befallen all and everie one of Us, unleſſe theſe miſchiefs (as the world accounts them) had befallen Him. <hi>The inconveniences which He ſought to prevent by voluntarie undergoing theſe Calamities, were, the Dominion or Reign of Sin in us, and our Servitude unto Satan by this Reign of Sin. For, for this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that He might Diſſolve</hi> or Deſtroy <hi>the works of the Divel:</hi> And His manifeſtation did contein, not only His Incarnation, but His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie perſecution, His Death and Paſſion, which he was more willing to undergo, then to ſuffer the works of Satan, in any one of us, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolved. If we then ſhall hold on his ſide, or ſeek to keep him in, whom Chriſt came to caſt out; or ſhall build again that Babel which Chriſt came to deſtroy; if we take part with Satan, as all thoſe do, which do thoſe things whereby the works of Satan may be maintained or augmented, whereby the Reign or Soveraigntie of Satan may be confirmed or inlarged, we do thoſe things which are more diſpleaſing to Chriſt, then his Death and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was. And by doing ſuch things (according to the former Rule) we wrong <hi>Him</hi> more then they did, which did conſpire or Complot His Death, then they did, which put Him to that moſt cruel ignominious Death: For He was more willing to ſuffer <hi>That Death,</hi> to ſuffer all the indignities, that the Divel or world could put upon Him, then to ſuffer us, any one of us, to live and dye in our ſins, and in the ſervitude and power of Satan. Thus much by way of Application, as relating to the <hi>Firſt Generall;</hi> Proceed we now to the <hi>Second General; He—Dwelleth in mee, and I in him.</hi>

Dwelling</hi> implies a conſtant or frequent place of <hi>Abode;</hi> and ſomewhat more then ſo, a place of known or profeſſed <hi>Abode,</hi> no lurking-hole, or ſculking-place. All theſe circumſtances concur to juſtifie the Tranſlation of the Original word here, rather by <hi>Dwelling,</hi> than by <hi>Abiding.</hi> For <hi>Chriſts abiding</hi> in us (if we ſo eat his fleſh and drink his blood as he preſcribes) is <hi>conſtant,</hi> is <hi>frequent,</hi> and <hi>perpetual.</hi> And whileſt he abides in us, our abiding in him is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and frequent, but the known, or profeſſed place of our abode (and it is the beſt profeſſion to be of his houſhold). It is he that feeds us in time of peace, and he is our Tower of defence in time of War, the Rock of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, whileſt we are beſet with death and danger. <hi>Be thou to me,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal</hi> 71. 3. <hi>my ſtrong habitation, whereto I may continually reſort; thou haſt given commandement to ſave me, for thou art my Rock, and my Fortreſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that Chriſt is the Rock of our Salvation, of our habitation in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, is a point which needs no further proof, no amplification. Yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is <hi>our dwelling place,</hi> the Rock of our Habitation in whom we dwell: <note place="margin">Though a man be in the houſe as <hi>the Dweller;</hi> The houſe may be in the Man, as the right ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, poſſeſſor, &amp; houſ-holder.</note>

Yet ſure, that Joy doth both Satiate the Soul and Repleniſh the Bodie of him that enters into it. He is, as if we could ſuppoſe a large Veſſel of Chryſtal or tranſparent Gold let down into a Sea of Nectar or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters. But the expreſſions of Scripture about <hi>God the Father his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt, and Chriſt in Him,</hi>

                  <hi>Chriſt &amp; his Holy Spirit being in us,</hi> is various; Eſpecially, In S. John. Chap. 14. verſes 10, 11, 16, 17, 20, 23. and perhaps more eaſie to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented by the Chriſtian Union with God, then to be explayned in words more eaſie then the texts themſelves.</p>
               <p n="21">21. To let theſe paſs then; <hi>The propoſed Difficulties</hi> muſt have their <hi>proper Solutions: the former</hi> from the explication of that <hi>Great Attribute of Chriſt,</hi> to wit, that <hi>He is the Chief-corner ſtone</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>other Difficultie</hi> referres to that <hi>Metaphor</hi> of the vine and the Branches, or of the Stock and the Grafts.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is compared unto <hi>A ſtone</hi> or <hi>Rock,</hi> and wee unto living Stones <note place="margin">The former difficulty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> built upon it, in reſpect of the ſtrength and firmneſs of the foundation and ſtructure of Gods Houſe or Temple.</p>
               <p>He is, again, rightly compared to the vine, to an Olive or other more fruitfull tree, and we unto Branches or grafts (not ſpringing from the Root, but ingrafted into it) in reſpect of our growth in Him, and of the Diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of His virtue into us and through us.</p>
               <p>That we are built upon Chriſt (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20.) this doth argue that <hi>we dwell in him,</hi> that Hee is the Rock of our habitation. In that we are built <hi>on him,</hi> as on the Chief Corner-ſtone: not under Him onely, as He is <hi>Summus angularis lapis,</hi> the Chief Stone at the Topp, <hi>but upon Him</hi> as <hi>Lapis imus,</hi> the Firſt-Foundation-ſtone too, and that a <hi>Living ſtone,</hi> which was cut out of the Mountain without Hands, and which was to grow into a Mountain filling the whole earth; This inferres, <hi>That he must dwell in us.</hi> For the ſtone, which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeakes of, did not become a great mountain, ſo great a mountain as ſhould fill all the earth, by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or by heaping, or building one ſtone upon another, but by the growth of life; that is, by increaſe or augmentation of the ſame ſtone. Did this ſtone then increaſe or grow from ſmall beginings unto a mountain, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading the whole earth? If this wee ſay, the rock of our ſalvation or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation muſt receive increaſe of life, and become a greater habitation or dwelling place in this laſt Age than he had been in any former. But how ſhould this be true? ſeeing he is, and was the rock of ages, the Rock on which the world it ſelf is Founded; the rock by which the earth it ſelf which ſupporteth all other rocks, is ſupported, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.</p>

22. <hi>Such a Rock he was from eternitie as he is God,</hi> not as he is man. <hi>As man,</hi> he was firſt as a little ſtone, yet a growing ſtone, for <hi>he grew in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſtature, and favour with God and man,</hi> Luke. 2. 52. As God he could not be the corner-ſtone which God had promiſed to lay in Sion. Yet was Chriſt, who was both God and man, <hi>That ſtone which was layd in Sion.</hi> And as he, which was both God and man, did ſuffer for us, was rayſed again the third day from the dead, not according to his Godhead, but according to his manhood: So was he (the ſame Chriſt, which was both God and man) the ſtone layd in Sion, not according to his Godhead, but according to his manhood. This gives us the ordinary interpretation of the Prophet Eſay <hi>Chapt.</hi> 28. 16. But <hi>A late Interpreter</hi> of prophecies or viſions, hath obſerved an <hi>Hypallage,</hi> or inverſion in theſe words, not infrequent in the Prophets, familiar (as he alledgeth) to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> writers, ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion <note place="margin">Eſai. 8. 14.

Both conſtructions, the ordinary and this Critical, are true, and compatible; both in reſpect of the matter, are neceſſarie: Chriſt God and man was layd in <hi>Sion,</hi> as a ſure foundation ſtone, as <hi>Imus angularis Lapis,</hi> as the loweſt corner ſtone, unto which <hi>S. Peter,</hi> for precedencie of time (ſo far wee yeild unto his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie) was firſt annexed. <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt living ſtone, which was Built upon this foundation ſtone: the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were layd, not upon <hi>Peter,</hi> but upon the ſame foundation ſtone, whether one after another or all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, wee will not dſpute. However, all that beleive as <hi>Peter</hi> and the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, or ſhall ſo beleive unto the worlds end, are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately layd upon the ſame foundation ſtone, not one upon another, no one of them upon <hi>Peter,</hi> or upon any other <hi>Apoſtle; their union or annexion unto Christ, is as immediate as Peters was,</hi> and is or ſhalbe, as indiſſoluble as his was to Chriſt, albeit, their growth be not ſo great, nor for qualitie ſo glorious. The beſt inſcription of this edifice thus immediately erected upon the ſame ſtone, would be that of the Poet, <hi>Creſcet creſcentibus illis.</hi> As the number of living ſtones, which are layd upon this foundation ſtone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſo the foundation or corner ſtone which God did promiſe to lay in <hi>Sion,</hi> doth ſtill increaſe. As every particular living ſtone increaſeth or groweth from a ſtone into a pillar of this houſe of God; from a pillar in the houſe of God, unto a temple of God; ſo this foundation ſtone, that is, Chriſt as man, ſtill groweth, ſtill increaſeth, not in himſelfe, but in them. For they grow by his growth in them, or by diffuſion of life from him into them.</p>

                  <hi>a living rock,</hi> or a ſtone which being cut out of a mountain, became a Mountain which filled all the earth; yet <hi>the manner of his growth in us,</hi> or the manner of his inlarged habitation through the Church, may be beſt concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the manner of the ſoules growth or diffuſion of his Vertue throughout Vegetable or ſenſible bodies, that is, through trees or plants, or through the bodies of men, of beaſts, or ſuch as wee call living creatures. There is
<pb n="3347" facs="tcp:32220:31"/>
                  <hi>a vegetable ſoul</hi> in the <hi>Ake-corn</hi> when it is firſt ſet or planted; and this ſoul we may truely ſay <hi>dwelleth</hi> or <hi>abideth</hi> in the Akorn, and is the cauſe why the Akorn ſprouteth into a rod: the ſame ſoul is the cauſe why the rod or twig groweth greater, the true cauſe why this twig growes into a ſtemme, why the ſtemme grown greater, ſpreads it ſelf into branches, why every branch beareth leaf, bloſſom, or ſeed. Now the greater the ſtemme doth grow, the further the vegetable ſoul doth ſpread it ſelf; The ſame vegetable ſoul which was in the Akorn diffuſeth it ſelf into the ſtemme, into the branches, into the leaf, into the bloſſom, into the Fruit or ſeed. None of theſe could thrive or proſper at all, unleſſe the vegetable ſoul did <hi>abide or dwell</hi> in them, none of them can thrive or proſper any longer, than the vegetable ſoul <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or dwelleth</hi> in them. Thus was <hi>Chriſt</hi> the root out of which <hi>S. Peter</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See Joh. 15. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. where the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode is mutuall.</note> ſprouted, the ſoul of <hi>Peter</hi> as he was a living or Spiritual man. He had no life but from Chriſt, he grew by Chriſt <hi>dwelling</hi> or <hi>abiding</hi> in him. And as he did grow by Chriſt <hi>abiding</hi> in him; So he bare fruit by Chriſts <hi>dwelling</hi> in him, by the diffuſion of life, and vegetation from Chriſt. And ſo all they, that abiding in Chriſt do grow in faith, grow by Chriſt <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> in them and ſpreading his vertue through them, after ſuch a manner as the vegetable ſoule doth diffuſe it ſelf throughout the Branches which ſpring from the root or ſtemme, or through the branches which are ingrafted or inoculated into it. And this manner of the vegetable ſouls diffuſion of it ſelf (or of its vertue) into all the Branches which are ingrafted into the ſame ſtock or root, doth better reſemble the manner of Chriſts <hi>dwelling</hi> in us, than the diffuſion of life or vegetation from the root into the ſtemmes, ſtovens or branches, which without ingraffing or inoculation naturally ſpring from it.</p>
               <p n="24">24. But this later ſimilitude of the Stock and Grafts, although it well expreſſe the manner of Chriſts <hi>abiding</hi> or growing, not in himſelf, but in us, and the manner of our <hi>abiding</hi> or <hi>dwelling</hi> in him; it may ſeem to fail in this; That ordinarie Stocks, howſoever the ingrafted branches be ſupported by them, and receive life and nutriment from them, yet do they not receive their ſpecifical kind of life from the ſtocks into which they are ingrafted, but ſtill retain their own native qualitie. As a good Apple or Pear grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Crab ſtock or Thorn, doth not degenerate into a Crab or Thorn, but reteins its native ſweetneſſe, and bears the ſame fruit which it would have done, although it had grown up into a Tree from its own root, or from the root whereof it was a native Branch. It would be a Soloeciſm to ſay, That any ſuch ſtock doth remain or <hi>dwell</hi> in the Graft, becauſe it doth not diffuſe its ſpecifical qualitie into it. But Chriſt in this manner <hi>abideth</hi> or <hi>dwelleth</hi> in us. He is the Root and Stem, and we the Grafts and inſet bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and yet he is ſaid as truely <hi>to dwell in us, as we in him.</hi> This argues that the manner of our ingrafting and <hi>abiding</hi> in him is not natural, becauſe the Stock or Stem, is for nature and qualitie much better than all the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Grafts which are ſupported by it, which receive life and nutriment by it. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>That we Gentiles were cut out of the Olive tree which was wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good Olive tree.</hi> This ingraftment is contrary unto nature <hi>two wayes;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In that the Grafts being wild by nature, without any root, or fat, or ſweetneſs in themſelves, grow better qualified then they were, by participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſweetneſs of the Stock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that the Stock whereinto they are ingrafted, is a good Olive; whereas the Olive tree, naturally admits no ingraftment, or inciſion, being
<pb n="3348" facs="tcp:32220:32"/>
by nature ſo fat, that it ſeems to envie or ſcorn to participate his fatneſs unto any other Branches. <hi>In arbore pingui non vivunt inſita,</hi> Grafts do not thrive or proſper in any fat tree or ſtock, ſaith <hi>A late Naturaliſt.</hi> And as an <hi>Hebrew Doctor</hi> hath Obſerved, the Olive, being the fatteſt of Trees, will admit no inciſion, nor ingraftment. Nor will any Olive Graft thrive or proſper, unleſſe it be ingrafted in an hungry ſtock. That fatneſſe is as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Olive, as ſweetneſs to the Fig or Vine; beſides experience, we have the authoritie of Scripture, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. The trees went forth on a time to annoint a King over them, and they ſaid unto the Olive tree, Reign thou over us; But the Olive tree ſaid unto them, Should I leave my fatneſſe wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? And the trees ſaid unto the Fig tree, Come thou and Reign over us; But the Fig tree ſaid unto them, Should I forſake my ſweetneſſe and my good fruit, &amp;c? Yet is Chriſt Jeſus the True Olive Tree, but left his fatneſſe for a time, that we, being by nature wild Olives might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into him, and being ingrafted might participate of his fatneſſe and ſweetneſſe, which is no other, then that whereof the natural Olive is the Embleme, to wit, <hi>Peace,</hi> even the <hi>Peace</hi> of God which ſurpaſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. <hi>Peace</hi> was his Embaſſage; as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between</hi>

The meaneſt Prophet is not excluded; <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> are to be numbred amongſt the Prophets here meant, they were no foundations of the reſt.

So were not, for ought we read, the names of the Prophets; nor can it be concluded, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> did mean the ſelf ſame thing, by the <hi>twelve foundations,</hi> that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here doth by <hi>the foundation of the Prophets and the Apoſtles.</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> deſcribes the new <hi>Jeruſalem, as a Citie lying four ſquare, with twelve Gates.

Yet foundations the Apoſtles might be ſaid of this Citie, in ſuch a ſenſe as <hi>Heſychius</hi> ſaith, Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> was of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe he brought him to Chriſt.

                     <hi>Beza</hi>'s Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> here in the Text, doth ſignifie <hi>both extremes</hi> of any dimenſion, as well the loweſt, as the higheſt; and he gives this good <hi>Caveat</hi> withal, that we are not to preſſe this compariſon of Chriſt to a <hi>Corner-ſtone</hi> too far; no further than our Apoſtle meant it: which was, <hi>the joyning of two wals toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which before had been diſtant, and unſociable; to wit, the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Gentile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in everie compleat building, there muſt be more then two walls, four at the leaſt, and therefore four <hi>Corner-ſtones,</hi> four <hi>imi angulares lapides,</hi> four Foundation-ſtones, and four <hi>Summi angulares lapides,</hi> that is, four Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, or binding Corner-ſtones; and all theſe corner-ſtones are ſaid to be the <hi>chief</hi> in the building. It is evident, that Chriſt is the <hi>Firſt foundation-ſtone,</hi> and yet may it not be denyed that he is alſo the chief <hi>Corner-ſtone</hi> which binds the building. For in this ſenſe muſt that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 22. be underſtood: <hi>The Stone which the Builders refuſed is become the Head-Stone of the corner.</hi> For if we reſpect the literal ſenſe of this Propheſie, or the ground of the <hi>metaphor, the loweſt or foundation ſtone, being once refuſed by the builders, cannot by the ſame builders be layed in the foundation again,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they will pull down what they have built: But whileſt the foundation is in laying, a ſtone may be rejected, or laid aſide by the builders, as not ſo fitting to be laid in the Foundation (or to be any intermediate part of the edifice ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) and yet may come to be the fitteſt Stone for coupling or binding the building; that is, to be the ſupreme Corner-ſtone. The <hi>Author of the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick Hiſtorie</hi> hath a Tradition, for whoſe authoritie he (perhaps) could have produced better Warrant, then we can take from him, that in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſecond Temple (at whoſe conſecration, in all probabilitie, this 118. <hi>Pſalm</hi> was conceived) there was <hi>a peculiar Stone</hi> often layed aſide by the builders, as unfitting (in their judgement) to become any part of the foundation or intermediate building, which yet afterwards proved the fitteſt Corner-ſtone for binding or coupling together the walls erected. And the extraordinarie unexpected fitneſſe of this ſtone, to finiſh that building, for whoſe erection it was continually held unfit, <hi>did miniſter hint or occaſion unto the Pſalmiſt</hi> to ſay, <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="3351" facs="tcp:32220:33"/>
But leaving the truth or probabilitie of this <hi>Tradition</hi> to the ſearch of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries or Criticks, the literal or emblematicall ſenſe which the author makes of the Pſalmiſt, doth well ſuit with the allegorical and myſtical, which the <hi>Apoſtles S. Paul</hi> here, and <hi>S. Peter,</hi> Act. 4. 11. from our Saviours mouth, have made of the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> parabolicall ſpeech. For thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt (whom God had preſented and commended to the Maſter builders of his Temple, that is, to the Prieſts the Scribes and Phariſees, to the elders and chief rulers of the Synagogue, in the dayes of his humiliation here on earth,) was by them rejected, ſcoffed and ſpurned at, and laſtly buryed in the earth, as altogether uſeleſſe and unfit for Building. And yet, after his reſurrection, He became not onely <hi>imus,</hi> but <hi>ſummus angularis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis,</hi> not only the firſt firm <hi>Corner-ſtone</hi> or ſupporter, but the chief and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>Corner-ſtone</hi> too; aſwell the <hi>finiſhing</hi> as the <hi>Foundation</hi> of this ſpiritual Temple not made with hands. That Chriſt himſelfe is both the <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>finiſher,</hi> that is, both the higheſt perfection and loweſt foundation in this building, his owne interpretation of the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 42, 44. will neceſſarily inferre. <hi>Did you never read</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Scriptures, The ſtone which the Builders rejected, the ſame is become the head of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; this is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? And whoſoever ſhall fall on this Stone ſhall be broken: but on whom ſoever it ſhall fall it ſhall grind him to powder.</hi> Fall upon this <hi>corner-ſtone</hi> they could not, but as it was the loweſt in the building. Their fall upon it could not be ſo grievous as to break their limbs, unleſſe it had been layd deeper or lower then ordinary founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or corner-ſtones are uſually layd. And the myſtical ſenſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words is, that ſuch as ſpurned and ſtumbled at him, in his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſhould as it were break their limbes; But that this ſtone ſhould fall upon any, this in the literall ſenſe ſuppoſeth, that it ſhould be higher than they were, ſo high placed in this building, that the fall of it ſhould not bruiſe or break their limbes, but grind their bones to powder. And thus was the <hi>Jewiſh nation</hi> broken or cut off from being Gods people for their contempt of Chriſt in his humilitie. And not onely they, but all ſuch as continue the like contempt of his paſſion and reſurrection, ſhall by his ſecond coming (to Judgement) in glorie, be ground to powder; that is, the paines of their firſt breaking by falling upon this corner-ſtone ſhall be multiplied without end or meaſure.</p>
               <p>To conclude this <hi>ſecond Point; Christ is both Lapis ſummus angularis, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis imus, primus &amp; latiſſimus angularis,</hi> as Pineda ſaith <hi>in Chap.</hi> 38. <hi>Job.</hi> verſ. 6.

So Chriſt, who is the chief <hi>corner-ſtone</hi> of it, is that ſtone, which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw in viſions by night, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 34.

ſaid to grow into an holy temple, will better appear in diſcuſſing the <hi>third Point</hi> propoſed, which was, <hi>Concerning the manner how theſe Epheſians or others are ſaid to be built upon the foundation of the Prophets and the Apoſtles, and upon Jeſus Chriſt the chief Corner-ſtone; and how they grow into an Holie Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith that the ſtone cut without hands did become a <hi>Great Mountain,</hi> he ſuppoſeth, that it ſhould be a living ſtone. And <note place="margin">The 3. Point. propounded Paragr. 2.</note> when our Apoſtle here ſaith that the whole building doth <hi>grow unto an holy temple,</hi> it is included, that every part of this temple ſhould be a living ſtone. For growth, (ſuch growth as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of) is an effect of life. Things inanimate or without life, as materiall buildings, ſtones of the quarrie, or any heap or congeſt, may become greater by addition of matter unto them: they cannot <hi>Grow</hi> unto greatneſſe, as wanting the facultie of vegetation or Nutrition. That onely is capable of <hi>growth,</hi> which is capable of <hi>nutrition,</hi> and nothing is capable of nutrition, but that which is endowed with life. Hence ſaith <hi>S. Peter</hi> 1. Ep. cap. 2. verſ. 2. &amp;c. <hi>As new born babes deſire the Sincere milk of the word, that yee may grow thereby, if ſo be yee have taſted that the Lord is gracious.</hi> The <hi>Growth</hi> then of every Chriſtian, is more than the Growth of vegetables; for it includeth the ſenſe of taſt, wee muſt <hi>taſt</hi> the graciouſneſſe of the Lord by faith, and wee muſt come unto him by faith, as unto a <hi>Living ſtone, diſallowed of men, but choſen of God and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taious, and coming thus unto him,</hi> As the Apoſtle adds, verſ. 5. <hi>wee alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lively ſtones, and are built up a ſpirituall houſe, an holy</hi> Prieſthood <hi>to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable to God through Jeſus Chriſt. S. Peters</hi> infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in that place verſ. 6, 7, &amp;c. is the very ſame with our Apoſtle <hi>S. Pauls</hi> in this place; and ſo is the <hi>Uſe or Application</hi> of it <hi>the very ſame</hi> with that, which our Apoſtle makes in the later end of this Epiſtle. But <hi>of the Uſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It will in the meane time be very <hi>Uſefull</hi> for us to obſerve, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>S. Paul,</hi> nor <hi>S. Peter,</hi> when they purpoſely handled the building of the Gentiles upon this chief <hi>Corner-ſtone,</hi> do mention or intimate any other <hi>Foundation,</hi> on which wee are to be builded, before we be builded on Chriſt: <hi>Neither of them</hi> taught us to rely on themſelves, or on their <hi>perſonal faith,</hi> or their ſucceſſors Authoritie, as upon <hi>ſecondary founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> by Union with whom (or relying upon whom) we might be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the <hi>Prime Foundation,</hi> which is Chriſt.</q> 
                  <hi>If this they had taught us, they had taught us not to believe as they believed,</hi> and not believing as they believed, we could not poſſibly become ſuch live ſtones of this ſpirituall edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as they were.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if wee muſt beleeve as <hi>S. Peter</hi> believed, muſt wee not beleive as the Church beleeves? yes! Al that hope to be ſaved muſt believe as the true Church believes; and they onely are the true Church which believe as <hi>S. Peter</hi> believed. The Queſtion is, <hi>Who they be that believe as S. Peter believed?</hi> Theſe (wee ſay) are <hi>the members of Reformed Churches,</hi> or the Reformed Churches themſelves. <hi>No member of the Romiſh Church can poſſibly believe as S. Peter did unleſſe they will abandon the abſolute infallibilitie of the viſible Romiſh Church.</hi> For every one which beleeves as <hi>S. Peter</hi> did, muſt have the ſame Object of Faith which <hi>S. Peter</hi> had. He may not believe any Article of faith which <hi>S. Peter</hi> did not believe: he may not ſeek, he cannot hope to be built on the ſame Foundation on which <hi>Peter</hi> was built, by relying upon any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie <note place="margin">See Book 3. Chap. 7. 8. A Diſcourſe about, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> &amp;c.</note> upon which <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe did not rely. The manner of his union unto this <hi>Foundation</hi> muſt be the ſame that <hi>Peters</hi> was, as immediate as <hi>Peters</hi>

Union was. What then was the proper Object of <hi>Peters</hi> faith? What was the <hi>Fundamental Rock</hi> on which <hi>Peter</hi> was by this faith immediately built? <hi>That was only Chriſt, the Son of man, and the Son of the living God:</hi> 
                  <q>And the Branches which naturally iſſue out of this Root (or living Rock) are: That Chriſt the Son of the living God, the Son of God the Father, was Conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was Crucified, dead, and buried, &amp;c.</q> Did S. <hi>Peter</hi> believe all or any of theſe Articles by believing his own Authoritie? Was he founded on Chriſt by the intermediation, or interpoſition of any other <hi>ſecondarie foundation?</hi> Was he the foundation or Rock on which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was built? If we cannot believe theſe Articles, but by believing S. <hi>Peter</hi> or his <hi>perſonal faith,</hi> to be the Rock on which the Church is built, then <hi>Peter,</hi> or his <hi>perſonal faith,</hi> muſt be to us as a <hi>ſecond foundation.</hi> We cannot be united to Chriſt, we cannot be builded on Chriſt, unleſſe we be firſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto, and builded on <hi>Peter.</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> was not builded upon himſelf, or upon his own faith; wherefore if we be builded upon <hi>Peter</hi> or upon <hi>Peters</hi> faith, we have not the <hi>ſame Object of faith,</hi> nor the ſame faith which <hi>Peter</hi> had; for neither <hi>Peters perſon,</hi> nor <hi>his faith,</hi> were any part of the <hi>Object of his Faith.</hi> His <hi>Authoritie</hi> was no meanes of his Union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That the Object of Faith muſt be formally the very Same in all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the preſent Romiſh Church (if this were the Queſtion between her and us) could not deny.</hi> Her greateſt Clerks do expreſſely teach and maintaine it <hi>as a principle</hi> of true Divinitie. And maintaining this truth, they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe (unleſſe they will contradict themſelves) <hi>that we muſt be as immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to Chriſt by Faith,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> was; we muſt be as immediately build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Chriſt by this faith, as <hi>Peter</hi> was; we muſt not be built on him, by being built upon <hi>Petes Faith,</hi> or upon his <hi>ſucceſſors Infallible Authoritie.</hi> For ſo we ſhould have another <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Article of faith</hi> than <hi>Peter</hi> had, or his ſucceſſors have: We ſhould have another foundation then <hi>Pete</hi> had, as many more foundations as <hi>Peter</hi> hath ſucceſſors. Our Union with <hi>them</hi> ſhould be a part of our Union with Chriſt; Our Belief of their Infallible Authoritie, ſhould be the chief <hi>Bond</hi> of this Union, ſuch a bond or ſtay of our edification upon Chriſt as the ſtones or cement in a material building, is, between the loweſt foundation, and the intermediate Rows of ſtone which are layed one upon another until the higheſt Row be finiſhed. And to be thus united unto Chriſt, were to make him no living ſtone, which diffuſeth life unto all that are built upon him; but a dead ſtone, or a ſtone only able to ſupport the material or dead weight which is laid upon it; there ſhould be no growth in faith, but an addition, or cementing of one part unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until the edifice were finiſhed. Whereas our Apoſtles words are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, <hi>that all the building is fitly framed together in Chriſt, and ſo framed grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up unto an holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> He ſaith not, we are builded one upon another, but <hi>builded together</hi> in Him <hi>for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> This Spirit by which we are builded <hi>together</hi> in Chriſt, or through which we become the habitation of God, is not communicated and propagated unto us from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Succeſſors, as from intermediate Foundations or Roots. We, and all true believers, receive the influence of the Spirit, as immediately from Chriſt, or from God the Father and the Son, in the <hi>ſame manner</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did, though not in the <hi>ſame meaſure.</hi> But the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the <hi>meaſure</hi> in which we receive it, or the difference of our growth in Chriſt, doth not argue a different <hi>manner</hi> either of our receiving it, or of growth by it.</p>

7. But is this the worſt Practiſe of the Romiſh Church, <hi>that ſhe adds one Article more unto our Creed,</hi> than Saint <hi>Peter</hi> knew, or taught others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; or that ſhe makes <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors to have a Foundation which he had not? If thus ſhe did, and no more, this were enough to convince her of <hi>Groſſe Hereſie.</hi> But this one Article of faith, or this <hi>ſecond foundation</hi> of faith which ſhe pretends, is of ſuch a tranſcendent nature, that it devours all the reſt; and doth, if not overthrow the Firſt foundation of our faith, yet, which is all one, it draws us from it. For as many ſucceſſions as there be of Popes, or of <hi>Peters</hi> pretended ſucceſſors, ſo many ſeveral foundations there be of their faith, which ſucceſſively adhere unto them. Nor are theſe ſeveral or ſucceſſive foundations either immediately cemented, or firmly united to the <hi>firſt Foundation,</hi> which is Chriſt, or one to another: They are as ſo many Rows or Piles of ſtone laid one upon another without any juncture or binding, than looſe ſand. And all that abſolutely unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the preſent Romiſh Church, that is, to <hi>Peters</hi> pretended ſucceſſors, muſt of neceſſity fall off from the <hi>Firſt Foundation,</hi> Chriſt God and man, and flote with theſe <hi>ſecondarie foundations,</hi> to wit, <hi>Peters</hi> ſuccceſſors, when the floods of temptations do ariſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The point</hi> then to be proved is this, <hi>That the preſent Romiſh Church,</hi> to wit, <hi>the preſent Pope, or ſuch as rely upon him, as a ſecond or intermediate founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this structure, cannot poſſibly be built upon the foundation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Prophets, they cannot grow up together as living stones firmly united in Chriſt Jeſus, as in the Corner-ſtone.</hi> Now the <hi>proof</hi> of this Point is clear, becauſe none can be built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, unleſſe they abſolutely believe, as they believed, and firmly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that which they have commended unto us in their writings to have been delivered unto them by God himſelf; for ſo they expreſſely teach us to believe. Believing then as they believed, we muſt believe, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the Apoſtles and Prophets be not the <hi>Foundation</hi> here meant in the Text, yet, that they were <hi>Maſter</hi> Builders appointed by God for ſquaring and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all that lived with them, or that ſucceeded them, for this <hi>foundation;</hi> and that the <hi>Rule</hi> by which, as well the Paſtors and Teachers, as the people taught by them, muſt be fitted and ſquared for this <hi>foundation,</hi> is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith conteined in their Writings. Both theſe parts of <hi>truth,</hi> to wit, that the Books of the Old and New Teſtament are their Writings or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, and that in theſe Writings the Doctrine, or <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, muſt be abſolutely believed, and taken for unqueſtionable, before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny modern paſtors in the Church, can be fram'd or faſhioned to be true ſtones in this building. <q>But no man which <hi>abſolutely</hi> believes the preſent Romiſh Church, can have any <hi>abſolute</hi> belief, that the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, or the Writings of the Apoſtles and Prophets are infallibly true or contain the Word of God. The beſt belief that any Romaniſt can have is but <hi>Conditional,</hi> and the <hi>Condition</hi> is this, <hi>If the preſent Romiſh Church</hi> (to wit, the Pope, and ſuch as rely upon his authoritie) <hi>be abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> and cannot err in matter of faith.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it will be Replyed; In as much as the Roman Catholicks take it as a Principle moſt unqueſtionable, that <hi>their Church cannot erre,</hi> they for this reaſon muſt beleeve the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt to be infallible, and the bookes of the Old and New Teſtament to conteyne the word of God, becauſe the Church their Mother, which they firmely beleeve cannot erre, doth tell them ſo; or, (as their owne writers ſpeake) becauſe the Church their mother doth <hi>Canonize theſe bookes</hi>
                  <pb n="3355" facs="tcp:32220:35"/>
                  <hi>for the bookes of God.</hi> This indeed is the chiefe advantage, which they Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their Lay-people have of ours, in that they believe the Churches te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony concerning the bookes of God to be infallible, and if they beleeve the Church to be in this point infallible, they cannot doubt but that theſe bookes are the word of God.</p>
               <p>But if wee look more narrowly into this <hi>myſterie of iniquitie,</hi> and take their full meaning with us, it will further appear, that this <hi>abſolute belief</hi> of this preſent Churches abſolute infallibilite doth overthrow or undermine the whole frame of faith. For they extend this ſuppoſed infallibilitie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church ſo farre, and make the belief of it ſo neceſſarie, that without this <hi>fundamentall principle</hi> (as they ſay) wee cannot infallibly believe or know the bookes of the, Old and New Teſtament, to containe in them the word of God. And in avouching this, it is evident that they leave both the Authoritie of the Apoſtolical and Prophetical writings, and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Preſent Church, altogether uncertaine, ſo uncertaine, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing avouched by either of them can be (by their doctrine) ſo certain, as to become any <hi>Foundation</hi> of their faith. If wee cannot infallibly believe the bookes of the Old and New Teſtament to be the bookes of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and of divine Authoritie, otherwiſe then by believing the preſent Romiſh Church to be infallible, let them tell us how they can poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or prove, that the Romiſh Church, or any other Congregation of men, hath any ſuch infallible authoritie. This authoritie muſt be either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or known by light of nature, or by Divine Teſtimonie, or Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That the infallibilitie of their Church can be known by light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they do not, they dare not ſay. For that <hi>Peter,</hi> on whom that Church (as they pretend) is founded, was an Apoſtle of Chriſt, cannot be known by light of Nature, or by ſenſe; it cannot be infallibly believed, but by Divine Authoritie, Revelation, or Teſtimonie. By what Divine Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie then do they know that <hi>Peter</hi> was an Apoſtle, or that the Church was to be builded on him, or on his ſucceſſors? You know they pretend that place of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> Chap. 16. 18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church:</hi> and that of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> Chap. 22. 32. <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy faith ſhall not fail;</hi> And yet they deny, that we can poſſibly know theſe words to be the words of God, or to have any ſuch meaning as they make of them, unleſſe we will believe the Churches Authoritie, in avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be the words of God, and her interpretation of them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
               <p>But leaving them wandring in this <hi>Round</hi> or Circle, as we found them long agoe, let us further conſider the manner how we are built upon Chriſt <note place="margin">Book 2. ch. 30 <hi>Valentian</hi> his Inchanted Circle.</note> the Chief <hi>Corner-stone,</hi> and how we muſt grow unto an holy Temple in the Lord.</p>

                  <pb n="3356" facs="tcp:32220:36"/>
And for this cauſe Chriſt (who is the Rock) <hi>was every way digged into, in his ſide, in his hands, in his feet.</hi> The myſterie whereof is, <hi>that he might exhibit a firm foundation</hi> out of which <hi>the fabrick of the Church</hi> ſhould grow. That we then become living ſtones in this edifice, it is from our <hi>immediate Union</hi> with this chief <hi>corner-stone;</hi> being united to him, he is faſhioned in us: and by him faſhioned in us, we become living ſtones, growing ſtones: we grow from living ſtones to living pillars, from living pillars to living Temples, or <hi>habitations</hi> for our God. That the children of God are not onely living ſtones, but from living ſtones grow into pillars, our Saviour himſelfe hath taught us by <hi>S. John.</hi> Rev. 3. 12. <hi>Him that overcometh will I make A Pillar in the temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out; and</hi> if wee be pillars in the temple of God, we muſt be as immediately placed on the foundation or chief corner-ſtone as <hi>S. Peter</hi> or Chriſts other Apoſtles were: We muſt be as intire Temples as they were. And for this reaſon, our Saviour adds, <hi>upon every one whom he makes a pillar, the name of God and the name of the City of God the new Jeruſalem which cometh out of Heaven. Know ye not,</hi> ſaith S. Paul, 1 Cor. 6. 19. <hi>That your bodie is the temple of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> As wee ſay, the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence makes the Court; So it is Gods Holy Spirits extraordinary preſence in man which makes him his Temple. And the Reaſon why Chriſt is called <hi>The Temple of God,</hi> is becauſe <hi>the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily.</hi> And for the like reaſon every one in whom Chriſt dwelleth by faith, is, in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated ſenſe, called, <hi>The Temple of God.</hi> And as viſible Cities conſiſt of ſeverall houſes, and as the beautie of every Citie conſiſts in the Uniformitie of houſes well built and joyned together, ſo the heavenly Jeruſalem conſiſts of ſeveral Temples, whoſe beautie or Uniformitie conſiſts in this, that Chriſt Jeſus is the life and light of every ſeverall Temple, and that his ſpirit is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formely diffuſed through all.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Chriſt (as you have read before) Communicates his Titles unto his Saints, but not the <hi>Reall Prerogative of his Titles.</hi> He is <hi>The Rock,</hi> ſo was <hi>Peter</hi> a rock, ſo are wee rocks, but not <hi>The rock</hi> on which the Church is built. He is the <hi>Chiefe Corner-ſtone,</hi> we are living ſtones; he is the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Prieſt of the moſt high God; and he makes us both temples and Prieſts unto his God. So ſaith <hi>S. Peter.</hi> 1. Ep. cap. 2. verſ. 5. <hi>Yee all as lively ſtones are built up a ſpirituall houſe, an holy Prieſt-hood to offer up Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſacrifices acceptable to God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Modell</hi> of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Temple and Prieſt-hood (that is, of the new Jeruſalem, and the ſervice of God performed in it) was exhibited by <hi>Moſes</hi> Exod. 24. 4, 5. at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the firſt covenant. <hi>Moſes wrote all the words of the Lord, and roſe up earely in the morning, and builded an altar under the Hill, and twelve pillars according to the</hi> 12. <hi>tribes of Iſrael. And he ſent yong-men of the Children of Iſrael, which offered burnt offrings, and ſacrificed peace offerings of Oxen unto the Lord.</hi> Immediately, after this, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> ſaw the God of Iſrael: and there was under his feete, as it were a paved work of a ſaphire ſtone, and as it were the bodie of Heaven in his clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. The yong men which he ſent to offer ſacrifices (as the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters obſerve) were the firſt-born of their families. For till that time, and at that time, which was before the conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes, it was Lawfull for the Firſt born male of every family to execute the office of the Prieſt; This was his dutie. So that every family was as a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Church, and had his <hi>Prieſt,</hi> to performe this ſervice of God. Now though all that are built <hi>upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles,</hi> are not admitted to be <hi>Architects</hi> or maſter-builders, though all be not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="3357" facs="tcp:32220:36"/>
teachers or paſtors; yet all that are, or hope to be parts of this buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, have the ſame Prerogative which the Firſt-born males of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had before <hi>Aaron</hi> was conſecrated; All muſt be <hi>Prieſts</hi> to offer up <hi>Spiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> unto God. But ſeeing wee muſt <hi>grow</hi> unto an holy temple; and growth (as was ſaid before) ſuppoſeth <hi>nutrition,</hi> let us now ſee what is the nouriſhment by which we muſt grow from living ſtones to be living pillars, from pillars to be living Temples, yea Kings and Prieſts unto our <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. The nature and qualitie of the <hi>Nutriment</hi> by which wee muſt <hi>grow,</hi> cannot in fewer words be more pithily expreſt, than it is by <hi>S. Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. cap. verſ. 2. It is <hi>the ſincere milk of the word:</hi> But how good ſoever the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment be, it doth not kindly nouriſh unleſſe wee have an appetite to it; Therefore the ſame Apoſtle addes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>deſire, or long after, the ſincere milk of the word.</hi> We muſt then deſire to have the <hi>word dwell in us plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> and wee muſt deſire to have it <hi>ſincere,</hi> that is, pure and unmingled. Now this milk may become unſincere or mingled, ſometimes by the default of the <hi>Paſtor</hi> or <hi>teacher,</hi> ſometimes by the default of the <hi>hearers.</hi> The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which concernes us <hi>teachers</hi> is, that wee do not mingle the word, with the Traditions of men, how ancient ſoever they be. This is the fault of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> which the Church our mother hath ſufficiently prevented by publick edicts or decrees. But many otherwiſe averſe enough from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Romiſh or other ancient Church, ofttimes corrupt it with their own Conceits or Phanſies, which will eaſily mingle themſelves with the word, unleſſe we ſpeak out of premeditation, and have both art and leaſure to reviſe and examine, aſwell our own meditations, as the meditations or expoſitions of others whoſe help wee uſe. <q>Since the ordinary Gifts of the Spirit did ceaſe, there is no facultie under the ſun which more requires the help of art and ſtudy than the expoſition of Scriptures doth. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a greater skill then the skill of Alchymie, to extract the true ſenſe and meaning of the holy Ghoſt, from the plauſible gloſſes or expoſitions which are dayly made upon them.</q> But how ſincerely ſoever the word may be delivered by the <hi>Pastor,</hi> it may be corrupted by the <hi>hearer.</hi> Milk (as Phyſicians tell us) is turned into purer blood with greater facilitie, than any other nutriment, ſo the body which receives it, be free from humors; but if the ſtomack or other vitall parts, be ſtuft with Phlegm, oppreſt with Choler, or other corruption, there is no nutriment which is more eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or more apt to feed bad humors than milk, how pure ſoever it be. Thus though the ſincere milk of the word be not only the beſt, but the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nutriment of ſoules, by which wee muſt grow up in faith: yet if the heart which receives it from the preachers mouth, <hi>ſincere,</hi> be peſtered with corrupt affections, it doth not nouriſh; if it do not purge or purifie the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humours but mingle with them, they malignifie one another. The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall humours, which on the hearers part, corrupt the ſincere milk of the word, and of which every one that will be a diligent hearer, muſt endeavour to purge his ſoule by repentance, are ſet downe by <hi>S. Peter</hi> in the ſame Chapter, verſ. 1. <hi>Wherefore laying aſide all malice, all guile, and all hypocriſie, and envies, and evill-ſpeakings, as new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word.</hi> Wee muſt firſt, (then) deſire the word <hi>as Phyſick</hi> to purge our ſoules: That part of the word I mean, which teacheth Repentance, and denyall of all ungodlineſs, before wee can hope to grow by the milk of it, that is, by the comfort of Gods promiſes. Unleſſe our hearts be, in good meaſure purified, by obedience to the Generall precepts, or morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; how ſincere ſoever the milk of the <hi>word</hi> preached be, our deſire of it
<pb n="3358" facs="tcp:32220:37"/>
cannot be ſincere; wee ſhall deſire it, or delight in it, to maintain Faction, or ſecret pride, not to <hi>grow</hi> up thereby in ſinceritie of mind and humbleneſſe of ſpirit, which are the moſt proper effects of the <hi>milk of the word</hi> ſincerely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and ſincerely received.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> whether we take it in the <hi>Greek,</hi> in the <hi>Latin,</hi> or in our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is ſometimes a <hi>Title on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Reſpect</hi> or courteſie: So ſtrangers uſually ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute men of place or note, by the name of <hi>Dominus,</hi> or ſometimes of <hi>Domination</hi> it ſelf. And we uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtile the Eldeſt Sons of <hi>Earles</hi> by the title of <hi>Lords;</hi> And all the Sons of <hi>Dukes,</hi> even from their Cradles are ſo inſtiled. Not to vouchſafe them this Title, when we mention them, were ill manners or diſcourteſie. Howbeit, even they which are bound to
<pb n="3359" facs="tcp:32220:37"/>
love them beſt, the very parents of their bodies, do not permit them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the <hi>Realities</hi> anſwering to theſe honourable <hi>Titles,</hi> before their full age; and for the moſt part till they themſelves have ſurrendred them by death. The <hi>Realitie</hi> anſwering to this title of <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>Dominion.</hi> Every one that hath <hi>Dominion</hi> is a <hi>Lord,</hi> in reſpect of that over which he hath <hi>Dominion;</hi> and whoſoever really is a <hi>Lord,</hi> is ſo inſtiled from ſome <hi>Dominion,</hi> which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth. <hi>Dominus</hi> in Latin ſometimes goes for no more then our Engliſh word <hi>[Owner:]</hi> and this is the loweſt or meaneſt ſignification of the word, <hi>Lord.</hi> The full <hi>Extent</hi> or higheſt value of the word <hi>Dominus,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> muſt be gathered from the ſeveral degrees, or ſcale of <hi>Dominion;</hi> as either from the <hi>Extent</hi> of the matter or ſubject over which <hi>Dominion</hi> is exerciſed, or from the <hi>Soveraigntie</hi> of Title. <hi>Dominion,</hi> as Lawyers define it, is <hi>A Facultie or power, fully to diſpoſe of any corporal or bodily ſubſtance, ſo far as they are not reſtrained by law.</hi> And by how much a mans power to diſpoſe of what he hath, is leſſe reſtrained by law, by ſo much his <hi>Dominion</hi> over it is the greater; and he, in reſpect of it, is, if not ſo much a <hi>greater Lord,</hi> yet ſo much more <hi>properly a Lord.</hi> But fitting it is, in regard of publick good, or of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, that moſt mens power to diſpoſe of that, which otherwiſe by full right is their own, ſhould be in certain Caſes reſtrained. Many are <hi>Lords</hi> of great Lands, and may diſpoſe of their annual profits as they pleaſe; but yet cannot ſell, or alienate their perpetual inheritance.</p>
               <p>Others have a more full power to diſpoſe of the houſes wherein they dwell, a power not only to let or ſet them for yeers, but to ſell or give away the perpetual inheritance; who yet are by Law reſtrained utterly to demoliſh or ſet them on fire, eſpecially if they be incloſed by neighbour Lodgings. The Caſes are many, wherein <hi>Dominuim ſub altiore dominio eſt.</hi> There is a ſub ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Lordſhips or Dominions; ſome are <hi>Mean Lords,</hi> ſome are <hi>Chief Lords.</hi> Even <hi>meaner Lords</hi> or owners are not to be denyed the titles of <hi>Lords,</hi> albeit they cannot alienate the ſoil, whereof they are owners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licence of the <hi>Chief Lord;</hi> much more are chief or <hi>higher Lords</hi> to be ſo reputed, becauſe their <hi>Dominion</hi> or power to diſpoſe of their own Lands is leſſe ſubordinate; howbeit in ſome caſes limited by the Rule of Law. And this reſtraint, in how few caſes ſoever it be, hinders their greatneſſe from growing into abſolute <hi>Dominion: Lords</hi> they are, but not <hi>abſolute Lords.</hi> This is a <hi>Title</hi> peculiar to <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Monarches,</hi> who are ſo called only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their <hi>own ſubjects,</hi> or of their <hi>own Lands.</hi> No meere mortal man ſince Adam was <hi>Lord</hi> of the whole earth, or bare ſoveraigntie over all men or bodily ſubſtances. And the greateſt of men have been ſubject or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Angels.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To leave other diviſions of <hi>Dominion</hi> to Lawyers; All <hi>Dominion</hi> is either, <hi>Juriſdictionis</hi> or <hi>Proprietatis;</hi> A power of Juriſdiction, or a right to the Propertie. The former branch of <hi>Dominion,</hi> is exerciſed only over men or reſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which only are capable of <hi>Juriſdiction paſſive,</hi> or of <hi>Government.</hi> The later branch, which we call <hi>Dominion of propertie,</hi> for the moſt part reſpects things corporall. Howbeit, even men or reaſonable creatures are ſometimes ſubject to <hi>both Branches of Dominion,</hi> but in different meaſure, according to the ſeverall rites or cuſtomes of diverſe <hi>ages, nations,</hi> or <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Such as the <hi>Latins</hi> call <hi>Servi</hi> or <hi>Servuli,</hi> ſlaves (or ſervants properly ſo called) were <hi>in bonis Domini;</hi> they were the goods or poſſeſſion of their Maſters. Theſe bodily Lords had not only <hi>Dominion of Juriſdiction over,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See Book 8. Ch. 7. And Book 10. Chap. 15, 16.</note> but <hi>Dominion of propertie, to their perſons.</hi> No law did reſtrain their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters from diſpoſing of theſe ſervants as they pleaſed; as either to exchange,
<pb n="3360" facs="tcp:32220:38"/>
give away or ſell, them and their children. The poor ſervants did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>mutare dominum, non ſervitutem,</hi> change their Lords, without any exchange or alteration of their ſlaverie. Sometimes the <hi>Romans</hi> had, and ſome other nations at this day have, <hi>Dominium vitae &amp; necis,</hi> power or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to kill, maim or wound their ſervants without any reſtraint or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll of law. But this abſolute power to diſpoſe of their ſlaves or ſervants was afterwards by the <hi>Romane</hi> Law inhibited. Lords and Maſters of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſervants were lyable to the ſentence of publick Law, if they did uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable crueltie or ſeveritie towards their ſlaves. But, by the Lawes or moſt <hi>Chriſtian nations,</hi> this <hi>abſolute Dominion of Lords</hi> over their ſervants, (and conſequently this kind of ſubjection and ſlaverie) is taken away. For every Chriſtian is an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> or <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and ſomewhat more. All are in reputation <hi>the Sons of Abraham.</hi> Now the poſitive Law of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviours time, did exempt the Sons of <hi>Abraham</hi> by the free wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from ſlaverie. The Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> might not make bondmen of their brethren the Sons of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Albeit we retein the name of <hi>Maſters</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> yet neither are the one ſort properly called <hi>Domini,</hi> nor the other <hi>Servi.</hi> A maſter with us is no more then <hi>Pater familias</hi> amongſt the Latines; and thoſe whom we call <hi>ſervants,</hi> are <hi>famuli.</hi> Every Father of a familie hath <hi>Dominium Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis,</hi> a right or power of Juriſdiction over his familie, but not <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium proprietatis,</hi> not right, or power of propertie in their perſons. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, even this power or <hi>Dominion</hi> of <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> is limited, as well by the Lawes of God, as of man. No father of his family may correct any of his familie as he pleaſeth, but in ſuch caſes, and ſo far as the Law will permit; And according to the different condition of the parties, over whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the familie hath this power of <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> or correction, muſt the exerciſe of it be alwayes tempered: No husband or Maſter of a familie may exerciſe the ſame power over his wife, which he doth over his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. No man by the Law of nature ought to uſe his children, as his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or apprentices; unleſſe they be <hi>ſuch</hi> by eſtate or condition of life. Nor can a Maſter of a familie, which is of a more ingenuous or generous profeſſion, put his ſervants or apprentices, which are of the ſame profeſſion, upon ſuch ſervices, as a Maſter of ſome inferiour trade or profeſſion may put his ſervants to. A Merchant may not imploy an apprentice to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, in ſuch workes and ſervices, as are proper to, and well befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Tinker or Cobler, or ſome other inferiour crafts-man, or day la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer. Howbeit, every Maſter of an apprentice or hired ſervant hath a right or power, not only of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> or of government, but of <hi>propertie,</hi> though not over his ſervants <hi>bodie</hi> or <hi>perſon,</hi> yet over his <hi>bodily labours</hi> or imployments. Apprentices or ſervants, which are as free born, and of parentage as good, perhaps better, then their Maſters, have no power to diſpoſe of their own Labours or imployments, but muſt herein follow their Maſters directions and appointment; and in caſe they alienate their induſtrie from their Maſters ſervice, though to their owne profit, without his leave, they are ſubject to his power or <hi>Juriſdiction;</hi> he may authoritatively ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, chaſtiſe, or otherwiſe require ſatisfaction for wronging him by miſ-expenſe of time, or in that power or intereſt which he hath <hi>by Covenant</hi> in their labours or imployments. Yet may not any maſter of a familie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a ſervant as he pleaſeth, or as his paſſion ſhall ſuggeſt, but ſo far only as the Law ſhall permit: For every maſter of a private familie is under the power or <hi>Dominion</hi> of the publick Magiſtrate, and ſubject, if he be a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi>
                  <pb n="3361" facs="tcp:32220:38"/>
                  <hi>to Eccleſiaſtick Cenſure,</hi> in caſe he tranſgreſſe the manner or meaſure of the puniſhment, which the Law of God or of man doth permit him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe only within his familie. Nor may any Maſter exact thoſe ſervices or bodily imployments of his ſervants or apprentices at all times, or upon all dayes, which at ſometimes, or upon moſt dayes, he may. If a ſervant ſhould refuſe to labour in his ordinary vocation upon the <hi>Lords day,</hi> though commanded ſo to do by his Maſter, the Maſter hath no lawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> over him, no power to chaſtiſe him for ſuch refuſall; becauſe the Maſters right or power to diſpoſe either of his own, or of his ſervants imployments, for that day, is inhibited by the Law of God, and of his Church, which hath <hi>Dominion of Iuriſdiction</hi> in thoſe Caſes over Maſters.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The iſſue of theſe Generalities concerning <hi>Lordſhip</hi> or <hi>dominion,</hi> is this. <q>Though there be many which are called <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Masters,</hi> (and many there be which really and indeed are ſuch) yet is there in truth, but <hi>One Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Lord,</hi> whether we ſpeak of <hi>the Lordſhip</hi> or Dominion of <hi>proprietie,</hi> or of <hi>Iuriſdiction,</hi> and that is <hi>God.</hi>
                  </q> For by right or title of Creation he hath more abſolute power over all his creatures, then any creature, then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Monarchs</hi> (as we call them) then any <hi>chief Lord</hi> hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Lands or Goods, over any thing which they can call <hi>theirs;</hi> whether by gift, purchaſe, or inheritance. For whatſoever by theſe, or any other means is <hi>theirs,</hi> as money, goods, or any other bodily ſubſtance, they did not make any parcel or matter of the ſubſtance of it, but only acquired a right or title to it being made. As they cannot create or make any thing out of nothing, ſo can they not utterly deſtroy or annihilate any thing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated or made. The height of all created Power is only to amend or marre the faſhion of things, and this is but permitted; yea even the <hi>permiſſion</hi> it ſelf preſuppoſed, this power is ſtill ſubordinate in the exerciſe of it, to an higher power. But God doth found his right of <hi>Dominion over all things,</hi> or his power to diſpoſe of them and of their appurtenances, <hi>in their very radical Being.</hi> This is his ſole Gift. Nor is His <hi>power</hi> or <hi>dominion</hi> only more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, or <hi>intenſively</hi> greater over the moſt noble bodily ſubſtance that is, then any creature can have over the leaſt thing that is; but it extends alſo unto thoſe ſubſtances, which are not ſubject to man, or any creatures <hi>dominion.</hi> He hath a more Soveraign Title of dominion over the ſouls and ſpirits of Kings and Monarchs, over the bleſſed Angels under whoſe Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the greateſt Monarchs are, then they have over their meaneſt Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>His dominion</hi> extends beyond the definition given by Lawyers, which comprehends only <hi>things corporal,</hi> but meddles not with <hi>coelestial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as <hi>Angels,</hi> which are not ſubject to the <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> of Princes, nor can they be impriſoned in their coffers. Men, as they could not make themſelves, ſo neither can they by their valour, wit, or induſtrie, gain or create a title to any thing, which is not Gods, and whereof he is not <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lord</hi> before and after they come to be <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>owners ſubordinate</hi> of it. They cannot move their bodies, nor imploy their minds, but by his free do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; nor can they enjoy his freeſt gifts, but by his concurſe or Co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. He hath a <hi>Dominion of propertie</hi> over their ſouls, yea an <hi>abſolute dominion,</hi> not of <hi>propertie</hi> only, but of uncontrollable <hi>iuriſdiction</hi> over their very <hi>thoughts,</hi> as it is implyed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 17, 18. He doth not only give us the ſubſtance, which we are enabled to get, but gives us the very power, wit, and ſtrength, to get or gather it; Not this power only, whereby we gather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="3362" facs="tcp:32220:39"/>
but our very <hi>Being,</hi> which ſupports this power, is his gift; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe our <hi>Being</hi> be ſupported and ſtrengthned hy <hi>his power ſuſtentative,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as think of gathering wealth or getting neceſſaries, much leſs can we diſpoſe of our own endeavours for accompliſhing our hopes, deſires, or thoughts. To conclude then, All we have, even wee our ſelves are, Gods by <hi>abſolute Dominion,</hi> as well of <hi>propertie</hi> as of <hi>Iuriſdiction.</hi> There is no Law in heaven or earth, that can inhibit or reſtrayne his <hi>abſolute Power</hi> to diſpoſe of all things as he pleaſeth; for he works all things by the <hi>Counſel of his Will,</hi> and <hi>He only is Abſolute Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>abſolute Lordſhip</hi> or <hi>Dominion,</hi> how far ſoever extended, though over <hi>Angels, Powers, and Principalites,</hi> from this ground or <hi>univerſal Title of Creation,</hi> is intirely, jointly, and indiviſibly common to the <hi>Bleſſed Trinitie.</hi> For ſo <hi>S.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Of the</hi> Real grounds <hi>unto this</hi> Title.</head>
               <p n="1">1. COncerning the name of <hi>Lord,</hi> there is no verbal difference in the <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> whether this name or <hi>Title</hi> be attributed to <hi>God the Father</hi> (as oft it is) or to <hi>God the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> unto the Bleſſed <hi>Trinitie,</hi> or unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> God and Man. Yet in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> there is a difference in the very <hi>Names</hi> or words. The Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is uſually rendred <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Dominus,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> is alike common to every Perſon in the Holie <hi>Trinitie,</hi> as expreſſing the Nature of the <hi>God-head [he that is being it ſelf:]</hi> Howbeit, even <hi>this Name</hi> is ſometimes in peculiar ſort attributed unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Son of God, is in thoſe places perſonally meant, this muſt be gathered from the <hi>Subject,</hi> or ſpecial Circumſtances of the matter, not from the <hi>Name</hi> or Title it ſelf. But the name <hi>Adonai,</hi> which properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Lord or King, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek doth (implying as much as the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> or <hi>Foundation of the people)</hi> is the <hi>peculiar Title</hi> of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> or of
<pb n="3363" facs="tcp:32220:39"/>
God incarnate. And for attributing <hi>this Title</hi> unto Chriſt as <hi>his peculiar,</hi> the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a good warrant out of the <hi>Prophetical Writings,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which he queſtionleſſe underſtood a great deal better then many great Divines, and accurate Linguiſts have done his writings, or the harmonie betwixt the <hi>Pſalmiſts,</hi> and his <hi>Evangelical Comments</hi> on them. This <hi>Title of Lord [Adonai]</hi> is uſed moſt frequently in thoſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> which contain the moſt pregnant Prophecies of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Meſſias</hi> his exaltation. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 2, 4. <hi>The Kings of the earth band themſelves, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are aſſembled together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt. But he that dwelleth in the heavens</hi> (doubtleſſe he means the ſame <hi>Jehovah) ſhall laugh.</hi> Yet he doth not ſay, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but <hi>Adonai, the Lord ſhall have them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Reality of Dominion</hi> anſwering to this Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> whereunto the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> againſt whom they conſpired, was exalted, is more fully expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſame <hi>Pſalm, v.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy poſſeſſion. Thou ſhalt cruſh them with a Scepter of Iron, and break them in pieces like a Potters veſſel. Be wiſe now therefore ye Kings, be learned ye Judges of the earth: ſerve the Lord in fear, and rejoyce in trembling. Kiſſe the Son</hi> (the Son doubtleſſe of <hi>Jehovah) leſt he be angry, and ye periſh in the way, when his wrath ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly burn; Bleſſed are all they that truſt in him.</hi> And ſo again <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. which is as it were the <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> or marriage ſong of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Church: The Prophet exhorts the Spouſe to do, as Chriſt willed his Diſciples to do, and as <hi>Abraham</hi> had done at Gods Command, <hi>Forget thine own people, and thy Fathers houſe, ſo ſhall the King have pleaſure in thy beauty, for he is the Lord; reverence or worſhip him v.</hi> 10, 11. And again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. wherein <hi>Chriſts</hi> everlaſting Prieſthood is confirmed by Oath, it is ſaid, <hi>Jehovah ſaid to my Lord [Adonai] ſit thou at my Right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foot-stool.</hi> But may not the <hi>Jew</hi> thus Object; that ſeeing our <hi>Chriſt</hi> or their expected <hi>Meſſias</hi> is enſtyled <hi>Adonai,</hi> not <hi>Jehovah,</hi> in theſe very pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherein his <hi>Exaltation</hi> or ſupreme <hi>Dominion</hi> is foretold; That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not truly God, as <hi>Jehovah</hi> is? To this Objection our <hi>Saviours Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> (which had anſwer'd him rightly, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be the <hi>Son of David)</hi> is unanſwerable and moſt ſatisfactorie. If the expected <hi>Meſſias</hi> were not to be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and truly <hi>God</hi> the ſupreme <hi>Lord,</hi> as well of the dead, as of the living, why did <hi>David in ſpirit call him Lord,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was <hi>the Son of David?</hi> It is a point to be obſerved, that the <hi>Iews</hi> in our <hi>Saviours</hi> time did not, or could not deny, that this <hi>Pſalm</hi> was lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally meant of their expected <hi>Meſſias,</hi> albeit the later <hi>Iews</hi> ſeek to wreſt it (but moſt ridiculouſly) ſome to <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> ſome to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that the word <hi>[Adonai]</hi> is of no leſſe value or importance then <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> but only imports <hi>Iehovah, or God incarnate,</hi> or the <hi>Meſſias</hi> his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be <hi>Lord or King,</hi> may be evinced againſt the <hi>Iew;</hi> for that the ſame ſacrifices of praiſe and thankſgiving, which <hi>One Pſalmist</hi> ſolemnly offers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iehovah, Another Pſalmiſt</hi> (or perhaps the ſame) doth alike ſolemnly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up to <hi>[Adonai]</hi> or to the expected <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in another Pſalm. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. (which is a Prophetical Song of <hi>David,</hi> and containes the Exaltation of his God and Lord,) <hi>Exalt thy ſelf O God above the heaven, and let thy glory be upon all the earth,</hi> ver. 5, 11. This Prophecie was then punctually fulfilled, and <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, or requeſt ſigned by the mouth of <hi>God,</hi> when our <hi>Saviour</hi> after his Reſurrection ſaid; <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and in earth; go therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name</hi>

I will ſing and give praiſe. Awake Viol and Harp, I will awake early. I will praiſe thee O Lord, among the people, I will ſing unto thee among the Nations.

                  <hi>Firſt, That Adonai, or Lord, was the known Title of the Meſsias,</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> expected in our <hi>Saviours</hi> time; and this was the reaſon that the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſces</hi> had not a word to anſwer or rejoyn unto our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> was to be <hi>The Son of God,</hi> becauſe <hi>David in Spirit cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him [Adonai] Lord,</hi> Matth. 22. 45. <hi>The ſecond; That he that was Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, or the Meſsias, was likewiſe</hi> Jehovah, <hi>truly God,</hi> becauſe <hi>David</hi> did not in ſpirit onely call him <hi>Lord,</hi> but did in ſpirit worſhip him, as <hi>his Lord and God,</hi> with the beſt ſacrifice that he could deviſe, as appears from <hi>Pſalm</hi> 57. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A great part of the <hi>Book of Pſalms,</hi> even all thoſe paſſages (if my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation fail me not) without exception, which mention the extraordinary manifeſtation of Gods glory, or his exaltation as <hi>King,</hi> run the ſame way, and as it were pay Tribute unto the infinite <hi>Ocean of Gods mercy;</hi> firſt manifeſted in our <hi>Saviours Exaltation</hi> to the right hand of God.</q> The more remarkable Paſſages are theſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Jehovah reigneth, let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the Iſles be glad.</hi> Whileſt <hi>Jehovah</hi> was <note place="margin">The Exaltation of <hi>Jehovah</hi> as King, is that Kingdom of Heaven which S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> preached, to be then approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> onely known in <hi>Jurie,</hi> the multitude of the Iſles or Nations, had no ſpecial reaſon to be glad, for <hi>Iudah was then his Sanctuary and Iſrael his dominion;</hi> but after God had given our <hi>Saviour Chriſt the utmoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion;</hi> that is, after our <hi>Saviours Aſcenſion</hi> into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt upon his Diſciples, enabling them to preach the Goſpel of the Kingdom unto all Nations, the <hi>multitude of the Iſles,</hi> the whole Earth had reaſon to rejoyce: Then was that fulfilled, which followeth in that <hi>Pſal. ver.</hi> 6. <hi>The Heavens declare his righteouſneſs, and all the people ſaw his Glory.</hi> That this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is literally meant of <hi>Chriſts Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation to be Lord of Lords,</hi> and of his <hi>Inauguration to his everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 1. 6. puts out of queſtion amongſt all Chriſtians; <hi>when he bringeth in his firſt begotten Son into the world, he ſaith, Let all the Angels of God worſhip him;</hi> ſo the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had ſaid in this 97. <hi>Pſal. ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Confounded be all they that ſerve graven Images, worſhip Him all ye Gods;</hi> or as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> (upon which our Apoſtle often Paraphraſed) <hi>Worſhip him all ye Angels of God.</hi> The matter or ſubject of <hi>this Pſalm</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. Both of them contain Propheſies concerning the Declaration of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the <hi>Son of God.</hi> And from this harmonie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this 97. and the <hi>ſecond Pſalm,</hi> and from the common <hi>Prenotion</hi> or Rule of interpreting Scriptures, known to the Learned or unpartially ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant in thoſe days, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> adds that Preface unto his Teſtimonie; <hi>when he bringeth in his onely begotten Son into the World:</hi> He ſuppoſeth that the Learned among his Countrie-men ſhould or might have known that

               <p n="3">3. Yet ſome conjecture that our <hi>Apoſtle, Heb.</hi> 1. 6. hath reference rather to <note place="margin">The Septuagint <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 43. reconciled with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>ver.</hi> 43. in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation, then unto the 97 <hi>Pſalm</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> The words indeed in the Greek or <hi>Septuagint</hi> are the very ſame, though in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> not the ſame by any Equivalencie of the literal ſenſe. <hi>At nec ſic quidem malè.</hi> There is a <hi>varietie</hi> of ſenſe, yet no <hi>diſcord,</hi> but rather a full and perfect <hi>Conſort</hi> between the <hi>Literal</hi> and <hi>Grammatical</hi> ſenſe of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the <hi>myſtical</hi> and <hi>real</hi> ſenſe, which the Greek or <hi>Septuagint</hi> in both places expreſſeth. Firſt, The 97 <hi>Pſalm</hi> (as many others are) is a Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal deſcant upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his divine Prophetical Song, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. And the 70 Interpreters (whether out of ſome <hi>Prenotion,</hi> or out of the admirable Concord between that ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the 97 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> or out of a divine <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> wherewith (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is of opinion) they were impelled ſometimes to interſert a more expreſs meaning of the Holie Ghoſt, then an ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator could out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> have obſerved; whether this way, or that way moved, they) have given the ſame Paraphraſe upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>ver.</hi> 43. which our Apoſtle hath made upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. which is no other then the <hi>Septuagint</hi> had made before, but literally more conſonant to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> then their Paraphraſe upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. is.</p>
               <p>But more probable it is, that our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did aim at the 97. <hi>Pſal.</hi> then at the forecited place of <hi>Deut.</hi> becauſe the other Teſtimonies following in that <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 8, 9. are evidently taken out of the Book of <hi>Pſalmes: unto the</hi> SON, <hi>he ſaith;</hi> O GOD, <hi>Thy throne is for ever and ever, the Scepter of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a Scepter of righteouſneſs. Thou haſt loved righteouſneſs, and hated iniquitie, wherefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyle of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs above thy fellowes.</hi> This Teſtimonie is evident in the 45. <hi>Pſal. v.</hi> 6, 7. So is that other <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12. expreſſely contained in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102, <hi>Thou Lord in the beginning haſt eſtabliſhed the earth, and the heavens are the workes of thine hands; They ſhall periſh, but thou dost remain, and they all ſhall wax old, as doth a garment; And as a veſture ſhalt thou fold them up, and they ſhall be changed; But thou art the ſame, and thy yeares ſhall not fail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former teſtimonie is perhaps <hi>Typically Propheticall,</hi> and may in ſome ſort concern <hi>Salomon</hi> according to the literal ſenſe, but <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> only as he was a Type of that <hi>Son of David,</hi> who was likewiſe to be the <hi>Son of God.</hi> But the Character almoſt of every line in the hundred and ſecond <hi>Pſalm,</hi> teſtifies, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in this grievous complaint had more then a <hi>Typical</hi> repreſentation, ſuch a diſtinct and clear viſion of <hi>Chriſts Glorie</hi> and Exaltation as the Prophet <hi>Eſay Chap.</hi> 53. had of his humiliation in our fleſh or humane nature. The Title of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is, <hi>A prayer of the afflicted, when he ſhall be in diſtreſs, and powr forth his meditations before the Lord.</hi> And, <hi>The only fountain of comfort to all afflicted in bodie or ſoul is the Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>

4. The more extraordinary and more ſpecial <hi>Grounds</hi> or <hi>Baſes</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Title of Lord, as it is peculiar to Chriſt,</hi> is erected, are theſe.

Now, not onely our redemption from the eſtate of Slaverie unto Satan, but all the means for our further advancement (after our ranſom was paid) were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by <hi>the Son of God:</hi> And that, which moſt advanceth the <hi>peculiar Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Chriſts Dominion and Lordſhip</hi> over us, was the price which he gave for us: <hi>For we were not redeemed with corruptible things, as with ſilver and gold</hi> (though men with theſe, and things more corruptible then theſe, do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the real title of <hi>Lords,</hi> and exerciſe the dominion of Lords over Lands or Servants ſo purchaſed) <hi>but we were redeemed by the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb undefiled and without ſpot,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Blood is the moſt precious and deareſt part of mans bodie, and greater love we cannot teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unto our deareſt friends, then by ſpending our blood for them. Loſſes we value none ſo deeply as forgetfulneſs, ungrateful neglects, or contempt from them for whoſe ſakes and credit we have been content (ſpecially out of ſinceritie of love and ſober reſolution) to ſhed our blood: Never was any blood either ſo copiouſly ſhed, or out of the like ſinceritie of love, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety of reſolution, as Chriſts blood was ſhed for all and every one of us; This blood did immediatly iſſue from his Man-hood, whereof it was a true and lively part; yet was it the <hi>blood not of Man onely, but of God:</hi> whence if we conſider either <hi>our own miſerable eſtate,</hi> being then the enemies of God, or <hi>his dignitie</hi> that made Attonement for us; What real portion, branch, or degree of ſervice can we imagin anſwerable to this <hi>Soveraign Title of Lord,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not more then fully purchaſed over all that are partakers of fleſh and blood?</p>

Sin and ſlaverie was the <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> the condition or ſtate from which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us; but the end of our redemption from theſe, was to inveſt us <hi>in the libertie of the Sons of God.</hi> The height of all our hopes in the life to come, is, to be <hi>Kings and Prieſts</hi> as he is; but in the mean time we are or may be, live members of <hi>his Glorious Body;</hi> and being ſuch, he hath a more <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar right of Dominion</hi> over us, over all that pertain unto his Church, then by right of Creation he hath as <hi>God,</hi> then by right of Redemption or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement he hath as <hi>God and Man:</hi> For, That part of our nature, that fleſh and blood which he took of his Mother, was his by a more <hi>peculiar Title</hi> and real property, then it was God the Fathers or the Holie Ghoſts; and we by myſtical and ſpiritual union with that part of the humane nature, which he aſſum'd into the Unitie of his Divine Perſon, are <hi>His,</hi> at leaſt <hi>He</hi> by this union is our <hi>Head and Lord,</hi> by a more ſtrict and proper Title, then God the Father or God the Holie Ghoſt is: By the former <hi>Title of Redemption</hi> or ſatisfaction made for us, he is our <hi>Lord,</hi> and we his ſervants: By this <hi>Title of myſtical Union</hi> with him, he is the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> or <hi>Head,</hi> the Church is his Spouſe; and being Head of the Church, every member of it is bound (as God by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> exhorts the Spouſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.) <hi>to worſhip him as our Lord and God,</hi> for the husband is Lord of the wife. He bought all our ſouls being in the ſtate of Aliens or bond-ſervants, and after cleanſed and purified them, that they might be eſpouſed to him, and finally preſented to his Father: He hath <hi>purchaſed the Church of God</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) with his own blood,</hi> Acts 20. 28.

               </p>
               <p>To begin with <hi>the Former:</hi> when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>That every tongue muſt Confeſſe that Jeſus Chriſt is</hi> THE LORD; You muſt take this <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal note</hi> to be equivalent to that phraſe ſo often uſed (in the Book of the <hi>Revelation)</hi> by the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> and <hi>Apoſtle; [all nations and Kindreds, all people and Tongues] every one, of all Sorts, of the Sons of Adam, are bound,</hi> de Jure, <hi>to confeſſe,</hi> 
                  <q>That Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God, and the ſon of man, conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> is THE LORD, of the Dying and of the Living, of the Quick and of the Dead.</q> As for all ſuch as do not either in heart or tongue, or in both, either by themſelves or by others for them, truly acknowledge <hi>Him</hi> in this life to be <hi>ſuch a Lord,</hi> they <hi>ſhall</hi> acknowledge <hi>Him</hi> to be <hi>ſuch A Lord</hi> after their Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from death, of which likewiſe <hi>He is Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But the acknowledgment of <hi>Every Tongue,</hi> or of every one, to whom God hath vouchſafed either a tongue or the uſe of the tongue, will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to find him <hi>a Gracious Lord</hi> at the reſurrection from the dead, and at the day of finall Judgment. There muſt be, (as is ſaid) an <hi>Univerſalitie</hi> as well <hi>of duties</hi> and ſervices to be performed by every particular perſon to whom God hath given an heart to underſtand, as an <hi>univerſalitie of tongues</hi> or lips, which are to make this <hi>confeſſion.</hi> The <hi>real language of every heart</hi> will be ſufficient for every one in particular, whom God hath deprived or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="3369" facs="tcp:32220:42"/>
the uſe of the tongue. But unto him, to whom God hath given an underſtanding heart, and the uſe of the tongue alſo, the hearty prayers and gracious words of others in his behalfe will not ſuffice, unleſs God by their praiers do frame his heart to beleive, and move his tongue (if God have given him the uſe of the tongue) to <hi>Confeſs that Ieſus Chriſt is the Lord.</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de creditur ad juſtitiam, ore fit confeſſio ad ſalutem. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs, with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt beleive in thine heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth unto righteouſnes, and with the mouth confesſion is made unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Rom. 10. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Univerſalitie</hi> or extent of this Belief or <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>parties</hi> whom it concernes, is moſt fully expreſt in the verſe following. For the Scripture ſaith, Eſa. 28. 16. <hi>Whoſoever believeth on him ſhall</hi> (not make haſte, or) <hi>not be aſhamed.</hi> And again Joel 2. 32. <hi>Whoſoever calleth on the name of the Lord</hi> (whether he be Jew or Gentile) <hi>ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Thus you ſee, that there is an <hi>univerſalitie of the parties</hi> or perſons, which are bound <hi>de Jure</hi> to make this <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and an <hi>Univerſalitie</hi> of comfortable promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto all ſuch as make it as they ought; that is, not in <hi>tongue</hi> only, but with the <hi>Heart;</hi> not in <hi>heart</hi> only, if God have given them the uſe of the heart and of the tongue, or his bleſſings of memory and underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That (beſides this <hi>univerſality of perſons confeſsing Chriſt</hi> with their tongues to be <hi>the Lord)</hi> there is an <hi>Univerſalitie or Totality of duties</hi> to be performed by every one that <hi>confeſſeth Chriſt to be the Lord,</hi> is evident from <hi>Ieſus Chriſt our Lords own mouth,</hi> Luke 6. 46. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things, which I ſay?</hi> 
                  <q>This ſpeech infers thus much at leaſt, That though all other, both Jews &amp; Gentiles; even every tongue throughout the world, had <hi>confeſſed</hi> as much as theſe his preſent Diſciples (of which ſome were temporary, ſome perpetual Profeſſors) did; yet this would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to make them capable of the reward univerſally promiſed to his <hi>true Diſciples</hi> and ſervants: That this <hi>confeſsion,</hi> though made by <hi>every tongue beſides,</hi> was not ſufficient to make <hi>any particular man</hi> capable of the reward (promiſed to all his true ſervants, that are capable of his words and ſayings) which was not ready and willing to <hi>do</hi> them.</q> That every one, which heard his ſayings, and was willing to do them, was truly capable of all the bleſſings, which he promiſed, is clear from his words following, ver. 47, 48, 49. <hi>Who ſo cometh to me, and heareth my ſayings, and doth them, I will ſhew you to whom he is like: He is like a man which built an houſe, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a Rock: And when the flood aroſe the ſtream brake violently upon that houſe, and could not ſhake it, for it was founded upon a Rock. But he that heareth and doth not, is like unto a man, that without a foundation built an houſe upon the earth, againſt which the ſtream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and the ruine of that houſe was great.</hi> But our Lord and Saviours mind is by himſelf more fully expreſt to this purpoſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, But he that doth the will of my Father, which is in heaven.</hi> 
                  <q>The limitation of theſe words, as well for their <hi>negative as affirmative extent,</hi> is this: That neither every one, nor any one of them, which ſhall <hi>confeſs onely with their tongues</hi> that he is the <hi>Lord,</hi> ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</q> This limitation of the Negative, or rather our <hi>Aſſurance of Faith,</hi> that this <hi>negative</hi> is thus far to be extended, is manifeſt from the verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. For to propheſie in the Name of Chriſt, is more than to <hi>confeſſe</hi> with the tongue only that <hi>Chriſt is Lord.</hi> To caſt out Divels in the Name of Chriſt
<pb n="3370" facs="tcp:32220:43"/>
is more then to prophecie in his Name: To do many works of wonder in Chriſts Name is more than to caſt out Devils in his Name. For to caſt out Divels indeed is a wonderful work, and yet but One of thoſe wonderful works, which then and for many years after were done in Chriſts Name, by ſuch as (although they did call <hi>Chriſt, Lord, Lord,</hi> as he truly is <hi>the Lord of all)</hi> were not Chriſts true ſervants, not ſuch as Chriſt will take notice of or approve as better, but rather reject as worſe then Infidels, in that laſt and dreadful day, when he ſhall call his ſervants (whether <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>de facto)</hi> to a final account. For ſo it is expreſſed in the words following, ver. 23, 23. <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that day</hi> (and the more the better, ſo their plea were good) <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name have caſt out devils, and in thy name have done many wonderful works? And then will I profeſſe unto them, I never knew you;</hi> that is, I never approved of you, but rather diſapproved you and your works, as worſe then the works of heathens, or heatheniſh workers. For unto the Heathens, as Heathens, he hath not ſaid, that he will ſay in the laſt day, <hi>Depart from me Ye Workers of iniquity.</hi> That the Affirmative extent of his words, to ſuch as ſhall not only with their tongues confeſs, but in heart and practice acknowledge him to be <hi>the Lord,</hi> is as large and ample as his former threatnings to ſuch as either indeed and facts deny him, or with their tongues and lips do not confeſs him to be <hi>the Lord;</hi> his promiſe in the next words, ver. 24. will give us full aſſurance. <hi>Therefore whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe man, which built his houſe upon a rock.</hi> 
                  <q>And thus you ſee, The words of our Lord and Savior (confirmed by the mouthes of two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick witneſſes, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke)</hi> do warrant the truth of theſe two Univerſals, That never a one of ſuch, as onely with the tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him to be the Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: That every one, which in heart confeſſeth him, though with tongue he cannot confeſs him to be the Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of heaven:</q> For every one which doth the will of his Father which is in heaven (and the doing of this his heavenly Fathers will here, is not an act of the Tongue, but of the heart, and of the affections) ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, which is the place and ſeat appointed for all Chriſts true Servants, and onely for them. The onely queſtion then remaining, is, <hi>What this Will of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is? what it is to do it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This will of His heavenly Father</hi> is either <hi>General,</hi> whatſoever is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Ten Commandements, in the moral Law, or in the Prophets; or more <hi>Special,</hi> as it is revealed in <hi>Chriſt</hi> or by Chriſt: Did <hi>Chriſt</hi> then give us a <hi>New Law,</hi> or other precepts, then God by <hi>Moſes</hi> had done? Or did he give us (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith) <hi>Evangelical Counſels as Additionals unto the Law?</hi> In no wiſe: Chriſt taught no other things, then his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> after his reſurrection did preach; and his <hi>Apostles</hi> taught no other things then <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> had taught, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 22. But theſe they taught after <note place="margin">The ſame <hi>will</hi> of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but more fully by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>another maner,</hi> then the Scribes and Phariſees did, then the ordinary Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of the Law and the <hi>Propheſies</hi> had done.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Gods will</hi> concerning man, was more fully declared by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then it was by <hi>Moſes</hi> or by the Prophets; the very true meaning of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf and of the Prophets was more fully revealed and clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted unto mankinde in Chriſt, then it was to <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf or to the <hi>Prophets: Unto me</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Apoſtle, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10.) <hi>who am leſs then the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace given, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the unſearchable riches of Chriſt: And to make all men ſee what is the</hi>

                  <hi>fellowſhip of the myſterie, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt: To the intent that now unto the Principalities and Powers in Heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi> And by this more full declaration of <hi>Gods Will</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we Chriſtians are tyed unto more ſtrict obſervance of His Will known, then men were tyed unto before <hi>Chriſt</hi> was declared to be <hi>the Lord;</hi> Admitting the Services to be the <hi>very ſame,</hi> yet the ſame ſervices are now due under a <hi>double Title:</hi> They are due to God the <hi>Father</hi> by right of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and due to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he is <hi>Lord;</hi> For God the Father is to be honored not onely in himſelf, but in Chriſt.</p>

For ſo the faſhion was long before, and continued till his time, to picture God, or the <hi>bleſſed Trinity,</hi> in ſome fair and beautiful form, and to paint the divel in ſome foul, loathſom, or ugly ſhape. And this good Writer to correct their error, well admoniſhed, as well the parents as their children, <hi>That if they would learn to know what God was, they muſt firſt be taught to know what</hi> Goodneſs <hi>is, what</hi> Juſtice <hi>is, what</hi> Mercy <hi>is, what</hi> Bounty <hi>or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs is:</hi> And if they deſire to know what maner of creature the divel is, who is the chief enemy of God, they ſhould firſt be taught to know what malice is, what filthineſs is, what loathſomneſs is, what villany or treachery is. For Satan is but a Compoſt of theſe, or an extract of all that children or their parents acknowledge for evil: Howbeit, if either children or parents could be taught to know what <hi>Iuſtice</hi> is, what <hi>Mercy is,</hi> what loving kindneſs is; or if they could be taught to know that God is, what all theſe are, even <hi>Iuſtice it ſelf,</hi> even <hi>mercy it ſelf,</hi> loving kindneſs it ſelf, wiſdom it ſelf; or Wiſdom, Juſtice, Mercy, and loving kindneſs it ſelf truly infinite; yet his wiſdom, his mercy, and loving kindneſs would be to us incomprehenſible, unapprehenſible, even in that theſe <hi>Attributes</hi> in him are infinite: We could have no true or lively <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,</hi> either <hi>ſpeculative</hi> to inform our underſtandings what were good and ought to be followed; or <hi>moral,</hi> to enable and qualifie our hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to imitate or expreſs that patern of goodneſs, or ſo much of it as we apprehend in God, if we ſhould look upon theſe <hi>Attributes</hi> as they are in God the Father only, or in the Divine nature: But as he that cannot look upon the Sun in its ſtrength or brightneſs, or at the noon day, may take the <hi>model</hi> of it in the water, or in the Moon at full; So we that cannot behold the glory of Divine Majeſty in the Godhead, may ſafely behold the Map or Model of his incomprehenſible Goodneſs in <hi>the Man Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> All <hi>His</hi> actions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors were with ſuch wiſdom ſet and bent upon mercy, on goodneſs, on

               <p>
                  <q>Before I enter upon the Particulars therein contained, I am in General to advertiſe, That albeit the Scripture be ſuch A Compleat Rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <note place="margin">An Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing H.

Of this later rank are the Articles of the Godhead, of the Creation, of Divine Providence, of Original Sin, of Final judgment, and of Life and Death everlaſting.</p>
               <p>The Being of a Godhead or Divine Power, the very Heathens, which knew not Scriptures, did in ſome ſort believe: of Gods Providence, and of Judgment after this life, the Heathens likewiſe had divers Notions, which were as rude materials or ſtuffe unwrought. The frame or faſhioning of which Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into true and Chriſtian Belief, cannot otherwiſe be effected then by the Rules of Scripture, which are The Lines, by which the ſtructure or edifice of Faith muſt be ſquared or wrought. Now whatſoever the Heathens without the help of Scriptures, or Divine Revelations, did believe or conceive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Points mentioned, Every Chriſtian man, which doth believe the Scriptures, though but by an hiſtorical Faith, may much better believe and conceive by the help of Scriptures, albeit his affections be not as yet ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Spirit of Grace; although he be but in the Eſtate of a meer Moral or Natural man; ſo he be not delivered up unto a Reprobate ſenſe.</p>

And theſe Later are moſt frequent in the ancient heathen Poets; Many of whoſe Teſtimonies to this purpoſe are ſo Expreſs and direct, that they may well ſeem to have been taken from ſome ſcattered Traditions of that truth, which God had revealed unto the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs before the Law was written, or from the written Law it ſelf, which it is probable <hi>Plato</hi> with ſome other Philoſophers and Poets had read, at the leaſt received at the ſecond hand. <q>However, unleſs the truth concerning this point delivered in Scriptures had been imperfectly implanted in mens hearts by nature, theſe meer natural men could not have ſubmitted their Aſſent or Opinions unto it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That not the ancient Poets onely, but the ancient Philoſophers had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Notion of pains or torments, which the wicked after this life were to <note place="margin">The <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Notion.</note> ſuffer, we may gather from <hi>Ariſtotle, Poſter. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. For ſo he tels us, that the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> did aſſign this <hi>final cauſe of thunder, namely, to terrifie ſuch as were reſerved in infernal priſons.</hi> And in aſsigning this Final Cauſe of thunder, whoſe Material and Efficient Cauſe with its properties they were not ignorant of; they did acknowledge an Higher Guide or Governor of theſe natural Effects then nature her ſelf. We may perhaps rectifie this Notion by ſaying, <hi>The thunder was created by this Guide or Governour of Nature, rather to terrifie ſuch as live here on earth, that they come not into theſe infernal priſons.</hi> And to avoid or prevent their coming into them, Nature her ſelf, which taught <hi>Pythagoras</hi> this Philoſophy, might teach all, <q>That there can be no means ſo ſafe or ſo compendious, as the making of our peace with that divine Power, who ſpeaks to men in this terrible language.</q> 
                  <hi>The thunder of his power</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob,</hi> cap. 26. 14.) <hi>Who can underſtand?</hi> But the leſs we underſtand It in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the better we underſtand Him to be a Terrible Judge. That this Notion, which the thunder did ſuggeſt to the <hi>Pythagorean Philoſophers</hi> of the Divine Power, as avenger of Evil, was not a Philoſophical Phancie, but <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by Nature in the heart,</hi> may be further evinced; for that the thunder did imprint the like fear in ſuch as in words or opinion did deny the Divine Providence, or ſought to ſhake off all conceit of future Judgment. Witneſs the Emperor <hi>Caligula,</hi> who ſo demeaned himſelf in his Empire and tyrannie over others, as if he never looked to be called to any account for his Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and yet this man (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> tels us) would riſe from the table, when it thundred, and oft times for fear run under his Bed; He knew himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the cenſure or controll of man, and had enough about him to inſtruct him in the natural cauſes of thunder; and yet by this ſtrange fear he did acknowledge a ſuperior Judge, from whoſe preſence or apprehenſion he ſought to hide himſelf, as Malefactors do themſelves from the eyes or hands of earthly Judges, or from the miniſters of civil Juſtice.</p>

2. But might not this ſtrange fear ariſe rather from ſome peculiar diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Caligula,</hi> then from any <hi>inſtinct of nature,</hi> univerſal to all ſuch as he was, upon the like or equivalent Summons or admonitions? From whatſoever diſpoſition we can imagine this ſervile or ſlaviſh fear ſhould proceed, it was a timorous diſpoſition, and could not have wrought or inclined ſuch men, as he was, unto ſuch manifeſt documents of imminent fear, but from a feeling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of a foul and beaſtly life: For he was a man that in other caſes had gotten as full a <hi>Conqueſt over his Conſcience,</hi> as any Man, Prince or Subject, in this life can poſſibly get. He had with much care and coſt lull'd his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with varietie of all pleaſures incident to ſenſe or earthly affections, into ſo dead a ſleep, that no voice of man, though Embaſſador from God; no voice of God (known to men) beſides this terrible voice of his <hi>thunder,</hi> could have awaked it. But amongſt ten thouſand ſuch as he was, that is, of ſuch as for the moſt part have lived as beaſts, and for this reaſon could deſire to dye like beaſts, without any account or reckoning how they had ſpent their Lives; it will be hard to find one, that in ſome or other particular did not give <hi>A true Criſis or proof of this Truth,</hi> which now we teach (that is, of a <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> after this life) <hi>by nature implanted in their hearts;</hi> albeit moſt of them in words would not confeſs it: albeit many of them uſed their own and their Paraſites wits by natural reaſons to overthrow or enervate the force of it. But as in Caſes of civil Juſtice, the unwitting acknowledgement of ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial or pertinent Circumſtances, drawn from ſuch, as otherwiſe ſeek to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal or ſmother the Main truth (upon which they are directly examined) is with intelligent Judges, of more force, then one or two voluntary teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of men ſuſpected to be <hi>Acceſſaries</hi> in the buſineſs, or partial favourers of the principal Actor: So in this controverſie betwixt God and our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, The unwitting practiſes (or paſſionate expreſſions made in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie) of ſuch heathens, as either denied or knew not the truth of a <hi>Final Iudgment,</hi> do give more powerful and more authentick teſtimonies for it, then either the authoritie or expreſs teſtimonie of other heathens, which did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly or directly affirm it (ſave onely ſo farre, as their teſtimony was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the like inſtinct of nature, or implanted <hi>Notion,</hi> which did move the others to confeſs it indirectly or in practiſe, although in words they did deny it, or not confeſs it) do for it; or then the avowed denials of any more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Heathens in their Jollity do againſt it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In many Caſes as well natural and moral as divine, there may be a real and ſolid truth, or ground of truth in the practiſe, without any apprehenſion of it in the practitioner; oft times with oppoſition to it in his Conceipt or Opinion.</hi> Moſt men, when they deſire to call things forgotten to mind, will rub or ſcratch the <hi>back part</hi> of their head. The Ground or Reaſon of their Practiſe is from Nature her ſelf, which hath placed the facultie of memory in that part of the brain, or at leaſt in ſome other part, betwixt which and that which they ſo handle, there is ſpecial intercourſe. Howbeit moſt men obſerve this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe or cuſtom by meer inſtinct of nature, without ſo much as once queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or thinking whether their faculty of memory be ſeated in the brain or in the breſt. And ſome perhaps do uſe this cuſtom, being of a contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, viz. <hi>That the memory is ſeated in the fore-part of the Brain.</hi> But their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt conformity to others in this cuſtom, will in any indifferent Moderators Judgement prevailingly preſcribe againſt their Opinion. Few there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſo deſtitute of natural reaſon, but would be able as occaſion requires, or exigents impel, to give warmth to ſome things that were cold, and to cool other things that be hot, by blowing or breathing upon them. Yet this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
<pb n="3379" facs="tcp:32220:47"/>
is practiſed by moſt out of meer inſtinct of nature, without thought or queſtion, how ſuch two contrarie effects, as heat and cold, could poſſibly iſſue from one and the ſame mouth or breath. There is a true and real cauſe of this diverſity or contrariety in the effects, and a true reaſon in nature, how they are wrought, albeit this cauſe or reaſon be, neither in whole nor in part, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by ſuch as practiſe it with ſucceſs. Yea of ſuch as have their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes exerciſed in the ſtudy of Philoſophie, ſcarce one of five there is, but if he ſhould on the ſuddain be put thus to practiſe by rule of <hi>Art,</hi> would fail of his purpoſe, more, then ſuch as thus practiſe by meer <hi>inſtinct of nature;</hi> or would be as far to ſeek, if he were put to give the true reaſon of it, as the poor <hi>Pilgrim</hi> in the <hi>Fable</hi> was, who being kindly entertained by a Satyr, which had found him blowing his fingers for extremity of cold in the woods, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly thruſt out of his houſe, only for ſeeking to cool his broth with the ſame breath, wherewith he had warmed his fingers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But in what practiſes or reſolutions in the heathen was this divine truth of a <hi>Judgment</hi> after this life neceſſarily included? <hi>The particulars are many,</hi> but moſt of them may be reduced unto <hi>this General. As many of the heathens as either eſteemed the love of virtue, honeſtie, or godlineſs more dear then this mortal life with its appurtenances temporal; or as many of them as did abhorre the practiſe of any villani or impietie more than death; whatſoever they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did expreſly ſay or think concerning this Article of Final Judgment in particular, did by theſe practiſes or reſolutions give authentick teſtimony unto it.</hi> Now that virtue or honeſty were to be more eſteemed then this mortal life, with all the commodities of it, the moſt part of heathen <hi>Philoſophers</hi> (beſides the Sect of <hi>Epicures)</hi> did grant and maintain. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> went further in the eſteem of moral virtue, then any <hi>wiſe Chriſtian</hi> will do in practiſe, then any <hi>good Chriſtian</hi> ought to do in opinion: (but of their errors or Hyperboles anon.) <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the Prince of Philoſophers grants, that there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that ſome things be <hi>abſolutely good,</hi> ſo good that a man ought to love them more than life, or rather to abandon life than their practiſe. Some things again he grants <hi>abſolutely evil;</hi> So evil, that a man ought rather to chuſe death then adventure upon them; ſuch are Treaſon againſt our native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Inceſt, Perjury, &amp;c. This great Philoſopher, in expreſly granting thus much, is neceſſarily concluded by his own Principles to grant <hi>a life after this life ended much better then this;</hi> and a death, or an eſtate of life much worſe than death, to ſuch as have lived and died diſhoneſtly. Nor is he thus far concluded onely by his own Principles, but by the very Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe chief Secretary he was. For every thing that hath <hi>Being,</hi> doth by an indiſpenſable Law of nature deſire the continuance of ſuch <hi>Being</hi> as it hath; but moſt of all of its <hi>Well-being</hi> or bettering of its preſent eſtate. Now if mans hopes or fears were terminated in this life (as needs they muſt with this life be terminated, unleſs we grant a Judgment after death, or an award of the evils which men fear, or of the good things which they hope) every man were bound in reaſon and by nature to ſeek the preſervation or continuance of his own life before all things in the world beſides. Nothing were to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worſe then a bodily death, nothing ſo good as continuation of bodily life with health and competency. Much better it were to be a part of this viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world, then utterly not to <hi>Be.</hi> To avoid or put off this <hi>utter not-Being,</hi> ſo long as were poſsible, no deviſe could be diſhoneſt, no practiſe amiſs. We do not blame bruit beaſts for making what ſhift they can for maintaining or ſaving their lives; no means, which they can uſe to this end onely, are by us accounted foul; for as we ſay, <hi>they do but follow kind,</hi> or do as nature directs
<pb n="3380" facs="tcp:32220:48"/>
them: But what is the reaſon why in thus doing they do not amiſs, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve blame? Becauſe nothing can be ſo ill to them as death, nothing ſo good as life: But for a Man to transform himſelf into a Beaſt, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue beaſtly or filthy practices, for continuance or preſervation of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily life; this the very Heathens did deteſt as unnatural, baſe, and odious: What was the reaſon? they ſaw by light of nature, that man had better hopes then beaſts are capable of, as it were wrapped up for him in the conſtant practice of honeſty and vertue, and was capable withal, of greater evil which might accrew from a diſhoneſt and filthy life, then any evil that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the nature of beaſts; yet did not that <hi>Good</hi> which good men did aim at, either in practice of virtue, or by declining vice, always betide them in this life, in the Judgement of moſt Heathen.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Two things there were, which moſt later Heathens (not the <hi>Stoicks</hi> onely) did highly extol in <hi>Regulus;</hi> the one, That he <hi>did prefer the love of his Countrie, before the contentments of this life,</hi> which he might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in plenteous manner. The other, <hi>That he did prefer a lingring and cruel death, before the ſtain or guilt of perjury:</hi> For being in hold or durance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he was remitted to <hi>Rome,</hi> upon oath, That if he did not effect what they had given him in charge to treat for, he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and undergo ſuch puniſhment as they ſhould think fit to inflict: It was in his power to have effected with the <hi>Romans</hi> that, which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did deſire; but he would not uſe his power to perſwade, but rather to diſſwade the <hi>Romans</hi> from condeſcending to their enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, becauſe he ſaw it would be prejudicial to their Commonweal and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, though advantageous to him in particular: But he accounted it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſs then gain, as well to himſelf as to the <hi>Roman</hi> State, to ſave the life, though of ſome worthy Peer as he was, by breach of Oath or Perjury; and in this reſolution he returned unto the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> although he knew they reſolved to put him to cruel and lingring torture. The <hi>Obſervation</hi> upon this reſolution of <hi>Regulus</hi> (which will generally ſerve for all the like, by what Heathen ſoever practiſed or commended) is briefly <hi>This: No humane pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe or reſolution can be truly commendable, but onely ſo far as it helps to make the Practitioner a better man then he was before, or could continue to be, without ſuch practiſe.</hi> Was <hi>Regulus</hi> then a better man by this practiſe, then without it he could have been? Or did it truly propagate or continue that goodneſs which before he had? If he by doing this did not continue his former good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or become a better man, his commendations are unjuſt; the Fact it ſelf was not truly commendable, was no argument either of reaſon or wit in the Practiſer, or of honeſty in the Reſolution: If by this <hi>Reſolution</hi> he became a better man then before he was, or without it could have been, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of <hi>Regulus,</hi> did, after the accompliſhment of this fact, remain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the due reward of this <hi>Reſolution,</hi> as either his ſoul, his body, or both: For every <hi>real Accident</hi> or Attribute, neceſſarily ſuppoſeth a <hi>real ſubject</hi> to ſupport it; and if no better doom had been reſerved for <hi>Regulus,</hi> then that which the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> his chief Judges on earth, did award him, he could not poſſibly either have continued or bettered his well-being by undertaking it; it was altogether impoſſible for him to become a better man by this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, by which he doth utterly ceaſe to be a man, if his hopes had been terminated with this mortal life, or if he had not remained capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or puniſhment after death.</p>
               <p>That very thing was, even by the verdict of the Heathen, highly magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in <hi>Regulus</hi> (a wiſe States-man and good <hi>Patriot)</hi> which in a bruit Beaſt,
<pb n="3381" facs="tcp:32220:48"/>
of what kinde ſoever would have been accounted, and that juſtly, more then unreaſonableneſs, a very madneſs: For no beaſt, unleſs it be altogether mad, will evidently expoſe it ſelf to death. That which exempts <hi>Regulus</hi> his witting expoſing of himſelf to a more cruel death then any ſober man could finde in his heart to put a dumb beaſt unto, from cenſure of Folly, was, The mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his undertakings by <hi>Reſolution</hi> and <hi>Reaſon:</hi> And all the <hi>reaſon</hi> that he had thus to reſolve, was, That he hoped not utterly to periſh as beaſts do, although certain he was to die. Beaſts, which run upon their own deaths, are therefore accounted mad, becauſe by death they utterly ceaſe from being what they were: For them to deſire death, is to deſire their utter deſtruction, which they could not deſire, but ſeek by all means poſſible to avoid, unleſs they had firſt put of all common ſenſe, wherein the height of their madneſs conſiſts: <hi>Regulus</hi> was therefore accounted <hi>manly reſolute,</hi> and <hi>reſolutely wiſe,</hi> for that in chooſing rather to die, then to live with ſtain of perjury, or taint his ſoul with breach of oath; he did not deſire his own deſtruction, but the continuation of his well-being, or bettering his own or his Countries eſtate: And this his deſire or reſolution (which ſuppoſeth another ſentence after this life ended) the Heathens which ſo highly magnified his reſolution did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto as good, and fit to be imitated by all honeſt men and true Patriots, albeit perhaps moſt of them were unwilling to be his <hi>ſeconds</hi> in like attempts, when the matter came to the tryal.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor did the <hi>Romans</hi> onely commend this Reſolution in <hi>Regulus,</hi> whoſe Memory for well deſerving of that Commonweal, they had in perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence: But other Heathens which did deteſt the very name of <hi>Christians,</hi> and eagerly ſought the extirpation of Chriſts Church on earth, did as much admire and commend the like in <hi>Chriſtian Biſhops: Two memorable ſtories</hi> very appoſite to this purpoſe, come to my minde; the one related by St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> the other by St. <hi>Auſtin.

               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (in his Tract againſt Lying) tells us of Biſhop <hi>Firmus,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This conſtant Reſolution, as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> teſtifies, did ſo turn the edge of his Perſecutors malice into admiration and reverence of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, that they diſmiſt him with honor: Howbeit, there had been no wit or praiſe-worthineſs in the practiſe, unleſs the Practiſer had expected ſome beter Sentence after Death (to which he did thus conſtantly expoſe himſelf) then the applauſe of theſe Heathens, which he could not hope for,
<pb n="3382" facs="tcp:32220:49"/>
which he did not expect. And the heathens in commending and admiring his conſtancy and integrity, did, though <hi>faintly or unwittingly,</hi> yet <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ſubſcribe unto the truth of his hopes or belief of a <hi>Iudgment after death;</hi> as alſo unto that <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>God</hi> delivered by his Apoſtle, that <hi>ſeeing Chriſt hath laid down his life for us, we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. At leaſt we ought to expoſe our ſelves to bodily death, rather then ſuffer them to be put upon the hazard of death eternal: As it is likely <hi>this Good Biſhop</hi> feared, leſt he ſhould hazard this poor Chriſtian ſoul, whoſe death or Turning the Heathens ſought, being not ſo certain of his Reſolution as of his own, but doubtful whether he would not deny <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or renounce the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> rather then ſuffer ſuch tortures, as he now felt, or expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch a violent and cruel death, as they threatned him with.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Again, The moſt wiſe and learned among the heathen <hi>Philoſophers</hi> did place <hi>Felicity</hi> or true happineſs in the <hi>conſtant practiſe of Virtue,</hi> as in Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Juſtice, Wiſdom, &amp;c. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> were ſo wedded to this Opinion, <note place="margin">The opinion of the Stoicks.</note> that they held <hi>virtue to be a ſufficient recompence to it ſelf,</hi> at what rate ſoever it was purchaſed or maintained; though with the loſs of life, and limbs, with the moſt exquiſite and lingring tortures, that our ſenſes are capable of. They eſteemed <hi>Regulus</hi> more happy even in the middeſt of his torments, then his perſecutors were or could be in the height of their mirth and proſperity, or in the perfect fruition of their health, or beſt contentments of their ſenſes or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; Yea ſo far they went, that they judged <hi>Regulus</hi> to perpetual happineſs, albeit he had been perpetually or everlaſtingly ſo tormented as for a time he was.

And no marvel, ſeeing it is <hi>This Hope</hi> which muſt ſtrengthen other Graces of God in us, &amp; enable our ſpirits to counterſway the contrary inclinations of natural fear of death, or torments in the day of tryal. <hi>Caſt not away your confidence</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle) Heb.</hi> 10. 35, 36 <hi>Which hath great recompence of reward.

The Internal Experiments which certifie the Chriſtian of a Judgment to come, be ſo frequent and forcible, that pains will be better ſpent in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men to take notice of them, then in a long diſcourſe of them. It is the chief wiſdom of a Chriſtian, the very life of Chriſtian Sobriety, not to exceed ſo much in mirth, though honeſt, harmleſs and in ſeaſon; nor in the frequency of any buſineſs, though indifferent and lawful; as not to allot <hi>the ſecrets of our hearts</hi> and conſciences ſome ſet hours and <hi>times for Audience.</hi> Multiplicitie of buſineſs without interpoſition of vacancies to this purpoſe, is but like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual noiſe and clamor in a Court of Juſtice; and not to uſe ſome retired In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terims for examination of our ſouls, is but as if men ſhould continually laugh or brawl, whileſt the Officers of the Court injoyn peace or ſilence. <hi>So often then as we ſhall perceive our Conſcience either expreſly to check us, or inwardly to</hi>

theſe <hi>Dreams,</hi> and of their ſerious obſervation, that of <hi>The Son of Sirach, Eccl.</hi> 34. 1, 2, 3. is moſt true. <hi>The hopes of a man void of underſtanding are vain and falſe; and dreams lift up fools. Who ſo regardeth dreams is like him, that catcheth at a ſhadow, and followeth after the wind. The viſion of dreams is like the reſemblance of one thing to another, even as the likeneſs of a face to a face.</hi> Howbeit, even ſuch <hi>Dreams</hi> may be reſolved into ſome natural Cauſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. Nor do men fail in the apprehenſion of particulars repreſented (which is alwayes more lively by night, then by day) but in the application or compoſition of ſuch repreſentations whileſt they dream: This commonly is as imperfect or monſtrous, as if one ſhould be able to name his Letters right, but not able to ſpell or make a ſyllable otherwiſe then by rote or gueſs; or apt to put thoſe ſyllables ill-favouredly together, which he had ſeverally ſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not much amiſs.</p>
               <p>Like to mens apprehenſions of theſe <hi>Dreams</hi> were moſt ſpeculations of the Heathens concerning the truth, or manner of a <hi>final Iudgment,</hi> or <hi>future Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi> whoſe indefinite <hi>Notions</hi> Nature had implanted in their hearts. So vain and idle they were for the moſt part in their Collections or applications of what they conceived, that no more credence was to be given unto their particular ſpeculations or doctrine, then unto a ſick mans apprehenſions of his preſent <hi>Dream.</hi> But however many of them did write and ſpeak of a future <hi>Iudgment,</hi> more out of Art and imitation of others, then out of any ſolid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments; yet was it not poſſible that the wits of all or moſt of them, of the Antients eſpecially, ſhould have been ſet a working in this Argument, without ſome undoubted and experienced impulſions of nature ſeeking to lead or drive them upon that Truth, which we Chriſtians are expreſly taught by a <hi>Better Maſter</hi> then Nature.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Other <hi>Dreams</hi> there be, which are reputed <hi>natural,</hi> whoſe obſervation is very uſeful; becauſe they have real Cauſes in nature, and alwayes exhibit <note place="margin">A Diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Dreames.</note> either a true <hi>Criſis</hi> or notice of mens preſent eſtate of body, or ſome right <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> of ſome diſeaſe growing upon them, whoſe original or progreſs is to their waking thoughts unſenſible or unapprehended, Howbeit, the right interpretation or ſignification of ſuch ſuggeſtions or intimations, as nature gives to men in <hi>Dreams,</hi> is uſually unknown, or much miſtaken for the preſent, by the parties, to whom they are immediately made by nature; They muſt be expounded or Judged of by the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> or <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> Some men, no way diſtempered nor diſquieted in thought, have <hi>dreamed,</hi> that ſome part of their Legs or Arms have been turned into a ſtone, or into an Icie ſubſtance. The apprehenſion or compoſition was vain and falſe; yet not without a true and obſervable <hi>Cauſe.</hi> The <hi>Phyſician</hi> did by the relation of the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces perceive (as the Event did prove) a cold humor beginning to ſettle in that part of the body, whoſe transformation was repreſented in the <hi>Dream;</hi> and gather'd withall, that the humor not thence removed would breed a numneſs or oppreſsion of the nerves in that part. Others oft times <hi>dream</hi> (not from any thoughts or diſcourſes to that purpoſe) that they are flying in the air, or can jump from one place to another, further diſtant then any man can conceive it poſſible for himſelf, or other terreſtrial creatures to leap or skip. The <hi>Philoſopher or Phyſician</hi> knows this, or the like repreſentation made in ſleep, not occaſioned from any late waking thoughts, to be a token of a clean ſtomack, of pure blood, or lively ſpirits. Others, I have heard of, in the midſt of their quiet ſleep, have ſuddenly cryed out as if they had been ſtabbed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ribs.

not vain or idle <hi>in reſpect of the Cauſe</hi> or obſervation. The skilful Phyſician, from this their miſ-apprehenſion, rightly apprehended a ſalt humor violently diſtilling upon the lungs, ready to breed a dangerous Conſumption, whoſe removal would have been more difficult, had not Nature given this imperfect advice or forewarning for the ſpeedy prevention of it: This ſecret advice, or forewarning of Nature, was ſo much the more to be credited, becauſe no occaſion of any quarrel, no thought or diſcourſe tending to the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſuch fear, had preſented it ſelf to the waking thoughts of the party thus dreaming for a long time before: Every real occaſion of joy or fear, the very leaſt annoyance or pleaſance, that can befall our bodies in night-ſleep or ſlumber (as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> long ago obſerved) is apt to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform our <hi>Common ſenſe</hi> (or Judicative faculty) being now ſurpriſed by ſleep, with repreſentations or conceipts of the greateſt delight or fear that is of the ſame kinde with that which is really repreſented; as if a drop of ſweet flegm do diſtil upon the ſwallowing place, it raiſeth an apprehenſion of honey, or other ſweet meat, to which the taſt of the party thus dreaming hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed; and from this Original, hungry men in their ſleep feed their Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies with apprehenſion of pleaſant Banquets. Abundance of choler oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times raiſeth an apprehenſion of ſome great fire: And nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon then for men, troubled with flux of Rheum from the brain, to dream of drowning, or danger by floods or water: The leaſt oppreſſion of the motive faculty, will occaſion the <hi>Ephialtes</hi> or <hi>Gigas,</hi> that affection which we commonly call <hi>The Mare.</hi> In all theſe and the like affections, <hi>Nature doth her part,</hi> however <hi>the Parties</hi> to whom ſhe ſecretly ſuggeſts theſe ſigns or tokens of their bodily eſtate or conſtitution, do for the moſt part groſly erre in their conſtructions of them, until they be rectified or better inſtructed by the <hi>Phyſician</hi> or <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who onely know the natural cauſes of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations by ſleep, which is as a falſe glaſs, wherein every thing appears much greater to the Phantaſie, then in nature it is, or would appear to our vigilant ſenſes.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In like manner the beſt apprehenſions or collections which the Heathens made of thoſe Real <hi>Notions,</hi> which are by nature implanted (of a <hi>Final Judgement)</hi> were erroneous; their Doctrinal ſpeculations or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, were no better then an ignorant mans apprehenſion of his natural <hi>Dreams;</hi> howbeit, even the ſpeculations of ſuch Heathens, as did moſt erre in particular, do miniſter much matter of true and uſeful Contemplation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Chriſtian Divine,</hi> part of whoſe office it is, or ſhould be, to ſearch the original of others errors, whoſe rectification muſt be made by the <hi>Scripture,</hi>

               <p>The truth and certainty of this Judgment denounced by <hi>Enoch</hi> was ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and notoriouſly known, that the Hebrew Church before our <hi>Saviours</hi> incarnation, did begin the <hi>Writ or Inſtrument of their Great and terrible Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> with the firſt words of <hi>Enochs</hi> Propheſie, <hi>Dominus veniet,</hi> the Lord <note place="margin">See Book 10.

               <p>Other Teſtimonies to this purpoſe are moſt frequent in the book of <hi>Pſalms, Pſal.</hi> 50. 1, 2, 3. <hi>The mighty God, even the Lord, hath ſpoken, and called the Earth from the riſing of the Sun unto the going down of the ſame. Out of</hi> Sion <hi>the perfection of beauty God hath ſhined.

Thy Throne is eſtabliſhed of old, thou art from everlaſting.</hi> Every Throne or Tribunal is eſtabliſhed for execution of Judgment: But this Throne, though eſtabliſhed of old or from Eternity, yet was not the Judgment, for which this Throne was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, executed from eternity, or ſo executed at any time before the Date of this Pſalm, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> expected in due time, or at the end of time it would be.

               <p>
                  <q>But for more full ſatisfaction, ſome here may juſtly Demand: Whether <hi>St. Paul</hi> did make this interpretation of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> by ſome new Revelation of the Spirit made in particular to him, unknown to moſt others before that time? Or whether the interpretation of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> and of other like prophecies which he made, were literally and really included in the prophecies themſelves, and ratified by the General Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of Faith, or by the Common Rule of interpretation in thoſe times ſufficiently known to the learned, whoſe eyes were not blinded with paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor prejudiced with partiality to their own Sects or Factions?</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this we Anſwer, that <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Interpretation of the Prophet was really included in the literal ſenſe of the Prophecie, and the literal ſenſe or conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which he made of the fore-cited paſſage in the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> and other Prophets, was warrantable by the Common Rule of Interpretation ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known in thoſe times.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Rule is General; That all thoſe places of the old Teſtament, which <note place="margin">An uſeful <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule.</hi>
                     </note> intimate either a new manner of Gods governing the world, or a beginning of his reign over all Nations, or of being made Lord and King, or of ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Judge the earth, muſt be meant of God incarnate, that is, of the Son of God begotten before all worlds, and begotten again from the dead.</q> For as the Son of God by his death and reſurrection became our Lord by a peculiar Title; So he was from the ground of the ſame <hi>Title</hi> appointed Judge of quick and dead by a peculiar and perſonal right. This is more often and more Emphatically intimated by our Saviour Chriſt, and by his Apoſtles, then obſerved by many of their profeſt Interpreters. Firſt by <hi>St. Peter,</hi> Acts 10. 40, 41, 42. <hi>Him God raiſed up the third day, and ſhewed him openly, not unto all the people, but unto witneſſes choſen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the dead. And he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to preach to the people, and to teſtifie, that it is he, which was ordained of God to be the Judge of the quick and the dead.</hi> And again by <hi>St. Paul,</hi> Acts 17. 30, 31. <hi>And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all men every where to repent: becauſe he hath appointed a day, in the which he will Judge the world in righteouſneſs, by that man, whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> But more fully by the ſame <hi>St. Paul,</hi> Rom. 14. 9. <hi>To this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might he Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> In this Collection from the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> he ſaith no more, then our Saviour hath done, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 21, 22. <hi>For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even ſo the Son quickeneth whom he will. For the Father Iudgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgment unto the Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But the Former Queſtion ſtill revolves upon the ſame Center that it
<pb n="3394" facs="tcp:32220:55"/>
did before. The Point or Center is This; <hi>Whether St. Peter, or St. Paul, or whether our Saviour himſelf did deliver the doctrine fore-cited from that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity only, which was delegated to them from God, within that compaſs of time, wherein they did converſe with men here on earth?</hi> 
                  <q>or whether the doctrine, which they then delivered, were fully ratified by Divine Authority revealed and written before?</q> 
                  <q>To this we Anſwer, that our Saviour Himſelf in all his <note place="margin">Chriſts An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the Jews were but Comments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prophets</note> Anſwers to the <hi>Jews</hi> did but Comment upon, or expound thoſe Texts of holy Scripture, which he had put into his Prophets mouthes long before he himſelf had ſpoken with the mouth of man.</q> 
                  <q>One of the moſt pregnant Texts of the Old Teſtament is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 1, 2. God ſtandeth in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the mighty, he judgeth among the Gods: How long will ye Judge unjuſtly, and accept the perſons of the wicked? I have ſaid ye are Gods; and all of you are children of the moſt High; but ye ſhall die like men, and fall like one of the Princes: that is, like any Princes amongſt the Heathen:</q> And dying and falling thus, they could not expect that they were to riſe again to Judge others, but rather to be Judged by God himſelf, or by him that was the <hi>Son of the moſt High in another manner then they were:</hi> who though he were to die as man, yet did he not ceaſe to be the Son of God by his death: Yea, He was declared to be The only Son of God with Power, by His Reſurrection from the Dead. And out of this hope of his future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, the Pſalmiſt for Concluſion, being as it ſeems oppreſt with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Judgment, appeals unto the ſupreme Judge as well of the dead as of the living. <hi>Ariſe O God, Iudge the earth for thou ſhalt inherit all Nations,</hi> ver. 8. He doth not ſay, Thou <hi>doſt</hi> inherit all Nations, or thou <hi>art already</hi> ſet in Judgment; but <hi>ariſe O God to Iudge the earth, for thou ſhalt inherit all Nations.</hi> 
                  <q>So that the ground or Title of his univerſal Juriſdiction or judicature is his Inheritance of all Nations, and his Title of Inheritance over all Nations bears date, or began to be <hi>in Eſſe</hi> from the day of his Reſurrection;</q> as you heard before out of <hi>St Paul, Rom.</hi> 14. <q>And was before him expreſly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9. I will declare the Decree; the Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son; This day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion, Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of Iron; thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces like a potters veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</q> This Decree was executed, this promiſe performed, when, All Power in Heaven and Earth was given unto Chriſt: <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To omit all further variety of Teſtimonies; No other Article in our Creed is, or can be ſo authentickly teſtified, as This One Article of Chriſts coming to Judgment is. Beſides that it was expreſly and diſtinctly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets, and the fulfilling of their prophecies expreſly avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles, the Truth of it was in ſpecial manner ſealed by the blood of this Great Judge himſelf.

                  </note> was from his voluntary Confeſſion of this Article, in the ſame Form or Terms wherein we profeſs our Belief of it. For, as you may read <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 59. After the High-Prieſt and Elders had found, that the Witneſſes ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him did not agree in their teſtimonies, or elſe (which is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) that their teſtimonies, though well agreeing, did not amount to any matter Capital: the High-Prieſt ſeeks to intangle him in his own Anſwers to This Interrogatory: <hi>I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, whether thou be The Chriſt, the Son of God,</hi> ver. 63. Our Saviour confeſſeth the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle or Interrogatory; For ſo much is anſwered, at leaſt in the next words,
<pb n="3395" facs="tcp:32220:55"/>
                  <hi>Thou haſt ſaid it, Nevertheleſs I ſay unto you, Hereafter ſhall you ſee the Son of Man ſitting on the right hand of Power, and coming in the Clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Adverſative Particle <hi>[Nevertheleſs]</hi> hath much troubled ſome Interpreters; and ſome, to eaſe themſelves of further trouble, would have it <note place="margin">The Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Particle <hi>Nevertheleſs.</hi>

               <p>Unto the former Queſtion; <hi>Art Thou The Chriſt?</hi> Our Saviour in the morning anſwered, <hi>If I tell you, you will not believe,</hi> Luke 22. 67. And it is probable our Saviours words related by <hi>St. Matthew; thou ſayeſt it,</hi> include as much, as if he had ſaid; <hi>Thy Conſcience tels thee, though thou wilt not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to it, nor believe it, that I am Chriſt the Son of God; but howſoever you will not now believe it, nevertheleſs hereafter you ſhall be inforced to acknowledge it. Hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven. Then the High Prieſt rent his clothes, ſaying; he hath ſpoken blaſphemy; what further need have we of witneſſes?</hi> Indeed if the matter which he confeſſed had been truly Capital, his own confeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made before a competent Judge, had been a ſufficient and full conviction without any further witneſs. But there was nothing in his Anſwer which, according to theſe High-Prieſts Rules or Principles, could bear ſo much as the leaſt colour or appearance of any Crime, much leſs of Blaſphemy; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe their hearts had been infected with malice againſt his Perſon.</p>
               <p>They now condemn him of Blaſphemy in their own Court, And yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after they accuſe him of Treaſon in the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, for ſaying <note place="margin">The blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Jews condemn Chriſt of Treaſon and Blaſphemy.</note> he was the <hi>King of the Iews:</hi> Their accuſation in both was ſo groſly mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that it did plainly reverberate or reflect upon themſelves; For if to be <hi>King of the Iews</hi> were Treaſon againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> State, then the High-Prieſts and Elders with all their complices were traytors; becauſe they expected their <hi>Meſsias</hi> to be a temporal <hi>King,</hi> greater then <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But ſuch is their malice againſt <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> that rather then he ſhould be acknowledged for their <hi>Meſsias,</hi> they would make their <hi>Meſsias</hi> a traytor, &amp; their own doctrine concerning him to be treaſon. Rather then they will acknowledge <hi>Ieſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> to be the Son of God, or the <hi>Son of man, appointed to be the Iudge of quick &amp; dead,</hi> they will make their <hi>Meſsias</hi> to be a Blaſphemer, &amp; the Prophets do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning his Perſonal Office to be blaſphemy: for if the vail of malice had been removed from their hearts, or if they had not looked upon our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Anſwer</hi> through it, there is no branch or part of this Anſwer, which was not diſtinctly and expreſly foretold by the Prophets.

                  <hi>Chriſts Church</hi> (whether we conſider it as militant or triumphant) is an eſſential or integral part of his Kingdom; and as his Kingdom, ſo his Church, hath its firſt plantation or beginning here on earth: Both have a right or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the glorious promiſes made to the Church univerſal; neither Church nor Kingdom here on earth can have entire poſſeſſion of the bleſſings or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives promiſed, until it be given them by the <hi>Great King</hi> at the day of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgment.</hi> Of this rank is that prophecie, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of</hi>

                  <hi>them, ſaith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi> This Place (no man denies) was literally verified in the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> upon our <hi>Saviours Aſcenſion;</hi> But ſhall not be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and ſolidly fulfilled until the day of Judgment be paſt: Then the true members of Chriſts Church ſhall neither need Tradition, nor the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, they ſhall be all immediately taught of God, and have his Laws moſt perfectly and indeliblely written in their hearts. <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not,</hi> then, in any wiſe <hi>prevail againſt them,</hi> not ſo far as to annoy their bodies or interrupt their peace and happineſs. Of this intire happineſs and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Church Militant had a pledge or earneſt in the effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, and all that be true Members of Chriſts Church, have a ſuperficial draught or picture of this entire happineſs in their hearts. But Chriſt at his Aſcenſion was ſo far from annulling the uſe of preaching, or teaching one another, that, as the Apoſtle tels us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> (more extraordinary, then any had been during the time of the Law) <hi>for the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of faith, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Thus to interpret the prophecies of the Old Teſtament concerning the Church indefinitely taken, can be no Paradox, ſeeing the predictions of our Saviour himſelf concerning his Kingdom muſt of neceſſity be thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted; witneſs that Prediction (to omit others) <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 27, 28. <hi>The Son of man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father with his Angels, and then he ſhall reward every man according to his works. Verily I ſay unto you, there be ſome ſtanding here, that ſhall not taſt of death till they ſee the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The later part of this Prediction, or the Experiment anſwering unto it, was exemplified in <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> within ſeven dayes after: For theſe Three were Spectators of his Transfiguration in the Mount; And his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration was but a repreſentation or exemplification of that glory wherein he ſhall appear in the day of Judgment, when he ſhall give theſe Apoſtles, and all that ſhall obey his precepts, full poſſeſsion of the Kingdom of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="3400" facs="tcp:32220:58"/>
for them. But albeit theſe three <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had not onely their eyes, but their ears true witneſſes of <hi>his glory, as of the glory of the onely begotten Son of God</hi> (for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>His face did ſhine as the Sun, and his raiment was white as the light;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>A bright cloud over ſhadowed them, and behold a voice out of the cloud, which ſaid, This is my well-beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed, hear him:)</hi> Yet miſerable men had they been for all this, if their hopes or expectations had been terminated or accompliſhed with this tranſient glorious ſpectacle or voice: Both the voice and the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle were but earneſts or pledges of that everlaſting joy or happineſs, which they were to expect in the perpetual fruition of the like ſights or ſounds in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Of this ſort or rank is that Prophecie of <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. 4. <hi>And he ſhall judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nations, and ſhall rebuke many people; and they ſhall beat their ſwords into Plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks: Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more.</hi> There was at the birth of this great <hi>Judge,</hi> a glimps exhibited of this Univerſal Peace, which ſhall not be univerſally eſtabliſhed before the laſt and final <hi>Judgement:</hi> All the Nations of the Earth were quiet and free from any noiſe of War when he came firſt into the World: For <hi>Janus</hi> his Temple was then ſhut; And after he ſhall be revealed again unto the World from Heaven, there ſhall be neither Death, nor Famine, nor the Sword. Howbeit, even the deareſt of his Saints, which have lived ſince his firſt Birth, were to endure a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>War</hi> in their Pilgrimage here on earth; and the end of their War is to make them capable of this everlaſting peace.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Another Prediction of his <hi>coming to Judgement</hi> there is, which muſt be interpreted according to the <hi>former Rule;</hi> that is, <hi>Inchoativè,</hi> or in part <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 2. meant <hi>Inchoativè</hi> of Chriſts firſt coming, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletivè</hi> of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</note>

For he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers ſope: And he ſhall ſit as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finer or purifier of ſilver, and he ſhall purifie the ſons of Levi, and purge them as gold and ſilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>

               <p>So certain and ſo general is the <hi>former Rule</hi> of interpretation, that not this prediction of <hi>Malachi</hi>'s onely, and the like of other Prophets; but the fulfilling of them related by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> cannot rightly be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted without the help of <hi>this Rule:</hi> For Inſtance, to lay <hi>this Rule</hi> unto <hi>St. John Baptiſts</hi> ſpeech, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Now alſo the ax is laid unto the root of the tree: Therefore every tree which bringeth forth not good fruit, ſhall be hewn down and cast into the fire: I indeed Baptize you with water unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but he that cometh after me, is mightier then I, whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear, he ſhall Baptize you with the holy Ghoſt, and with fire: Whoſe fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garner: But will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</hi> This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction cannot be exactly fulfilled until the <hi>Final Sentence</hi> be given and put in execution: And yet within 43 years after his Baptiſm by <hi>John,</hi> there was a manifeſt and lively repreſentation exhibited to the World of his ſecond coming unto Judgement; and this repreſentation was exhibited upon the Nation of the <hi>Jews:</hi> The full accompliſhment whereof ſhall at his <hi>ſecond</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The literal meaning of both places, and the intent and purpoſe, as well of the Angels, as of our Saviour in this prediction, infers, <hi>That this Son of man, whom they now beheld with bodily eyes, was that very God, whoſe glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and reign the Pſalmiſt deſcribes, Pſal.</hi> 104. 3. <hi>Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, who maketh the clouds his chariots, who walketh upon the wings of the wind.

               <p>In all the manifeſtations of Chriſt to be the Son of God, The Cloud is ſtill a Witneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In his Transfiguration upon the Mount. <hi>A Cloud did overſhadow him;</hi> and out of the Cloud this teſtimony was given him by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed; hear him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>For more particular Deſcription of the Manner of his Coming, the next Point is; <hi>From what place he ſhall come?</hi> Now it is expreſly ſaid in our Creed [That <hi>Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> who was conceived by the holy Ghoſt, born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was crucified, dead, and buried, deſcended into hell, who the third day roſe again from <note place="margin">The Place or Term <hi>from which</hi> Chriſt ſhall come to Judgment.</note> the dead, aſcended into heaven, and there ſitteth at the right hand of God, <hi>ſhall thence come to Judge the quick and the dead.</hi>
                  </q>] But this word [Thence] is of ambiguous Reference. It may be referred in general either to the <hi>Heavens,</hi> into which he aſcended, or unto the <hi>Right hand of God,</hi> or unto <hi>both.</hi> Certain it is, that he ſhall come from <hi>Heaven</hi> as viſibly and locally, as he aſcended thither. Yet whether he ſhall come <hi>from the Right hand of God,</hi> is queſtionable, but not by us determinable, unleſs it be determined already in the firſt Chapter of this Book, what is literally meant by <hi>The Right hand of God,</hi> either in the Creed or in thoſe places of the New Teſtament, out of which This Article is taken. If Chriſts Body (as <hi>Lutherans</hi> did contend, chapt. 3. § 6.) be every where; or, if by the <hi>Right hand of God</hi> only the <hi>Power of God</hi> be literally meant, as many other Proteſtant Writers take as granted, or leave unqueſtioned; then Chriſt cannot be ſaid <hi>to come from the Right hand of God;</hi> for it is impoſsible that Chriſt ſhould come, or that there ſhould be any <hi>true motion from that, which is every where.</hi> Neither can it be ſaid, nor may it ſo much as be imagined, that Chriſt ſhould depart from the <hi>Power of God,</hi> which (whereſoever he be as man) doth accompany and guard him. But if by the <hi>Right hand of God,</hi> at which Chriſt ſitteth, be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally meant <hi>A viſible and glorious Throne,</hi> then Chriſt may be ſaid as truly and <hi>locally to come from thence,</hi> as from heaven, <hi>to Iudge the Quick and the dead.</hi> At leaſt His Throne may remove with him. Now that by the <hi>Right hand of God,</hi> at which Chriſt ſitteth, A Viſible or local Throne is meant, I will at this time add only one Teſtimony unto the reſt heretofore avouched in the handling of that Article, which is more literally concludent then all the reſt; and it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>He endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God.</hi> Not at the <hi>right hand of his own Throne, but at the right hand of the Throne of God</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

2. For perfecting this Map or Survey of Chriſts coming to Judgment already begun; would it not be as pertinent to know The Place, unto which he ſhall come, as the Place whence he comes?

But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">To what Place Chriſt (probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſhall come.</note> the Scriptures are not in this Point ſo expreſs and punctual as in the former, we may not ſo peremptorily determine it, or ſo curiouſly ſearch into it. This is certain, That Chriſt after his deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from heaven, ſhall have his Throne or Seat of Judgment placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the heaven and the earth in the air over-ſhadowed with clouds; But over what part of the earth his throne ſhall be thus placed is uncertain or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural; at the moſt but probable</p>
               <p>Many notwithſtanding, as well Antient as Modern, are of Opinion, <hi>That the Throne or Seat of Iudgment ſhall be placed over the Mount of</hi> Olives, <hi>from which Chriſt did aſcend;</hi> and This (for ought we have to ſay againſt it) may be A Third Branch of the fore-mentioned ſimilitude betwixt the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſts aſcending</hi> up into heaven, and <hi>of his Coming to Judgment;</hi> that is, <hi>As he was received in a cloud into heaven over Mount Olivet, ſo he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend in the clouds of heaven, to Judge the world in the ſame place.</hi> But the Teſtimony of Scripture, which gives the beſt Ground of probability, and a Tincture at leaſt of moral certainty to the former opinion or conjecture, is that of <hi>Zach. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Then ſhall the Lord go forth, and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Nations</hi> (to wit all thoſe Nations, which have been gathered in <note place="margin">See Book 9. Chap. 43.</note> battel againſt <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and theſe in the verſe precedent were <hi>all Nations) as when he fought in the day of battel. And his feet ſhall ſtand in that day upon the Mount of</hi> Olives, <hi>which is before</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>on the Eaſt, and the Mount of</hi> Olives <hi>ſhall cleave in the midſt thereof toward the Eaſt and toward the Weſt, and there ſhall be a very great Valley, and half of the Mountain ſhall remove toward the North, and half of it toward the South, &amp;c.</hi> This place, albeit (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) in part it were verified in the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> yet may it be alſo literally meant of the Laſt General Judgment, in which the reſt of the prophecie following ſhall punctually and exactly be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But to leave theſe Circumſtances of Place, from which, and unto which Chriſt ſhall come, and utterly to omit the Circumſtance of Time, which is more uncertain. <hi>The moſt uſeful branch of the Third General Point propoſed, is to know or apprehend the Terrible manner of his Coming. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the terror of the Lord</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.) <hi>we perſwade men.</hi> His Speech is very Emphatical and Significant; an Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm of Life, unto whoſe Truth every experienced Phyſician of the ſoul will eaſily ſubſcribe. For but a few men there be (eſpecially in theſe later times, and theſe muſt be more then Men; in ſome good meaſure <hi>Chriſtian Men)</hi> whom we can hope to perſwade unto Godlineſs by the Love of God in Chriſt our Lord; Albeit we ſhould ſpend our brains in drawing the picture or proportion of the Love exhibited in Chriſt, or give luſtre or colour to the proportion drawn by the Evangeliſts, with our own blood. But by the Terror of the Lord, or by decyphering of that laſt and dreadful day, we ſhall perhaps perſwade ſome men to become Chriſtians, as well in heart as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, by taking Chriſt's Death and their own Lives into ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now of Terror or dread there be Two Corporeal Senſes more apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <note place="margin">Two Senſes chiefly apt to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Terror.</note> then the reſt, which are apt rather to ſuffer or feel, then to Dread the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, which befal them; The Two In-lets by which Dread or terror enters
<pb n="3404" facs="tcp:32220:60"/>
into the ſoul of man, are the Eye and the Ear. All the Terrors of that laſt day may be reduced to theſe Two Heads: To the <hi>ſtrange and unuſual Sights,</hi> which ſhall then be ſeen, and unto the <hi>ſtrange and unuſual Sounds or Voices,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Terrors of Sounds, and Terrors of Sights.</note> which ſhall then be heard. If we would ſearch the Sacred Records from the Fall of our firſt Parents until our reſtauration was accompliſhed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or until the Sacred Canon was compleat, <hi>The notifications or apprehenſions of Gods extraordinary preſence, whether they were made by voice, or ſpectacle unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, have been fearful and terrible to fleſh and blood;</hi> though much better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Gods Preſence then we are.</p>
               <p>When our firſt Parents heard but the Voice of <hi>the Lord God walk in the garden, in the cool of the day,</hi> they <hi>hid themſelves from his preſence amongſt the trees of the Garden,</hi> Gen. 3. 8, 10. <hi>When</hi> Gideon <hi>(Judg.</hi> 6. 22.) <hi>perceived that he which had ſpoken unto him</hi> (albeit he had ſpoken nothing but words of comfort and encouragement) <hi>was the Angel of the Lord,</hi> Gideon <hi>ſaid, Alas O Lord God, becauſe I have ſeen an Angel of the Lord face to face.</hi> The iſſue of his fear was Death, which happily he conceived from Gods word to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 33. 20. <hi>Thou canſt not ſee my face, for there ſhall no man ſee me, and live.</hi> But to aſſure <hi>Gideon,</hi> that he was not compriz'd under that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſentence of Death denounced, by God himſelf, to all that ſhall <hi>ſee him face to face,</hi> the Lord ſaith unto him, ver. 23, 24. <hi>Peace be unto thee; fear not; thou ſhalt not die; and Gideon</hi> (for further ratification of this Priviledge or diſpenſation) <hi>built an altar unto the Lord, and called it</hi> Jehovah Shalom, <hi>that is, the Lord ſend peace;</hi> or the Lord will be a Lord of peace unto his ſervants. Yet could not this aſſurance, made by the Lord himſelf unto <hi>Gideon,</hi> exempt his Succeſſors from the like or greater fear upon notice of Gods extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preſence. For ſo <hi>Manoah (Samſons</hi> father) after long Conference with the Lord, after he knew that it was an Angel of the Lord, which had brought the Meſſage to him of <hi>Samſons</hi> birth, ſaid unto his Wife, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>We ſhall ſurely die, becauſe we have ſeen God. But his Wife ſaid unto him, if the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, he would not have received a burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and a meat offering at our hands; neither would he have ſhewed us all theſe things, neither would he at this time have told us ſuch things, as theſe, ver.</hi> 23. So then Gods extraordinary preſence is terrible even to his ſervants, to fleſh and blood without exception, though in the iſſue it will prove comfortable to ſuch as truly fear him, and faithfully rely upon his promiſes. <hi>St. Peter</hi> long after this time was a man leſs conſcious of many grievous ſins, then moſt of us alive this day are, yet not upon any ſight or ſpectacle of Gods Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Preſence; but only upon an inſtinct or ſecret apprehenſion of his Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Preſence in Chriſt as man, notified unto him by the miraculous draught of fiſhes, which he took by his direction and command, cries out; <hi>Lord depart from me: for I am a ſinful man, Luke</hi> 5. 8. And <hi>St. Paul</hi> before his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>fell to the earth</hi> upon a ſuddain glimpſe or repreſentation of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious light, wherein Chriſt ſhall appear at the laſt day, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 3, 4. And after he had heard <hi>A Voyce</hi> ſaying unto him (though in no extraordinary manner for terror) <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> He trembling and aſtoniſhed at the name of Jeſus, ſaid, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> ver. 6. No marvel if <hi>St. Paul,</hi> being conſcious of perſecution intended by him againſt Chriſts Church, and having by Fact and Reſolution declared himſelf to be Chriſts Enemy, were thus affrighted at the Sight and Voice; when as <hi>St. Peter, St. James</hi> and <hi>St. John,</hi> after long and peculiar familiarity with Chriſt, and after many gracious promiſes made unto them of Gods ſpecial protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over them, were thrown down to the earth with a more placid and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="3405" facs="tcp:32220:60"/>
Voice, then that, which <hi>St. Paul</hi> heard. The Voice, which they heard out of the cloud, was this, <hi>This is my well beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him.</hi> And when they heard it (ſaith the text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 6.) <hi>they fell on their faces, and were ſore afraid;</hi> until Chriſt <hi>came and touched them, and ſaid; ariſe and be not afraid.</hi> This ſtrange dejection of theſe three great Apoſtles at ſo mild and gentle a Voice, yet a Voice uttered from the extraordinary preſence of God, gives us a Remarkable Document or grounded Obſervation of the truth of that ſaying of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50. <hi>Now this I ſay brethren, that fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</hi> Chriſt had told theſe Three, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 28. that they ſhould <hi>ſee,</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>the Son of man coming in his Kingdom. Peter</hi> had a deſire to have inherited that joy, wherewith his heart was raviſhed at the ſight of our Saviours Transfiguration, which (as you heard before) was but a repreſentation of his coming in glory to Judge the world; and out of this deſire he ſaid, <hi>Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three Tabernacles; one for Thee, one for</hi> Moſes, <hi>and one for</hi> Elias. Yet as ſoon as he heard the Voice, the Antipathie between ſinful fleſh, and the fruition of Gods preſence (or the inheritance of that Kingdom of Chriſt, which was then repreſented) begun to ſhew it ſelf. And what ſhall We do then, which are conſcious of more grievous ſins, then <hi>St. Peter, S. Iames,</hi> or <hi>S. John,</hi> then were? unto whom both the Spectacle of Chriſts glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſence, and the Voice or Sound, which in that day ſhall be heard from heaven, will be far more terrible then any manifeſtation of Gods preſence, whether made by Voice or Sight unto our Firſt Parents, unto <hi>Gideon,</hi> unto <hi>Manoah,</hi> or unto any of his Apoſtles recorded in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us now take a view of ſuch repreſentations or deſcriptions of the <note place="margin">A view of the terrible Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Sounds preceding Doomſday.</note> Terrible Spectacles, which ſhall be ſeen, and of the Terrible Voices or ſounds, which in that laſt day ſhall be heard, as Gods Prophets or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts have framed to us.</p>
               <p>Theſe repreſentations are of Two Sorts, either Charactred out unto us in meer Words, or in Matters of Fact hiſtorically related.</p>
               <p>To begin with the Terrible Spectacles, which ſhall appear before the laſt day, or at the leaſt before the Proceſs or Judgment begin. Theſe are moſt punctually expreſt by the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> Cap. 2. 30, 31. <hi>And I will ſhew won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the heavens, and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of ſmoak, the Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and the Moon into blood, before the great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>

The Lord alſo ſhall roar out of</hi> Sion <hi>&amp; utter his voice out of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>&amp; the heavens &amp; the earth ſhall ſhake.</hi> The Terrors here foretold were really repreſented by the firſt deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> whoſe approach to execute Gods Judgments upon that land and people was propheſied of, by this Prophet, in the beginning of this Second Chapter; yet ſo foretold by him, as the plagues there threatned might by Repentance have been prevented; So could not the Terrors foretold in the Second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie; at leaſt the Prophet expreſſeth no means for averting theſe fearful ſigns in the heavens and earth. This later prophecie is in particular exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by our Saviour; <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 27, 29, 30. <hi>For as the lightning cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the Weſt; So ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be.

                  <hi>the Son of man in Heaven; and then ſhall all the Tribes of the Earth mourn, and they ſhall ſee the Son of man coming in the clouds of Heaven with power and great glory:</hi> Both the Prophecie of <hi>Joel,</hi> and this prediction of our Savior were in part fulfilled, ſhortly after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Titus,</hi> by the burning of the Mount <hi>Veſuvius</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> a Province of <hi>Italy;</hi> the <note place="margin">See <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 24. §. 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> manner and effects whereof, how fearful and terrible they were, not to <hi>Rome</hi> onely or <hi>Italy,</hi> but to a great part of <hi>Africa,</hi> to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Syria,</hi> and to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with the Countries adjoyning, and how conſonant they were unto the Prophet <hi>Joels,</hi> and our Saviors Prediction, may be gathered from <hi>Dion,</hi> in his 66. and 68. Books; and from other <hi>Roman</hi> Heatheniſh Writers of thoſe times: But however the world had a general warning of the <hi>laſt Judgement,</hi> in that fearful Spectacle, yet may we not deny that the like or more fearful Spectacles ſhall be again exhibited, upon, or immediatly before our <hi>Savior's ſecond coming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>St. Peters Comments</hi> upon the forecited Prophecie of <hi>Ioel, Acts</hi> 2. 20. there ariſeth <hi>A Queſtion;</hi> The Prophet ſaith, as the Hebrew word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that theſe ſigns ſhould be exhibited <hi>before the great and Terrible day of the Lord.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, They ſhall be exhibited before the great and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous,</hi> or <hi>notable</hi> day of the Lord: So indeed the 70 <hi>Interpreters,</hi> whoſe Tranſlation St. <hi>Peter</hi> follows, renders the Hebrew <hi>[Hannora]</hi> not as the Latines do, <hi>horrendum,</hi> or <hi>tremendum,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Conſpicuous:</hi> And the reaſon why they ſo render it, as ſome later Criticks think, was becauſe they took the Original word to be a Derivative, or Branch of the Hebrew word <hi>Raah,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>To ſee;</hi> and ſo the Object of it ſhould be only ſome viſible apparition or matter of Sight; whereas the later and more accurate Hebricians, take the ſame Hebrew word to be a Branch of the root <hi>Jarah,</hi> which ſignifieth to Fear, or Dread; and for this reaſon render it not the <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or conſpicuous day,</hi> but the <hi>terrible day of the Lord.</hi> But there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of conceiving any error, either in the 70 Interpreters concerning the derivation of the Hebrew word <hi>[Hannora]</hi> or of any alteration of Rules (concerning the right derivation of words) between the Ancient and Modern <hi>Hebricians:</hi> For the Greek word, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which our Engliſh renders, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> or <hi>Conſpicuous,</hi> is, as Grammarians ſay, <hi>Mediae ſignificationis;</hi> that is, General, to any ſtrange or uncouth apparitions in the Heavens; whether they be apparitions of Horror and Dread, or onely of Lightſomneſs, or good <hi>hope: Every man prayed,</hi> ſaith the Author of the ſecond of <hi>Maccabees, chap.</hi> 5. 4. that the <hi>apparition might turn to good:</hi> Yet was the Apparition then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Prodigious and fearful.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But the moſt lively repreſentation of the laſt Judgement, as well for <note place="margin">The terrors on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Types of the Terrors of Doomſday.</note> matter of Fearful Spectacle, as for matter of Terrible Sound, was exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited immediately by God himſelf, at the promulgation of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai: And it came to paſs on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders, and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the Trumpet exceeding loud, ſo that all the people that were in the camp trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: And Moſes brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they ſtood at the neather part of the mount: And mount Sinai was altogether on a ſmoak, becauſe the Lord deſcended upon it in fire; and the ſmoak thereof aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended as the ſmoak of a Furnace, and the whole Mount quaked greatly,</hi> Exod. 19. 16, 17, 18. Our Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 21. addeth (which is not in the Old Teſtament expreſt) <hi>So terrible was the Sight, that Moſes ſaid, I exceedingly fear and quake:</hi> And if <hi>Moſes</hi> the Man of God did ſo exceedingly quake at this Sight, Who ſhall be able to ſtand without trembling and quaking at the like?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3407" facs="tcp:32220:61"/>
But ſhall Chriſts appearance at the laſt day be like to this fearful Sight at the giving of the Law? Yes, and a great deal more terrible. What Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort then doth the Goſpel of Chriſt afford us Chriſtians more, then <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law did the Iſraelites? The Law being given in this Terrible manner, did Prognoſticate or portend their fearful end which ſhould adhere unto it, or ſeck ſalvation by it without the interceſſion of a Mediator, who was to be the Author and Fountain of a better meſſage, and more gladſome tidings from Heaven to all ſuch as ſhall ſeek Redemption by him, or Abſolution from the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>This is the Prerogative of the Goſpel, as it ſtands in oppoſition to the Law, and this Prerogative is proſecuted at large by our Apoſtle in that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. But the benefit of this Prerogative is not abſolutely Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, but Conditional. It extends onely to ſuch as ſhall ſhew better obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Chriſt and to his Goſpel, then moſt of the Iſraelites did to <hi>Moſes</hi> and to his Law: To ſuch as contemn or diſobey the Goſpel, Chriſt ſhall appear a more dreadful and terrible Judge in the laſt day, then he appeared unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> This point of Doctrine is fully proſecuted by our Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25, 26, 27. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh; for if they eſcaped not, who refuſed him that ſpake on the earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him, that ſpeaketh from heaven; whoſe voice then did ſhake the earth; but now he hath promiſed, ſaying, Yet once more I ſhake not the earth onely, but alſo heaven: And this word,</hi> Yet once more, <hi>ſignifieth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of things that are made, that theſe things which cannot be ſhaken, may remain:</hi> God (as a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father obſerves) did call his people at the giving of the <hi>Law</hi> unto the <hi>mountain then burning with fire,</hi> to teſtifie unto the world what our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith in the concluſion of <hi>chap.</hi> 12. <hi>That he is a conſuming fire</hi> unto the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Tranſgreſſors of his Laws; and that fire and ſmoke, that burning, blackneſs, darkneſs, and tempeſt, ſhall be the everlaſting portion of all ſuch, as ſhall not be found in Chriſt at the day of Judgement, nor then abſolved by him from the curſe of the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Point</hi> which I would commend to <hi>the Reader</hi>'s more ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <note place="margin">A <hi>ſpecial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,</hi> It was Chriſt that ſhook the earth at the giving of the Law.</note> out of the 26. <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> is, <hi>That it was the voice of Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator of the New Covenant, which did ſhake the earth at the giving of the Law:</hi> The Apoſtle takes it as granted from the Common Rule of Interpretation, well known in thoſe times, that the ſhaking of the Earth then, was an Emblem or token of <hi>the mutability of the Law,</hi> and of the <hi>unſtability of the Earth</hi> or viſible World it ſelf. The Earth being then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſhaking or motion, did thereby teſtifie it ſelf to be obnoxious unto ruine and deſtruction: And in that (after this terrible <hi>commotion of the Earth</hi> at the giving of the Law, when <hi>the Mountains,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114. 4. <hi>skipped like rams, and the little hills like yong ſheep)</hi> God again, by the Prophet <hi>Haggai, chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. denounceth, That <hi>yet once more</hi> he would ſuddenly <hi>ſhake the heavens, and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land:</hi> This intimates unto us, that the <hi>ſecond commotion</hi> of the Heavens, and of the Earth (which was to be <hi>once,</hi> and no more) ſhould finally accompliſh that which was fore-ſhadowed or repreſented by <hi>the former commotion of the earth</hi> at the giving of the Law: This <hi>ſecond commotion</hi> ſhall bring the Heaven and Earth to ruine, and put an end to all things mutable; or (as our Apoſtle ſpeaks) it includes the <hi>removing of thoſe things that can be ſhaken, that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain;</hi> that is, that there may be a world ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: That which the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> intimates more darkly, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

               <p>Some late Hiſtorians and Aſtronomers, relate a natural Eclipſe of the <note place="margin">Clavius.</note> Sun ſo terrible in <hi>Spain,</hi> that the Crows, and other Fowls of the air, ſeeking as it ſeems to flie from it, were ſo affrighted with the ſuddain increaſe of darkneſs about mid-day, that they fell down to the earth in a deadly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: What tongue then can expreſs the Dread and Horror, which the <note place="margin">Another Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells, that <hi>the Birds fell to the earth</hi> upon a great ſhout gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or at ſome great ſolemnity.</note> terrible apparitions at that day ſhall produce in all ſuch as have lived and died in incredulity or ſecurity of the Judgement which ſhall follow them; in all on whom that day ſhall come, as ſuddenly (without any better obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or preparation for it) as the forementioned Eclipſe of the Sun did upon the reaſonleſs Fowls of the air? Or if you deſire a further a deſcription of the Terror, which ſhall then fall upon the Inhabitants of the earth, even upon the moſt intrepid and undanted, in reſpect of any ordinary Terrors; then take it from St. <hi>Iohn, Rev.</hi> 6. 15, 16. <q>And the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men, and every bond-man, and every free-man, hid themſelves in the dens, and in the Rocks of the mountains; and ſaid to the mountains, and to the rocks, fall on us, and hide us,—.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much was diſtinctly likewiſe fore-told, and Prophetically ſet forth by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> chap. 2. 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That neither St. <hi>Johns</hi> words, nor the Prophet <hi>Eſays</hi> are Hyperbolical, but are Literally meant by them, and really and punctually to be fulfilled, is clear from our Saviors Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> and the like paſſages of other Prophets, at his going to the Croſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 30, 31. <hi>Then ſhall they begin to ſay to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>

                  <hi>fall on us; and to the hills, cover us; for if they do theſe things in a green tree, what ſhall be done in a dry?</hi> Howbeit, this terror ſhall not meerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from theſe Terrible Spectacles and Sounds which ſhall be Antecedent to the Final Judgement, but from the Sight of Chriſt placed in his ſeat of Judicature. So St. <hi>Iohn</hi> (in the forecited place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 16.) tells us, That the Affrightment and dread that ſeized upon the great men of the Earth did ariſe from ſeeing the face of him that ſate upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Having thus ſhown the Terrors antecedent to the Proceſs, we go on to <note place="margin">The <hi>Proceſs</hi> of the final Judgement.</note> the Proceſs it ſelf. That takes beginning from the Manner of Chriſt's Coming and approach; or from His Appearance, as he ſhall ſit in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He ſhall come from Heaven, or from the Right hand of the Throne of God, where he now ſitteth, to execute Judgment, in the open air, or in that region wherein the clouds have their Rake. The Manner of his Progreſs or approach ſhall be Swift; and, as before hath been intimated, to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion Violent. For at his coming to Judgment, and not before, ſhall the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>'s Prayer or Wiſh be accompliſhed; <hi>Oh that thou wouldeſt rent the heavens, that thou wouldſt come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy preſence. As when the melting fire burneth, the fire cauſeth the waters to boyl; to make thy name known to thy adverſaries, that the nations may tremble at thy preſence: When thou didſt terrible things, which we looked not for, thou cameſt down, the mountains flowed down at thy preſence,</hi> Eſay, 64. 1, 2, 3. But becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> intimates (in the fore-cited place) that the chief cauſe of Terror, was the ſight of him that ſate upon the Throne; we ſhall <hi>firſt</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how his Throne or Preſence is deſcribed in the Old Teſtament: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how theſe Deſcriptions or Repreſentations are decyphred or charactred out unto us (by more then parallels) in the New.</p>
               <p>Now all the Prophecies or Predictions, which to this purpoſe can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, <note place="margin">Of this Rule, ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 11. §. 9.</note> muſt all be interpreted by the Rule heretofore given; <q>that is, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be <hi>literally</hi> meant or verified of ſome former times or events, yet they are verified or meant of them <hi>Inchoativè</hi> onely: They are not, they cannot be <hi>Completivè</hi> applyed to any other time or times, beſides the day of Final Judgement, or the world to come, which ſhall enſue upon it:</q> The terror of his Throne, and of him that ſitteth thereon, is deſcribed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9, 10. <q>I beheld till the Thrones were caſt down, and the Ancient of days did ſit, whoſe garment was white as ſnow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his Throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery ſtream iſſued and came forth from before him, thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him: the Judgement was ſet, and the Books were opened.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Fiery Wheels are Emblems of his ſuddain approach, or of the ſwiftneſs of his Judgements to overtake his Enemies: Though the Viſion was new and uncouth, yet the Branches of the things ſeen or revealed unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> were known before unto Gods Prophets; His Seat or Throne was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of old; ſo faith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 4. <q>Thou haſt maintained my right and my cauſe, thou ſateſt in the Throne Judging right: And again, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7.</q> 
                  <q>O thou enemy, deſtruction is come to a perpetual end, and thou haſt deſtroyed Cities, their memorial is periſhed with them: But the Lord ſhall endure for ever, he hath prepared his Throne for Judgement.</q> [See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96: <hi>ver.</hi> 10. 13.

<pb n="3410" facs="tcp:32220:63"/>
an Emblem of the Law, which was an Emptineſs or <hi>vacuum</hi> in reſpect of the Goſpel; and as all things elſe in the Law prefigured or forepainted, were ſolidly accompliſhed in the Goſpel: So theſe Seats, which are here indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely repreſented unto us by <hi>Daniel,</hi> without any ſpecification of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, without intimation of any ſitting on them, are pictured unto us by St. <hi>John,</hi> with 24.

That as all the Truths of both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will conſummately be fulfilled, ſo the Saints of Both may then be moſt perfectly united in the Church Triumphant.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But to proceed to ſuch other Repreſentations as are to be found in the Scripture: This manner of Chriſts coming to Judge the earth, or of his appearance in glory, was repreſented unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and to the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 10. 17. <q>The ſight of the glory of the Lord, was like devouring fire on the top of the mount, in the eyes of the children of Iſrael:</q> And this fire had devoured them, if they had approached the mountain, or Gods preſence, without Gods invitation: <q>But <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi> and 70. of the Elders of Iſrael went up, and ſaw the God of Iſrael, and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a <hi>Saphir</hi> ſtone, and as it were the body of Heaven in its clearneſs:</q> And upon the Nobles of the children of Iſrael he laid not his hand.</p>
               <p>This was a Peculiar Priviledge or diſpenſation: Alſo they ſaw God, and did eat and drink; and in this they repreſented the ſtate of the Elect; which, notwithſtanding the terror of that laſt day, ſhall be invited by Chriſt, and be admitted to eat and drink with him in his Kingdom. But this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion during the time of the Law was not granted to all Iſrael, but to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and to the 70. Elders or Nobles of Iſrael only; unto all the reſt, whom God did not vouchſafe to invite, the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, though ſeen afar off, was Terrible; ſo terrible that they durſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto it. So ſhall the coming of the Son of Man be to all the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of the earth, which have not hearkned to his ſweet and loving Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here on earth: All ſuch as have neglected them, or make their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before him without a garment or habit in ſome ſort ſuitable to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, unto which they have been invited, ſhall be everlaſtingly excluded and caſt into utter darkneſs, where ſhall be nothing but weeping, and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gnaſhing of teeth: But the thred which I am now to follow, is the forementioned Prophecie, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now, whether <hi>in the viſion of the Ancient of days, God the Father were perſonally repreſented;</hi> or whether <hi>it were a repreſentation of the Godhead or Divine Power onely, as it is indiviſibly in the Bleſſed Trinity, without any note of Perſonal difference;</hi> or whether <hi>at the laſt day there ſhall be any diſtinct repreſentation of Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of the Father;</hi> or whether <hi>The Throne of the Son of God ſhall then onely appear;</hi> are <hi>Queſtions</hi> which I will refer wholly to the Schools. It ſufficeth us to believe and know, that <hi>the Father Judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgement,</hi> eſpecially this Final Judgement, <hi>to the Son;</hi> and that the SON OF MAN ſhall then appear in the <hi>Glory of his God-head,</hi> in Glory equal to <hi>God the Father.</hi>

What Manner of appearance this ſhall be, and how the world ſhall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, we are now to inquire ſo far as is fitting, taking the deſcription of it from Gods written word. And haply, leſt we ſhould conceive of God the Father, as more ancient for dayes, then the Son, (which Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Divine Nature the pictures of the Bleſſed Trinity ſeen and allowed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, do naturally and inevitably ſuggeſt to the unlearned) <hi>St. John</hi> doth deſcribe the Son of Man, or that glory wherein the Son of God and the Son of Man ſhall then appear, much what after the ſame manner, that <hi>Daniel</hi> had done the Ancient of dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9, 10. The deſcription of the Son of God and of the Son of Man taken by <hi>St. John,</hi> is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>And I ſaw in the middeſt of the</hi> 7. <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. His head and his hairs were white like wooll, as white as ſnow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire. And his feet like unto fine braſſe, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the ſound of many waters. And he had in his right hand ſeven ſtars, and out of his mouth went a ſharp two edged ſword, and his countenance was as the Sun ſhineth in his ſtrength.</hi>

To ſhew us that his Glorious Majeſty is altogether unexpreſſible by Man or Angel, it is expreſly added by <hi>St. Iohn</hi> in the next words, <hi>And he had A Name written, that no man knew, but he himſelf.</hi> And yet, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. it is ſaid, <hi>His Name is called, The Word of God.</hi> This is not that Name which no man knew beſides himſelf, for <hi>St. John</hi> knew him by this Name when he wrote his Goſpel; and this is a Name, which doth more fitly, and more fully expreſs the Majeſty, Glory and Power, wherein he ſhall at the laſt day appear, then the former Attributes of Faithful and True, or any other Name that is given unto him in the Word of God: This contains all the reſt.

               <p>The Power of Chriſt here deſcribed by <hi>S.

All ſuch as denied either the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> or the <hi>Immortality</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> all ſuch as doubted or were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of either of theſe truths, did likewiſe deny, or were doubtful or ignorant of the <hi>Reſurrection of the body.</hi> But on the contrary, neither all, nor moſt of ſuch as did deny, or were ignorant, or doubtful of the <hi>Reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> did either deny or were ignorant or doubtful of the <hi>immortality</hi> of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>But no marvel if the heathens, which did not doubt of <hi>the immortality of the ſoul,</hi> were altogether, or for the moſt part, ignorant of <hi>the Reſurrection of the body,</hi> when as in this <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> which God had viſibly graced with many excellent gifts of the Spirit, there were ſome, a great ſort too many, which ſaid, <hi>There was no Reſurrection of the dead;</hi> and the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> a people docile and apt to take the impreſſion or moſt lively character of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> a people excelling other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in brotherly love, were ignorant, in part, of this great Myſtery, and from their ignorance or ſcant meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in it, did <hi>mourn</hi> beyond meaſure for their dead, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and of the Heathens, that of our Saviour unto the <hi>Sadduces, Matth.</hi> 22. 29. is moſt true. <hi>They therefore erred becauſe they knew not the Scriptures, nor the Power of God.</hi>

Albeit none of the heathens did expreſly acknowledge ſuch a <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> as we believe; although the moſt of them were ready to deny it when it was propoſed unto them; yet, many of them had divers <hi>Implicit Notions</hi> of it.

Such as had been given over to beaſtly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, were to take up their habitations in the bodies of Swine. The ſouls of others leſs harmful, yet ſtupid and dull, had their tranſmigration allotted by this Philoſopher into Sheep or Calves.

This progreſs of one and the ſame ſoul through divers bodies, was not (in the opinion of ſuch as firſt conceived or nurſt it) to continue for ever. For <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did not deny an eternal Reſt unto mens ſouls after this pilgrimage or progreſs were ended. <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>For catu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi> lib. 1. pag. 87, 90.</note> Now this progreſs or pilgrimage, as ſome avouch, was to endure but unto the production of the third or fourth Body.</p>

               <p>In this and the like particulars <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> might many wayes err without any groſs inconſonancy to their general principles. And one of <hi>Plato</hi>'s general Principles was, <hi>That the humane ſoul was in the body</hi> tanquam nauta in nave, <hi>after ſuch a manner as the Maſter Mariner is in the ſhip to direct and guide it.</hi> And as a Mariner may without loſs undertake the government of divers Ships ſucceſſively, ſo one and the ſame reaſonable ſoul might guide or manage ſundry bodies. In the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> diverſity of actions, of manners, of diſpoſitions did no more argue diverſity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſouls or ſpirits, then variety of muſical ſounds in various wind-inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as in the <hi>Sackbut, Cornet, Shalm,</hi> or <hi>Trumpet)</hi> doth argue diverſity of breath, or of Muſicians. One and the ſame muſician may wind them all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, and yet the muſick ſhall be much different, becauſe of the diverſity of the inſtrument. In all theſe opinions they did only <hi>err, not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> They did not err againſt, at leaſt their error includes no oppoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the <hi>Power of God.</hi> For if it had pleaſed him thus to place the ſoul in the body, or to take it out of one body, and put it into another, as theſe <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> dreamed, ſo it might have been, ſo it muſt have been. Nor did their error include any denial of the <hi>Power of God,</hi> but rather an approach or ſtep to the diſcovery or acknowledgement of it, againſt modern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts.</p>

               <p n="6">6.

                  </note> of the ſoul, hold it withall to be an <hi>Antecedent</hi> ſo neceſſary for evincing the future <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the body (or reſtauration of the ſame man who dyes) that if the ſoul were not immortal, there could be no reſurrection of the body, no Identical reſtauration of men that periſh and are conſumed to duſt. They which deny the <hi>Immortalitie</hi> of the ſoul, do <hi>therefore erre becauſe they know not the Scriptures,</hi> nor the <hi>Will of God</hi> revealed in them concerning the ſtate of the ſoul after death. For if the ſoul of <hi>Chriſt, as man,</hi> were (as we muſt believe it was) of the ſame nature that our ſouls are of; if his ſoul did not die with his body, our ſouls ſhall not die with our bodies.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt at the very point of death or diſſolution of ſoul and body, did commend his ſoul into his Fathers hands. And <hi>God the Father</hi> took a more ſpecial care of his ſoul then either <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> or <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea</hi> did of his body. That God likewiſe did take the ſouls of the faithful into his cuſtody at their departure from their bodies, our Saviour long before had taught us, in his Anſwer to the <hi>Sadduces, Matth.</hi> 22. 31, 32. <hi>As touching the reſurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was ſpoken unto you by God, ſaying? I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob. <hi>God is not the God of the dead but of the living.</hi> And, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> addeth <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. ver. 38. <hi>All live unto him:</hi> not alwayes in their bodies, but <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in their ſouls,</hi> which alwayes expect a ſecond conjunction or re-union to their proper bodies. And St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> when his perſecutors did deſtroy his body, commends his ſoul into Chriſts hands, as Chriſt had done His Soul into the hands of his Father. So that no man can doubt of the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="3427" facs="tcp:32220:71"/>
or perpetual duration of the ſoul, unleſs he be altogether ignorant of <hi>theſe,</hi> and <hi>many</hi> like paſſages in the Scriptures. But they which deny <hi>all Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of the Reſurrection,</hi> or Identical reſtauration of the ſame man to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily life (in caſe his ſoul were mortal, or might utterly ceaſe to be with the body) do err, not only out of ignorance of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or of <hi>The Will of God</hi> revealed in Scriptures; but this their ignorance ſuppoſeth an ignorance or denial of the <hi>Power of God.</hi> For <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>able out of ſtones to raiſe up children unto</hi> Abraham, is no leſs powerful perfectly to reſtore <hi>the ſelf ſame</hi> body and ſoul which now are, and really to repreſent the <hi>ſelf ſame man</hi> which now is, albeit both body and ſoul ſhould, at his death, not only die, but be utterly annihilated; that is, although no more either of body or ſoul did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after death then was extant before the firſt Creation of all things. Now before the firſt Creation there was not ſo much as a particle or leaſt portion either of mans ſoul or body; For all things were created out of Nothing; and all things might be created the ſame again that now they are, albeit they were by Gods power, or by ſubſtraction of his influence totally reſolved into nothing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. All theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> following are moſt true.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That as God did make all things of nothing, ſo he is able, if it ſhould pleaſe him, to reſolve all things into nothing.</hi> This is eſſentially included in the <hi>Article</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>Propoſitions</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of Omnipotencie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So is this <hi>Second</hi> likewiſe; <hi>Although all things created were reſolved into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, God is able to make them again the ſelf ſame ſubſtances that they ſometimes were, or now are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe is this <hi>Third: Albeit the bodies of men be not utterly reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing when they die, but into the Elements, of which they conſiſt or are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; as into the Earth, Air, Water, &amp;c. yet every mans body, at the day of final appearance before our Judge, may be Numerically the ſame that now it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All theſe Propoſitions are Objectively Poſsible, that is, they imply no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in nature; and, not implying any contradiction in nature, they are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Objects of Omnipotent Power.</hi> That is, <hi>God is able to work all theſe Effects in nature, which unto Nature, or natural Cauſes are impoſsible.</hi> But that either the ſouls or bodies of men ſhall be annihilated or reſolved into nothing, we are not bound to believe; becauſe the Scripture doth no where teſtifie <hi>Gods Will</hi> or purpoſe ſo to reſolve them. Their annihilation or diſſolution, their re-production or re-union meerly depends upon the <hi>Will or Powerful Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God.</hi> And albeit the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of one and the ſame man may be <hi>demonſtrated to be in Nature poſsible:</hi> Yet, That this Poſſibilitie ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Act; That every Man ſhall undoubtedly riſe again in the body, to receive that which he hath done in his body: Or, With what manner of body for qualifications they ſhall ariſe, This cannot be taught by Nature, but muſt be learned or believed from Scripture.</p>
               <p>To begin with the Second Propoſition <hi>[Although all things created were reſolved into nothing, God is able to make them again the ſelf ſame nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical ſubstances, that they ſometime were, or now are.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Proof of this Propoſition, I take as granted; <hi>That all things, which by Creation took their beginning, had a true Poſsibilitie of being numerically</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">That there is a <hi>Logical Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie</hi> preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Power. See Book 10. Fol. 3177.</note> 
                  <hi>what they were, before they actually were:</hi> otherwiſe it was impoſsible for them <hi>actually to have been.</hi> Now this Poſsibility (allotted to every thing before it be) of being <hi>numerically what it is</hi> (or hath been) was not limited unto <hi>This or That ſet Point</hi> or tract <hi>of time,</hi> but was of it ſelf, indifferent unto all times, from eternitie. All the Coexiſtence, which any thing created hath with
<pb n="3428" facs="tcp:32220:72"/>
                  <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> part of time, is not from any eſſentiall dependence which it hath on this or that time, but meerly from the <hi>Will or Pleaſure of the eternall</hi> Creator, who hath appointed <hi>to every thing a ſet time</hi> or ſeaſon. <hi>The ſelf ſame men</hi> which now are, might have been an hundred years ago; or, if their birth or production had been deferred till a hundred years after this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, they might by their Creators appointment be <hi>Then the ſame men</hi> that now they are. Their <hi>Actual Being</hi> in this Age, doth not take away the <note place="margin">The bringing <hi>Poſſibilitie</hi> into <hi>Act,</hi> doth not impair Gods power, but ſhewes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it, <hi>pro hac vice.</hi> See §. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Poſsibilitie</hi> either of being before this Time or after it: For, <hi>Poſsibilitie</hi> is perpetuall, and at all times reducible into Act, whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe the Creator to appoint or allott it <hi>actuall Being</hi> or exiſtence. The Reduction of <hi>Poſsibilitie</hi> into <hi>Act</hi> (which is the perfection thereof) doth not prejudice or diminiſh the Creators Power of doing the like again; though the doing of it once makes it <hi>impoſsible</hi> that the doing of it again ſhould be the firſt time or <hi>Turn</hi> of doing it. The omiting or forbearance to bring <hi>Poſsibilitie</hi> into Act, in the time paſt, doth not lapſe it more then <hi>pro illâ vice.</hi> It leaves us this <hi>poſsibilitie,</hi> now truly to ſay; <hi>That which was not done a thouſand years ago might have been then done; and the like or ſame may yet be done by The Power Almightie.</hi> As every body indued with Colour is alwayes viſible, though there be no eye preſent to look upon it, (for it is therefore truely viſible, in that any creature endued with ſight may actually ſee it ſo often as it ſhall pleaſe to look upon it:) So, every thing which implies no contradiction in nature, is always truely Poſsible; and therefore eternally Poſsible, becauſe <hi>The Eternall</hi> may give it <hi>actuall Being</hi> or exiſtence at all times, when it pleaſeth him. <hi>This Poſsibilitie is at all times the object of his Omnipotent Power,</hi> as viſibilitie is of ſight; and, as whatſoever is viſible may at all times be ſeen by a clear eye; ſo whatever is poſsible may at all times be done or made by God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is evident, That <hi>God by his Power</hi> hath given all things, which now are, or heretofore have been, actuall Being; that is, he hath created them. <hi>Creation is the making all things of Nothing: Annihilation is the reducing of any thing that hath been made, into Nothing. Both acts are proper only unto the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Theſe differ, as Addition and Subſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>Omnipotent Creator.</hi> Suppoſe then ſome man or Angel had been annihilated by his Omnipotent Power a thouſand years ago; It is yet <hi>as poſsible</hi> for the ſame man or Angel to be made again, as it was for him to be made at the firſt. And <hi>the Reaſon</hi> is this; <hi>Annihilation could take nothing from him, ſave only that which Creation gave him.</hi> But <hi>Creation</hi> only gave him Actuall Being or exiſtence; Therefore annihilation onely takes away actual being or exiſtence, not the Poſſibilitie of Being; for that he had before he could be created. Seeing then <hi>Creation</hi> did not give man or Angel Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Being, which was eternally included in the Creators Power; Annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">☞</note> doth not diſſolve or deſtroy this Poſſibilitie, but leaves it only, as Creation found it. And whilſt the Poſſibliitie remaines the ſame, it is ſtill the ſame <hi>Object of the ſame Omnipotent</hi> Power, and may as eaſily be reduced into Act a thouſand years hence, as it was in the firſt Creation.</p>
               <p>To make this Probleme more plain by <hi>Demonſtrating it upon a particular. Adam</hi> the firſtman was Created upon the 6. day from the beginning of time, wherein the heavens and earth were made <hi>of nothing.</hi> Now no diſtinction of time, which did then begin to be; no ſecret power or vertue of time, (which is but a circumſtance of things that are) could either hinder or limit the <hi>Creators Power</hi> for creating of <hi>Adam</hi> upon the firſt day, or give any furtherance to his power for creating him upon the ſixth day, rather then upon the twelfth or 13. day from the beginning of the Creation. Admitting his Creation had been deferred untill the twelfth day, this deferring of his Creation could
<pb n="3429" facs="tcp:32220:72"/>
have been no lett or hinderance why he might not have been <hi>the ſelf ſame man</hi> which was created the ſixth day. As if any man ſhould caſt a bullet in the ſame mould at twelve of the clock, which he had purpoſed to caſt at eight, but did deferr the caſting of it till that time, either upon pleaſure, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of other occaſions; that delay would no way argue the bullet moulded at that time not to be the very ſelf ſame which it would have been, if it had been caſt four hours before, or four hours after.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Models</hi> of all things created, or poſsible to be created, are more certainly, and more conſtantly contained in the <hi>Almighty Creators Power or Wiſedom,</hi> then any <hi>Models</hi> which man can make, are in mans power and skill. And ſo are all the creatures likewiſe more exactly anſwerable to the <hi>Models</hi> contained in <hi>his Power and Wiſdom,</hi> then any bullet or other materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls can be to the mould, wherein they are caſt. Difference of time or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of their production can breed no difference at all in the things produced, ſo long as every one is produced according to that exact <hi>Modell,</hi> or exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forme which it had in God from Eternity. According to this patern or <hi>modell,</hi> the firſt man (as Scripture tells us) was created upon the ſixth day: Suppoſe the ſame Creator had annihilated him upon the eighth day; This <hi>Annihilation</hi> ſuppoſed, there is no impoſsibilitie or difficultie imaginable, why he might not upon the twelfth or thirteenth day have been created a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the ſelf ſame man he was upon the ſixth day; ſeeing it was poſsible for God to have deferred his Creation till that day, and yet to have created him <hi>the ſelf ſame individall perſon,</hi> that was created upon the ſixth day.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Neither the exerciſe of <hi>Gods Almighty Power</hi> in creating <hi>Adam</hi> upon the ſixth day, nor the ſuppoſed exerciſe of the ſame power in annihilating him the eighth day, could breed any prejudice to the poſſibilitie of being created the ſelf ſame man upon the twelfth or thirteenth day, which he had been from his firſt Creation to his annihilation. Indeed to ſay, <hi>That Adam, being created the ſixth day, and ſuppoſed to be annihilated upon the eighth day, and created again upon the twelfth or thirteenth day, ſhould be then firſt created, would imply a contradiction.</hi> But it is one thing to ſay, <hi>there be two Creations,</hi> another to ſay; <hi>there be two diſtinct creatures,</hi> or two diſtinct ſubſtances created. <hi>A man might be twice created, and yet not be two diſtinct creatures, but numerically and Identically one and the ſelf ſame man which he was, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly one and the ſelf ſame man, as if he had been but once created, or had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from his creation without any interruption of his duration or exiſtence.</hi> This implies no more contradiction in nature, then to ſay; that the King may create one and the ſame man twice <hi>Earl</hi> or <hi>Duke,</hi> or make him often <hi>the ſame Magiſtrate.</hi> The <hi>Office</hi> or dignity may be the ſelf ſame, albeit there be ſome <hi>vacancie</hi> or interruption in the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> or duration of it. As if a man was depoſed of his Office and dignity at the end of the firſt year, and reſtored again at the end of the ſecond year; this would imply a <hi>diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Creation</hi> or advancement, <hi>no diverſitie at all in the Office</hi> or dignitie, unto which the ſame perſon is twice advanced. Now <hi>Gods Power</hi> over all his creatures, either utterly to annihilate them, or to interrupt them in their actuall exiſtence or duration, and to create them in the ſelf ſame or better eſtate again, is farre greater and more Soveraigne, then any <hi>Princes</hi> civill power to advance or depoſe his ſubjects, or to reſtore them intirely to their former dignities. Admit then, <hi>That God had reſolved the firſt man Adam into nothing at the very firſt inſtant, wherein he did eat the forbidden fruit, with purpoſe not to create him again untill the laſt trumpet ſhall ſound to Judgement; the Terrour of that day ſhould make as deep impreſsion in him then firſt reſtored</hi>
                  <pb n="3430" facs="tcp:32220:73"/>
                  <hi>to life and ſenſe again, as if he had ſuffered him to live but one day, and had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him at even unto Judgment or a final accompt as terrible as in that laſt day it ſhall be to all that die in their ſins.</hi> This whole time of vacancy or ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>actual Being</hi> for almoſt ſix thouſand years would not have ſeem'd ſo long to him at his Reſurrection, as a night paſt over in a dead ſleep is to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, which had murthered his Father in the Evening, and is drawn to the execution as ſoon as he awakes in the morning.</p>
               <p>Thus much of Gods Power in general to raiſe up the ſelf ſame men again, which have been long dead, or, by ſuppoſition, more then dead, utterly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into nothing. Now if we muſt acknowledge it as an <hi>eſſential Branch of the Almighty Creators Power</hi> to be able to raiſe up or create <hi>the ſelf ſame men</hi> again, although they had been annihilated or turned to nothing, we muſt needs acknowledge it as a fruit or <hi>effect of the ſame Power,</hi> to re-unite every mans ſoul and body again at the laſt day; ſeeing the ſoul (as <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> doth teach us) doth ſtill remain the ſame it was, the body being not utterly anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated or conſumed to nothing, but only reſolved into duſt, or into the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> of which it was firſt made. <hi>Sed quomodo, inquis, diſſoluta materia exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri poteſt?

to St. <hi>Peter, I have prayed for thee, that thy faith ſhall not fail, Luke</hi> 22. 32. and of the Popes authority, as of <hi>Peters</hi> pretended Succeſſor in this promiſe; that whatſoever doctrine the Pope ſhall deliver <hi>ex Cathedra</hi> (as he hath done this doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation)</hi> for a point of Faith, they think God bound in Juſtice to uſe his abſolute and Omnipotent power to make it true.

               <p n="11">11. But, <hi>The Queſtion</hi> betwixt us and them, Concerning <hi>Chriſts local or circumſcriptive Bodily preſence in the Sacrament;</hi> is not, whether <hi>God</hi> can make one and the ſame body, to be, at one and the ſame time, in divers places; or whether He can create one and the ſame body again in every hour, or in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, as ſhall ſeem good to him; But whether <hi>it be his will to uſe this his power?</hi> Or whether <hi>his will thus to do, be ſo fully revealed</hi> in Scripture, as that we are bound to believe, <hi>That he doth or will make Chriſts very Bodie and Blood to be locally preſent in every place where, and at all times when, that bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſhall be celebrated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This we deny; And the former Principle or Antecedent <hi>[That God is able to create the ſelf ſame body as often as it pleaſes him]</hi> will never infer their intended Concluſion. Not to queſtion what God can do; we further add <hi>[For Chriſts body, or whole Chriſt God and man, to be bodily preſent, by this means, in many places at once, or in all places at all times wherein that bleſſed Sacrament ſhall be celebrated, is one of thoſe things, which, according to their rules as well as ours, cannot be done, as implying an evident Contradiction in nature:]</hi> It may not be believed nor imagined, becauſe <hi>God did never bind any man to believe ſuch an impoſsibilitie, or Contradiction, as is involved in this doctrine.</hi> It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without the compaſs of the moſt miraculous work, which God hath at any time wrought, or ever promiſed to work. All the former Inſtances or Caſes poſſible, concerning Gods Power <hi>to make one and the ſame man again after he had been annihilated,</hi> are moſt unlike to their intended Concluſion. All the former Inſtances or ſuppoſitions are free from all color or ſuſpition of Contradiction in nature. This ſuppoſed Creation of Chriſts Body of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſince his death, implies as many and as manifeſt Contradictions, as there have been Maſſes in the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not only theſe Aſſertions, but the diſſimilitude alſo of the Caſe in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the former Caſes, will be immediately made clear from the very Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Creation. <hi>To create a body is to make it of nothing;</hi> and to make the ſelf ſame Body which formerly had been, but is reſolved into Nothing, out of Nothing again, is but a ſecond exerciſe of his Creative Power; and whatſoever God before hath done, he is able to do the ſame again. But the Body of Chriſt they acknowledge to be immortal, and abſolutely exempted, not only from Annihilation or reſolution into Nothing, but from all danger of Corruption or diminution.</p>
               <p>Again, whatſoever is Created, whether at the firſt, ſecond, or third time, hath no Actual being until it begin to be by Creation: Now to make <hi>that very thing begin to be, or to begin to be out of nothing,</hi> which already actually <hi>is, is ſomething, is immortal,</hi> and more glorious then any other creature, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a manifeſt Contradiction.

<pb n="3432" facs="tcp:32220:74"/>
that it can never ceaſe to be what it is; therefore it is impoſſible that it ſhould begin to be by a new creation, or be created again. For that which is created, or may be created again, muſt firſt be reſolved into nothing, or ceaſe to be, before it can be created again (ſeeing creation is the making of that, which is not, out of Nothing) or be made again by means miraculous. If then Chriſts Body be locally preſent in the Sacrament, it muſt either be created again, and this ſuppoſeth either annihilation or diſſolution of it; or elſe it muſt be brought out of the heavens into the Prieſts hands; or elſe the preſence of it in many places muſt be created: but Local Preſence is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uncapable of Creation, for it is a Meer Relation, which can neither be created nor made, but reſulteth from, or followeth upon the motion (of things created) from one place to another, or from their creation or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be in that place, wherein they are ſaid to be created.</p>
               <p n="12">12. So it fares with our Adverſaries in this Argument, as it doth with Boot-halers or night-riders which have caught an unlawful prey, being hotly purſued by the right owners. Now their manner is to divide the ſpoil and their company, that they may carry one part one way, and another part ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; that ſo whilſt one is purſued, others may eſcape without purſuit or reſcue of the prey. Through the ignorance or careleſneſs of Gods people, which ſhould have kept a better watch over their own ſouls, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts had made a gainful prey by tranſporting the native ſenſe of our Saviours Words in the inſtitution of the Sacrament to juſtifie the doctrine of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi> And ſince they have been purſued by reformed Writers, as Cozeners and Cheaters of Gods people, ſome of them run one way, ſome <note place="margin">The ſeveral Shifts of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Writers, to maintain their Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</note> another; Some of them ſeek to maintain Chriſts <hi>local preſence or Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> by the former doctrine of Gods Almighty Power, which is able to create one and the ſame body often: Others ſeek to maintain the ſame doctrine, and carry away the prey by the manner of <hi>Angelical motion</hi> from one place to another in an inſtant or moment of time. And if they could draw ſuch as purſue them into theſe ſtraits and ſubtilities, they hope to make their part good againſt ſuch, as are not much converſant in the School-mens nice diſputes concerning the nature or motions of Angels, or know not the difference between the nature and motions of Spirits and Spiritual Bodies.

Or if we take the Church for the <hi>Trent Council</hi> confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> themſelves cannot agree about the meaning of it in this point.

There ſhall be no need then of <hi>Tranſubſtantiating</hi> Sacramental bread into <hi>Chriſts Body,</hi> or wine into his bloud for giving life unto thoſe, that have been long dead, or for effecting that change, which ſhall be wrought in the living; Now, if by the meer <hi>virtual preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood,</hi> the men which have been long dead, ſhall be reſtored to perfect life &amp; immortalitie; ſhall not the ſouls of all, which receive him in the Sacrament by Faith and true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, be raiſed to Newneſs of life by the ſame <hi>virtual preſence,</hi> without any <note place="margin">Of Chriſts virtual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Corinthian Naturaliſt</hi> his Two curious Queſtions.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The former imports thus much; <hi>How is it posſible that the Dead ſhall be raiſed?</hi> Or, it being admitted that it is poſſible for the dead in ſome ſort or manner to ariſe to life; <hi>the next branch</hi> of the ſame <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, <hi>in what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner they ſhall</hi> de Facto <hi>ariſe?</hi> as whether by <hi>Gods Creative Power,</hi> by which he made all things of nothing; or by his <hi>Conſervative Power,</hi> by which he preſerveth all things that are, in their proper <hi>Being;</hi> or advanceth them to an higher eſtate or better Tenure of <hi>Being?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond Queſtion</hi> or Quaerie is, <hi>With what kind of bodies ſhall the dead ariſe?</hi> Whether with the ſelf ſame bodies wherein they died? Or if not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way the ſame, what alteration or change ſhall be wrought in them?</p>
               <p>Unto Both theſe Queſtions our Apoſtle vouchſafeth but this one Anſwer, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

               </p>
               <p>But this Anſwer may ſeem in the firſt place to break the Rule of <hi>Chriſtian Charity:</hi> For many of theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> though in this point of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <note place="margin">An Objection againſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in point of Charitie.</note> erroneous and ignorant, were yet <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> though <hi>weak brethren;</hi> and the Law is general: <hi>he that ſhall ſay unto his brother,</hi> THOU FOOL, <hi>ſhall be guilty of Hell fire,</hi> Matth. 5. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Rule indeed is General, <hi>if this or the like opprobrious ſpeech be hatched out of malice, leavened wrath, or invetered hatred:</hi> But this ſentence they do not incur, out of whoſe mouthes theſe or the like ſpeeches iſſue by <note place="margin">The Anſwer to that Objection.</note> way of juſt <hi>reproof</hi> or <hi>inſtruction;</hi> as from a Maſter to his Scholers, or from a Lord to his Servants, in points wherein they err, and are to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected or inſtructed by him. In theſe caſes, or upon theſe occaſions, their cenſure paſſeth rather <hi>upon the folly,</hi> then <hi>upon the perſons</hi> of them, whom they ſo chaſtiſe, correct, or ſeek to inſtruct.</q> And it is not altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent which ſome have noted upon that place, <hi>That our Apoſtles cenſure doth not aim at any particular or determinate perſon,</hi> but it is indefinitely directed <hi>to all</hi> thoſe, which ſeriouſly make the former queſtions, either concerning the <hi>Poſsibilitie</hi> of mens ariſing from the dead, or the <hi>particular Manner how</hi> this Reſurrection ſhould be wrought, or <hi>with what bodies</hi> they ſhould come forth.</p>
               <p>But many ſuch, as will confeſs his reaſon or Argument to be free from

breach of <hi>Chriſtian Charitie</hi> or good manners, will <hi>queſtion</hi> the <hi>Logical</hi> ſtrength or pertinence of it. The ſtrength or efficacy of it, is queſtionable upon Theſe points; As firſt, <hi>How the dayly experiment of ſeed-corn, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A ſecond ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in point of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie.</note> 
                  <hi>firſt dies and is quickned again, can inferr the Fundamental concluſion by our Apoſtle intended;</hi> to wit, <hi>the Reſurrection of mens bodies,</hi> which have been dead and rotten for many hundred years, and their Reliques diſperſed into ſo many ſeveral Elements, or places, that if the ſeed-corn which men ſow, were but diſperſed into half ſo many places; the husband-man ſhould in vain expect an increaſe, or his ſeed again. Secondly, <hi>admitting this yearly experiment of the ſeed dying and reviving were of force ſufficient to inforce our belief of the former concluſion, that the bodies of men dead may be raiſed to life again, yet the manner or ground of his inference would be impertinent, if not contradictory to the principal concluſion intended by him, which we are bound ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly to believe.</hi> For it is not enough to believe that the bodies of men, which are committed to the grave, ſhall not utterly periſh, but be quickned again, (as the corn which is covered with the ground:) but we are bound further to believe, <hi>That every man ſhall ariſe with his own body,</hi> with the ſame very body, wherein he lived, that he may receive his doom <hi>according to that which he hath done in the body, whether it be good or bad.</hi> This concluſion is not included in the <hi>Apoſtles inference</hi> or Experiment drawn from the corn, which groweth out of the putrified ſeed: for he expreſsly affirmes in the ver. 37. <hi>that the body, which ſpringeth out of the ground, is not the ſame ſeed that is ſown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the former difficultie, ſome good <hi>Commentators</hi> there be, <note place="margin">The Anſwer to this objection.</note> which grant that our <hi>Apoſtles inſtance</hi> in the ſeed, which firſt dies and is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards quickned, is not a <hi>Concludent proof</hi> or forcible Reaſon, but rather a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> or Exemplification; and it is the property or character of ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes or examples, <hi>illuſtrant, non docent,</hi> they may illuſtrate the truth taught, they do not teach or confirm it. <hi>Tertullian</hi> with other of <hi>the Fathers</hi> have diverſe illuſtrations or exmeplifications of the Reſurrection in the courſe of nature, out of all which it would be hard to extract a full <hi>Concludent proof. Lux quotidie interfect a reſplendet,</hi> The light dayly vaniſheth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers brightneſſe again; darkneſſe goes and comes by an interparallel courſe to the removall of light. <hi>Sidera defuncta reviviſcunt.</hi> The ſtars dayly ſet, or fall, and riſe again. The ſeeds of vegetables do not fructifie untill themſelves be diſſolved and corrupted. All things ſublunary are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by periſhing, their reformation or renewing ſuppoſeth a defacing. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe and like obſervations, taken out of <hi>the book of Nature,</hi> may ſerve as <hi>Emblemes</hi> or <hi>devices</hi> for emblazoning or ſetting forth our hopes or belief of the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> But <hi>concludent proofs</hi> they cannot be, unleſſe we grant that <hi>the Book of nature</hi> hath by Gods appointment, <hi>Types,</hi> or ſilent <hi>Prophecies</hi> of Divine myſteries, as well as hath the <hi>book of Grace.</hi> But ſhall we ſay or believe that the <hi>Apoſtles inference</hi> in this place is only <hi>Emblematical</hi> or <hi>Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal?</hi> or rather a <hi>Phyſical or Metaphyſical Concludent Proof?</hi> Aproof, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as acknowledge the truth of the Old Teſtament or written word of God, but a proof (ſo far as it concerns the poſſibility of a Reſurrection) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>the Book of nature?</hi> His concluſion, he ſuppoſeth, might by obſervant Readers be extracted out of the Inſtance or Experiment which he brings. For unleſſe out of the Inſtance given in the Corn, which firſt dies and afterwards is quickened, the Poſſibilitie of the Reſurrection, of ſuch a Reſurrection as he taught, might concludently be proved; they which doubted of, or denyed this truth, had not incurr'd the cenſure of folly, they had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="3436" facs="tcp:32220:76"/>
the Title or name of fools. But not to be able to read that, which was legible in their own books; that is, in the works of nature, was a childiſh folly; a folly, which in men of years and diſcretion could not proceed but from inſufferable incogitancy or negligence. If we examine the <hi>Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> according to the Rules of true Philoſophie, which never diſſents from true Divinitie, his Inſtances are concludent, his Argument is an Argument of proportion, <hi>a majore ad minus,</hi> from the greater to the leſſe. All the difficultie is in framing or ſetting the Termes of it aright.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All the exceptions, which are taken againſt <hi>his proof,</hi> are reducible to this <note place="margin">Exceptions againſt the Proof.</note> 
                  <hi>one general Head; That he argues, or makes his inference, from the works of nature unto a work ſupernatural,</hi> or <hi>from the generation of vegetables ordinary in the courſe of nature, unto the Reſurrection of our bodies, which can be no work of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no generation; but a work as ſupernatural as Creation.</hi> But they which thus Object, ſhould conſider that thoſe works, which we term works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">The Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons anſwered.</note> (as generation of vegetables, the increaſe of the earth, the fruit of trees, and the like) are not in our Apoſtles Philoſophie any way oppoſite to the works of God, or to works miraculous and ſupernatural. This Propoſition is in his Divinitie, and in true Philoſophie, moſt certain; <hi>[Whatſoever nature works, God doth work the ſame:]</hi> and he works the ſame immediatly, though not by himſelf alone, for nature worketh <hi>with him,</hi> though immediatly <hi>by him.</hi> But the former Propoſition is not convertible; that is, we cannot ſay, <hi>that God works nothing without the Co-agencie of nature,</hi> as we ſay, <hi>that nature worketh nothing without the co-operation or Power of God.</hi> Nature worketh nothing, cannot poſsibly work without the power and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of God; God worketh many things, ſince the world was made by him, or nature created by him, without the aſſociation or co-operation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or any cauſes naturall. And <hi>the works which he worketh by himſelf alone, either without the aſſociation or interpoſition of cauſes naturall, or contrary to the ordinary courſe of nature; are properly called works miraculous or ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall;</hi> and <hi>Miraculous</hi> they are called, not becauſe they alwayes argue a greater or more immediate exerciſe of Gods Power, then is contained in the works of nature; but in that they are unuſuall, and without the compaſſe of ordinary Obſervation. <hi>Sometimes thoſe works, which are truly miraculous, may leſs participate of the Almighty Power, then the uſual works of nature do.</hi> It was a true miracle, that the Sun ſhould <hi>ſtand ſtill in the vale of Aialon;</hi> but <note place="margin">Works truly miraculous may have a leſs ſhare of Gods Power then uſual works of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> not therefore a Miracle in that it did argue a greater manifeſtation of Gods Power, then is dayly manifeſted in the courſe of nature or works of other creatures; But a great Miracle only in that it was ſo <hi>rare and unuſual.</hi> The dayly <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> about the earth, if we ſearch into the true and prime cauſes of it, includes a greater meaſure or more branches of the <hi>Almighty Ceators Power,</hi> then the ſtanding ſtill of the <hi>Sun,</hi> did, in the dayes of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or the going back of it did in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> For in our <hi>Apoſtles Divinitie,</hi> Act. 17. 28. <hi>We live and move and have our being</hi> in God; that is, all things that are have their being <hi>in him,</hi> and <hi>from him;</hi> their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is but a participation of his <hi>infinite being.</hi> The life of all things living, is but a participation or ſhadow of his Life; The <hi>Motion</hi> of all things that move, is but the participation of <hi>his Power:</hi> ſo that when the Sun did ceaſe to move or ſtand ſtill in the dayes of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> it was partaker only of <hi>his Power ſuſtentative,</hi> or of that power by which he ſupporteth all things; It ceaſed to move, only by meer ſubſtraction or ceſſation of <hi>his motive Power,</hi> by whoſe vertue or influence it dayly, like a <hi>Gyant-</hi>runs his courſe. Thus dayly to run its courſe it could not, without a poſitive force or power communicated unto
<pb n="3437" facs="tcp:32220:76"/>
it from <hi>The Creator in whom (as</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeakes) it moves. But it ceaſed for a while to move, without any poſitive force or power to inhibit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain its courſe; But, as we ſaid, by meer ſubſtraction of that power, by which it moves. So long as it continues its courſe, it both moves and hath its Being in God, and it is partaker of two branches of His Almighty Power. But when it ſtood ſtill, it onely had its Being in him. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the other branch of Power was intercepted. Now the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from thoſe works, which we call, The works of nature, unto works miraculous or ſupernatural, would in this caſe hold <hi>a majore. He that dayly makes the Sun to compaſſe the world, is able to ſtay its courſe when he pleaſeth.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. A miracle likewiſe it was, and a great one too, that <hi>The three Children</hi> ſhould be untouched in the midſt of the flaming furnace: yet neither was there a greater nor more immediate poſitive effect of <hi>Gods Power</hi> in the reſtraint of that fire then, then was in the ſuſtaining other Fire, which at other times devoured the bodies of his Saints, <hi>The Holy Martyrs,</hi> who loved not their lives unto the death, but gave them up for the Teſtimonie of the Lord Jeſus: For, Without the co-operation or concurſe of Gods Power, the fire could not have touched their bodies. Wherein then did the Miracle, Recorded in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and experienced in the three children, properly conſiſt? Not ſo much, if at all, in fencing their bodies from the violence of the flame, by impoſition or infuſion of any new created qualitie into their bodies, as <hi>in ſubſtracting or withdrawing his ordinary Co-operation from the fire,</hi> whoſe natural propertie is to conſume or devour bodies combuſtible; ſuch as the bodies of the <hi>three Children</hi> by nature were. The only cauſe, why the fire did not burn them, was, the ſubſtraction or withdrawing of Gods Co-operative Power, without whoſe ſtrength or aſſiſtance the hotteſt furnace, that Art or experience can deviſe, cannot exerciſe the moſt natural operation of fire. For as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the fire cannot ſubſiſt, or have any place in the Fabrick of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, unleſs it be ſupported by Gods Power ſuſtentative; So neither, whilſt it ſubſiſts or hath actual being amongſt Gods creatures, can it work or move without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Gods co-operative or all-working Power. In Him both theſe Powers are one; both,</hi> as he is, are infinite: But as communicated unto his creatures they are not altogether <hi>one,</hi> but <hi>two</hi> participated branches of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power. And in the burning of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> or in other deſtructions made by fire; both branches, as well of his ſuſtentative, as of his co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative power, are manifeſted; Whereas in the preſerving of the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the violence of the flaming furnace, the one branch only; to wit, His Power ſuſtentative, was communicated to the fire; the other branch, to wit, the participation of his co-operative or working Power, was, for the time being, lop't off from the body or ſubſtance of the fire. Now this withdrawing of <hi>his co-operative Power</hi> from the fire, was a true document or proof that <hi>he is the God and guide of nature.</hi> That without him the fire, even whilſt it is for nature and ſubſtance moſt compleat, cannot perform the proper work or exerciſe of its nature. The neceſſary <hi>conſequence</hi> of which <hi>Proof</hi> or experiment is this; <hi>That he is the Author or fountain as well of all the works or exerciſes of natural cauſes, as of natural bodies or ſubſtances themſelves.</hi> And if we conſider his Power, not in it ſelf, but as communicated to his Creatures or natural Agents, it is and ought to be acknowledged greater in <note place="margin">See this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Sermons, printed at Oxon. <hi>Anno</hi> 1637. <hi>pag.</hi> 39, 40.</note> thoſe works which we call works of nature, and of which we have dayly experience; then it was in either of theſe two Miracles before mentioned. Both of them were for this Reaſon only <hi>Miraculous,</hi> in that they were moſt
<pb n="3438" facs="tcp:32220:77"/>
unuſual, and without the circuit of any experiment or obſervation in the courſe of nature before the times, wherein they hapned.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To raiſe Mens Bodies out of the Grave, or out of the Elements into which they have been diſſolved, is far more unuſual, then to raiſe up Corn out of putrified ſeed; and in this reſpect the Reſurrection, which we hope for, muſt be acknowledged a work more Miraculous and wonderful, then the yearly ſpringing of Corn, of fruits, of herbs, or graſs. But may we ſay in this Caſe as in the former, that the Power of God is no leſs, but rather grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in theſe ordinary works of nature (as in cauſing herbs, fruit, or corn to ſprout or fructifie with advantage of increaſe) then it ſhall be in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead; which is a work, not of Nature, but miraculous and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural; a work in which natural Cauſes ſhall not be entertained nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by God? No: there ſhall be a manifeſtation of greater Power, then either of Gods <hi>Suſtentative</hi> Power, by which all things, that were created, are ſtill preſerved; or of His <hi>Co-operative</hi> Power, without whoſe participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nothing, which is ſo preſerved, can work at all, or perform the exerciſes of its proper nature. The Power indeed, by which He Preſerveth all things, is the ſelf ſame Power, by which He Made all things out of nothing. <hi>The Preſervation of things that are, is but a continuation or proroguing of the firſt Creation.</hi> As all things are made of Nothing; ſo would they inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into Nothing, were they not continually ſupported and preſerved by the ſelf ſame Power, by which they begun to Be, when they were not. Creation and preſervation differ onely <hi>in ſenſu connotativo,</hi> only in relation, not in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>Creation includes a Negation of Being before;</hi> For all things, that are, took their beginning by Creation. <hi>Conſervation ſuppoſeth a beginning of things that are, and includes a Negation of their returning into nothing.</hi> Theſe Two Negations being abſtracted or ſequeſtred, the Creation of all things and their Conſervation, are as truly and properly the ſame Power or work of one and the ſame party, as the way from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Athens</hi> is the ſame.</p>
               <p>But if the Continuation of things, that are, be a Creation; or if the ſelf ſame <hi>Almighty Power</hi> be ſtill manifeſted in the preſervation of things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that was manifeſted in the firſt Creation, what greater power can be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the Reſurrection from the dead, then is daily manifeſted, and ought to be acknowledged in the preſervation and daily increaſe of herbs, of fruits, of corn ſown, and ſpringing out of the earth? Or if any greater power ſhall be manifeſted <hi>in the Reſurrection from the dead,</hi> then is daily experienced in theſe works of nature, how ſhall we juſtifie our <hi>Apoſtles Argument</hi> in this place to be an <hi>Argument of proportion,</hi> or an <hi>Argument</hi> (as we ſaid before) <hi>from the greater to the leſſe,</hi> or <hi>an Argument à pari,</hi> from <hi>The like Caſe or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?</hi> The <hi>Argument</hi> indeed would directly follow; <hi>He that is able to make men live again, that have been dead for a thouſand years, is alſo able to quicken the corn in the next month, which died the laſt month.</hi> This kind of Argument would be as clear, as if you ſhould ſay, That he, that is able to make ready payment of a thouſand pounds, may ſoon and eaſily pay an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. But you would take it as an impertinent or indiſcreet allegation to ſay, I know this man is able to pay you an hundred pounds, therefore I would perſwade you to take his bond for a thouſand. But our Apoſtles Argument in this place may ſeem leſs probable, and it is, at leaſt to appearance, but Thus; <hi>God dayly raiſeth up corn within a year after it is ſowen.</hi> Ergo, <hi>he ſhall raiſe up</hi> Adams <hi>body, which was conſumed to duſt five thouſand years ago.</hi>

6. To frame the Apoſtles Argument, which is an Argument of Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aright, you muſt take his Principles or grounds into your conſideration. Now he firſt ſuppoſeth, and takes it (as all good Chriſtians ought to do) for granted, that <hi>God doth give that body unto every ſeed with which it ariſeth or cometh out of the ground.</hi> The increaſe of things ſown or planted, is not, in his Language or Philoſophie, the meer Effect or gift of Nature; For even <hi>Nature her ſelf, or whatſoever ſhe hath to beſtow, is the gift of God.</hi> That which Philoſophers call Nature is in true Divinity nothing elſe, but <hi>The Law which God hath ſet to things natural,</hi> or ſubject to change or motion. Now he which made this Law, whether for guiding bodies ſublunary or celeſtial, can diſpenſe with it at his pleaſure. He ſometimes inhibits the ordinary courſe of the Law of Nature by ſubſtraction, as it were, of his Royal Aſſent; or by ſuſpending the concurrence of his Operative Power; And ſometimes again he advanceth the ſtate of things natural, by creating or making a New Law unto the manner of their Being, or of their Operations; that is, he changeth their Qualities, though not their Natures or Eſſences. Thus much preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or premiſed, our Apoſtles Inference is as firm and ſtrong, as it is Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; <hi>Stulte! Tu quod Seminas—. O Fool! that which</hi> THOU <hi>ſoweſt is not quickened, except it die &amp;c.</hi> The force or Emphaſis may be gathered thus. <hi>If God doth give a body unto that ſeed, which thou ſoweſt for thine own uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, much more will the ſame God give a body to The Seed, which</hi> He Himſelf <hi>doth ſow, much more will he quicken it, after it hath been dead; ſeeing the End, why he ſowes it, is not thy temporal benefit or commodity, but His Own immortal glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When God did enact that ſevere Law, from which death natural takes its original, <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return;</hi> the Intent or purport of that Law was not, that man by returning to duſt ſhould utterly or finally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and be for ever as if he never had been: What then was the intent or purport of this Law? That mans body ſhould be committed unto the earth, as ſeed is committed to the ground; that as the corn, which ſprings out of the earth, returns to earth again, and is ſtill raiſed up with advantage and increaſe unto the Sower: So the bodies of men, after that by the firſt mans folly they became corruptible and certain to ſuffer corruption (whether in the earth in the air, or in the Sea) might be raiſed again, but not to corruption; that God may receive the ſeed, which is ſown, with <hi>increaſe of Glory to himſelf;</hi> this increaſe of Glorie being rooted in the increaſe of their happineſs, by whoſe immortalitie he is immediately glorified. <hi>Thus much of the former diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, to wit, how our Apoſtles Inſtance or experiment in the work of nature doth infer his intended Concluſion, to wit, the future Reſurrection from the dead. And from the Solution of this Former, the Second may eaſily be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoyled.</hi>

                  <hi>Corn dying, and being quickened again, can fit or parallel the Reſurrection of the body, ſeeing the Corn, which is quickened, or ſpringeth up, is not</hi> The ſame body, <hi>which was ſown? Whereas it is a Point of our Belief, that the ſame numerical bodies which die and return to duſt, or are reſolved into aſhes or into the Elements, of which they conſiſt, ſhall be raiſed up at the laſt day.</hi> For if The Body raiſed up were not the ſelf ſame that died, the Body which died, ſhould not be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker either of pain or joy everlaſting, but another Bodie ſhould be tormented or glorified inſtead of the Body which died; Every man ſhould not receive reward or puniſhment <hi>according to that, which he had done in the body;</hi> or at leaſt this reward or puniſhment ſhould not be received in the ſame Body, in whhic he had done ill or well.</p>

                  <hi>Aquinas,</hi> a Great School-man in his time, labours to aſſoyl the propoſed Difficultie by framing the Apoſtles Argument Thus. <hi>If Nature can repair that which dies,</hi> Idem Specie, that is, <hi>If Nature can make it to be of the ſame</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aquinas</hi> his Solution true but imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</note> 
                  <hi>Kind it was, though not the ſame numerical body it was</hi> (as he that ſows Wheat reaps Wheat, not Rie or Barley, though not the ſelf ſame grains of Wheat, which he ſows;) Then <hi>The God of nature and Creator of all things ſhall raiſe up the bodies of men, which are his ſeed and proper husbandry, the very ſelf ſame which they were, not the ſelf ſame for kind or ſpecifical Unity, but the ſame Individuals.</hi> Of all the bodies, which have died, not one ſhall miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not ſo much as a hair of any mans head, or any leaſt part of his body ſhall finally periſh.</p>
               <p>But though all this be True, yet is it Impertinent, it fals not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of our Apoſtles Inference in this place, who neither affirms, nor denies, nor took it ſo much as into his conſideration, whether the Corn which ſprings <note place="margin">The Authors Solution of the former Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie.</note> up, be the ſame Individual Nature or ſubſtance, which did putrifie and die in the ground. <q>The utmoſt Circumference of his conſiderations or thoughts extends no further then thus; That the Body which God doth give to every ſeed, is not for qualitie the ſame, which was ſown; for it was ſown Bare Corn without blade, husk, or ear, and loſeth that corpulencie or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, which it had: But it ſprings not up bare Corn.</q> The new life, which it gets in the womb of the earth, is cloathed with a freſh body capable of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and growth; of both which it was uncapable whilſt it was ſevered from the ear wherein it grew, or after the ſtalk was cut down. And This Change or alteration in the Corn ſown and ſpringing up doth well fit the Change or alteration, which ſhall be wrought in our Bodies at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or laſt day. Our bodies by death become more uncapable of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment then the corn ſevered from the ear or cut down; for they are utterly deprived of life, of ſenſe, of motion, in all the Interim between the day of their diſſolution and the laſt day. By the Reſurrection they ſhall not only recover life, ſenſe and motion, but the life which they get ſhall be indowed with Immortalitie; the bodies ſhall be clothed with Glory.</p>
               <p>This change of our mortal bodies into immortal is much greater, then the moſt plentifull increaſe, which any ſeed doth yield. One ſeed or grain may in ſome ſoils bring forth thirty, in others ſixtie, in others a hundred; but immortality added to the life of the body is an increaſe in reſpect of this mortal life, which now we lead, inexpreſsible by any number. The life of <hi>Methuſelah</hi> is not comparable to it, albeit the years which he lived on earth, were multiplied by the dayes contained in them, and both multiplied again by all the minutes and ſcruples conteined in the dayes and years which he lived. And yet after this increaſe of life our bodies ſhall be the ſame they were, for <hi>nature and eſſence,</hi> but not the ſame for qualities or capacities, whether of joyes or pains. In theſe reſpects they ſhall differ far more, then any corn growing doth from the ſeed, from which it ſprings. And this <hi>difference of qualities, between the bodies</hi> which die, <hi>and ſhall be raiſed again, was all that our Apoſtle ſought or intended to illuſtrate or ſet forth by that ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which he uſeth. Thou ſoweſt not the corn which ſhall be; that is, not the ſame corn for quantitie, for qualitie,</hi> for vigour of life; nor ſhall mens bodies be raiſed again to ſuch a life only, as they formerly had, or to ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible eſtate as that, wherein death did apprehend them, but to a life truly immortal.</p>

               <p>Thus much of the Poſitive Force of our Apoſtles Argument drawn from the ſimilitude of the Corn, which by the Law of Nature muſt die before it be quickned and receive increaſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But of this ſimilitude it is no native branch or part, whether the corn which dies being ſown, do riſe again the next year for vital ſubſtance or life, the ſame, which it was whilſt it was contained in the blade or ear, the year before; certainly it is not <hi>the ſame for Corpulencie,</hi> for matter or quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But whether the ſeeds of life or <hi>ſpirit of corn</hi> do not remain <hi>the ſame by continuation,</hi> though in divers bodies or matter, our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> diſputes not, nor do I diſpute. This is a curioſitie, which cannot be determined in the Pulpit without appeal unto the Schools. The vital ſpirit or eſſence of the <hi>Corn</hi> may be ſo far <hi>the ſame</hi> in the corn which is ſown, and which is reaped, that, if we ſhould for diſputation ſake, ſuppoſe or imagine, what ſome have dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically affirmed, to wit, <hi>That the corn ſown were endowed with ſenſe or feeling,</hi> were capable of pleaſure or pain; the pleaſure, which it formerly enjoyed might be renewed, increaſed, or multiplied with increaſe or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of its bodily ſubſtance; ſo might the pain, which it had felt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ſown, be renewed and increaſed after it were quickned again, if any ſort of corn were appointed, as ſome men are, to torture and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now albeit we muſt believe, that mens bodies after the Reſurrection ſhall be the very ſame for ſubſtance which they were before death, yet are we not bound to believe that they ſhall be any further the ſame, then that every man which died in his ſins, may in his bodie feel an infinite increaſe of thoſe miſeries, which he had deſerved; and in ſome ſort felt whilſt he lived on earth. Or, that every man at the laſt day may reap an infinite increaſe of thoſe joyes and comforts, of which in this life he had ſome taſts or pledges whilſt <hi>he ſowed unto the ſpirit.</hi> For, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> elſewhere ſpeaks, <hi>he that ſoweth unto the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption;</hi> a full crop of all the miſeries incident to mortalitie, but miſeries more then mortal, miſeries everlaſting and never dying. And he that in this life <hi>ſoweth unto the ſpirit,</hi> ſhall at the <hi>Reſurrection, of the ſpirit reap life,</hi> but a life <hi>immortal</hi> without end, without annoyance or interruption of joy.</p>
               <p>Again, they extend the former <hi>ſimilitude</hi> too far, which from it would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="3442" facs="tcp:32220:79"/>
that as there is a natural force or previal diſpoſition in the corn ſown, by which, as by a ſecondary cauſe or inſtrumental mean, it is quickned and increaſed; So there be natural ſeeds of life in the putrified reliques of mens bodies, or remnants of the matter diſſolved, out of which life im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſhall ſo ſpring, as the blade doth out of the ſeed which is ſown, only by the <hi>ſuſtentative or operative power of God,</hi> by which all things are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, or enabled to produce their natural effects. For although it be true, that the works which we aſcribe <hi>to nature,</hi> are wrought <hi>by God,</hi> or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the ſame power, by which they were firſt created and ſet a working; yet the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of mens bodies ſhall not be wrought by the mere continuation of <hi>This Power;</hi> There muſt be <hi>more then a conſervation</hi> of their matter, <hi>more then an uſual co-operation</hi> with the Elements, out of which they are raiſed, there muſt be even <hi>a new creation</hi> of their bodies; yet not <hi>a Creation of them out of nothing,</hi> but out of the ſcattered fragments of their matter; ſuch a creation as the works of the fifth and ſixth day were, when God commanded the <hi>ſea or water to bring forth fiſhes in their kind,</hi> and the <hi>earth to bring forth trees or plants in their kinde.</hi> Theſe were not effects of <note place="margin">See Book. 10.

And thus God at the laſt day ſhall command not the <hi>earth</hi> only, but the <hi>Sea</hi> alſo with the other Elements <hi>to give up their dead.</hi> Rev. 20. 13. Laſtly, they extended <hi>this ſimilitude</hi> too far, which hence imagined, that as the <hi>corn</hi> often dies and is often quickned, and dies again; So, by the doctrine of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> there ſhould be a death after the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> after death, or ſuch a continual viciſſitude between life and death, as is between light and darkneſs.</p>
               <p>This <hi>objection</hi> is punctually reſolved by <hi>Tertullian in the</hi> 48. <hi>Chapt. of his Apologie.</hi> 
                  <q>The ſum of his anſwer is; That ſo it might be, if the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Creator had ſo appointed; for he is able to work this continual interchange, or viciſſitude of life and death, as well in mens bodies, as in the bodies of corn ſown or reaped; or as he doth the perpetual viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of light and darkneſs in the two <hi>Hemiſpheres</hi> of the world; but he hath revealed his <hi>Will</hi> to the contrary.</q> And the reaſon is not the ſame (but rather contrary) in Gods crop or harveſt, as it is in the crops or harveſts of mortal men: As men in this life are mortal, ſo is their food or nutriment; and for this reaſon, their nutriment muſt be ſupplied by continual ſowing and reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But <hi>God is immortal,</hi> and ſo ſhall the crop of his harveſt be. Our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> from the dead is his general crop or harveſt; and this needs to be no more then <hi>One;</hi> becauſe our bodies, being once raiſed up to life again, ſhall never die; but enjoy <hi>immortalitie</hi> in his preſence. <hi>Heaven is his Granary,</hi> and what is gathered into it cannot periſh or conſume.</p>

                  <hi>belief of this Article</hi> will give us the true mean, and preſcribe the due <hi>manner or meaſure</hi> of mourning: Our <hi>ſorrow,</hi> though natural and juſt, yet if it be truly Chriſtian and ſeaſoned with Grace, will ſtill be mingled with comfort and ſupported by hope. To be either impatient towards God, or immoderatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for the death of our deareſt friends, whoſe bodies God hath in mercy committed to the cuſtody of the earth, of the ſea, or other Elements; is but <hi>A Symptome of heatheniſh ignorance (or</hi> infidelity) of this Article, <hi>A Barbariſm in Chriſtianitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we of this Land ſhould live amongſt <hi>Barbarians,</hi> whom we had taught to make bread of Corn, and accuſtomed to the taſt of this bread as unknown to their forefathers, as <hi>Manna</hi> at firſt appearance was to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but not acquainted them with <hi>the myſtery of ſowing and reaping;</hi> they would be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">☜</note> in their hunger or ſcarcitie of bread to ſtone us, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to ſtone <hi>Moſes</hi> in their thirſt, if they ſhould ſee us offer to bury that corn in the earth, with which their bowels might be comforted: yet if they were but ſo far capable of reaſon as to be perſwaded, or we ſo capable of truſt or credit with them as to perſwade them, that there were no poſſibilitie left either to have bread without ſupply of corn, or for corn to increaſe and multiply, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it did firſt die and putrifie in the ground; hope of a more plentiful crop or harveſt would naturally incline them to brook the preſent ſcarcity w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> patience, and to be thankfull towards ſuch, as would ſo carefully provide for them.</p>
               <p>Now, beſides, that <hi>the ſouls of the righteous are in the hand of God;</hi> the committing of their bodies to the grave is but as <hi>a ſolemn preparation of ſeed for a future crop or harveſt.</hi> If in theſe premiſſes we do rely and truſt in God, our ſorrow and heavineſs for the dead, though it may endure for a while, will be ſwallowed up in comfort; our mournfull tears and weeping will be ſtill accompanied with praiſes and thankſgiving unto him, that hath ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them that live in his fear, and die in his favour.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But as this Doctrine adminiſtreth plentie of comfort in reſpect of friends deceaſed; ſo it ſhould move us to make choice of ſuch only for our deareſt friends, as we ſee inclined <hi>to live in the fear of the Lord.</hi> Or, if we have prevented our ſelves and this advice, in making ſuch choice, yet let us <note place="margin">☜</note> never be prevented by others for making the main and principal end of our <note place="margin">Chriſtians ſhould chuſe ſuch friends as have ſhare in the Firſt, and hopes of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> friendſhip or delight in any mans company to be this; <hi>A ſerious ſtudy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to prepare others, and to be prepared by them, to live and die in the Lord.</hi> As there is no greater comfort in this life, then a faithfull and hearty friend; So can no greater grief befall a man at the hour of death, then to have had a friend truſty and hearty in other offices and ſervices, but negligent and backward in cheriſhing the <hi>ſeeds of faith, of love,</hi> or <hi>fear of the Lord,</hi> or other proviſion of our way-fare towards the life to come. No practiſe of the moſt malicious, or moſt inveterate, or moſt provoked foe, can breed half ſo much danger to any man, as the affectionate intentions of a carnal friend, always officious to entertain him with pleaſant impertinences, which will draw his mind from the fear and love of God, and either divert or effeminat his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations from reſolute pitching upon the means and hopes of <hi>a joyfull Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> to everlaſting life.</p>

               <p>You know the Story; how that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was not permitted to miniſter ſo much as a drop of water unto <hi>Dives</hi> to cool his tongue.

               <p>Of a mans Body which died twenty years ago, ſome part is changed or transformed into the nature of earth, ſome part reſolved into vapors or Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; Some part into groſſer moiſture, whereof other live creatures are produced: No part of it returns into meer Nothing.

                  <q>This ſuppoſed <hi>Reſtauration</hi> muſt either be by a New Creation; or it muſt be only by a <hi>Recollection</hi> or gathering together of the reliques or matter, which have been diſperſed and ſcattered through divers places, and transformed into ſo many ſeveral bodies.</q>

               <p n="2">2. That the bodies, which have been diſſolved, ſhould at the laſt day be made <hi>the ſelf ſame they were by a new Creation,</hi> (properly ſo called) ſeems impoſſible. For every bodie muſt have its proper and immediate Matter, and no bodie can be created without the Creation of ſuch a Matter. The ſoul of man may be created in the Body without creation of the Matter whereto it is annexed, becauſe the ſoul is no material ſubſtance; But the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a bodily or material ſubſtance eſſentially includes a Creation of the Matter, and this Matter may be either created before <hi>The Compound,</hi> into which it is afterward formed; (as the Body and Matter of the Firſt Man was created out of the earth, before it was wrought by the breath of God into a living or ſenſitive ſubſtance:) or this Matter may be concreated with the body or Compound, whoſe matter it is.</p>
               <p>Thus the Fiſhes in the Sea, and the Plants in the Earth were each of them <note place="margin">See Book 10. Fol. 3113.</note> created by one intire Creation; there was not one creation of their proper Matter, and another of their proper Form. The bulks or ſtems of trees were not made or created out of the earth before the vegetable or vital facultie was infuſed into them; Both were made at once.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral branches of the <hi>Difficulty in this Argument</hi> may be framed thus: <hi>If the bodies of men, which have been reſolved into duſt (perhaps into as many ſeveral bodies, as there be men now living) muſt all be created again;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt's Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons framed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Bodie.</note> 
                  <hi>and every one created again the ſelf ſame it was; Then either the matter muſt be the ſelf ſame, which it was; or elſe it muſt have ſome new matter equivalent, or of the ſelf ſame uſe or ſervice in reſpect of the ſoul, unto which the former matter had been, and this new matter</hi> (not altogether <hi>the ſame</hi> but <hi>the ſame</hi> by <hi>Equivalencie) is, or is to be, united.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the ſelf ſame <hi>matter</hi> which was in a mans body when he died, ſhould become the ſame again by a new creation <hi>ex nihilo,</hi> implies a Contradiction; For that very material ſubſtance, which was in <hi>Adam</hi> at his death, is not to this day annihilated; not the leaſt ſcrap or fragment of it, but is now exiſtent in ſome body or other. And that, which at this very hour actually is or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſteth in ſome other body, cannot at this very hour <hi>begin to Be,</hi> cannot at this very hour <hi>be made of nothing,</hi> becauſe it ſelf already <hi>is ſomething.</hi> If the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> bodie (which we ſuppoſe not to be utterly annihilated) could be created again whiles it ſo continues, it ſhould be <hi>exiſtent,</hi> and not <hi>exiſtent,</hi> it ſhould <hi>begin to be,</hi> and <hi>not begin to be,</hi> at the ſame point of time. Both which imply a manifeſt Contradiction; and all Contradictions, though <note place="margin">See Chap. 13. §. 11.</note> in matters meerly ſpeculative, are as contrary to the <hi>Unitie and truth of the Godhead,</hi> as diſſimulation, fraud or cozenage are to <hi>the Holineſs of God.

               <p>Some of the <hi>Antient Fathers</hi> in their Arguments againſt the Heathen, or in their Apologies for <hi>This Article of our Faith,</hi> ſuppoſe the Reſurrection of the body ſhall be accompliſhed by the Recollection of the Reliques or Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, into which each ones bodie hath been diſſolved. And to this purpoſe <note place="margin">There is much <hi>good moralitie</hi> to be learned from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the mixtures and ſeparation of metals.</note> uſe divers Similitudes or illuſtrations drawn from Gold-ſmiths, or Refiners of Metals, who by their Art or Myſterie can extract the fragments of Gold or Silver out of any other metal or body, with which they are mingled.

               <p>It was an exerciſe of the <hi>Creative Power</hi> to turn Water (in an Inſtant) into Wine; to multiply <hi>five loaves and two fiſhes</hi> unto the ſuſtentation of more then <hi>five thouſand men,</hi> beſides the fragments remaining, which were ten times more then the proviſion it ſelf.

For admitting (what no Chriſtian can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie) that Gods Skill or knowledge to recollect all the ſeveral parcels of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans bodie (which way ſoever diſperſed) doth infinitely exceed the moſt exquiſite Skill of any Mineraliſt or Refiner in ſevering one metal from

another, and in wedding and uniting every parcel, fragment, or remnant, of what kind ſoever, with others of it own kind: Yet this Infinite Skill or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Recollecting or uniting the ſeveral parts of mens bodies, which have been diſſolved by death, could not ſuffice to the ſupportance of that truth, which in this Article we all believe, againſt the aſſaults of the <hi>Atheiſts;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this infinite Skill or knowledge were ſeconded with an <hi>infinite Creative Power.</hi>

Now the matter or bodily ſubſtance of every man that is devoured by fiſhes or other inhabitants of the Sea, is turned into the matter or bodily ſubſtance of the devourer. The matter again of every fiſh, that is eaten by man, is converted or changed into the matter or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that man which eats it. The</hi> Canibal <hi>would not ſo greedily feed upon mans fleſh as he doth, unleſs he were truly nouriſhed by it; and nouriſhment is the converſion of the matter or ſubſtance eaten into the matter or ſubſtance of him that eateth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the Reſurrection of every man with his own body, with the ſame body, from which his ſoul was by death divorced, did only, or principally conſiſt in the Recollection or re-union of the ſame material parts or reliques which were diſſolved by death, it would be a hard point to reſolve or ſatisfie the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> or incredulous <hi>Naturaliſt,</hi> how it were poſſible that every man ſhould have the ſelf ſame Bodie that he had at the hour of death.</p>
               <p>To twiſt the difficultie harder, according to the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (which are not impoſſible, nor in ordinary conjecture improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.) <note place="margin">The ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced.</note>
               </p>
               <p>From what creature ſhall the firſt mans body, which the fiſh devoured be challenged? Or what creature ſhall the <hi>Almighty</hi> injoyn to make reſtitution of his intire matter? Shall the <hi>Almighty</hi> injoyn the fiſhes of the Sea to caſt up the morſels of mans fleſh, which they have eaten, as the <hi>Whale did Jonas?</hi> But it is ſuppoſed, that the bodily ſubſtance or matter of the man, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the ſubſtance or bodies of the fiſhes, which did eat him; for God did not preſerve either the life or bodily matter of men devoured by fiſhes, as he did preſerve <hi>Ionas.</hi> Shall the mans bodie then be repaired out of the matter or bodily ſubſtance of the fiſhes, which did eat him? But that (as the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> ſuppoſe, and is not in it ſelf improbable) other men have eaten and turned it into the matter and ſubſtance of their bodies. And theſe men again have been eaten by other fiſhes, or by ſuch Land-monſters as the <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals.</hi> Shall the firſt then or ſecond mens bodies be repaired out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſubſtance or matter of theſe later men, which have eaten the fiſhes that eat the former, or out of the bodies of <hi>Canibals,</hi> which have eaten them?</p>

                  <pb n="3448" facs="tcp:32220:82"/>
The Queſtion then remains; <hi>How the bodies of thoſe men ſhall be repaired? or from what Elements ſhall the Reliques or diſſolved fragments of their bodies be recollected?</hi> Seeing their bodies alſo have been either immediately devoured by <hi>Canibals,</hi> or mediately by other men, which have eaten the creatures, that have devoured the former men? The <hi>Canibals,</hi> which devoured men muſt, by this <hi>Article of Chriſtian Faith,</hi> ariſe again with their own bodies, not with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of other men whom they have devoured; <hi>how then is it poſsible for every man to ariſe with his own body,</hi> ſeeing the bodies of many men, at leaſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques or fragments into which they are diſſolved, have been ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by ſome one ravenous creature, and ſome one <hi>Canibals</hi> humane body may ſucceſsively be the Tomb or Sepulcher of many mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?</p>
               <p>And here me thinks that queſtion, which the <hi>Sadduces</hi> put unto our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our concerning the woman which had been married to ſeven brethren, one after another, might be more punctually propoſed concerning the women of <hi>Samaria</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which in the extremitie of ſeige did make their hunger-ſtarved ſtomacks the grave or <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> of thoſe tender Infants, whom they had lately conceived in their womb, and brought forth with joy.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion by the <hi>Sadduces</hi> was thus propoſed, <hi>Which of the ſeven bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſhould have the woman to wife at the Reſurrection, ſeeing ſhe had been wife ſucceſsively to all the ſeven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> or Naturaliſt would propoſe his Queſtion thus; <hi>Whoſe ſhall the bodies of the Infants (which their mothers devoured) at the day of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection be? ſhall they belong as appurtenances to the bodies of their mothers, of which they were (though moſt unnaturally) made natural or material and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial parts a little before theſe cruel mothers died? But then the Infants ſhould have no bodily ſubſtance, they could not ariſe with their own bodies. Or ſhall the reliques of the bodies, which their mothers ſwallowed, be drawn or extracted (as a refiner doth gold out of droſs, or ſilver out of baſer metal) out of the ruines of their mothers bodies? but ſo their mothers ſhould ſeem at the reſurrection to want part of their bodily and much pined ſubſtances, which they had at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of their ſouls and bodies: Their bodies, by this ſuppoſition, cannot be the ſame they were when they dyed.</hi>

An Oak, albeit it ſtand four hundred years, or unto whatſoever height or greatneſs in that time it grows, is ſtill the ſame tree or vegetable body, which it was at the firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: yet the Material Parts of it, cannot be altogether, or for the moſt part, the ſame that they were. The whole Matter or bodily ſubſtance of it, when it was firſt ſet, was not the thouſandth part of that bodily ſubſtance, which after three hundred years growth, it hath; And of the <hi>matter,</hi> which it had, when it was but a yard high, it is not imaginable that any one part, ſo much as a pins head, ſhould be remaining the ſame it was, after it come to be twenty yards in height and a yard in thickneſs.

               <p>A Raven likewiſe is the ſelf ſame Fowl when it is ready to die for age, that it was, when it was firſt hatched; but the <hi>matter of it cannot poſsibly be the ſelf ſame;</hi> it is not conceivable that ſo much as an inch of <hi>the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which it had when it was firſt hatched, ſhould continue in it, <hi>the ſame</hi> till death. For its natural heat doth perpetually conſume or waſt ſome part of

its matter or ſubſtance; and its blood, without perpetual nouriſhment by new food or matter prepared, would be dried up by its natural heat; For life conſiſts in <hi>calido et humido,</hi> in heat and moiſture, and cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in any live creature without continual nutriment, more then the fire or flame can be preſerved without fewel. Nor could the life, or natural heat, wherein life ſpecially conſiſts, ſtand in ſuch perpetual need of nutrition or new mater whereon to feed, unleſs there were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual diſſolution of ſome <hi>material parts,</hi> which vaniſh or expire out of the body, though not ſo viſibly, yet as certainly, as fume or ſmoak doth out of the fewel, wherewith the fire or flame is fed. Unleſs there were ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent diminution or waſting of the material parts in mans body, there could be no proper growth or augmentation of the whole body, or of every part; For if every leaſt particle did remain the ſame it was, as well for quantitie as for qualitie, the whole body could not be augmented in every part, but it muſt be as great again as it was before, after every ſuch growth or Augmentation. For there can be no Augmentation or growth in any part o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then by addition of ſome ſenſible nutriment: Now if every leaſt part be augmented by addition of ſome new or ſenſible matter or ſubſtance, the addition, which is made unto every leaſt part, would be as great as the part, to which it is added: For it is ſuppoſed that every leaſt part is augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and augmented it cannot be, but by addition of ſome other ſenſible body, which cannot be leſs, then the leaſt part ſenſible of a body; or of a ſenſible body.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But if we grant, as the truth is, that the material parts of the body augmented remain not the ſelf ſame to day, which they were yeſterday or a week ago, but are ſtill fluent and waſting, <hi>other material parts</hi> coming into their place with ſome addition of quantitie, ſo as the addition in bodies grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by dayly nutriment be ſtill greater, then the waſt or diminution, The manner of natural growth or augmentation may be eaſily conceived. And it was a truth of nature excellently expreſſed by the great <hi>Philoſopher; Aucto toto augetur quaelibet pars etiam minutiſsima: Whenſoever the whole body is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, every leaſt part is augmented.</hi> As if the whole body in the ſpace of a year be augmented by the quantitie of a palm or a ſpan, the thouſandth part of the body muſt be augmented by the thouſandth part of a palm or ſpan. But thus the whole body (as the ſame <hi>Philoſopher</hi> obſerves) is in every part aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented <hi>non quoad formam ſed quoad materiam.</hi> And his reaſon is <hi>qua materia eſt in perpetuo fluxu;</hi> becauſe the material parts of mans body are perpetually fluent, alwayes decaying and alwayes repaired. It is a <hi>maxim</hi> again of the ſame <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> that, <hi>Auctum manet idem numero,</hi> that every vegetable body being augmented (how long ſoever the growth or augmentation laſts) is <hi>numerically the ſame</hi> it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The caſe then is clear</hi> out of the <hi>Book of Nature,</hi> (by which the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> or infidel will only be tryed) That, the body or bodily life of man, how long ſoever he live, remains <hi>one and the ſame</hi> from his birth unto his death, albeit the matter of which his body is compoſed, and wherein his life is ſeated, do not remain the ſame. As the face or image of the Sun remains the ſame in a water or river, albeit the parts of the water, in which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, do not continue the ſame, but as one portion of water ſlideth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, another comes in its place, altogether as apt to take the impreſſion or picture of the Sun as the former; Or as the light continues one and the ſame in a lamp, albeit the oil, which preſerves its light, do continually waſt; For one drop or portion of the ſame oyl, or of new oyl poured in, is as
<pb n="3451" facs="tcp:32220:83"/>
apt to continue the light, as the former drops were, which are waſted. The light then remains the ſelf ſame, albeit the oyl continually waſt: So that unto numerical Identitie of the ſame light, the numerical unitie or Identitie or the ſame portion of oil is not required, cannot poſſibly be had. It ſufficeth that the oyl or matter, which feeds the lamp, be the ſame by <hi>Equivalencie.</hi> By theſe and many like unqueſtionable inſtances in nature the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> or infidels ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is altogether falſe, to wit, That, <hi>unto the Reſurrection of the ſame body, or unto the reſtauration of the ſame bodily life, the Identitie of matter, or of material parts, which it formerly had, is neceſſarily required.</hi> I adde, that, This <hi>Identitie or unitie of matter</hi> is leſs needfull unto the numerical unitie or Identitie of mans body, becauſe the ſoul of man, amongſt all other veget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, is only immortal, and remaineth the ſame it was after it be ſevered from the body.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Taking then the <hi>firſt ſuppoſition of the Atheiſts</hi> as True; Suppoſe the bodily matter of ſome men to have been altogether or <hi>intirely tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatea</hi> or changed into the bodily ſubſtance of ſome other men, and that two or three of ſuch men might have the whole bodily ſubſtance of ſome other man, or child, in their bodies when they died: it is <hi>no probable Argument or forcible Objection,</hi> to ſay, <hi>This man, or child, whoſe bodily ſubſtance is ſuppoſed to be converted into the ſubſtance of other men, cannot ariſe again with the ſame body, which he had, becauſe he cannot have the ſame matter which he had, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the other loſe ſome part of the matter, which they had in them when they died.</hi> Suppoſe the material parts of every man were utterly annihilated when they died, yet their bodies may be made the ſelf ſame again, which they were, not only by Creation of new matter out of nothing, but out of any matter or Elements prae-exiſtent, ſo prepared and proportioned to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual nature or bodily life, as the former was. For, <hi>the numerical unitie or individual entitie of every nature conſiſts in the unitie or proportioned correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondencie to that modell, whereto the Almighty Creator did frame it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude then; ſeeing the <hi>Reſurrection of the ſame bodies</hi> wherein we die, muſt be wrought by the Power of God, it is fitting that we refer <hi>the particular manner, how our bodies ſhall be intirely reſtored,</hi> unto God himſelf. We will not diſpute whether the Reſurrection of every man in his own body ſhall be wrought, <hi>de facto,</hi> by recollecting of the duſt, into which men are turned; or of the ſame material parts which every man had when he died; or whether it ſhall be wrought by Creation of ſome new matter, or only by preparing ſome other Elementary matter prae-exiſtent, and working it into the ſame individual temper or conſtitution, into which our bodily food or nutriment was wrought, whilſt we lived. It ſufficeth to have ſhewed, that <hi>every man may ariſe with his own body by any of the former wayes;</hi> or partly by one, partly by another.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Recollection of the ſame material fragments</hi> or reliques, into which our bodies are diſſolved, is no more neceſſary by the <hi>Principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or true <hi>Philoſophie</hi> unto the conſtitution of the ſame bodies (at the day of the Reſurrection) which before have been, then the recollection or regreſſe of the ſame matter or nutriment, whereof our blood or fleſh was made, or by which our life was preſerved in childhood, is unto the continuance or <note place="margin">☜</note> conſtitution of the ſame life, fleſh, or blood in old age. The life of every man in old age is the ſame, the body the ſame, the fleſh the ſame, the blood the ſame, which it was it childhood; albeit the blood or greateſt part of our bodies in childhood was made of one kind of nutriment, and the blood, which we have in mature or old age be made of another, much different
<pb n="3452" facs="tcp:32220:84"/>
nutriment. Yea albeit we alter our food or diet every year, yet our bodies remain ſtill the ſame, every finger the ſame, whilſt it continues in the body, and whilſt this bodily life continues. For albeit the nutriment be of divers kinds, yet nature or the digeſtive facultie works all into one temper, and this temper continues the ſame in divers portions of the matter which is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fluent, and the ſame only by <hi>Equivalencie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if nature by Gods appointment and co-operation can work divers kinds of food or nutriment into the ſame form or conſtitution, it will be no improbable ſuppoſall to ſay, that, <hi>The God of nature can work any part of the Element of water, of ayre, or of earth, any fragment or relique of Adams body into the ſame individual form or mould, wherein the bodily life of the man, that ſhall be laſt dead before Chriſts coming to Judgement, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</hi> Yet will it be no hard thing for God to make <hi>Adam</hi> the ſelf ſame body, wherein he died, out of the reliques of this mans body.</p>
               <p>To work this mutual exchange between the material parts of ſeveral mens bodies without any hinderance or impeachment to the <hi>numerical Identity of any mans body;</hi> or without any prejudice to this truth, <hi>[That every man ſhall ariſe with his own body]</hi> which, we Chriſtians believe, is impoſſible to nature, or to any natural cauſes; they can be no Agents in this work: yet it is no wayes impoſſible (for it implyeth no contradiction) for nature thus to be wrought and faſhioned by the Creator and preſerver of mankind. In avouching thus much, we ſay no more then ſome (I take it) meer <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in other Termes. <hi>Quicquid poteſt prima cauſa per ſecundam, idem poteſt per ſe ſola. Whatſoever the firſt cauſe doth by the inſtrumental Agencie or ſervice of ſecond cauſes, the ſame he may do by his ſole Power, without the ſervice, of any inſtrumental or ſecond cauſe.</hi> Now God, <hi>by the heart, by the Liver</hi> and by the <hi>digeſtive facultie,</hi> as by cauſes inſtrumental or ſecondary, doth change the ſubſtance of herbs, of fruits, of fiſh, of roots into the very ſubſtance of mans body, without diſſolving the unitie of his bodily life; and therefore, if it pleaſe him, may change the material parts of one man into another mans body or ſubſtance, without the help or inſtrumental ſervice of the nutritive or digeſtive faculty, or any other inſtrumental cauſe; All this he may do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly by <hi>His ſole Power; But whether it be His Will ſo to do or no at the laſt day, be it ever reſerved with all reverence and ſubmiſsion to his infinite wiſdom alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. One ſcruple more there is, wherewith ingenuous minds and well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <note place="margin">The ſcruple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident into an ingenuous minde.</note> may be ſometimes touched. The doubt may be framed, Thus. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be moſt true and evident from the Book of nature, that the natural or digeſtive faculty of man doth preſerve the unitie of bodily life entire by diverſitie of mater or nutriment, yet the living body ſo preſerved is one and the ſame by</hi> continuation of exiſtence <hi>or duration. His dayes, whilſt natural life continues, are not cut off by death, he doth not for a moment ceaſe to be what he was: But when we ſpeak of Reſurrection from death, when we ſay the dead ſhall ariſe with their own bodies, here is a manifeſt interruption of bodily life, or of mans dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in bodily life. His body ceaſeth to be a living body as it was. And therefore if he muſt live again in the body,</hi> the body <hi>to which his ſoul ſhall be united at his Reſurrection, may be called his own body, becauſe it ſhall be inhabited or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with his immortal ſoul, but how ſhall it be</hi> The ſame body: <hi>which he formerly had; ſeeing the exiſtence or duration of him, or of his ſoul in the body, is divided by death; and diviſion deſtroyeth unitie? This leaf or paper is one, yet if we divide it in the middle, it is no more one but two papers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The queſtion then comes to this ſhort and perſpicuous iſſue. <hi>Whether the</hi> uninterrupted continuance of duration <hi>or exiſtence, or unitie of time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi>
                  <pb n="3453" facs="tcp:32220:84"/>
                  <hi>the duration of mans life is meaſured, be as neceſſary to the Unitie or Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of his bodily Nature or Being, as Unitie or Continuation of Quantitie is unto the Unitie of Bodies diviſible or quantitative.</hi> The determination or Judgment is eaſie. The Book of Nature being Judge, it is evident; <hi>That Unitie of Time or continuation of mans life, without interruption, is but Accidental to the unitie of bodily nature or being.</hi> It is a <hi>circumſtance</hi> only, no ſuch <hi>part of the Eſſence</hi> or nature, as continuation or unitie of quantitie is of the unitie of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies diviſible; for time and quantitie are by nature diviſible, whereas the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, or other things, that exiſt in time, is <hi>indiviſible.</hi> It is true, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion makes a pluralitie in things that are by nature diviſible, but not in natures indiviſible. Every thing that is diviſible, though it be <hi>unum actu,</hi> yet it is <hi>plura in potentiâ.</hi> In that it may be divided, it is not purely, ſimply, or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>one,</hi> but may be made two or more. And whilſt it remains <hi>one,</hi> it is one by conjunction of parts. The entire ſubſtance of any natural bodie as it is diviſible or ſubject to dimenſion, cannot be contained under one part of quantitie, but part of it is contained under one part of quantitie, part of it under another: For, <hi>Omne quantum habet partem extra partem,</hi> and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is diviſible. The whole ſubſtance diviſible cannot ſubſiſt, but in the whole quantitie or meaſure.</p>
               <p>The higher and lower parts of a tree or pillar have no unitie betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as both are united to the middle parts. If it be divided in the middle, the union and unity is loſt; after the diviſion made it is not one but two; one diviſion makes its two, two diviſions makes it three. But in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſenſible or vegetable, conſidered as parts of the nature or eſſence of ſuch Bodies, the caſe is quite otherwiſe. A man is the <hi>ſame man, the ſelf ſame bodily ſubſtance</hi> or vegetable this year, which he was three years ago; and his bodily ſubſtance this year is not therefore one and the ſame with the bodily ſubſtance which he had three years ago, becauſe it is one with the bodily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which he had the laſt year; but intirely one and the ſame in all: We cannot ſay, that <hi>part</hi> of his bodily nature was exiſtent in the firſt year, <hi>part</hi> in the ſecond year, and <hi>part</hi> in the third year, for his whole bodily nature was intirely in the firſt year, and in every part or hour of the firſt year: The ſame bodily nature was intirely in every hour of the ſecond year, and ſo in every hour of the third year. For though mans body be diviſible in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie; though his duration be likewiſe diviſible; yet his bodily nature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible, and intirely the ſame in every moment of its own duration. And for this Reaſon, <hi>Although death may make a diviſion or interruption in its dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or exiſtence; yet it makes no pluralitie or diviſion in its nature:</hi> in what part of time ſoever his nature gets new exiſtence, it is intirely and indiviſibly the ſame it was.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The former Inſtance drawn from the <hi>Diviſibilitie of a bodie</hi> ſubject to quantitie or dimenſion would hold much better Thus. <hi>As one part of ſuch a body being ſeparated from the reſt, (ſuppoſe a branch or ſlip of a tree being united to another tree by inoculation or ingrafting) remains the</hi> ſelf ſame <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it was, though it now exiſt not in the ſame tree, but in another:</hi> So the bodily ſubſtance of man, though cut off by death from the company of the living, and ſevered from all co-exiſtence with the things which now are, may be the ſelf ſame ſubſtance which it ſometimes was, although it get no co-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence with the things which now are, but with the ſubſtances which ſhall be many hundred years hence; it may be at that time the ſame which formerly it was, as truly and properly, as if it had continued its co-exiſtence or actual being with the things which now are, or actually ſhall be, till it be again.

               <p n="11">11. And now for Application or Concluſion; let us here ſuppoſe that the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> as he makes himſelf worſe then a beaſt whilſt he lives on earth, could hope to make himſelf equal to beaſts in his death, or to be transformed into a ſwine. Imagine he ſhould endeavour to drown his immortal ſoul in a Tavern, or to bury his bodily natural Eſſence in the Stews; ſuppoſe his body might, by <hi>Venus</hi> fire, or other loathſom fruits of filthy luſts, be diſſolved into aſhes, and the aſhes of it be diſperſed through all the winds: Imagine his bones might in ſome filthy puddle be reſolved into ſlime, and become the food or nutriment of crawling toads, or of other more venemous creatures; The purſuit of theſe his fearful deſperate hopes could nothing avail him, they would be at beſt but as pledges of greater ſhame and miſery to befal him; <hi>The powerful hand of his Almighty Iudge</hi> will raiſe him up at the laſt day with the ſame body, which he had expoſed to all this ſhame and miſery, with the <hi>ſelf ſame body for nature and ſubſtance,</hi> but not the ſame for qualitie or dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie; For it ſhall after death be ten thouſand times more capable of pain, then in this life it was of pleaſure. All his bodily pleaſures came to an end before he came to an end of his bodily life: <hi>Theſe alwayes die before he dies that hath wedded himſelf unto them.</hi> But his pain ſhall never die, his paines though deadly ſhall never come to an end. Theſe are the endleſs fruits of that mans ſhort dayes on earth, which wholly miſpends his time in fooliſh bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily pleaſures or noyſom luſts. But for the ſouls of the Righteous (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever become of their bodies after death) <hi>They are ſtill in the hands of God,</hi> they are wholly at his diſpoſal; whether thoſe Bodies wherein they dwelt do fall by the enemies ſword, or come unto their graves in peace, whether they become a prey unto the beaſts of the field, to the fowls of the Air, or to the fiſhes of the Sea.

But the <hi>Connexion</hi> betwixt theſe two <hi>Aſſertions</hi> (which we are bound <hi>ſeverally</hi> to believe from the authoritie of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets)</hi> as, <hi>That Chriſts Reſurrection from the grave ſhould be the</hi> neceſſarie Cauſe <hi>of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;</hi> or, That <hi>our future Reſurrection ſhould neceſſarily infer Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead;</hi> or, <hi>that the denial or doubt of our Reſurrection ſhould infer a denial or doubt of his Reſurrection,</hi> is more then can eaſily be gathered out of <hi>Moſes</hi> or the <hi>Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>mutual Inference</hi> of the ones Reſurrection by the other, whether <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively</hi> or Aſſertively, was <hi>firſt made</hi> by our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in this place, at leaſt in <hi>expreſſe Terms,</hi> though <hi>implicitely</hi> made by our Saviour before.</p>
               <p>Our Apoſtle in making this <hi>mutual Inference,</hi> ſeems in the Judgment of ſome, to tranſgreſs or violate the <hi>Laws of Argumentation</hi> generally agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Gloſſam <hi>&amp;</hi> Hugonem <hi>in hunc Locum.</hi>
                  </note> in the <hi>School of nature,</hi> which notwithſtanding he elſewhere and uſually more exquiſitely obſerves, then any <hi>Naturaliſt</hi> doth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Inferences</hi> made by our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> are radically and generally Two. The One Negative, <hi>Per Reductionem ad impoſsibile, aut abſurdum:</hi> The other Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, by Poſitive Proof.</p>
               <p>The Negative hath many branches:</p>
               <p>The Firſt is, ver. 13. <hi>If there be no Reſurrection of the dead, then is Chriſt not riſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second ſprings out of this, in the 14. verſe; <hi>And if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is alſo vain.</hi> And yet of this their Faith One Branch was, <hi>Their Belief in Chriſts death</hi> and paſſion.</p>
               <p>The Third Branch ſeems to ſpring out of both theſe, verſe 15. <hi>Yea and we are found falſe witneſſes of God, becauſe we have teſtified of God, that he raiſed up Chriſt, whom he raiſed not up, if ſo be that the dead riſe not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt Branch is reſumed again by our Apoſtle in the ſixteenth verſe: and the Second likewiſe in the ſeventeenth, with this Addition, that, <hi>If Chriſt be not raiſed, then ſuch as believe in Christ are yet in their ſins.</hi> And ver. 18. Then <hi>they which are fallen aſleep in Christ are periſhed;</hi> not only fruſtrated of
<pb n="3457" facs="tcp:32220:87"/>
their hopes of the life to come, but deprived or couzened of ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or contentments of this life, as the unbelievers injoy, and without loſs or detriment might injoy, if the dead were not to be raiſed up; or if Chriſt were not already raiſed from the dead. For he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The affirmative inference is contained in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. (&amp; 20.) <hi>Now if Chriſt be Preached that he roſe from the dead, how ſay ſome among you, that there is no Reſurrection from the dead?</hi> 
                  <q>This interrogation reſolved into an Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, imports thus much; If we truly Preach, and you truly believe, that Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, then we muſt of neceſſity Preach, and you of neceſſity believe, that there ſhall be a general <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the dead, and that ſuch as die in <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be raiſed up to immortal Glory. And this affirmative is expreſsly aſſumed by our Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt fruits of them that ſlept.</q> And afterward, by him powerfully re-inforced, as may be ſeen, in the 21, 22, &amp; 23. verſes.</p>
               <p>That this is our Apoſtles intent and meaning there can be no queſtion; All <hi>The difficultie is, how either the Negative inferences or inconveniences</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How S. <hi>Pauls</hi> inferences may be collected.</note> 
                  <hi>which he preſſeth upon ſuch as deny the Reſurrection of the dead, or the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive points which he chargeth theſe Corinthians, and in them, us, undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe, can be concludently gathered from the principles of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To begin with the Negative Inferences, and in particular with the third Branch, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Yea, and <hi>We are found falſe witneſſes of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let us examine wherein did, wherein could, the falſhood of this Teſtimonie conſiſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some perhaps would reply, that, <hi>We are not to ſay any thing of God (though not benefitting his Majeſtie,)</hi> but that which is moſt true. We are not indeed; ſo far as we know or believe: But albeit we fail in that we ſpeak of him, yet this is not enough to convince us of bearing falſe Teſtimony of Him. To ſay or ſpeak that of any which we take to be the Truth, and to ſay it, not with purpoſe to caluminate or ſlander, but rather to his praiſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, is not to bear falſe Teſtimonie of him, much leſs againſt him; albeit we be out of charitie miſtaken in that which we ſay of him. Admit then, That the Apoſtle had been in ſome errour concerning <hi>the Reſurrection,</hi> when he firſt taught the Romans and theſe Corinthians; That, As Chriſt was raiſed from the dead to life immortal, ſo we alſo in good time ſhall be raiſed to the ſame or like imortal life; and, that, as he, So we alſo, ſhould be raiſed by the immediate power of God, his ſuppoſed miſtake in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, could not convince him of bearing falſe Teſtimonie on Gods behalf, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which he ſaith concerning the Reſurrection of others (beſides Chriſt) from the dead, doth tend to Gods glory. For to bear falſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of or againſt any, Doth alwayes include ſome mater of imputation, of aſperſion, or prejudice; Whether we bear ſuch teſtimony of God or of man.</p>
               <p>What imputation or prejudice was it then to affirm, <hi>that God had raiſed up Chriſt from the dead,</hi> if there were no general Reſurrection of others from the dead? or wherein doth the falſhood of the teſtimonie, which our Apoſtle ſeeks to avert from himſelf, punctually conſiſt? Did it conſiſt in ſaying, <hi>That he raiſed up Chriſt, whom he did not raiſe up, if ſo be the dead riſe not?</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſuppoſe it as queſtionable (much leſſe ſimply deny it)
<pb n="3458" facs="tcp:32220:88"/>
                  <hi>That God did raiſe up Chriſt from the dead;</hi> but only deduceth his adverſary to <hi>this inconvenience or abſurditie, that if the dead were not raiſed up, then Chriſt was not raiſed, and that he had born falſe witneſs of God in ſaying that he had raiſed up Chriſt.</hi> So that, <hi>The ground of the falſe Teſtimony lies in the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Yea to avouch <hi>that God did raiſe up Chriſt from the dead</hi> (although the fact were true and unqueſtionable <hi>that God did raiſe him up,)</hi> were in our Apoſtles Divinitie to lay an imputation or ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on God, <hi>if ſo be that ſuch as beleive in Chriſt, and die in Chriſt, ſhould not be raiſed up</hi> unto bliſſe and glory: Better it were (or at leaſt leſs evil) in our Apoſtles Judgement, to deny <hi>that Chriſt was riſen from the dead,</hi> then grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>This,</hi> to deny <hi>The Reſurrection of ſuch as ſleep in Chriſt.</hi> For to grant the former and to deny the Latter, were to caſt an imputation of folly upon God, and an aſperſion of impoſture upon the Son of God Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. What imputation then is it unto God, or how doth this Aſperſion riſe, and fall upon Chriſt or his Apoſtle, by granting that Chriſt was indeed raiſed up; and yet denying, that the dead ſhall be raiſed up again?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>Maxim in Philoſophie</hi> generally acknowledged if not firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <note place="margin">A Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Maxim</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced and much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note> by the heathens: <hi>[Deus et natura nihil fruſtra Faciunt, God and nature work nothing in vain.]</hi> From this principle ſuch of the heathens as knew not God, ſuch as denyed His providence, or knew not how to diſtinguiſh him or it from nature, held it an impietie or prophaneſs, to ſlander nature ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Errour in her working, or of folly in producing effects to no good end or purpoſe. Some there were, which did queſtion whether Monſters (as children, which are born with two heads, with more Toes or fingers then are uſual &amp;c.) were not <hi>Errata naturae,</hi> errours, imperfections or overſights of nature. But they finally reſolve, that albeit ſuch events might fall out by the errour, or contrary to the intentions or indeavours of <hi>That particular nature,</hi> wherein theſe miſfigurations were found; yet they were intended by a more General nature, and intended by it to ſome good uſe and purpoſe: As, commonly, prodigious births do portend ſomewhat, whoſe knowledge is uſefull and good for others. Now the Heathens erred in aſcribing that, to general or univerſal Nature, which was peculiar unto God, who is the Author, Moderator, and guide of Nature, whether general or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>And if by general or Univerſal nature they meant no other thing, then we do by the guide and God of nature, <hi>Mentem teneant, Linguam corrigant,</hi> their meaning was good, but their expreſſion of it much amiſs. This we know, that God doth ſuffer or cauſe nature oft times to miſcarry in her courſe or projects for ends beſt known to himſelf. No man is born blind, or deaf, or dumb, without ſome errour or defect in that particular nature, whereof, or by which, his body is framed. All theſe and the like effects are beſides the intention, or contrary to the endeavour of nature, which alwayes aymes at the beſt. Hence our Saviours Diſciples, as we read, <hi>John</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>When they ſaw a man, which was blind from his birth, asked of their maſter; who did ſin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?</hi> They had not moved this Queſtion, unleſs by light of nature they had known, that blindneſs from his birth, was contrarie to the ordinarie and common courſe of nature; though not contrarie but conſonant, to the <hi>Will of God</hi> in this particular. For it is more then probable that they had read, though then perhaps they did not actually remember, <hi>who made the dumb or the deaf, him that ſeeth or the blind? Have not I the Lord?</hi> Exod. 4. 11. God, they likewiſe knew, did for ſome good end or juſt cauſe, either ſuffer or
<pb n="3459" facs="tcp:32220:88"/>
cauſe nature to miſcarry in this man; And they likewiſe knew ſin to be a juſt cauſe of many miſcarriages in the humane nature. And hence they queſtion, <hi>Whether God had puniſhed this man with blindneſs from the birth for his own or for his parents ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they themſelves did erre in collecting, That extraordinarie blindneſs had befallen him, either for ſome extraordinarie ſins of his own, or of his parents, and this error our Saviour rectifies ver. 3. <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his parents;</hi> that is, <hi>neither of them were more extraordinarie ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then others were,</hi> who neither were blind themſelves, nor had children that were blind from the birth. The true cauſe of this defect in natures work in framing this man; the true reaſon why he was born blind (as our Saviour expreſſeth in the next words) was, <hi>that the works of God ſhould be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in him.</hi> So true it is, which the heathens had obſerved, <hi>[Deus et natura nihil fruſtrà faciunt.]</hi> It was not in vain, nor to no purpoſe, that nature did not effect or accompliſh her work in this poor man; for by this means, Gods works in him were more manifeſt to himſelf and others, then if he had been born with Eagles eyes. He was not only cured miraculouſly of his native blindneſs, but the eyes of his underſtanding by this miraculous cure were opened and inlightned to ſee more for his ſouls health, then the learned Scribes and Phariſees did, in whom neither nature nor Art had been defective.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Galen,</hi> that great Phyſician and curious ſearcher into all the ſecrets of the humane nature, had well obſerved, That there is no part nor parcell in the whole body of man, which hath not its proper uſe. And from contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this undoubted Truth; he was inforced to acknowledge, what otherwiſe he ſeemd to deny, <hi>Divinum Opificem, A Divine Artificer</hi> or worker, even of the leaſt and moſt contemptible parts of mans natural bodie. And of <hi>This work of God,</hi> though much defaced by our firſt parents ſin, he gave the like <hi>verdict</hi> that God himſelf did of all his works; That <hi>every part of mans body was good, exceeding good, and admirably framed to its proper uſe or function.</hi> The moſt artificial works of man, of the moſt exquiſit, and moſt induſtrious Artificer, will alwayes admit ſome errours and defects; no work of man is good in its kind; That is the beſt, which hath the feweſt faults or overſights, or is adorned with the feweſt impertinent or unuſeful beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; Whereas the works of nature, even the defects of particular nature, are uſeful and profitable for the ſetting forth of Gods glory, and for procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or advancement of the publick good. Now if the ordinary works of nature (which be likewiſe the works of God) be never vain, idle, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; but have a correſpondent uſe or End, to which without errour they ſerve; <hi>Much more muſt the extraordinarie works of God be preſuppoſed to have ſome ſpecial End or extraordinary uſe, as proportionable to them, as the end or uſe of ordinary works of nature are to the ordinary operations or indeavours of nature.</hi> Now our Apoſtle ſuppoſeth <hi>That our Saviours Reſurrection from the dead, was an extraordinary work of God;</hi> The moſt remarkable work of God, <note place="margin">☞</note> that had been manifeſted to the world; <hi>and by neceſſarie conſequence, it muſt have an effect or end moſt remarkably correſpondent unto it;</hi> and what was that? <hi>The reſurrection of ſuch as live and die in Chriſt;</hi> or rather the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Gods glory and unſpeakable goodneſs in their Reſurrection unto immortal glory and happineſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The former principle <hi>[Deus nihil fruſtrà facit]</hi> being thus far improved <hi>That all Gods ſpecial and admirable works tend to ſome ſpecial and admirable uſe and purpoſe:)</hi> both parts of our Apoſtles mutual inference; as well the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative;
<pb n="3460" facs="tcp:32220:89"/>
                  <hi>[If the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed,]</hi> as the Affirmative; <hi>[If Chriſt be raiſed, then ſhall the dead ariſe]</hi> will appear to be as Firm and ſound, as the mutual Inference of the Cauſe from the Effect, and of the Effect from the Cauſe; or as firm and ſound as the mutual Inference of the Final Cauſe by the Efficient, and of the Efficient by the Final. Albeit to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and in the exact terms of the Schools; <hi>The neceſsity of the Efficient Cauſe depends upon the neceſsity of the End; The End makes the Efficient to be neceſſary; The Efficient doth not make the End to be neceſſarie. The immediate proper Effect of the Efficient is not the End or final Cauſe it ſelf, but</hi> Medium proximè deſtinatum ad finem, <hi>ſome Mean immediately deſtinated to the end; without which the End or ſcope, at which Nature in her operations aimed, cannot be obtained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If one ſhould ask why man and other terreſtrial creatures have Lungs, when as fiſhes (as moſt men and more probably think) have none?</p>
               <p>The reaſon were good, and the anſwer ſatisfactory, to ſay, That man and other like creatures ſtand in need of Reſpiration, and ſo of Lungs to temper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>or cool their blood, with whoſe exceſſive heat or diſtemper life otherwiſe would quickly be choaked. The preſervation then of life is the End or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe, why man and other like creatures have Lungs. But why life ſhould be preſerved no Cauſe can be given in nature; This is a Principle preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Howbeit of reſpiration or breathing, without which the life of man cannot be preſerved or continued, the Lungs are the true and proper Efficient Cauſe.</p>
               <p>This Mutual Inference is good, <hi>Quicquid pulmones habet, reſpirat; Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid reſpirat, pulmones habet.</hi> Whatſoever creature hath lungs, hath alſo the benefit of breath or reſpiration; This is an Argument from the Cauſe. And whatſoever hath the benefit of breathing or reſpiration hath lungs; This is an Argument from the Effect. And again Negatively; Whatſoever hath no lungs, hath no benefit of breath or reſpiration. Whatſoever hath not the benefit of reſpiration hath no Lungs.</p>
               <p>In St. <hi>Pauls Divinity,</hi> The manifeſtation of Gods Glory and Goodneſs in the Redemption of man, is the End or Final Cauſe of all the Articles which we believe concerning <hi>Chriſt as God and man;</hi> of which, even for this reaſon, we are to ſeek no further Cauſe or reaſon. But the manifeſtation of this His Goodneſs being preſuppoſed as made neceſſary by <hi>His Omnipotent Will;</hi> The Mutual Inference between the Son of Gods Incarnation, or between the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of his Sacerdotal or Regal Function, and the ſeveral parts of our Redemption, will be as perſpicuous and firm, as any Inference included in the former or like Inſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Unleſs Gods Will and Pleaſure had been ſet to manifeſt His Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Redemption of mankind, the Son of God had not been Incarnate, had not Died, had not been Raiſed from the dead. The manifeſtation of Gods Glory in our Redemption was the true Cauſe why the Son of God was to be incarnate: His Incarnation was not the Cauſe why Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was to be manifeſted, or why His Will and pleaſure was ſet to redeem us. For This (as we ſaid) is the Final Cauſe, and can have no other Cauſe of its neceſſitie; but rather impoſeth a neceſſitie upon other Cauſes ſubordinate, as upon <hi>Chriſts Incarnation, Paſsion and Reſurrection.</hi> But however Chriſts Incarnation was not the Cauſe why Gods Glory and Goodneſs was to be manifeſted in our Redemption; yet the actual manifeſtation of Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our Redemption, and our Redemption it ſelf is procured by the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Sacerdotal function of Chriſt, as by a true and proper Efficient Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3461" facs="tcp:32220:89"/>
And we may ſafely Infer: Firſt, That unleſs the Son of God had been incarnate, Gods Goodneſs to us had not been ſo admirably mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Unleſs the Son of God had become man, man could not have been delivered from the fetters and chains of ſin, much leſs reſtored to his firſt dignitie.</p>
               <p>And yet more; in that the Son of God became man, this is an Argument evident to us from the Effect, that man by ſin had become the Son of Satan: Sin then was the cauſe of Chriſts Incarnation, and Chriſts Incarnation is the cauſe or means of our deliverance or Redemption from ſin.</p>
               <p>Again, Unleſs man by Sin had become the ſervant of ſin and bond-man of Satan, the Son of God had not taken upon him the Form of a Servant. But in as much as the Son of God was found in the true Form of a Servant, this is an Argument from the Effect, evident to convince our conſciences that we Sons of men were by nature the ſervants or bond-men of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Unleſs the wages of ſin, and of our ſervice done to Satan by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the works of ſin, had been death; the <hi>true and natural Son of God</hi> had not been put to death. Our ſins then, and the wages due to our ſins (that was death) were the Cauſes of his death. And in that he truly dyed <hi>for us,</hi> This is an <hi>Argument</hi> evident from the <hi>Effect,</hi> Therefore, <hi>we were dead in our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be it ſo! Yet ſeeing the <hi>Son of God</hi> died for our ſins before he was raiſed from the dead, how ſaith our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the 17. verſe, <hi>[If Chriſt be not raiſed ye are yet in your ſins?]</hi> Could theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> or any others be ſtill in their ſins after their ſins were taken away? Or will any man deny that their ſins were taken away by Chriſt's death at the very inſtant of his ſouls departure from the bodie, or when he ſaid <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> it is finiſhed? What was finiſhed? The work which he undertook; and that was the <hi>Taking away of our ſins,</hi> or the work of our Redemption. Now if this work were finiſhed, when our Saviour Chriſt ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſins were taken away <hi>before Chriſts Reſurrection.</hi> And if ſin by Chriſts death had been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and utterly taken away, our <hi>Apoſtles Inference</hi> in this place had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, none had remained in their ſins, albeit Chriſt had not riſen again. <hi>Sin then, even the ſins of the world were taken away by Chriſts death, but not actually and utterly taken away,</hi> If ſin had been <hi>ſo taken away</hi> by Chriſts death, there <note place="margin">☜</note> had been no ſuch neceſſity of <hi>Chriſts Reſurrection</hi> from the dead, as our <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> here preſſeth upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> not as matter of <hi>Opinion,</hi> but as a <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principle of Faith.</hi> It remains then to be declared, <hi>In what ſenſe, or how far, ſin was taken away by Chriſts death; In what ſenſe it hath been, or how far it ſhall be taken away by his Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Firſt then Chriſts death was a Ranſome all-ſufficient for the <hi>ſins of the</hi>

                  <hi>ſins.</hi> But many dyed in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not becauſe there was no <hi>Balm in Gilead;</hi> as many do amongſt us, not ſo much for want of good Phyſick or ſoveraign Medicines, as for want of will to ſeek for them in due time; or for wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in not uſing Medicines profered unto them. So then, it will not follow, That no man dies in his ſin ſince Chriſts Death; Albeit we grant that the ſins of all were taken away by his death. For <hi>They were not ſo taken away, as that men might not reſume or take them again;</hi> 
                  <q>And the greateſt condemnation, which ſhall befal the world, will be; That when God had taken away their ſins, they would not part with their ſins; That when God would have heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, they would not be healed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>had theſe</hi> Corinthians <hi>been any further from having their</hi> ſins taken away by Chriſts death, <hi>if Chriſt had truly died for them, and yet but only</hi> died <note place="margin">The Benefits punctually ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Chriſts Death, and from His Reſurrection.</note> 
                  <hi>for them, and not riſen again?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes! Though Chriſt had dyed for All, yet all had died in their ſins, if He had only died, and had not been raiſed again. This Inference is expreſly avouched by our Apoſtle in the 17, and 18, verſes; <hi>If Chriſt be not raiſed, then they alſo which are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed;</hi> and yet he ſuppoſeth that they believed in Chriſts Death.</p>
               <p>But though the Inference be moſt true, becauſe avouched by our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, yet is it not Univerſally, but Indefinitely true: How far, and in reſpect of what ſins, or in what degree of periſhing, it is true, That is the Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Chriſt was delivered,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle (his meaning is, <hi>He was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto death) for our ſins, and he was raiſed again for our Juſtification, Rom.</hi> 4. 25. Are we then Otherwiſe Juſtified by His Reſurrection, then we are by His Death? So our Apoſtles words import: And if otherwiſe Juſtified by His Reſurrection then by His Death, Then are our ſins Otherwiſe taken away by vertue of His Reſurrection, then by vertue of His Death they were taken away. What ſhall we ſay then? That Chriſts Death did not Merit all the benefits, which God had to beſtow upon us? God forbid! all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>We do not receive all the Benefits,</hi> which God for his Deaths ſake beſtows upon us, by believing <hi>only in his death;</hi> But even <hi>This benefit of our Iuſtification we receive more immediately by our Belief of his Reſurrection from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the doctrine of our Apoſtle even in that place, wherein he handles the doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone, or by the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, <hi>Ex Profeſſe;</hi> as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 23, 24. <hi>Now it was not written for his ſake</hi> (to wit, <hi>Abrahams) alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us alſo, to</hi>
                  <pb n="3463" facs="tcp:32220:90"/>
                  <hi>whom it ſhall be imputed, if we beleive on him, that raiſed up Ieſus from the dead.</hi> And he gives the Reaſon, why our Belief of this Article ſhould be imputed unto us (in the next words) Seeing <hi>he was delivered</hi> to death <hi>for our offences, and raiſed again for our Juſtification.</hi> 
                  <q>Howbeit even This Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of His Reſurrection is a Grace or Bleſſing of God, which Chriſt did merit by His Death; yet a Grace conveihed unto us by the vertue of His Reſurrection, or by Chriſt himſelf, by his Reſurrection, exalted unto glory in his human nature.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We were Juſtified by his Death, in as much as The Pardon for our ſins was by it purchaſed, and the hand writing or obligation againſt us cancelled. If Chriſt then had only dyed for us and not riſen again, we might by Belief in his Death have eſcaped the Second Death or everlaſting pains of hell. We <note place="margin">Had Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>died,</hi> and not <hi>riſen again;</hi> Though we had not come in Hell, yet we had never come out of the Grave</note> ſhould notwithſtanding, as our Apoſtle here ſuppoſeth, have been detained perpetual priſoners in the grave. Our bodily or corporal being ſhould have been utterly conſumed by the firſt Death, without hope of recovery or reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And ſo far as the firſt Death had dominion over men, <hi>ſo far had theſe Corinthians remained in their ſins.</hi> So long as the firſt Death remains unconquered, ſin remains. Now if Chriſt had not been raiſed from the dead, the firſt Death or death of the body, had remained unconquered. Belief in Chriſts death could not utterly have freed them from all the wages of ſin; For death of the body is in us part of the wages of ſin; and it was to Chriſt part of the burden of our ſin. But in as much as Chriſt is riſen from the dead, and raiſed to an immortal life, over which bodily death hath no Rule or dominion, but muſt be put in abſolute ſubjection to Him; all that truly believe ſuch a Reſurrection are juſtified not only from the eternal guilt of ſin, nor only freed from everlaſting death; but are made heirs by adoption unto a life, over which death ſhall have no power. So then <hi>by Chriſts Death we are freed from the everlaſting Curſe; by his Reſurrection we are made free Deniſons of the heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> heirs by promiſe of an everlaſting and moſt bleſſed life. And thus far all that are partakers of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are ſaid to be juſtified by his Reſurrection; that is, they are bound to believe, that as He died for their Sins to redeem them from the ſecond death; ſo he roſe again for their further Juſtification to free them from the death of the bodie: He therefore roſe from the dead, that we, by believing this Article, might receive the Adoption of the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>But yet there is a further degree of Juſtification, that is, an Actual Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Reign or Dominion of ſin in our Bodies, which is never obtained without ſome meaſure of Faith or Sanctifying Grace inherent; albeit the true uſe and end of ſuch Grace and Faith inherent, be, to ſue out the Pardon, for our ſins in particular; not by our works or merits, (which are none) but meerly and ſolely by the Free-Grace and Favour of God in Chriſt. True it is, that even This Gift of Faith, by which we muſt ſue out our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in particular, and ſupplicate for the Adoption of the Sons of God, was purchaſed by Chriſts death; nor may we ſue for it under any other Stile or Form then <hi>propter merita Chriſti, for the merits of Chriſt.</hi> Yet after this plea made, we may not expect to receive this bleſſing otherwiſe, then <hi>per Jeſum Chriſtum, through or by Jeſus Chriſt, who was raiſed from the dead.</hi> This Grace, this Faith, and whatſoever other bleſſing of God, which Chriſt by his death hath merited for us; whatſoever is any way conducent to our full and final Redemption, deſcends immediately from the <hi>Son of God</hi> exalted <hi>in his human nature,</hi> as from its proper Fountain. He was conſecrated by his death <hi>(and his Conſecration was accompliſhed by his Reſurrection)</hi> to be an inexhauſtible
<pb n="3464" facs="tcp:32220:91"/>
fountain of life and ſalvation to all, that truly believe in his death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead.</p>
               <p>Thus we are fallen into the Affirmative Inference <hi>[If Chriſt be riſen from the dead, then ſuch as die in Chriſt ſhall be raiſed from death to immortal Glory.]</hi> The ſame Almighty Power, by which Chriſt was raiſed unto glorie, ſhall be manifeſted even in theſe our mortal bodies: <hi>[But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and is become the firſt fruits of them that ſlept.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The Inference or implication is; That ſeeing Chriſt, whoſe mortalitie was clearly teſtified by his death, was raiſed up to an endleſs and immortal life, Therefore ſuch as die in Chriſt (whatſoever in the mean time become of their bodies) ſhall be raiſed up to the like life, againſt which death ſhall never be able to make any attempt or approach. For as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>If the first fruit be holy, the lump is alſo holy; and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> But we are to remember that there were <hi>Two ſorts of Firſt fruits</hi> appointed by the Law; the One of the firſt corn that was reaped, being ground and made up into loaves, which were offered at the <note place="margin">Two ſorts of Firſt fruits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Law.</note> feaſt of Pentecoſt; And unto this ſort of Firſt fruits the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. hath Reference.</p>
               <p>The other was the offering of green corn when it firſt begun to bud or ear; And unto this ſort of Firſt fruits our Apoſtle here in the twentieth verſe, hath Reference. Chriſt then is the root, and we are the branches; he is the Firſt fruits, and we are the after-crop and harveſt. Now as the offering of the Firſt fruits; that is, of the green corn, was the hallowing of the whole crop; So the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the grave was the hallowing or conſecration of theſe our mortal bodies unto that glory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie which ſhall be at the finall Reſurrection. If God did accept the offering of the Firſt fruits, it was a pledge unto his people, that he would extraordinarily bleſs the after-crop with large increaſe; his people might with confidence expect a joyfull harveſt. To manifeſt the meaning or fulfilling of this Type or legal Ceremonie in our Saviour; <hi>He was raiſed up from the dead upon that very day in the morning, wherein the firſt fruits of green corn were by the prieſts of the Law offered unto God.</hi> His reſurrection (as was ſaid before) was the accompliſhment of his <hi>conſecration to the prieſthood after the order of Melchiſedec;</hi> His preſentation of himſelf to his Father as our High-Prieſt, and as the Firſt fruits from the dead, <hi>was the most accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able offering or ſacrifice that ever was offered unto God;</hi> a matter of greater joy <note place="margin">☞</note> and triumph to all the inhabitants of Heaven, then <hi>Iſaac's</hi> ſafe return from the intended ſacrifice was to <hi>Abrahams</hi> familie, or then <hi>Joſephs</hi> advancement in Egypt was to old <hi>Jacob.</hi> Now if the Firſt fruits from the dead were thus acceptable unto God, we cannot diſtruſt but that the after-crop ſhall proſper, and ſhall be gathered by the Angels of God (when the the time of ripeneſs ſhall come) into everlaſting habitations. However in the mean time it be ſown, it ſhall be reaped in Glory, and poſſeſſe its glory in immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie.</p>
               <p>This Article then of Chriſts Reſurrection from the dead, and of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Firſt fruits of them that ſleep, is the ground or root of all our Apoſtles Inferences from verſ. 35, to the end of this chapter, concerning the Reſurrection, or the eſtate of their bodies, that ſhall be raiſed to life: but of theſe we have ſpoken at large before: The ſum of all is intimated by our Saviour himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 12. 23, 24. <hi>The hour is come, that the Son of man ſhould be glorified. Verily I ſay unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die it bringeth forth muh fruit.</hi> Thus
<pb n="3465" facs="tcp:32220:91"/>
much likewiſe was foretold by the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> in that Evangelical Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his Seed, he ſhall prolong his dayes, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> Now <hi>this pleaſure of the Lord</hi> was <hi>our full Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. To conclude this point: Albeit our Sins were taken away by Chriſts death in both the Senſes before mentioned; and albeit in this life we be Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">See Paragraph the 7th,</note> Juſtified, that is actually acquitted from the guilt of ſins paſt by Belief in Chriſts Death and Reſurrection; and freed likewiſe from the rage and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of ſin by Participation of his Grace, and Inhabitation of his Spirit in us; yet ſhall we not be Abſolutely and Finally Juſtified, that is freed from all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of ſin inherent, until we be made partakers of his Glorie, This muſt be the Accompliſhment of our Juſtification by Faith in this life: <q>And it is no Paradox or ſtrange opinion to ſay, that We ſinful men ſhall be finally Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by utter extirpation of ſin out of our nature at our laſt Reſurrection:</q> When as Chriſt himſelf, in whom ſin never took any root, much leſs bore any branch; into whom no ſeed of ſin did ever fall, is ſaid to be Juſtified by His Reſurrection from the Dead, that is, acquitted from all burthen of our ſins.</p>
               <p>But where is Chriſt ſaid, in this ſenſe, to be Juſtified? In the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16: <hi>Without controverſie, Great is the myſterie of godlineſſe; God was manifeſted in the fleſh, and Juſtified in the Spirit.</hi> To omit all other interpretation of this phraſe, <hi>St. Paul</hi> means the very ſelf ſame thing by ſaying, <hi>Chriſt is Juſtified in the Spirit,</hi> that <hi>St. Peter</hi> means when he ſaith, <hi>He was quickened in the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. Both mean, That <hi>he was Juſtified or freed, by the Spirit or Power of the Godhead, from death</hi> or <hi>any other further burthen of our ſins. Chriſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>St. Paul, Heb.</hi> 9. 28. <hi>was once offered to bear the ſins of many, and unto them that look for him, he ſhall appear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> that is, to free us from the power of death, and all burthen of ſin, from which he himſelf was freed at His Reſurrection. So then, it is in its time and place moſt true, which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church doth moſt untruly teach; that <hi>there is a Juſtification by inherent righteouſneſſe.</hi> But this Juſtification cannot be had, may not be expected in this life; it cannot be accompliſhed in us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that Change be wrought, whereof our Apoſtle ſpeaks, verſe 51. of this Chapter. This Final Juſtification by this bleſſed Change, is the full Effect or final iſſue of Chriſts Reſurrection from the dead: he that doth not believe this future change or final iſſue of Chriſts Reſurrection, doth bear falſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of God, or againſt him, even whilſt he ſaith, that he believeth that Chriſt was raiſed from the dead. For to grant Chriſts Reſurrection from the dead, and to deny or doubt of this Final Juſtification or Abſolution of all true believers in his Reſurrection, from the reliques of ſin, is to caſt an Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon God himſelf, as if he had wrought this great work of Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>frustra;</hi> that is, to no Uſe or End correſpondent to ſuch a mighty Ground-work or Foundation.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Every man then is bound to believe, <hi>That all true Beleivers of Chriſts Reſurrection from the dead ſhall be undoubted partakers of that endleſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal glory, unto which Chriſt hath been raiſed.</hi> But no man is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive <hi>his own Reſurrection in particular unto ſuch glory,</hi> any further or upon more certain terms, then he can (upon juſt and deliberate <hi>Examination)</hi> find, that he himſelf doth truly and ſtedfaſtly believe <hi>this Fundamental Article of Chriſts Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Now if it were certainly determined and agreed upon by all, <hi>what it were truly and ſtedfaſtly to believe this Article,</hi> all the controverſies concerning the <hi>Certaintie of Salvation,</hi> or <hi>Irrevocable Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>

in this life, by Faith, would determine themſelves, and be at an end. But of the <hi>Examination of our Faith,</hi> or of its truth, ſincerity, or ſtrength, we ſhall have fitter occaſion and more full time to ſpeak in unfolding of the laſt part of the <hi>Article of Chriſts coming to Judgment;</hi> that is, the manner of the Proceſs in the Award of final Sentence.</p>
               <p>In the mean time it ſhall ſuffice to admoniſh the Reader, <hi>That he rate not the truth, or meaſure the ſtrength</hi> of his Belief in <hi>this main Article of Chriſts Reſurrection,</hi> only by the ſtrength of his perſwaſions of its Speculative and General Truth; ſpecially, <hi>in the abſence of temptations</hi> to the contrarie, or <note place="margin">How we may try our ſelves. See Book 10. Chapt. 28. 30.</note> whiles it is oppoſed to the exceptions of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> or <hi>Inſidels,</hi> which deny or oppugn it. How then muſt the truth or ſtrength of our Belief or Faith <hi>in this Article</hi> be meaſured? <hi>Only by our ſtedfaſt and conſtant practiſe of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Duties, whereunto the belief of it doth bind all profeſſors of it.</hi> Now the Special Duties, whereunto the Belief of it doth bind us, are ſuccinctly and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily ſet down by our Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>If then ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God; ſet your affections on things above, not on things on earth, &amp;c.</hi> And verſe the 5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members, which are upon earth, fornication, uncleanneſſe, inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry.</hi> And verſe 8. <hi>Put off all theſe, anger, wrath, malice, blaſphemie, ſilthy communication out of your mouth, Lie not one to another, ſeeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds.</hi> All of us have put off the old man by profeſſion and Solemn Vow at our Baptiſm; and a double Wo or Curſe ſhall befal us, unleſs we put him off in practiſe and reſolution; and labour to <hi>put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the Image of him that created him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The particular Limbs of this New man are ſet forth unto us by our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, verſe 13, 14. <hi>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye: And above all theſe things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectneſſe.</hi> The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Duties required of men and women according to their ſeveral condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or ſtates of life, (as of Wives to Husbands, and of Husbands to Wives; as of Children to Parents, and of Parents to Children; of Servants to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and of Maſters to Servants) are ſet down by the ſame Apoſtle in the verſes following unto the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt be altogether as certain that we do truely, ſincerely, and conſtantly perform theſe duties which are by our Apoſtle in this place required (whether as General to all Chriſtians, or ſuch as concern parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular eſtates of life) as we are of This general, [That whoſoever doth truly mortifie the deeds of the body and perform the other duties here required ſhall be undoubted partaker of the Reſurrection unto Glory] before we can be certain <hi>certitudine fidei,</hi> by certaintie of faith, of our ſalvation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection unto glory in particular.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe three verſes being the Cloſe or binding of all the reſt in this Chapter, or as the <hi>Solid Angle</hi> in which there <note place="margin">The Model or Scope of the whole Chapter.</note> is a punctual and full Coincidence of all the former Lines, I muſt be inforced to exhibit unto the Reader <hi>A Model or Abſtract</hi> of the Whole, before I can ſhew him the true <hi>Connexion</hi> or <hi>References</hi> between theſe later, and the foregoing verſes. And the Model or Abſtract of the whole Chapter is This.</p>
               <p>Our Apoſtle had given up this Concluſion as the main Aphoriſm or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultance of the fifth Chapter, verſe 20, 21. <hi>Where ſin abounded, Grace did much more abound.</hi> That <hi>as ſin had raigned unto death, even ſo might grace reign through righteouſneſs unto eternal life by</hi> Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Now whether it were to check that prepoſterous Inference which ſome had alreadie made of this Doctrine, when firſt it was delivered unto them (for it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered before he wrote this Epiſtle:) or whether it were to prevent the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, upon the reading of the former Chapter; our Apoſtle propounds that Objection, (which either had been or might be made againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Doctrine) in the begining of this Sixth Chapter; and he propounds it by way of Interrogation. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Shall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound?</hi> And he gives the Anſwer unto it in the ſecond verſe, by an <hi>Abſit, God forbid:</hi> That is, far be it from us, far be it from every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, thus to reſolve, thus to infer, ſay or think. And to ſhew the abſurditie of that inference, he adds this Reaſon; <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin live any longer therein?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Refutation may ſeem to participate more of <hi>Rhetorical Paſsion</hi> or indignation, then of ſound and <hi>Logical Reaſon;</hi> an artificial Evaſion rather then a concludent Proof. For theſe <hi>Romans</hi> might have demanded of him:
<pb n="3470" facs="tcp:32220:94"/>
what juſt fear is there that we <hi>ſhall,</hi> what poſſibilitie that we <hi>can</hi> live any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ſin, if, as you ſuppoſe, <hi>we be already dead unto it?</hi> Only prove what you ſuppoſe or take as granted, <hi>that we are already dead to ſin,</hi> or that ſin is dead in us, and we ſhall make juſt proof that we <hi>neither do, nor can</hi> live any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>in it,</hi> that <hi>it doth not,</hi> neither ſhall it live in us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the Queſtion then is (and a Great Queſtion it is, upon whoſe true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, the reſolution of all the queſtions or difficulties which are emergent <note place="margin">Of death to ſin.</note> out of this and other Chapters depends:) <hi>In what ſenſe every true Chriſtian is ſaid to be dead to ſin;</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth all theſe <hi>Romans</hi> were, which were true members of the true viſible Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of death, there be but two ſorts</hi> or kinds uſually known or acknowledged; <hi>The one a Natural,</hi> the other <hi>a Civil Death.</hi> He that is dead according to a Natural Death, is utterly deprived of all ſenſe or motion; he cannot feel, he <note place="margin">A natural and a civil death.</note> cannot taſte, he cannot ſmell, ſee or hear; his heart pants not, his lungs ceaſe to ſend forth any breath. And <hi>according to this kind of death Saint</hi> Paul <hi>himſelf could not be accompted dead to ſin:</hi> Sin was not ſo fully mortified or put to death in him, but that it had its Motions in his inward parts; and theſe Motions he by experience felt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there is a civil as well as a natural death,</hi> and many are ſaid to be civilly dead whoſe natural life is yet ſound and entire. Thus men which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or ſentenced to die, are ſaid to be dead in Law, albeit the execution or taking away of their natural life be a long time deferred. The like we ſay of men which have been free born, but afterwards fall into ſlaverie or bondage. Both theſe ſorts of men are ſaid to be dead in Law, or to be ſubject to civil death, becauſe they cannot do or make any legal act either to the benefit of their friends or poſteritie, or to the prejudice of their enemies. Of any civil contract or legal deed they are as uncapable, as he that is naturally dead is of breathing, ſenſe, or motion. And according to this acception or importance of death, <hi>Every one in whom the reign or dominion of ſin is broken, in whom the fleſh is made ſubject to the ſpirit, is truely ſaid to be dead to ſin:</hi> that is, in every man thus qualified, ſin is put unto a civil, though not unto a natural death.</p>
               <p>But neither is this civil death the death here punctually meant by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin live any longer therein?</hi> For he ſpeaks not of <hi>ſuch a death to ſin,</hi> as was peculiar to himſelf or to ſome few; but of <hi>ſuch a death</hi> as was common to all theſe Romans, and to every true member of the viſible Church. He doth not ſuppoſe (nor was it imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) that all of them to whom he wrote, were <hi>thus actually dead to ſin;</hi> or that ſin did not, or could not raign in ſome of them; at leaſt it may and doth to this day raign in many which have by baptiſme been admitted into the viſible Church: whereas <hi>Our Apoſtles Reaſon equally concerns all that are baptized.</hi> All and every one of them are in his ſenſe and meaning in this place, <hi>dead to ſin;</hi> and yet are not all of them <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> or <hi>ſin dead to them,</hi> or in them, either by <hi>a natural or civil death.</hi> In all of them ſin retains ſome life or being, in many of them it ſtill retains its Soveraigntie or Dominion. how then are all of them, how are all of us, that have been baptized, <hi>dead to ſin?</hi> Thus in the firſt place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>All of them did ſolemnly promiſe and vow to mortifie the deeds of the body, as we now do.</hi> But ſo may others do which never meant to be baptized. <note place="margin">Death to ſin is vowed by us in Baptiſm.</note> It is true; and therefore the full and onely Reaſon, why theſe Romans (one and other) were reckoned <hi>as dead to ſin,</hi> was not becauſe they had promiſed or <hi>vowed to mortifie the deeds of the fleſh,</hi> or to put ſin unto a <hi>civil death,</hi> that is
<pb n="3471" facs="tcp:32220:94"/>
to break the Raign or Dominion of it: For thus to promiſe or thus to vow without ſufficient means or probable hopes, ſuch hopes and means as <hi>by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they could not have</hi> to perform what they thus vow, were preſumption, a tempting of God, and provocation of Satan, to take that opportunitie which they themſelves offer, to aſſault them. To compell all that come unto the <hi>Sacred Laver,</hi> to undertake that <hi>treble vow</hi> (which is and hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſolemnly made and undertaken, either by the parties themſelves, which are to be baptized in caſe they be of years, or by their ſureties) were the part rather of a cruel Stepdame than the office of a loving Mother, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Church our Mother which exacts this vow of all and every one, could give full aſſurance to all and every one of her ſons, that God in baptiſme for his part never failes to give means ſufficient for quelling the reign of ſin, for mortifying the deeds of the body. Means (I mean) <hi>ſufficient not in themſelves only, but ſufficient to every one of us,</hi> unleſſe we will be defective unto our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now adde this Reaſon unto the former, and you have the <hi>true and full meaning of our Apoſtle</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>that all that are Baptized are dead to ſin;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Meanes alſo of dying to ſin received in baptiſme.</note> that is, Firſt they are <hi>dead unto it by ſolemn vow or profeſsion,</hi> Secondly they are ſaid to be <hi>dead unto ſin, or ſin to be dead in them,</hi> in as much as they in Baptiſm receive an Antidote from God by which the rage and poiſon of it might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be aſſwaged or expelled, ſo they would not either receive that grace or means which God in Baptiſme exhibits unto them in vain, or uſe it amiſſe. <q>So we may ſay that any popular diſeaſe is quelled or taken away, after a ſoveraign remedie be found againſt it, which never fails, ſo men will ſeek for it, ſeaſonably apply it, and obſerve that Dyet which the Phyſitian, upon the taking of it, preſcribes unto them.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Some in our times there be (and more I think than have been in all the former) which deny all <hi>Baptiſmal Grace.</hi> Others there be which grant <hi>ſome</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of baptiſmall Grace.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace</hi> to be conferred by Baptiſme, even unto infants; but yet theſe reſtrain it onely to infants Elect. And <hi>This</hi> they take to be the meaning of our <hi>Churches Catechiſme,</hi> wherein Children are taught to believe <hi>[That as Chriſt the ſecond Perſon in the Trinitie did Redeem them and all mankind: So the Holy Ghoſt (the third Perſon) doth ſanctifie them and all the Elect People of God.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But can any man be perſwaded, that it was any part of <hi>Our Churches mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> Children when they firſt make profeſſion of their Faith, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they are of the number of the <hi>Elect,</hi> that is, of <hi>ſuch as cannot finally periſh?</hi> This were to teach them their Faith backwards, and to ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven not <hi>Aſcendendo</hi> by aſcending, but <hi>Deſcendendo</hi> by deſcending from it. For higher then thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in his greateſt perfection could not poſſibly reach; no, nor the bleſſed Angels which have kept their <hi>First ſtation</hi> almoſt theſe 6000 years. Yet certain it is, that <hi>Our Church</hi> would have every one at the very firſt profeſſion of his Faith, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is <hi>One of the Elect People of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe <hi>Reverend Fathers</hi> which did compoſe that <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Church our Mother</hi> which did approve and authorize it, did in charity preſume, that every one which would take upon him to expound this <hi>Catechiſme</hi> or <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Elect and the Elect people of God.</note> other principles of Faith, ſhould firſt know <hi>the Diſtinction</hi> between <hi>the Elect,</hi> that is, ſuch perſons as cannot periſh, and the <hi>Elect People of God:</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Election</hi> unto Gods ordinarie <hi>Grace</hi> or means of ſalvation, and <hi>Election unto eternal glory.</hi> Every People or Nation, every company of men, when they are firſt converted from Gentiliſm to Chriſtianitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an <hi>Elect People,</hi> a choſen generation or company of men: that is, they
<pb n="3472" facs="tcp:32220:95"/>
and their ſeed after them are made capable of Baptiſm, receive an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in Gods promiſes made unto us in Chriſt, which the heathens <hi>whilſt they continue heathens</hi> cannot have. And all of Us are in Baptiſm thus far ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that we are made true members of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> qualified for hearing the word, for receiving the Sacrament of Chriſts Body and Blood, and whatſoever <hi>Benefits of Chriſts Prieſtly Function,</hi> are committed to the diſpenſation of his Miniſters. And thus far ſanctified by Baptiſme, no man can be but by the Holy Ghoſt. Our Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>That the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Husband is ſanctified by the believing wife: and the unbelieving wife is ſanctified by the believing Husband elſe were your children unclean, but now they are holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that he attributes an holineſs unto the children of believing Parents by which they are more capable of Baptiſme then the children of unbelieving Parents are. And of this holineſs by which they are capable of Baptiſme, all children are partakers, although but one of their Parents, whether Father or Mother, do believe: much more are the children of believing Parents to be reputed holy or ſanctified after baptiſme, by which alwayes <hi>ſome Gift of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> is conferred upon them. For even that holineſs which was communicated or derived unto them from their Parents before they were baptized, or by which they became capable of Baptiſme, was conferred upon their Parents by Baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether <hi>This gift</hi> or Qualification wherewith <hi>The Holy Ghoſt</hi> is ſaid <hi>to ſanctifie all the Elect people of God,</hi> be, or include in it, the <hi>Grace of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I will not diſpute. That infants are by Baptiſme regenerated we may not deny; unleſſe we will take upon us to put another ſenſe upon the <hi>Articles of our Church,</hi> than they will naturally bear. But whether ſuch as were baptized when they came to years of diſcretion (as moſt of theſe Romanes were) did in Baptiſme receive the <hi>Grace of Regeneration,</hi> or were forthwith regenerated; <hi>That</hi> I leave unto the Schools. It ſufficeth us to know the true meaning of our Apoſtle in this place. <q>And this it is. All of us in baptiſme receive <hi>A gift or Talent</hi> which by nature we had not, we could not have. For the uſe of this talent we ſhall be called unto a ſtrict accompt. <note place="margin">☞</note> And when this accompt ſhall be taken, it ſhall go harder with thoſe which either have abuſed it, miſimployed it or not uſed it, than with the Gentiles, Heathens or Infidels which never received the like.</q> 
                  <hi>For to whom more is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of them more ſhall be required.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And unleſſe their means to vanquiſh Satan the world and the fleſh had been greater than the meer natural man had any, the juſt Lord would not puniſh them more ſeverely than he doth the heathen or meer natural men for ſuffering themſelves to be vanquiſhed by his enemies. They which deny any <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>talent</hi> to be always given in baptiſme; or affirm <hi>this Talent</hi> to be given onely to ſome few which are of the number of the Elect; either do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <note place="margin">In Baptiſm, there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Aſtipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or promiſe between God and man.</note> or do not call to minde what baptiſme is. Now <hi>Baptiſme on our part is an Aſtipulation or promiſe;</hi> (1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 21.) <hi>And it is no leſſe on Gods part.</hi> It is a mutual Covenant or Aſtipulation between God and us. And in every Covenant or Aſtipulation there is <hi>Ratio dati et accepti,</hi> ſomewhat given and and ſomewhat taken. The giving is properly on Gods part, the taking on ours. For in true and proper terms we cannot give any thing to God, becauſe all we have, even we our ſelves, are his by double right, by right of creation and redemption. Yet it is his pleaſure that we in baptiſme ſhould ſincerely and heartily ſurrender that unto him which is his own, even our ſelves, our ſouls, and bodies. And he upon this ſurrender or vow, if it be ſincerely
<pb n="3473" facs="tcp:32220:95"/>
made, doth give to us that which was not ours, even his only ſon with all the benefits of his death and paſſion. All of us put him on in baptiſm, though not all in the ſame degree; and we may reſt aſſured, that God would never preſſe us in baptiſme, to fight under the banner of his Son, unleſs he were ready to furniſh us with ſtrength, with weapons, and skill to fight his battails. So we will (as our Apoſtle exhorts us) <hi>yeeld our members unto his ſervice,</hi> he will teach our hands to War, and our fingers to fight, and every facultie of our body and ſoul to do their part.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The</hi> Abſtract or Briefe <hi>of our Apoſtles diſcourſe in this chapter is to ſtir up that Gift of God in theſe Romans which they had received in baptiſm; or which is all one, to animate or incourage them to imploy that talent, which God in that Sacrament had concredited unto them, unto his glory.</hi> And this his <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is grounded upon their Profeſſion of <hi>dying to ſin</hi> which they had made in baptiſme: or upon the aſſurance of Gods ſpirit in the ſacred War, ſo we will take heart and courage to undertake the fight. There is not one branch of this Exhortation from the ſecond verſe of this chap. to this one and twentieth, but is rooted in one of theſe two conſiderations, or joyntly in both. That <hi>all of us in baptiſme are dead to ſin</hi> (in that ſenſe which we have ſhewed before) that is, <hi>by ſolemn vow, or by Profeſsing our death unto it,</hi> our Apoſtle infers <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and not onely <hi>dead</hi> but <hi>buried.</hi> And both this <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Burial</hi> unto ſin was ſolemnly profeſſed not by <hi>Word or Vow</hi> only, but by <hi>matter of fact</hi> or viſible Ceremony then uſuall in Baptiſme; for every one that was baptized (ſeeing all that were baptized were of good years, and ſtrength of body to undergo this Ceremony,) were <hi>ter demerſi in aquis,</hi> their whole bodies were plunged thrice in the water to repreſent their <hi>vowed death and buriall</hi> unto ſin. This <hi>Ternal demerſion</hi> of their Bodies, as ſome collect, was not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent <note place="margin">Ceremonies uſed at Baptiſm and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</note> 
                  <hi>The Holy and bleſſed Trinitie of the Divine Perſons</hi> in whoſe names they were baptized; but withall to repreſent the <hi>three ſeveral dayes</hi> wherein Chriſt lay buried in the grave. <hi>Therefore</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we are buried with him by Baptiſme unto death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father: even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſſe of life. ver.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The meaning of the former Ceremony was, and ſo of Baptiſme to this day, is, <hi>That as Chriſt did leave the burthen of our ſins, and put off the form of a ſervant, which for our ſakes he undertook, in the grave: ſo we by baptiſme and buriall into his death, ſhould put off the old man or body of ſin and be raiſed unto newneſs of life, and become partakers of his Reſurrection unto glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This raiſing unto newneſſe of life by the Sacrament of Baptiſme was repreſented by the ſafe Aſcenſion of their Bodies out of the water in the which they had been thrice plunged. And of our Reſurrection unto glory, we receive the pledge or earneſt, when we receive the <hi>Grace of Regeneration,</hi> that is the Grace which enables us to walk in newneſſe of life. And this is called the <hi>Firſt Reſurrection,</hi> without which no man ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the <hi>ſecond unto Glory.</hi> Now that all ſuch as are truly <hi>buried with him by baptiſme into death,</hi> that is, all ſuch as obſerve and perform <hi>their vow</hi> made in baptiſme ſhall undoubtedly be partakers of his Reſurrection unto Glory, the Apoſtle inferres ver. 5. <hi>For if we have been planted together in the likeneſſe of his death; we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his Reſurrection,</hi> and verſ. the ſixth. <hi>Knowing this that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin. For he that is dead, is free from ſin, ver.</hi> 7. that is, He that is <hi>dead to ſin</hi> in this life, is freed from the life or reign of ſin. For it is obſervable that he doth
<pb n="3474" facs="tcp:32220:96"/>
not ſay, if we have been <hi>planted together in his death,</hi> but if we have been <hi>planted together in the</hi> likeneſs <hi>of his death.</hi> It is not required that we ſhould die the death of the body as Chriſt did, but to die as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did, in the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and figure of his death; that is, we ſhould die to ſin, or crucifie that ſin in us, for which Chriſt was crucified. And as it is not required that we ſhould die the death of the body in baptiſme: ſo is it not to be expected that we ſhould forthwith be raiſed unto that glory whereunto he roſe, but to be raiſed <hi>unto A ſimilitude</hi> or likeneſs of it; that is, unto newneſs of life, which is the <hi>Firſt Reſurrection.</hi> And of this Reſurrection we ſhall not fail to be actual partakers by vertue of baptiſme, if we be rightly <hi>implanted into the ſimilitude of his death:</hi> for ſo the Apoſtles words are, <hi>If we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is it to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>planted together?</hi> or with whom are we planted? we Gentiles together with the Jews? So ſome conjecture. But the more ancient and better expoſition is, that we are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with Chriſt, <hi>planted together with Him;</hi> yet not ſo planted together with him as one tree is planted together by another <hi>(Arbor inter</hi> or <hi>juxta Arbores)</hi> each having its ſeveral root. But as Chriſt was planted by his death and burial, and conſecrated to be the root of life; So we likewiſe ſhould be planted by Baptiſme in Him <hi>to die to ſin,</hi> and being ſo planted in his death, to be partakers of his Reſurrection unto life: As the implanted graft which loſeth leaf and ſap and (to outward view) life alſo in winter, with the Branch or ſtock into which it was planted, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all again when the root ſends back the ſap at the Spring or the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the year.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This is that which our Saviour himſelf had ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 15. 4, 5. <hi>As the branch cannot bear fruit in it ſelf, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me. I am the Vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> That is, ye have no root in your ſelves, and therefore no life but as you are planted in me, the Vine. Now this Vine was opened in his death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe, and planted in his burial: and from him ſo planted, <hi>That</hi> of the <hi>Pſalmiſt Pſ.</hi> 85. 11. was fulfilled, <hi>Righteouſneſs did grow out of the earth;</hi> and we being ingrafted or inoculated into him thus planted, become true branches of the ſame Vine. Branches we are, but <hi>without root in our ſelves:</hi> all the life we can hope for muſt be derived from His root.</p>
               <p>And the very ſum and proper effect of our beleif in his death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is ſet down by our Apoſtle <hi>ver.</hi> 8. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Now if we be dead with Chriſt, we beleive that we ſhall alſo live with him. Knowing that Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto ſin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewiſe, reckon your ſelves alſo to be dead indeed unto ſin: but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then if all which are baptized are <hi>dead to ſin</hi> by <hi>ſolemn vow;</hi> every one muſt know it to be his <hi>duty to mortifie his earthly members;</hi> but none are bound to beleive that they are already <hi>actually dead</hi> to ſin, becauſe they are baptized. The ſum of our Apoſtles exhortation in the <hi>twelfth verſe,</hi> is, <hi>Let not ſin therefore reign in your mortal bodie, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yeild ye your members as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin: but yeild your ſelves unto God, as thoſe that are alive from the dead, and your members as inſtruments of righteouſneſs unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The height of our hopes in this life, is, to put ſin unto a <hi>civil death;</hi> that is, to bring the fleſh in ſubjection to the ſpirit. And this we may and ought
<pb n="3475" facs="tcp:32220:96"/>
to hope for; So ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi> And Grace is able to give us that victory over ſin which the Law could not, if we will ſubmit our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the regiment of Grace, and not preſume of Gods favour in conſciouſneſs <note place="margin">The Regiment of the Law &amp; of Grace.</note> of ſin. This is that which the Apoſtle rejects with the like indignation <hi>(v.</hi> 15.) as he had done the former imagination <hi>of continuing in ſin that grace might abound. What then? ſhall we ſin becauſe we are not under the Law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not that unto whom ye yeild your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey: whether of ſin unto death, or of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto righteouſneſs?</hi> His meaning is, that albeit they were by baptiſm tranſlated from the regiment of the Law unto the regiment of grace: yet if by preſuming upon Gods Grace or favour they continue in ſin, they ſhall ceaſe to be Gods ſervants, and become again the ſervants of ſin.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is the Obſervation of <hi>Proſper</hi> (an Ancient writer) upon this place. <q>That as no man can ſerve two maſters; So every man muſt ſerve one of theſe two, either ſin or righteouſneſs; God or Satan: and he that is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Proſpers</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</note> to the one, is exempted from the ſervice of the other. He that is a ſervant of righteouſneſs is freed from ſin, and he that is a ſervant unto ſin, is rather exempted, then freed from the ſervice of righteouſneſs.</q> Both are avouched by our Apoſtle, but with this difference, that <hi>being</hi> made <hi>free from ſin, they</hi> were made <hi>the ſervants of righteouſneſs;</hi> but when they were the ſervants of ſin, they <hi>were free,</hi> not <hi>from righteouſneſs,</hi> but <hi>to righteouſneſs:</hi> that is, they did righteouſneſs no ſervice, <hi>de facto,</hi> but uſed their freedom rather to wrong it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>God be thanked</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle ver. 17.) <hi>that ye were the ſervants of ſin. A strange kinde of ſpeech!</hi> The Phariſee indeed did thank God, that he was no extortioner, no covetous perſon, nor tainted with ſuch ſins, as he thought the Publican was; but we never read that any Phariſee, Publican, or other did thank God that he was an extortioner, or that he was a grievous ſinner, nor would God queſtionleſs accept of ſuch thanks: For he expects no thanks but for the good which he doth unto the Children of men. Now to be a covetous perſon, to be an extortioner, to be a ſervant to ſin, are things which have no goodneſs in them, therefore no works of God, no part of his doings. How then doth the Apoſtle ſo ſolemnly thank God on theſe Romanes behalf, that they <hi>were</hi> the ſervants of ſin? or is this his thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to be referred onely to the later part of that 17. verſe? <hi>But ye have obeyed from the heart that Form of doctrine which was delivered you.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was worthy of thanks: yet not this alone. The form of thankſgiving refers as properly and punctually to the firſt part of the verſe <hi>[God be thanked, that you</hi> were <hi>the ſervants of ſin]</hi> as it doth to the later part, <hi>[But you have obeyed the form of doctrine, which was delivered unto you.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the firſt place, it refers <hi>to their former ſervitude unto ſin.</hi> For though God were not the Author of their ſervitude to ſin, as he was of their obedience to the Doctrine of life; <hi>Yet his goodneſs did turn their former ſervitude to ſin, the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>very worſt deed which they had done, unto their good.</hi> For take them as now they were, it was better for them that they had been the ſervants of ſin, than not to have been ſo. God, you muſt conſider, at this time required the ſervice of righteouſneſs at their hands. And he that hath been a diligent ſervant to an hard and cruel maſter, from whom he could not in reaſon expect any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence worth his toil, is thereby well enapted and trained to be diligent and faithful in the ſervice of a gentle loving and bountiful Maſter. Such was the caſe and ſtate of theſe Romans. They had don extraordinary kindneſs
<pb n="3476" facs="tcp:32220:97"/>
for a long time unto ſin, and this their ſervice was not only loſt in reſpect of times paſt, but very dangerous in the future. Upon this known caſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment among men, doth our Apoſtle ground thoſe forcible exhortations in the verſes precedent, which he moſt ſtrongly concludes with the words of the 21. verſe. <hi>I ſpeak</hi> (ſaith he ver. 19.) <hi>after the manner of men, becauſe of the infirmitie of the fleſh: for as ye have yeilded your members ſervants unto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs and to iniquitie unto iniquitie:</hi> even ſo now yield <hi>your members ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to righteouſneſs, unto holineſs. For when ye were the ſervants of ſin, ye were free to righteouſneſs:</hi> that is, you did acknowledge no ſervice due unto it. <q>The implication which he expreſſeth not, is this: Being now become the ſervants of righteouſneſs, do as little ſervice unto ſin, as when you were its ſervants, ye did to righteouſneſs: acknowledge none to it, for none is due to it, eſpecially from you.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. But in the 21. verſe, if you mark his placing of the words well; he puts the caſe home. <hi>What fruit had ye then of thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> What fruit had ye <hi>then,</hi> at <hi>that time</hi> when ye did them with greedineſs? If the ſervice of ſin at any time were fruitful, it is queſtionleſs then, whilſt it is a doing. For this <hi>Dalilah</hi> hath the trick to wipe off all ſhame from her Lovers faces, whilſt ſin is in the action or motion. But our Apoſtle proves this ſervice of ſin to be fruitleſs, <hi>even then,</hi> becauſe now, when theſe motions were paſt, it makes them aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Nor is the ſervice of ſin fruitleſs, only becauſe it bringeth forth ſhame, but therefore more then <hi>ſhamefull,</hi> full of danger and dread becauſe the ſhame which it bringeth forth, is alwayes the Harbinger or fore-runner of death. For ſo the Apoſtles adds, <hi>For the end of thoſe things is death.</hi> Theſe are the beſt fruits of their ſervice to ſin; and ſin it ſelf is more then fruitles, becauſe the beſt fruits which it ſeems to bring are poiſonous. But now theſe Romans are called unto the ſervice of a far better maſter; one from whom they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>in re,</hi> but much more <hi>in ſpe;</hi> a bountiful earneſt, for the preſent, of an invaluable recompence and future reward, ver. 22. <hi>But now being free from ſin, and become ſervants to God, ye have your fruit unto holines, and the end everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And finally he binds all his former Exhortations with this undoubted Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion; <hi>For the wages of ſin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you have ſeen <hi>The dutie whereunto we ſtand bound by our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is <hi>twofold.</hi> 1. To forſake the Divel, the world, and the fleſh; and ſecondly to betake our ſelves to the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The motives</hi> to withdraw us from this ſervice of ſin, <hi>are three.</hi> The ſervice of it, firſt, is <hi>fruitleſs,</hi> 2. it is <hi>ſhamefull.</hi> 3. it <hi>cauſeth death:</hi> to wit, a moſt ſhamefull bitter and endleſs death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The motives</hi> to draw us unto the ſervice of God, are <hi>Two.</hi> 1. The <hi>preſent fruit</hi> which it yieldeth, <hi>viz.</hi> the peace of conſcience, or that righteouſneſs which is the flour and Bloſſom unto Holineſs. 2. <hi>The Final Reward,</hi> which is a moſt bleſſed life without end. <hi>The Firſt three Motives</hi> to withdraw us from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſin, are as it were linked or mortized one into another. The very <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs</hi> of Sins ſervice ſhuts up into <hi>ſhame;</hi> and the <hi>ſhame</hi> arreſting or ſeazing upon the ſinner is no other then the very Harbinger, Fore-runner or Serjeant of Death.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WE are here to ſpeak ſomwhat to <hi>The Firſt Point,</hi> which was the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs <hi>of Sin;</hi> of which more afterwards.</p>
               <p>It was an <hi>Ancient ſaying</hi> of a good Writer, <hi>praeſtat otioſum eſſe quam nihil agere:</hi> it were better to ſit ſtill and do nothing, then to buſie, and wearie our ſelves to no purpoſe. A ſhame it is in it ſelf, but commonly the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a far greater ſhame, to ſpend our time without any fruit. And if we could perſwade a man that for the preſent he labours in vain; that for the future he can expect nothing but weariſom trouble for his long pains, it would be enough to make him (if he have any wit) aſhamed of what he hath done; more then enough (unleſſe he be impudent) to make him give over what he hath begun. Yea he is not a wiſe man, that doth not forecaſt ſome probable hopes or gainfull iſſues of his labours before he begin them. So our Saviour tels us, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 28. <hi>For which of you intending to build a Tower; ſitteth not down firſt and counteth the coſt, whether he have ſufficient to finiſh it? Leſt haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finiſh it, all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, begin to mock him, ſaying: This man began to build, and was not able to finiſh.</hi> If want of forecaſt to go through with a work which in the beginning promiſed fruit, be a ſhame, or expoſe men to ſcorn or mockerie; what is it to begin and continue thoſe works, whoſe accompliſhing or finiſhing is more fruitleſs then the firſt beginning? So that the ſervice of ſin is in this reſpect <hi>ſhamefull,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>Fruitleſs.</hi> But if you obſerve our Apoſtle well, he doth not infer, that the works of ſin are ſhamefull becauſe they are <hi>Fruitleſs,</hi> but, that they are <hi>Fruitleſs</hi> becauſe they are ſhamefull. Shame, and that A poſitive ſhame, is the natural fruit or iſſue of all ſervice to ſin; and not every kinde of poſitive ſhame; but a ſhame accompanied or ſeconded with death.</p>
               <p>That the Apoſtles Argument may have its full weight or ſway upon our ſouls, we are in the <hi>Firſt place</hi> to examine <hi>What ſhame properly</hi> is. <hi>Secondly, What manner of death it is which is the wages of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Shame is a fear of ſome evil to enſue;</hi> Or an impreſſion of ſome evil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; <note place="margin">Of ſhame; what it is, and whence ariſing.</note> the fear of whoſe continuance is more greivous than any preſent ſmart. But though all Shame be a Fear or ſenſe of evil, yet every fear or ſenſe of evil doth not cauſe ſhame. Men naturally fear the loſs of goods, but,
<pb n="3478" facs="tcp:32220:98"/>
as our Saviour intimates, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 25. moſt naturally the loſs of their lives. Yet if our goods be taken from us by violence, we are not aſhamed of it: the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation or ſufferance of this evil cauſeth only ſorrow or grief to us, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Shame to him that doth it. There is no man almoſt, but feareth a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and undeſerved death; yet if ſuch a death be ſet before him, it cauſeth only Sorrow or heavineſs of heart, a dejection of ſpirit, no Shame or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of face: <hi>Such as die guiltleſſe are rather comforted then confounded at the ſight or preſence of others.</hi> That evil, whoſe ſight moveth pitie and compaſſion in others, cannot breed Shame to him that ſuffers it. <hi>Shame then is a fear of ſuch evil only, which conſiſts in diſgrace</hi> or loſs of reputation, and is oppoſed to <note place="margin">See <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> Rhet. l. 2. cap. 6 Ethic. Nic. lib. 4. cap. 15.</note> honor, fame, or praiſe. Now the deſire of honor, fame or praiſe is the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Motive, the ſharpeſt ſpur to animate men (eſpecially of better Spirits) to undertake any danger, to undergo any evil, that is free from diſgrace, or not charged with ſhame. His Rule in the General was exceeding good, though miſ-applied to him, and to his followers Caſe; <hi>Praeſtat per virtutem emori, quam per dedecus vivere.</hi> It is better to die with Credit, then to live with Shame. And this wrought ſo deeply with him and his Souldiers, that never any died with greater Reſolution then they did; Though all were ſlain, yet every man fell in his own rank. But many <hi>Romans</hi> and other Heathens, leſs furious then <hi>Catiline</hi> and his Souldiers were, have voluntarily ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the lingring tortures of death without any other motive to undergo or endure them, beſides the deſire of Fame and Honour. Now the deſire of Fame cannot be ſo ſharp a ſpur to make men adventure upon noble Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, though full of danger; but the fear or apprehenſion of Shame will be as ſtrong a Curb to withdraw them from lewd and naughtie courſes. And if the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are Gods Embaſſadors; or the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who is his Deputie, had no other Hank or Curb over men committed to their charge, then This: this alone would be ſufficient to keep the moſt of them from groſs exorbitances or outragious Courſes, did not Satan, the world and fleſh, ſtill ſet up their <hi>Stales</hi> or counterfeit pictures of ſhame to drive men <note place="margin">Satan's Stales; falſe honor, and falſe ſhame.</note> the contrary way to that whereto we ſeek by repreſentation of true Shame to draw them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Heathen Poet could vantingly ſay, That none but Fools were either lifted up with falſe Honour, or dejected with ſlanderous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie.</p>

               <p>But it is a ſad truth whereof we daily have experiment; That <hi>The main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict in our Chriſtian warfare, is between that honour which one man ſeeks to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from another, &amp; that Honor which cometh from God alone: Between the fear of ſhame and diſgrace from men, and that diſgrace or ſhame which is the Award of Divine Juſtice.</hi> Painted Honor and counterfeit Shame ſtill <hi>command in chief</hi> (as it were by Courſe) for the fleſh, the world and the Divel. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is truly ſhameful, but <hi>malum culpae,</hi> but that which is evil or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and againſt the Commandements of God. The only conſtant Rule for knowing what deſerveth Shame, what not, is the Decalogue, or ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.

So that <hi>Pudor</hi> is oppoſed to moral fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs or naughtineſs, as <hi>verecundia</hi> is to unſeemlineſs, or uncomlineſs: both of them agree in the general, both are <hi>A fear of ſome cenſure;</hi> but <hi>Pudor,</hi> or Shame, is, <hi>metus vituperij, a fear of reproach or infamy for doing that which in it ſelf is evil,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That diſpoſition which the Latines call <hi>verecundia</hi> was incident to man in his firſt and pure eſtate; The very Angels cover their faces at the preſence of God. And ſo no doubt but Children ſhould have born an awful and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt reſpect unto their Parents, and have been afraid to do thoſe things in their preſence, which done out of their preſence had not been evil or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly. But that which the Latines call <hi>Pudor,</hi> had found no entrance into our nature unleſs ſin had made it One. Our nature had been ſufficiently guarded by its Original Integritie againſt juſt fear of infamy or diſgrace. But taking our nature as now it is polluted with ſin, and ſtained with filthineſs, the fear of diſgrace or infamy is no prejudice, but rather an advantage to it. It is a qualification which makes men more capable of Rule or Government then any reaſonleſſe creature is; none of which are capable of this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The life of Government or Juriſdiction conſiſts in the right diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Poena and Premium,</hi> that is, of puniſhment and reward. And <hi>in every well governed Common-wealth Fame and Honour are the top branches of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; wealth or bodily contentments are but ſupporters unto it.</hi> Many, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes well ordered Common-wealths, might erre (as moſt Heathen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths did) in defining what true Honour was, or wherein true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour did conſiſt. They did not err in determining honour as the chief reward or Crown of well doing. Nor did they err in making diſgrace or infamy, as the ſpecial branch of puniſhment. Mulcts, or loſs of goods, loſs of life, or bodily torture, come but in the ſecond or third place: Fear of infamy and hope of Honour were of themſelves ſufficient to keep moſt men within the

compaſs of civilitie, or moral goodneſs, were it not generally true in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, which <hi>Solomon</hi> had obſerved in his times. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 4. <hi>That they which forſake the Law do praiſe the wicked;</hi> and ſo <hi>St. Peter</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> cap. 4. v. 4. <hi>That ſuch as walked in the wayes of the Gentiles, in laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, luſt, exceſſe of wine, ryotings, banquettings and abominable idolatry, did think it a ſtrange thing, that theſe late Converts to whom he wrote this Epiſtle, did not run with them to the like exceſſe.</hi> And for this cauſe, as he adds, <hi>they ſpeak evil of them;</hi> that is, they put all the ſhame they could upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As then, ſo now;</hi> Every ſocietie of lewd or naughtie men, have their uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped cuſtoms, which are equivalent with them to Laws: have their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby, (wo unto them! <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 20.) they attempt to alter or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Law of God, and the Law of nature; to eſtablſh evil for good, and to diſgrace goodneſs, as if it were evil.</p>
               <p>What courſe of life, what branch of lewdneſs more infamous by the Law of God then ryot or drunkenneſs? a vice ſo ſhameful, that the Fathers eye muſt not pity it in his Children that are tainted with it, but even their natural Parents, as well the Mother as the Father, are bound by the Law of God <hi>(Deut.</hi> 21. 20, 21.) to inform againſt them, to accuſe them before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, leſt the ſhame and ſin ſhould reflect upon themſelves by connivance. And by the ſame Law the publick Magiſtrate is bound upon the accuſation of their Parents to put them to an ignominious death. And yet there is a generation of men outwardly profeſſing the knowledge of God, and of Chriſt, which ſeek to put ſhame &amp; ignominie upon all ſuch as will not run with them to the like exceſs: which have their Laws and Rules for authorizing and cheriſhing this lawleſs and unruly cuſtom.</p>
               <p>God again by his written Law, and by his Sentence againſt <hi>Cain,</hi> awards death and ſhame to murtherers: And yet <hi>the ſeeds of this accurſed ſin are more then legitimated; ranked amongſt the eſſential parts of honour;</hi> made as the very touch and tryal of Gentry, by men which eſteem it a greater ſhame <note place="margin">☞</note> to indure the breath of a verbal Lie from anothers raſh mouth, then to tell or deviſe an hundred real Lies, or to outface a truth by falſe oaths. And by this corrupt cuſtom, which goes currant for a ſoveraign Law amongſt braver Spirits (as they account themſelves) the obſervance of Laws divine and humane (which forbid all private Revenge, all reſolutions to kill or be killed) is branded with the infamy of <hi>Cowardiſe; A terrible bug-bear,</hi> but to ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as are Men in maliciouſneſs, but Children in Knowledge. For it is a ſign of the greateſt Cowardiſe that can be, to be affrighted at the noiſe of vain words. or to forſake the Fortreſs upon a falſe Alarm, or repreſentation of counterfeit Colors. As theſe, ſo every other vice hath its Baud or Advocate to give it countenance, and to diſgrace the contrary vertue.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The old Serpent which beguiled the firſt Man by the firſt woman, works ſtill upon the weaker veſſel, and makes it his inſtrument to foyl the ſtronger. He is not ignorant that this <hi>maſculus pudor,</hi> as the <hi>Philoſopher cals it,</hi> this virile or manly fear of ſhame, whereby youth is naturally reſtrained from ſhameful courſes, cannot eaſily be vanquiſhed, but by ſuborning this effeminate or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh fear of worldly or popular diſgrace to betray it, as <hi>Dalilah</hi> did her Husband <hi>Samſon.</hi> And the expelling of <hi>this maſculine</hi> by this <hi>womaniſh fear of diſgrace</hi> or reproach, is as the putting out of the eyes of diſcretion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we diſcern good from evil. So that Satan leads them up and down at his pleaſure as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> did <hi>Samſon</hi> after he had loſt his bodily eyes by the cutting off his hair.</p>

We have a Saying or Proverb rather; <hi>Paſt Shame, paſt Grace.</hi> The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens had the like Obſervation, ſave only that they knew not what <hi>Grace</hi> meant. They had no uſe of the word [Grace] in that ſenſe, which is moſt common, and yet moſt proper with us.</p>
               <p>A Child or man paſt Grace is, with us, as much as <hi>Filius perditus,</hi> A Son of perdition; Such an one as <hi>Judas</hi> was, who yet was not <hi>paſt Grace,</hi> that is, not irrecoverably loſt, until he became impudent and obdurate in ſin.

               <p>I give that man (ſaith <hi>Plautus)</hi> for loſt, which hath loſt modeſtie, or is paſt ſhame. Our <hi>Common Proverb,</hi> and the <hi>Saying</hi> of this <hi>Poet</hi> have this ſure Ground in true Divinitie; <hi>That want of modeſtie, or a face uncapable of ſhame ſuppoſeth a great meaſure of iniquity in the breſt.</hi> That which we call a <hi>Brazen face</hi> hath alwayes for its <hi>Supporter</hi> an Iron ſinew, or a brawny heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 3. and 5. 3. and 6. 15. and 8. 12.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As nothing paſſeth into the underſtanding but by the gates of ſenſe: So the true belief of that which God threatened unto ſin, and that was death, is uſhered into the heart of man by ſhame and confuſion of face. The firſt impreſſion of Gods threatenings unto our firſt Parents was made upon this part. And all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> even unto this day, either have or might have a pledge of that which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates concerning their and their eldeſt Sons hiding themſelves and going out from the preſence of the Lord. To this day it is true, <hi>Qui male agit odit Lucem;</hi> an evil conſcience flies the light or preſence of men; And the face commonly bewrayes the heart; as he ſaid,</p>
               <q>Heu quam difficile eſt crimen non prodere vultu?</q>
               <p>It is an hard matter not to confeſs a crime, or the truth, although the mouth be ſilent. Yet as ſome men by long cuſtom in ſin degenerate into <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and ſee no reliques of Gods image (wherein they were created) in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, although the notion of a Godhead or Divine Power be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingrafted in all: So, though <hi>ſhame</hi> and bluſhing be moſt natural to man when he doth evil; yet ſome by long continuance in ſin, ſhake off this vail or covering of their nakedneſs. Such they are of whom <hi>Jeremie</hi> ſpake in the Old, and in the New Teſtament <hi>St. Jude</hi> ſpeaks, ver. 10. <hi>Men that are prone to ſpeak evil of thoſe things which they know not: but what they know naturally as bruit beaſts, in thoſe things they corrupt themſelves;</hi> and become as impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable by ſhame, as bruit beaſts whom God hath deprived of reaſon. He that is not ſubject to this paſſion participates more of the nature or diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of collapſed Angels than of collapſed man. The Divels (we read) do <hi>tremble</hi> at their belief or apprehenſion of Gods Judgments. We do not read that they are <hi>aſhamed</hi> of the evil which deſerves it; as our firſt Parents were. It is true (though) that they through want of awful reſpect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence unto the divine Majeſtie were the Authors of ſin, and propagators of ſhame to their poſteritie. All of us are prone to think that they deſerved ill, not of God only but of us: and yet the truth is, that we lay a great deal more blame upon them then they deſerved. They indeed were the firſt, yet not the greateſt ſinners. Many of their poſteritie in this qualitie go beyond them: all of us imitate them too well in their ſin, but not in being aſhamed when we ſin.</p>

gave evidences againſt them. We tranſgreſs all Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and one and the ſame Commandement over and over, God onely knows how often; yet are not dejected, are not confounded, but bear out ſail, as if there were no danger: Though <hi>every thing which God in his written Law hath prohibited, is a branch of the forbidden tree.</hi> He hath as peremptorily forbidden all <hi>To have any Gods but Him; to worſhip any graven Image; to take his Name in vain,</hi> as he did our firſt Parents to taſte of the <hi>Tree of good and evil:</hi> Yet even ſuch as would be held the only true Catholiques, <hi>Worſhip Images:</hi> and ſuch again as would be accounted the pure Worſhippers of God in truth and ſpirit, worſhip their own <hi>Imaginations;</hi> and transform the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable nature of the Deitie, into unfit ſimilitudes. Little Children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us are mightie Swearers; and nothing more common in publique or private, then to take Gods holy Name in vain, to abuſe it more groſly then the Jew or Heathen could, who knew not God incarnate. And all this they do without any ſign of ſhame. Women rail upon, revile and curſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the open ſtreets, until their faces grow red indeed, but with a redneſs which betokens no ſhame, which bears no tincture of bluſh, but rather of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and malice boyling in the heart, or of heat in their tongue, ſet on fire by Hell. But theſe for the moſt part are of the meaner and baſer ſort. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there be, as far tranſported with miſ-guided <hi>Zeal</hi> from that modeſtie which becomes their Sex; and this <hi>Zeal</hi> they offer up as ſtrange fire unto God without bluſhing, taking the Prieſts office upon them; to be more then Teachers, cenſurers of their Teachers: ſwift to hear any doctrine that ſhall contradict the publique voice of the Church, alwayes liſtening after the whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings of ſuch private Spirits, as invert the <hi>Tenor</hi> of the Goſpel, no leſs then the old Serpent did the firſt Commandement which God gave unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

For God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes ſhall be opened: and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> A plauſible Comment to her which was now giving the raines to her longing appetite. As plauſible a doctrine it is to many of her Daughters to meddle with the marks of Election and Reprobation, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets which God hath reſerved unto himſelf.

And ſeeing better cannot be expected, it were well if we could as truly imitate them, in being aſhamed of the evil which we have done. They no ſooner knew that they were naked, but they ſought a covering for their nakedneſs of fig-leaves: but this would not ſerve: <hi>For when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden: they hid themſelves from his preſence amongſt the trees.</hi> All of us have an experimental pledge of this which <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates concerning them in our ſelves, unleſs we choke or ſtifle the inſtinct of corrupted nature, by long cuſtom or continuance in ſin. That our conſciences do accuſe us; that the ſight of men whom we know or ſuſpect to be conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of our miſ-doings deject us; both theſe argue, that we muſt appear before a Judge, even before that Judge from whoſe preſence our firſt Parents hid themſelves; at whoſe appearance we ſhall be confounded, if we come before him polluted with ſuch blots and ſtains as our ſouls are aſhamed ſinful men (ſuch as our ſelves are) ſhould look upon. For even that redneſs or bluſhing which appears in mens faces upon conſciouſneſs of their infirmities or miſdeeds, is but a mask which our ſouls do naturally put before them, as being afraid leſt others ſhould ſee the ſtain or blemiſh of ſin.</p>
               <p>As our firſt Parents ſought to hide themſelves from God after they had tranſgreſſed his Commandements: So Offenders hide themſelves from his Deputies or Vicegerents on earth, not only for fear of puniſhment, but for ſhame. <q>And if we ſhould give you the real or phyſical Definition of ſhame, It is no other then the ſtriving of Nature to hide the ſtain of our ſouls by ſending out blood into the face or viſage.</q> And men do but ſecond this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate <note place="margin">☜</note> of Nature, when they put their hands or other covering before their faces. So <hi>Diſarius</hi> one of the Diſcourſers in <hi>Macrobius (Saturn. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.) ſaith: <hi>Natura pudore tacta ſanguinem ante ſe pro velamento ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus both corrupted nature, and we our ſelves ſeek to hide our ſouls from the view of others, albeit we cannot diſcern the inward ſtain or filth of ſin, but are rather in love with her painted pleaſures: But when he ſhall appear, that knew no ſin in himſelf, and yet knows all the ſecrets of mans heart: it is no vail of fleſh, no die of nature, no covering of the viſage with bloud, that will avail ſuch as continue to do thoſe things whereof they are or ought to be aſhamed, or which they are afraid that others ſhould ſee or know. They ſhall then deſire the Hils for a vail, and the Rocks and Mountains for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to their ſhame; but in vain, for perpetual darkneſs ſhall be their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and their preſent ſhame and confuſion of face ſhall then appear to be the harbinger or fore-runner of death.</p>

                  <q>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed? &amp;c.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <argument>
                  <p>We are many wayes ingaged to ſerve God rather then to ſerve ſin, though ſin could afford us as much fruit and reward as God doth. But there is no proportion, no ground of Compariſon betwixt the fruits of ſin and the Gift of God. The Caſe ſtated betwixt the voluptuous ſenſual life and the life truly Chriſtian. Satans method; And Gods method. A Complaint of the neglect of Grace.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe Scope of our Apoſtles whole diſcourſe in this Chapter is to deter us from the ſervice of ſin; and by the help of Super-abounding Grace, and Hope of an exceeding great Reward, both to encourage and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our beſt Endeavors unto the ſervice of God. His Motion or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was reaſonable, albeit ſin (or he that is the Author of ſin) were able to afford us as much fruit, or as full a recompence, as the ſervice of God doth.</p>
               <p>There is no man amongſt us of this Church, I preſume, but doth abhor the Hereſie of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> which was in part this, <hi>that we were beholding to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God for our bodies, then unto Him which made our ſouls.</hi> Yet if their abominable doctrine were (for diſputation ſake) ſuppoſed as <hi>true:</hi> We could not be by any right ſo ingaged unto the ſervice of this imaginary god, as unto the ſervice of the <hi>True God,</hi> which made our ſouls, and doth purifie them by his Word and Sacraments. For we are not debters to the fleſh, but unto the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh we are. Debtors indeed unto the only God which made both our bodies, and ſouls, and ſpirits: He may challenge our ſervice by double right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> by the right of Creation; which we had ſhamefully violated by ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enating <note place="margin">Our ſervice is due to God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</note> our Allegeance unto his Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> by right of Redemption; for he that made us all, hath redeemed us all; and if we continue ſervants unto ſin, we do not only violate that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient or former <hi>Bond</hi> which we owed unto him by right of Creation, but that <hi>ſecond Bond,</hi> whereby we ſtand bound unto him by right of redemption. And tranſgreſſors we ſhould be, and moſt unthankful wretches, if we did not cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſincerely betake our ſelves unto his ſervice, albeit the reward or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, which he hath promiſed and will perform, were but equal to the fruits or pleaſures of ſin.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, that ſo far they are from all equalitie, that there is <hi>No Proportion</hi> between them. <hi>The wages of ſin, are leſſe then nothing, compared to the reward of righteouſneſſe, which is more then all things elſe that can befal us.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> For not to <hi>Be</hi> at all, never to have had any <hi>Being,</hi> were better then to ſuffer the death here meant: So that death and life, eſpecially everlaſting death and everlaſting life, cannot come into any Ballance. That which is worſe then
<pb n="3485" facs="tcp:32220:101"/>
                  <hi>nothing,</hi> or not Being (ſo is everlaſting death) cannot be compared with any thing that is Good, much leſs with the perfection of goodneſs (ſuch is everlaſting life) which containeth all goodneſs, whereof we can imagine our nature to be capable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The only Compariſon then muſt be, between the ſervice of ſin and the ſervice of righteouſneſs, in reſpect of our preſent eſtate, or during the time of <note place="margin">The ſervice of ſin and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in regard of this preſent Life.</note> this mortal life. And ſo (if you mark it) our Apoſtle hath <hi>Two Motives</hi> to withdraw us from the ſervice of ſin; and <hi>Two</hi> to draw us to the ſervice of righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt Motive</hi> to withdraw us from the ſervice of ſin, is, that it is <hi>fruitleſs</hi> and <hi>ſhameful</hi> for the preſent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt Motive</hi> again to ſway us unto the ſervice of righteouſneſs, is the <hi>preſent fruit</hi> which we have unto Holineſs, and between <hi>theſe two</hi> there may be ſome Compariſon, if we ſequeſter them from the other <hi>two,</hi> to wit, from life and death everlaſting.</p>
               <p>To ſequeſter the ſervice of righteouſneſs altogether from the hope of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; or the ſervice of ſin altogether from the fear of everlaſting death, is a thing, if not impoſſible, yet not warrantable, as was ſhewed before in the tenth Chapter: For thoſe things which God hath conjoyned man may not ſever. Yet we may ſo far ſever them, as God permitted them to be ſevered in the wiſer Heathen. The very Heathens felt a kind of Compunction or ſting of conſcience upon the commiſſion of groſſers ſins, which did ſuggeſt a <note place="margin">See <hi>Chapter</hi> the tenth.</note> kind of tacit fear, but of what evil to come they expreſly knew not. They had again a kind of joy, or Grateful Teſtimonie, or congratulation of ſpirit or conſcience upon the practiſe of things honeſt and comely: And this joy did kindle a ſecret hope or incouragement to go forwards in thoſe courſes; but it burſt not out into a flame, it wanted the light or guidance of divine truth. For both this <hi>fear</hi> and this <hi>hope</hi> they had without any expreſs <hi>hope</hi> of everlaſting life, or expreſs <hi>fear</hi> of everlaſting death. However the wiſer or more moderate ſort of them did prefer the practiſe of vertue or ſuch pietie as they knew before the wonted pleaſures of this life.</p>
               <p>Yet this their greateſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> did not do, without the Contradiction of ſuch as were given over to bodily pleaſures. And this oppoſition of ſenſual men may ſeem to have ſome Ground of Reaſon, even from the Rule of Faith it ſelf, if we had no more expreſs hopes of everlaſting life, or more diſtinct fear of everlaſting death, then they had.</p>
               <p>For ſhall we not think that the eſtate of <hi>Dives</hi> was much better then the eſtate of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in this life, wherein <hi>Dives</hi> received pleaſure, and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> pain? Now pleaſure is much better then pain; And if ſuch a life as <hi>Dives</hi> here led, afforded pleaſure, how was it <hi>Fruitleſs,</hi> ſpecially in reſpect of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his life, which was full of pain? Indeed in reſpect of a life ſo charged with pain as <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s was, or with ſuch vexations and dangers as the life of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> and other more eminent Saints of God in the primitive Church were: That Saying of our Apoſtle is moſt true; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>If in this life onely we have hope in Chriſt, then are we of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, <hi>That if bodily death might have put an unqueſtionable end to all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies betwixt him and his perſecutors, there had been no gain but loſſe rather in the prolongation of his life.</hi> But when men truly profeſſing <hi>the power of Chriſtianitie</hi> may be devout, be religious, <hi>be obedient</hi> without danger of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, the caſe is altered. So that our <hi>Apoſtles ſaying</hi> doth not concern the peaceable and proſperous eſtate of Chriſtians, but <hi>the iniquitie of thoſe times</hi> and of ſuch Times as thoſe.</p>

But we muſt conſider that there is a great deal of difference between <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting infidelitie,</hi> or expreſs denyall of the ſouls immortalitie or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, and ſuch an implicit or indiſtinct <hi>notion</hi> of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for wel-doing, and puniſhments for ill doings, as the wiſer Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did acknowledge. Such of them as conſtantly acknowledged but thus much, though not without interpoſition of ſome doubting or diſtruſting fits concerning the ſouls imortalitie, without any <hi>notion</hi> at all of the bodies Reſurrection, did fully accord with our Apoſtle in this place. <hi>That the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſin,</hi> or (to ſpeak in their language) <hi>a voluptuous life, was altogether</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The emptineſs and vanitie of ſinful pleaſures.</note> 
                  <hi>Fruitleſs.</hi> So the Roman Orator tels us. <hi>Omnis voluptas pro nihilo putanda eſt, quod cum praeterierit perinde ſit ac ſi nulla fuiſſet. All pleaſure is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted as nothing worth, becauſe when it is once paſt, it is as if it had never been; that is, it leaves no fruit behind it: it is at the beſt but as a bloſſom or bud which withers or falls away before the fruit be ſet: and a bloſſom without hope of fruit is altogether fruitleſs, and of no eſteem.</hi> Thus he ſpake of <hi>Voluptas,</hi> that is, of pleaſure of the body: but he alwayes mainteined the contrary concerning <hi>Gaudium,</hi> which we call the pleaſure or joy of the mind, or the <hi>inward teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of a good Conſcience.</hi> In this Point, the ſame <hi>Roman Orator</hi> (with <hi>Seneca</hi> and divers other Heathen <hi>Poets and Philoſophers)</hi> did accord aſwell with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> as in the other ſentence he did with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to wit, <hi>That a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was a continual Feaſt.</hi> See the tenth Chapter of this Book. And See <hi>Tullie de Finib. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; De Senectute. And his Paradoxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But I know what a more diſſolute Heathen then <hi>Tullie</hi> was; or a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous Chriſtian or carnal Goſpeller would at this day object; that they are acquainted with greater bodily pleaſures then the Heathen <hi>Philoſophers</hi> or preciſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have experience of; And for this reaſon will appeal from us as incompetent Judges. And I confeſſe it is true! A diſſolute or voluptuous man whether Heathen or Chriſtian, oftimes enjoyes for a ſpace, ſome greater pleaſures of the fleſh, then any civil or modeſt man can do. And this was the miſerie or ignorance of the beſt ſort of Heathens (which did excuſe them <hi>a Tanto,</hi> though not <hi>a Toto;</hi> that is, in reſpect of us, not ſimply) in that they did not know or ſuſpect an inviſible Adverſarie which deals with us as a <hi>cunning Quackſalver,</hi> or craftie <hi>Mountebank;</hi> one that ſecretly <note place="margin">☞</note> corrupts our dyet, and by degrees inſenſible brings many diſeaſes upon us, <hi>That he may gain credit or eſteem by giving us ſome preſent eaſe or pleaſant remedie, though never any perfect cure.</hi> And yet the Heathen <hi>Philoſpher</hi> had obſerved, that moſt of thoſe pleaſures of the body or fleſh, by which men are ſpecially drawn from the practiſe of vertue, or moral honeſtie, were uſually appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, to be much greater then they truly were; both, becauſe moſt men look upon their faces or approaches in coming towards them; not upon their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or back parts at their going away: and becauſe, <hi>they are the remedies</hi> or preſent abatements of ſome grievous diſeaſe, which it were much better not to have, then to ſtand in need of any medicine how pleaſant ſoever.</p>
               <p>He that is cured of a deep wound or ſore, feels more eaſe or pleaſure when it growes toward the healing, then he ſhould have done in that part if it had continued whole. Yet who would long for a wound to find ſuch eaſe and contentment?</p>
               <p>He that is ſick of a burning feaver will take more pleaſure, for the time being, in drinking a cup of cold water; then a man in perfect health would do in a draught of the pleaſanteſt wine. Yet who would chuſe to be ſick to enjoy ſuch pleaſure? There is (I take it) no greater pleaſure of any ſenſe then cooling moiſture in the extremitie of thirſt. But it is a greater miſerie
<pb n="3487" facs="tcp:32220:102"/>
to be put unto this need or exigence. So is it with all diſſolute or voluptuous men. Take them for the preſent, as they are overgrown in diſſoluteneſs and intemperancie; and it is a great pleaſure for them to have their deſires ſatisfied: But <hi>it is a kind of Hell in the mean time to be peſtered with ſuch deſires which are alwayes more permanent and more durable then their ſatisfactions, or contentments can be.</hi> Beſides, that the eaſe and remedies which for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they find, do in the iſſue increaſe and malignifie the nature of their diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>And if they had been once acquainted with the true delight and pleaſures of a moderate and ſober life, they would loath their deſires as much as a man that knowes what health is, would diſlike the momentany pleaſures of the ſick.</p>

                  <hi>Canaa in Galilee</hi> did give the Bridegroom, in compariſon of ordinarie Inne-keepers or wine-drawers in his time, may ſerve to ſet forth the difference between the ſervice of righteouſneſs, and the ſervice of ſin: or between the the <hi>contrary Method</hi> which our Lord and maſter, and the prince of this world obſerve in rewarding their followers. <hi>Every one</hi> (ſaith the Governour of the feaſt, <hi>John</hi> 2. 10.) <hi>doth at the beginning ſet forth good wine, and when men have well drunk then that which is worſe.</hi> This is the very picture or image of Satans practiſe: <hi>But thou</hi> (ſaith the ſame Governour of the feaſt unto the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom) <hi>haſt kept the good wine until now;</hi> that is, until the cloſe of the feaſt. And this is the Type or Emblem of our Saviours <hi>Method.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To apply it more plainly. The Divel ſtill labours to glut men in their beſt dayes with the ſweeteſt pleaſures or contentments of the body: and when he <note place="margin">☞</note> hath made them drunk, or brought upon them an unquenchable thirſt or longing after the like, then he vents his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as of Satans malice and miſchief, ſo of his mercy and goodneſs there is no end to ſuch as embrace them, untill they bring us to an endleſs and moſt bleſſed life.</p>
               <p>The beginnings of ſin are alwayes pleaſant, at leaſt, ſin puts us to no pain in producing the habit or cuſtome of it, becauſe it is <hi>implanted in us by</hi>

               <p>This is in effect the very ſame, that <hi>Siracides</hi> ſaith, (perhaps himſelf had experimented) <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>At the firſt wiſdom will walk with a man by crooked wayes, and bring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, untill ſhe may truſt his ſoul, and try him by her Laws.

               </p>
               <p>For planting a firm Reſolution in us to endeavor the performance of thoſe duties, whereto our Apoſtle in this place exhorts us: It is an <hi>Excellent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> which another Heathen <hi>Philoſopher, Muſonius,</hi> a Greek, as I take it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <note place="margin">See <hi>A.

               <p>Now to review honeſt pains or labors paſt, is a thing grateful to our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie; a good fruit in it ſelf of labors paſt, if they were not otherwiſe fruitful. But the regretting remembrance of time miſ-ſpent in the purſuit of fruitleſs or unlawful pleaſures, is irkſome, is tedious, is loathſome, even to corrupted nature. Thus far and further ſome of the Heathens did run par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel with our Apoſtle in this place.

               <p>But why the revelations of Divine Truth are ſo plentiful in this dull, this old and ſleepie age of the world, which will not make right uſe of them, when as they were ſo rare and ſcant in thoſe times and Nations which in all humane probabilitie would have uſed them much better: this is a depth or <hi>Abyſſus</hi> which may not be dived into.

The <hi>Second</hi> is of Creatures indued with ſenſe. The <hi>third</hi> is the <hi>life of man,</hi> who beſides ſenſe, is endued with reaſon. The reaſonable life includes the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as the ſenſitive doth the life vegetable. Whatſoever bodily creature is endowed with reaſon is likewiſe endowed with ſenſe. But many things which are endowed with ſenſe are uncapable of reaſon. And again, what Creature ſoever it be which is partaker of the <hi>life ſenſitive,</hi> is partaker like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> of growth or nouriſhment. But many things which are nouriſhed and grow, as trees, herbs, plants, graſs and corn, are uncapable of the life ſenſitive; and yet even theſe are ſaid to die, as they properly do when their nutriment fails. But albeit the firſt beginning of mans life in the womb be only <hi>vegetative,</hi> not <hi>ſenſible</hi> or <hi>reaſonable,</hi> yet no man dieth according to this kind of death only. For ſuch as fall into an <hi>Atrophie</hi> (which is a kind of death or privation of the nutritive facultie;) yet are they not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as dead ſo long as they have the uſe of any ſenſe, no nor after they be deprived of all outward ſenſes: ſo long as their hearts do move, or their lungs ſend out breath. So that <hi>the bodily death of man includes a privation of ſenſe and motion.</hi> This difference again may be obſerved in the degrees of bodily death.</p>

2. Trees and <hi>vegetables</hi> alwayes die without pain, ſo do not man and beaſt. For that both of them are endowed with ſenſe and motion, both of them are capable of pain. And pain if it be continued and extream drawes ſenſitive death after it. Nor can this death approach or finde entrance into the ſeat of life but by pain. And in as much as this kind of life is ſweet, death which is the deprivation of it, is alwayes unpleaſant and terrible unto man; not only in reſpect of the pain which uſhers it in, but in reſpect of the loſs of vitall ſweetneſs which it brings with it. The pains of dying may be as great in beaſts as in man; ſo is not the loſs of that goodneſs which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in life; for reaſonleſs creatures perceive it not. A memorie they have of pains paſt, a ſenſe or feeling of pains preſent, and a fear of death, when it approacheth. But no fore-thought or reckoning of what followes after death. This is proper to the reaſonable creature. Now this <hi>Fore-thought</hi> of what may follow after, makes death more bitter to man, then it can be to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonleſs creatures. And amongſt men, the more or greater the contentments of life have been, and the better they are provided for the continual ſupply of ſuch contentments, the more grievous is the conceipt or fore-thought of death natural unto them. The ſummons of death are uſually more unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to a man in perfect health, then to a craſed body. So it is to a man of wealth and credit, more then to one of a forlorn eſtate or broken fortunes. So <note place="margin">☜</note> ſaith <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, Chap.</hi> 41. 1. <hi>O death! how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liveth at reſt in his Poſſeſsions? unto the man that hath nothing to vex him, and that hath proſperitie in all things? yea, unto him that is yet able to receive meat?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet is not the loſs of life, of ſenſe, or the foregoing of worldly contentments the <hi>only cauſe</hi> why men naturally fear death. For though it deprive them of all theſe, yet doth not the death of man conſiſt in this deprivation. The body loſeth all theſe by the divorce which death makes betwixt it and the ſoul. But ſeeing the ſubſtance of the ſoul ſtill remains: the greateſt fear which can poſſeſs a natural man, is the future doubtful eſtate of the ſoul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this diſſolution. Many which never hoped or expected any Re-union or ſecond marriage between the ſoul and body, after death had once divorced them, had yet a true <hi>Notion</hi> that the ſoul did not die with the body: and out of this conceipt ſome were more afraid of death then any brutiſh or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonleſs creature can be.</p>
               <p>Some other few became as deſirous of it, as Priſoners, which hope to ſcape, are of a <hi>Gaol deliverie;</hi> and thought it a great freedom (eſpecially in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented <note place="margin">Deſire of death or ſelf <hi>Homicide</hi>
                  </note> melancholy paſſion) to have the keyes of this mortal priſon in their own keeping, to be able to let their ſouls and life out at their pleaſure. But though it be univerſally true, that the corruptible body during the time of this life, is but a walking priſon, or moveable Cage unto the immortal ſoul; yet the ſoul being long accuſtomed to this priſon, doth naturally chuſe to continue in it ſtill, rather then to be uncertain, whither to repair after it go hence.</p>
               <p>That ſome Heathens have taken upon them to let their ſouls out of their bodies before the time appointed by courſe of nature, or doom given upon them by their ſupream Judge: This was but ſuch a deluſion of Sathan, as one man ſomtimes in malice puts upon another. For ſo oftimes a ſecret ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie or falſe friend hath perſwaded others to break the priſon whereto they were upon preſumption rather then on evidence of any <hi>notorious fact</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <note place="margin">☜</note> to make them by this means unqueſtionably lyable unto the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death, which without ſuch an eſcape they might have eſcaped. For
<pb n="3492" facs="tcp:32220:105"/>
any man wittingly and willingly to ſeparate the ſoul and body which God hath joyned, is <hi>A damnable preſumption,</hi> an uſurpation of Gods own office or Authoritie.</p>
               <p>To ſollicit or ſue for a divorce betwixt them is not ſafe for any, ſave only for ſuch as have <hi>Good Aſſurance</hi> or probable hopes, that when they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved they ſhall be with Chriſt. Now the ſouls of ſuch as die in him, have no deſire to return unto the former priſon of the body. But ſuch as have not in this life been eſpouſed unto him, would chuſe rather to remain in, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto, their former priſon, then to be held in cuſtody by their ſpiritual enemies. Their eſtate for the preſent is worſe then the ſufferance of bodily death: being charged, both with perpetual ſufferance, and expectation to ſuffer the ſecond death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And this death differs more from the <hi>Firſt death</hi> then <hi>inter numerandum;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of the ſecond Death wherein it exceeds the Firſt.</note> that is, more then in order of accompt, or rank of place. What then is not the ſecond death a privation of life? Yes; it is all this, and ſomewhat more beſides. Every vice includes a privation of the contrary vertue, and is a great deal worſe then want of vertue. So every ſickneſs includes a privation of ſome branch of health, and is much worſe then a <hi>Neutralitie,</hi> or middle temper (if any ſuch there be) between health and ſickneſs. So doth the <hi>Second death</hi> include an extream contrarietie to life and all the contentments of it. Blindneſs is a meer privation of ſight; and the eye which cannot ſee is dead in reſpect of this branch of life, and this death or deprivation of this ſenſe is only matter of loſſe. The eye or ſubject of ſight (oft-times) after the loſs of ſight, ſuffers no pain; no more doth the ear after it becomes deaf: nor the ſenſe of feeling after it be numm'd. A man ſtricken with the palſie feels no ſmart in that part which it poſſeſſeth. Whileſt any part of our body is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of pain, it is an argument that it is yet alive, not quite dead: And yet is all pain rather a branch of death, then of life. For much better it were to die the firſt death then to live continually in deadly pain. No man but would be willing to looſe a tooth, rather then to have it perpetually tormented with the tooth-ach. Now the <hi>ſecond death</hi> is no other then a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual living unto deadly pain or torture.</p>
               <p>Bodily death, or <hi>not being,</hi> is not ſo much worſe then life natural with all its contentments, as the <hi>ſecond death</hi> is worſe then <hi>the Firſt,</hi> or the bodily pains which can accompany it. The parts or branches of the <hi>firſt death</hi> are altogether as many as the parts of life natural. The ſeat or <hi>ſubject of the ſecond</hi> death is larger. There is no member of the body or facultie of the ſoul, whether ſenſitive or rational, which becomes not the ſeat or ſubject of the ſecond death. <hi>As this death is the wages of ſin, ſo it is for</hi> Extention <hi>commenſurable unto the</hi> body of ſin. Now there is no part or facultie in man which in this life hath been free from ſin: And whatſoever part or facultie hath in this life been polluted with ſin, becomes the ſeat &amp; dwelling place of <hi>the ſecond death:</hi> Whereſoever ſin did enter, it did enter but as an <hi>Harbinger</hi> to take up ſo many <hi>ſeveral Roomes</hi> for that death. Who is he that can ſay, that luſt hath not ſometimes entred in at the eye? that the ſeeds of luſt, of Envy, of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">☞</note> and of other ſins have not taken poſſeſſion of the ear; that his tongue or taſt hath not given entertainment to ryot gluttony and exceſſe in meat and drink? That his ſenſe of ſmell hath not been ſometimes a pander to theſe and the like Exorbitances? And <hi>the other fifth or groſſe ſenſe of Touch is as the common bed of ſin;</hi> for it ſpreads it ſelf throughout all the reſt, and is the foundation of every other external ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To give you then <hi>a true map of the ſecond death,</hi> and more then a Map of it,
<pb n="3493" facs="tcp:32220:105"/>
or of their eſtate that are ſubject unto it, we cannot exhibit. The <hi>Map</hi> with the true <hi>ſcale</hi> for meaſuring the <hi>Region of death</hi> with the miſerable eſtate of its inhabitants, is thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nature</hi> and common <hi>Experience</hi> afford us <hi>Theſe general un-erring Rules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That, <hi>all pain and grief are improved by one of theſe two means; or by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A double Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of pain or torment in the ſecond death.</note> 
                  <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> by enlarging the capacitie of every ſenſe or facultie which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of pain or diſcontent. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by the vehemency or violence of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or agent which makes the impreſſion upon the paſſive ſenſe or capacitie.</p>
               <p>One and the ſame <hi>Agent,</hi> aſwell for qualitie, as for intention of its active force, doth not make the ſame impreſſion upon different ſubjects though both capable of impreſsion. As one and the ſame flame and ſteam of fire hath not one and the ſame effect on iron, ſteel, and wax; though all of them be in the ſame diſtance from it. <hi>Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis:</hi> How powerful ſoever any <hi>Agent</hi> be, the <hi>Patient</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or retein no more of its power then it is capable of. Again; how ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable ſoever the <hi>Patient</hi> be of any violent impreſſion: yet the capacitie of it, is not filled unleſſe the force of the Agent be proportionable unto it. And though it be able to receive never ſo much; yet it is true again, <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet, nec plus dat quam habet:</hi> No creature, no <hi>Agent</hi> whatſoever, can beſtow any greater meaſure whether of good or evil, whether of pain or pleaſure, then is conteined within the ſphere of its activitie.</p>
               <p>From theſe unqueſtionable <hi>Principles</hi> this <hi>Univerſal Concluſion</hi> will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly follow: <hi>That all exceſſe, or full meaſure of pain, of grief, or woe, of every branch of</hi> malum poenae, <hi>muſt amount from the improved capacitie of the ſenſe or facultie, which receives impreſsion, and from the ſtrength and potencie of the Object which makes the impreſsion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. There is no humane body which is not by nature capable of the <hi>Gout;</hi> yet ſuch as are accuſtomed to courſer fare, to moderate dyet, and hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, are leſſe capable of this diſeaſe then ſuch as cheriſh and pamper the ſenſe of taſte and touching. What is the reaſon? Daintineſs of diet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the capacitie of the ſenſe of feeling, and makes it more tender, and ſo more apt to receive the impreſſion of noiſom humours, and the ſame dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or exceſſe of delicate fare, is more apt and forcible to breed plentie of forcible and peircing humours, then courſer fare or moderate dyet is. For the ſame reaſon, he, whoſe ſenſe of ſmelling, or taſt, is by natural diſpoſition of Bodie or by accuſtomance, more ſubtle or accurate, will be more offended with loathſome ſmells and naſtie food, then he which hath the ſame ſenſes, by a natural diſpoſition, more dull, or more diſ-uſed from delicate odours, or daintie meats. And a muſical ear accuſtomed to melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſorts, will be more diſpleaſed with jarring or diſcording ſounds, then he which hath the ſame ſenſe of hearing unpoliſhed by Art, or accuſtomed to ruder noiſes. The more accurate a mans ſight is by natural diſpoſition, or the more inſight a man hath in the Art of limning or painting, or the more accuſtomed he is to view freſh colours and proportions, the more impatient he is to behold unſightly Objects or deformed proſpects. And according to the increaſe of unſightlineſs or uglineſs in the object, his offence, or grief doth ſtill grow and increaſe. The <hi>Rule then is general, That the diſcontent, the grief or pain of every one of the five outward ſenſes, ſtill accrues from the capacitie or aptitude of the ſenſe to receive ingrateful impreſsions: And from the potencie or efficacie of the Agent to make ſuch impreſsions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3494" facs="tcp:32220:106"/>
                  <hi>The ſame Rule</hi> holds as true in our internal faculties or ſenſes. A man by natural diſpoſition of immoderate appetite for meat and drink is far more tormented with the ſame want of them, then a moderate or leſs greedie appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is. And this ſenſe, which is <hi>none of the five,</hi> hath this peculiar propertie, that it is tormented with its own Capacitie, without any agent or object to inflict pain upon it. The meer want of food is more grievous to it, then any poſitive pain that can befal it, by any external Agents.</p>
               <p>To a man (again) of a curious Phanſie or accurate Judgment, an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or ſlovenly diſcourſe, is more unpleaſant, then to an illiterate man; or to one of duller capacitie for wit.</p>
               <p>To an ambitious or popular man, the leaſt touch of diſ-eſteem or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of diſ-reſpect, is more bitter then an open affront or diſgrace unto an honeſt upright heart which looks no way but one, to that which <hi>leads</hi> to truth and honeſtie. And he that labors to improve this appetite of honor or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular eſteem, doth but ſollicit the multiplication of his own woes. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Honor eſt in Honorante,</hi> honor is ſeated in them that do the honor, not in them that are honored; ſeeing popular applauſe depends upon the breath of the multitude; the man that ſets his mind upon it, doth but as one that expoſeth his naked body to the laſh or ſcourge, or at the beſt to others courteſie. A man that much mindeth his gain, and hath his ſenſes exerciſed in cunning bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainings, takes the loſs of opportunitie or fair advantage to increaſe his wealth, more deeply to heart, then another man whoſe mind is weaned from the world doth his very want or penury. So that, though the want or loſs of the one be much greater then the others: yet the Capacitie of his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite or deſire of gain is much leſs, and therefore no way ſo apt to receive the impreſsion of diſcontentment or grief from the ſame occurrences or occaſions which torment the other.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Now to put all theſe together;</hi> Let us ſuppoſe one and the ſame man to be immoderately deſirous of worldly honors and riches: And by this means of an extraordinary Capacitie for receiving all thoſe parts of grief or ſorrow, which can accrue from loſs of goods, from contempt, diſgrace and ſcorn; and yet withall, as capable of, and as much inclined to, all the pleaſures of bodily ſenſes, whereby his Capacitie of pain or torture may be improved to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt. Let us alſo ſuppoſe or imagine the ſame man to be daily expoſed to all the temptations, to all the vexations that his bodily ſenſes or internal faculties are capable of, from the occurrences or impreſſions of objects moſt ingrateful; as to be daily cheated, daily diſgraced, to have his eyes filled with ghaſtly ſights, his ears with hideous noiſes, his ſmell cloyed with loathſome ſavours, and his taſt vexed with bitter and unpleaſant meats, or rather poiſon which cannot be digeſted; and his ſenſe of touch daily infeſted with deadly pain; his appetite of meat and drink daily tormented with hunger and thirſt: <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>And from a man in this woful eſtate and piteous plight, we may take the</hi> ſurface <hi>or firſt dimenſion of the ſecond death,</hi> but not the <hi>Thickneſſe</hi> or <hi>Soliditie</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> we muſt gather thus; <hi>firſt by Negatives.</hi> How capable ſoever a mans bodily ſenſes may be of pain or pleaſure, or his internal faculties of joy or ſorrow: yet it is Generally true in this life; <hi>Vehemens ſenſibile corrumpit ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum:</hi> The vehemencie or exceſſive ſtrength of the Agent or ſenſible Object doth corrupt or dead the ſenſe. Huge noiſes, though in their nature not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous, or for qualitie not diſpleaſing, will breed a deafneſs in the ear. And though light be the moſt grateful object that the eye can behold: yet the too much gazing upon it, or the admiſsion of too much of it into the eye will
<pb n="3495" facs="tcp:32220:106"/>
ſtrike it with blindneſs. Long accuſtomance unto daintie meats doth dull the taſte and take away the appetite. Likewiſe too much cold, or too much heat, doth either diſſolve or benumme the ſenſe of feeling: and a man may looſe not the ſmelling onely, but even the <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Facultie by ſtrong perfumes, much more by loathſome and abominable ſmels. There is not one of the five outward ſenſes, but if its proper object be too violent, or too vehement, may let in death to all the reſt. A man may be killed without a wound; either at the eye, or at the ear; at the noſe, or at the mouth: ſo he may be by the ſenſe of hunger or thirſt, without any weapon or poiſon, only by meer want of food. The <hi>Gangrene</hi> (or other like diſeaſe which works only upon the ſenſe of touch or feeling) brings many to an end without any forraign enemie. Some have died a miſerable death by cloſe impriſonment in a naſtie priſon, without violence to any other ſenſe ſave only to the ſenſe of ſmelling. Many have died of ſurfets, though of delicate, and in their kind, wholſome meats. <hi>Regulus</hi> that famous Romane Senator did die as miſerable a death, as his enemies could deviſe againſt him, without any other inſtrument of crueltie, beſides the force or ſtrength of the moſt grateful object, which the eye can behold; that is, of the ſun: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe ſplendent beams his eyes were expoſed without the mask or ſhelter of his ey lids, which his cruell enemies (for increaſing his pain and lingring torture) had cut off.</p>
               <p>Others again, which wanted no contentment either of the outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſes, have died through meer grief and ſorrow, firſt conceived, either from loſſe of goods or friends; or for fear of diſgrace and ſhame; and ſome through exceſſive and ſuddain joy. So that in this life, it is univerſally true, and undoubtedly experienced in all the bodily ſenſes; and moſt other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul: <hi>Nullum violentum eſt Perpetuum.</hi> There is no grief, no pain or ſorrow, whether inflicted by external Agents; or whether it breeds within us, or be hatched by the reflection of our own thoughts upon others wrongs, or our own overſights or miſdeeds; but if it be violent, or exceſſive, it becomes like a raging flame, which both devours the ſubject whereon it exerciſeth its efficacie, and puts an end to its own <hi>Being,</hi> by deſtroying that fuel which fed it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This then is the propertie of the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> and the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſuch as muſt receive the wages of ſin; That after the Reſurrection <note place="margin">The duration or Eternity of the <hi>ſecond death</hi> and pains of it.</note> of the body; the capacitie, aſwell of the bodily ſenſes, as of other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are ſo far improved, ſo far inlarged; that no extremity of any extern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Agent, no virulency of any diſeaſe which breeds within them, no ſtrength of imagination or Reflection upon what they have in time paſt fooliſhly done, or what they ſuffer for the preſent, or may juſtly fear hereafter, can either diſſolve or weaken their paſſive capacities or ſtrength to indure the like. <hi>Every facultie becomes more durable then an</hi> Anvil <hi>to receive all the blows that can be faſtned upon them,</hi> and all the impreſſions how violent ſoever which in this life would in an inſtant diſſolve or dead them. So that <hi>the ſecond death,</hi> as is ſaid before, is <hi>a life or vivacitie</hi> continually to ſuſtain deadly pains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Dimenſions of this death may be deduced to theſe three heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> to the <hi>intenſiveneſs of the pain or grief,</hi> which is more extream then any man in this life can ſuffer, becauſe the capacities of every ſenſe or paſsive facultie are in a manner infinitely inlarged; and ſo is the ſtrength or violence of external Agents, and <hi>the ſting of conſcience</hi> or perplexed thoughts wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully increaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3496" facs="tcp:32220:107"/>
                  <hi>Secondly, to the duration of all thoſe puniſhments,</hi> for it is a death ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly to the unceſſant perpetuitie</hi> of theſe everlaſting pains; for they are not inflicted by fits, but without all intermiſsion though but for a moment. There is not an ill day and a good, not an ill hour and a good, not an ill minute and a good, not an ill moment and a good, in hell; All times are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly evil; varietie of torments breed no eaſe. Thus much appeared by the <hi>Parable of the rich glutton,</hi> who could not obtain ſo much of <hi>Abraham</hi> as a drop of water to cool his tongue; which if it had been granted could not have effected any intermiſsion or interciſion of pain, nor any abatement, for the preſent, which would not have inraged the flame as much in the next moment. So that ſuch as ſuffer the <hi>ſecond death</hi> know not how to ask any thing for their good, becauſe indeed nothing can do them any good, but all things, even their own wiſhes conſpire unto their harme, and increaſe their wo and miſerie.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Some, taking occaſion from this <hi>Parable</hi> have moved a queſtion, not much neceſſarie; <hi>whether the fire of hell be material fire or no;</hi> that is, ſuch as may palpably or viſibly ſcorch the body, and torment the outward ſenſes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this fire is deſcribed by a flame, as in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the rich glutton; ſometimes by the blackneſs of darkneſs, as in Saint <hi>Jude.</hi> It is not the flame or viſibilitie of this fire which argues it to be material; the flame is leaſt material in our fire. And palpable it may be, though not viſible; But with this queſtion I will not meddle, being impoſsible to be determined without ſight or experience, which God grant we never have. It ſhall ſuffice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in brief to ſhew, how this fire, or rather the pains of the ſecond death are decyphered or diſplayed in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now, As the joyes of Heaven are ſet forth unto us under ſuch <hi>Emblemes</hi> or repreſentations, as are viſible or known unto us; and yet we do not beleive that they are formally or properly ſuch as theſe ſhadows or pictures repreſent, but rather eminently contain the greateſt joyes that by theſe repreſentations we can conceive or imagine: So we are bound to beleive, That the pains of Hell, are at leaſt, either properly and formally ſuch as the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes <note place="margin">See M Mede, on Pro. 21. 16 <hi>of the valley of Rephaim.</hi>
                  </note> them to be, or more extream and violent, then if they were ſuch as the characters which the holy Ghoſt hath put upon them, do without <hi>Metaphor</hi> import or ſignifie.

So much the deſcription of it in holy Scripture doth import.</p>

The ruines of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi> and the dead ſea or brimſtone Lake, wherein, neither fiſh nor other creature liveth, was

Now the very ſteam of ſuch a Lake would ſtifle or torment fleſh and blood to death in a moment; the outward ſenſes are not capable of its firſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p n="9">9.

And this fretting remembrance, and perpetual reflection upon the folly of their former wayes, is, as I take it, <hi>That Worm of Conſcience</hi> that never dies. But of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>The miſerable eſtate of the damned, or ſuch as ſhall ſuffer the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> may be reduced to theſe <hi>two Heads:</hi> to <hi>Puniſhment Eſſential,</hi> or to <hi>Puniſhment Accidental</hi> or concomitant. The <hi>Eſſential Puniſhment</hi> comprehends both <hi>Poena damni,</hi> and <hi>Poena ſenſus:</hi> The poſitive pains of that brimſtone Lake, and the <hi>Worm of Conſcience</hi> which gnaweth upon their ſouls.

               <p>In this life, that <hi>Saying</hi> is generally true:</p>
               <q>Solamen miſeris Socios habuiſſe doloris.</q>
               <p>it is alwayes ſome comfort to have Conſorts in our pain or diſtreſs. But this <hi>Saying</hi> is out of date in the Region of death; the more there be that ſuffer theſe pains, the leſs comfort there is to every one in particular. For there is no concord or conſort, but perpetual diſcord, which is alwayes ſo much greater, by how much the parties diſcording are more in number: And to live in continual diſcord, though with but ſome few, is a kind of Hell on earth. And thus much in brief of the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> wherein it exceeds the <hi>Firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. If any one that ſhall read this ſhould but ſuſpect or fear that God had inevitably ordained him unto this death, or created him to no better end then to the day of wrath: This very cogitation could not but much abate his <note place="margin">☜</note> love towards God, <hi>Whom no man can truly love,</hi> unleſs he be firſt perſwaded, That <hi>God is good and loving, not towards his Elect only, but toward all men, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf in particular.</hi> But this opinion of <hi>Abſolute Reprobation,</hi> or ordination to the day of wrath, I pray may never enter into any mans brains.</p>
               <p>But fleſh and blood, though not polluted with <hi>this Opinion,</hi> will, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and murmur, yet perhaps demur a while upon another Point more que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, to wit; <hi>How it may ſtand with the Juſtice of the moſt righteous Judge</hi>
                  <pb n="3498" facs="tcp:32220:108"/>
                  <hi>to recompence the pleaſures of ſin in this life, which is but ſhort, with ſuch exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and everlaſting torments in the life to come:</hi> Specially ſeeing the pleaſures of ſin are but tranſient, neither enjoyed nor purſued but by interpoſed <hi>Fits,</hi> whereas the torments of that Lake are unceſſantly perpetual, and admit no intermiſsion.</p>
               <p>The uſual <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this <hi>Quaere</hi> is: That every ſin deſerves a puniſhment infinite, as being committed againſt an infinite Majeſtie. But ſeeing this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hath no Ground or warrant from the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> in which neither the <hi>Maxim</hi> it ſelf is expreſly contained, nor can <hi>it</hi> be deduced thence by any good Conſequence; we may examine it by the <hi>Rule of Reaſon.</hi> Now by the <hi>Rule of Reaſon</hi> and proportion, the puniſhment due to offences <hi>as committed against an infinite Majeſtie;</hi> ſhould not be puniſhment <hi>infinite for time</hi> and duration, but <hi>infinite for qualitie</hi> or extremitie of pain whiles it continues. If every minute of ſinful pleaſures in this world ſhould be recompenced with a thouſand years of Hell-pains, this might ſeem rigorous and harſh to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him, that is, as infinite in Goodneſs as in Greatneſs, as full of Mercie as of Majeſtie.

               <p>But wherein doth the equalitie of his wayes or juſtice appear, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenceth the momentany pleaſures of ſin with ſuch unſpeakable everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting torments? It appears in this: <hi>That he ſentenceth no creatures unto ſuch endleſſe pains, but only ſuch as he had first ordained unto an endleſſe life: ſo much</hi>

                  <hi>better at least then this bodily and mortal life, as the ſecond death is worſe then it.</hi> Adam <hi>had an immortal life (as a pledge or earnest of an eternal life) in poſſeſsion; and had not loſt it either for himſelf or us, if he had not wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto the wayes of death, of which the righteous Judge had fore-warned him. Now when life and death are ſo ſet before us, as that</hi> Hold <hi>is given us of life; to recompence the wilful choice of death with death it ſelf, this is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and juſt.</hi> And if the righteous Lord had ſentenced our firſt Parents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>ſecond death</hi> immediately upon their firſt tranſgreſsion, his ſentence had been but juſt and equal; their deſtruction had been from themſelves. Yet, as all this had been no more then juſt, ſo it had been leſs then juſtice modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or rather over-ruled by mercie. Now inſtead of executing juſtice upon our firſt Parents, the righteous Lord did immediately promiſe a gratious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: and as one of the <hi>Antients</hi> ſaid, <hi>Foelix peccatum quod talem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruit Redemptorem,</hi> it was a happy ſin which gave occaſion of the promiſe of ſuch a Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But did this extraordinary mercy promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi> extend it ſelf <hi>to all?</hi> or to <hi>Adam only?</hi> or to <hi>ſome few</hi> that ſhould proceed from him?

                  <hi>to Adam</hi> and <hi>to all</hi> that came after him. But how the Nations whom God as yet hath not called unto the light of his Goſpel, or whoſe fore-elders he did not call unto the knowledge of his Laws given unto Iſrael; how either Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Children came to forſake the mercies wherein the whole humane nature in our firſt Parents was intereſted, is, <hi>A Secret known to God,</hi> and not fit to be diſputed in particular. This we are ſure of in the <hi>General,</hi> That God did not forſake them, till they had forſaken their own mercies. But for our ſelves; All of us have been by Baptiſm re-ordained unto a better eſtate then <hi>Adam</hi> loſt: Now, if upon our firſt, ſecond, third, or fourth open breach or wilful contempt of our <hi>Vow in Baptiſm,</hi> the Lord had ſentenced us unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting death, or given Satan a Commiſsion or warrant to pay us the

wages of ſin, this had been but juſt and right; <hi>his wayes</hi> in this, <hi>had been equal,</hi> becauſe <hi>our wayes were ſo unequal.</hi> But now he hath ſo long time ſpared us, and given us ſo large a time of repentance, ſeeking to win us unto his love by many bleſſings and favours beſtowed upon us: This (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) is the riches of his bountie; certainly exceeding great mercy, much greater then juſtice; even mercy triumphing againſt judgment. Now if after all this, we ſhall continue to provoke him, and defer our repentance, <hi>turning his Grace into wantonneſs,</hi> making the plentifulneſs of his word the nurſe and fuel of <hi>Schiſm and faction,</hi> no judgement can be too great, no pain too grievous, either for <hi>Qualitie</hi> or for <hi>Continuance.</hi>

               <p>A true Scale or ſcantling of theſe torments we may take from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how apt we are to grieve at our extraordinarie folly or <hi>Retchleſneſs</hi> in this life; whether that have turned to the prejudice of our temporal eſtate, of our health, or bodily life, of our credit or good name. There is not a man on earth but if he would enter into his own heart, might find that he had many times committed greater folly then <hi>Eſau</hi> did, when he ſold his Birth-right for a meſſe of pottage. He ſet his Birth-right (that is his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the <hi>Land of Canaan)</hi> on ſale, without the hazard of that inheritance which God had elſwhere provided for him; for he became Lord of <hi>Mount Seir.</hi> He did not contract for his own impriſonment or captivitie: but we daily ſet Heaven to ſale, and hazard our everlaſting excluſion from Gods preſence, for toyes leſs worth, at leaſt leſs neceſſarie for us, then bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meat was for <hi>Eſau</hi> in his hunger. And yet by ſuch fooliſh bargains we enter a Covenant with death, and contract, (though not expresſly, yet implicitely) for an everlaſting inheritance in Hell. Now unto ſuch as thus live and die without repentance, the moſt cruell torments that can be imagined, cannot be ſo grievous, as the <hi>continual cogitation,</hi> how they did bind themſelves (without any neceſſitie laid upon them) to receive the wages of ſin, by receiving ſuch baſe earneſt as in this life was given them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. A more exact Scale of the reward for this their folly; we have in <hi>Two</hi> Fictions of the Heathen, The one is <hi>That of Siſyphus</hi> his unceſſant la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>in rolling a huge ſtone,</hi> which ſtill turns upon him with greater force. The other is of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> whoſe Liver (as they imagined) was continually gnawen upon by a <hi>vultur</hi> or <hi>Cormorant</hi> without waſting the ſubſtance of it, or deading its capacitie of pain. The <hi>continuall reflection,</hi> of ſuch as periſh, upon their former folly, is as the rolling of <hi>Siſyphus's</hi> ſtone, a grievous labour, a perpetual torment, ſtill reſumed by them, but ſtill more and more in vain; for no ſorrow bringeth forth repentance there. And every

ſuch <hi>Reflection</hi> or Revolution of their thoughts upon their former wayes, is <hi>The gnawing of the worm of Conſcience,</hi> more grievous by much unto their ſouls, then if a vultur ſhould ſo continually gnaw their hearts.</p>

But this Hereſie hath been long buried in the Church; and his ſin be upon him that ſhall ſeek to revive it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Method</hi> then which we mean to obſerve is this:</p>
               <p>Firſt to ſet forth the <hi>excellencie of everlaſting life</hi> in reſpect of this life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Secondly to unfold the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> why neither the hope of everlaſting life, nor the fear of an endleſs miſerable death do ſway ſo much with moſt Chriſtians, as in reaſon they ought, either for deterring them from the fruitleſs ſervice of ſin, or for incouraging them to proceed in holy and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſes, whoſe end is everlaſting life. In this later we ſhall take occaſion
<pb n="3501" facs="tcp:32220:109"/>
to unfold the <hi>Fallacies</hi> or <hi>Sophiſms</hi> which Satan in his temptations puts upon us, with ſome brief rules or directions how to avoid them. A work queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of much uſe and fruit, though handled by a few, either ſo ſeriouſly or ſo largely as the matter requires.</p>
               <p>In comparing this life with the life to come, we are <hi>in the firſt place</hi> to ſet forth the <hi>different Tenures</hi> of them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to compare the <hi>ſeveral joys</hi> or contentments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This preſent life even at the beſt is in compariſon but a kind of death.</hi> For as the Heathen <hi>Philoſopher</hi> had obſerved, it is alwayes <hi>in fluxu,</hi> like a ſtream or current, it runs as faſt from us as it comes unto us. <hi>That part</hi> of our life which is paſt (ſaith <hi>Seneca)</hi> is, as it were, reſigned up to death; <hi>That part</hi> which is yet to come, is not yet ours, nor can we make any ſure reckoning of it. <hi>That part</hi> which we account as preſent, is equally divided between death and us: Not unconſonantly to that of <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 103. 15. <hi>The dayes of man are but as graſſe; He flouriſheth as a Flour of the Field. As ſoon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone, &amp;c.</hi> Or to that of <hi>Job; Man that is born of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is of few dayes and full of trouble: he cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down, he fleeth alſo as a ſhadow and continueth not.</hi> The Addition or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon this, in our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> is, <hi>That in the midſt of life we be in death;</hi> that is, we die as faſt as we live. The firſt part of our life is the beginning of our death; and death it ſelf differs from life, but as the <hi>Point</hi> doth from the <hi>Line</hi> which it terminates, or as the line doth from the ſurface, or the ſurface from the body whoſe ſurface it is. <hi>Mors ultima line a rerum eſt.</hi> The whole courſe of our life is full of interpunctions, or <hi>Commaes;</hi> death is but the <hi>Period</hi> or full point.</p>
               <p>Take it at the very beſt, it is in reſpect of <hi>true life</hi> or <hi>ſtedfaſt Being,</hi> but as the Reflex or Image of a ſtar in a flowing ſtream. The ſeat or ſubject of life doth not continue the ſame it was, no not for a moment; it is but one by continuation, or freſh ſupply of the like; As an Army is ſaid to be the ſame which conſiſts of the like number of men, though moſt of the Commanders <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coel Rodigin.</hi> lib. 8. cap. 2. &amp; lib. 25. cap. 1</note> and Souldiers of the firſt <hi>levie</hi> be ſlain. So <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> had a Legion which they called <hi>Immortal;</hi> becauſe it was continually ſupplied with the like number of new Souldiers, when the old ones failed. For the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſome have compared the life of man unto a Lamp, which burneth ſo long as it hath ſupply of oyl, but is preſently extinguiſhed when the oyl doth fail. And indeed as the oyl and light is to the Lamp, wherein the one is contained, the other ſhineth; ſo is the natural heat and moiſture unto the ſoul, eſpecially as to life ſenſitive. But when this corruptible ſhall have put on incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>our ſouls ſhall then be in our glorified bodies, as light is in the ſtars, in their proper ſphere.</hi> Our life ſhall be one and the ſame, not by continuation or ſucceſſion of bodily parts. So as this firſt life, and that other life which we expect, differ <hi>for their Tenure and manner,</hi> as the repreſentation or figure of the Sun in the water, and the Sun in its ſphere. The <hi>Tenure</hi> of the one is flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and tranſitory, The <hi>Tenure</hi> of the other is ſolid and permanent. And proportionable to this difference of their <hi>Tenures</hi> or durations, are the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent joyes or contentments. If all the poſſible contentments in this life (ſuppoſe they were far more in number then they are) were put together, they could not equalize the Contentments of one minute in the life to come. <note place="margin">The unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our deſires in the Contentments of this preſent life.</note>

               <p n="3">3. Our deſires in this life are vaſt, and our capacities to enjoy the good of what we deſire but narrow and ſlender. They conſort no better than a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit gluttons eye</hi> or appetite with his digeſtive facultie. Now it is a miſerie
<pb n="3502" facs="tcp:32220:110"/>
to have vaſt or ſtrong deſires, and not to be able to give them ſatisfaction; moſt miſerable to take thoſe courſes which exclude them from poſſibilitie of ſatisfaction. Hence an Heathen <hi>Philoſopher</hi> took the want or <hi>Emptineſſe of this miſerie to be the compleat Sphere of true happineſſe:</hi> and out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit defined a happy man, briefly this: <hi>Beatus eſt qui vivit ut vult:</hi> He is happy or bleſſed which hath all the contentments that he deſires or wiſhes. But, <hi>St. Auſtine</hi> tells us that another Heathen (whom he names not, but whoſe ſaying he often applauds) corrected this <hi>Definition</hi> thus; <hi>Beatus eſt qui vivit ut vult, modo nihil velit quod non debet:</hi> He is a happy man that <note place="margin">See Book 10. Chap. 17.</note> hath all that he deſireth; ſo he deſire nothing but what he ought to deſire. And certain it is, that the former <hi>Definition</hi> without this Correction, comes far ſhort of that true happineſs, which is contained in everlaſting life, or which all men <hi>by nature confuſedly deſire.</hi> For a man in this life may have every thing which in this life his heart deſires, and yet not have <hi>his hearts deſire.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is True Happineſs.</note> 
                  <hi>This</hi> no man can have in this life: nor doth the meer natural man find the way or entrance to it. See <hi>Chriſts</hi> Anſwer to <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples. pag. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> had tried as great varietie of particular contentments as any man living can project unto himſelf: and yet after long experience of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that he could propoſe unto himſelf, gives up this general verdict, <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of vanities, all is vanity, and vexation of mind.</hi> Yet is this vanitie ſeated in the unſetled and fluctuant deſires of man; not in the things themſelves which he deſires; for theſe have their right Uſe, ſo they be referred to their proper End, which is no other then true happineſs; and no man can have <hi>his hearts deſire</hi> until his heart do pitch and ſettle on this, as its Center.</p>
               <p>Hence ſome would Define True happineſs to be <hi>Plenitudo deſideriorum:</hi> the full ſatisfaction of our deſires. This all ſeek after without ceſſation; and ſome print, ſome <hi>Sent</hi> or relliſh of it, we find in moſt deſires of it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what there is in the right uſe of every Creature, which would lead us the right way unto it, did we not run <hi>Counter,</hi> ſtriving to make up a full meaſure of joy by the abundant fruition of theſe materials wherein we delight. Whereas the delight and contentment which we find in any Creatures ſhould turn our thoughts from them unto the inexhauſtible fountain whence all the goodneſs that we find in them or in our ſelves, is derived. The neerer we draw to him, the neerer we are to true happineſs: truly happy we cannot be until we enjoy his preſence. <hi>Irrequietum eſt cor noſtrum ad te Domine, donec qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcat in te.</hi> Our hearts are reſtleſs in the purſuit of happineſs, until they reſt in thee, O Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The firſt ſtep to happineſs which we can make, is, to be perſwaded, <hi>That true happineſſe cannot in this life be obtained.</hi> Our <hi>Senſes</hi> are uncapable of the <hi>Accidental joyes</hi> or <hi>concomitant glory</hi> which attend this happineſs. And our Reaſonable Soul, how magnificently ſoever <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſpeak of its nature, is more uncapable of <hi>Eſſential joy</hi> and happineſs; That conſiſts <hi>in the Fruition or enjoyment of the Divine Nature,</hi> which is, Happineſs it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the Contentments of this life will ſerve to no other uſe then to be as a</hi> Foyl <hi>to ſet forth the happineſſe of the life to come.</hi> All the Contentments poſſible of this life are entertained either by our <hi>bodily Senſes,</hi> or by <hi>the internal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of our Souls.</hi> Now by the diſcovery of the imperfections of ſuch Contentments, we may aſcend by degrees to ſome competent Scale or view for diſcovering the perfection of Joyes in the Life to come.</p>
               <p>The imperfection of all Contentments incident to this life, diſcovers it ſelf theſe <hi>Two Wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3503" facs="tcp:32220:110"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſeveral capacities are too narrow and feeble in themſelves to give entertainment to any portion of ſincere and true joy: the very beſt Contentments, which here they find in any Object, are mingled with dregs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſatisfying of one capacitie defrauds another of that meaſure of contentment whereof in this life it was otherwayes capable. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the ſatisfying of the baſer facultie, or meaneſt capacitie doth deprive the more noble facultie of its due. Men given to their bellies, or ſolicitous in purveying for the groſſer ſenſes of taſte or touch, defraud the ſenſe of ſight which is the gate of knowledge, and the ear which is the ſenſe of diſcipline, of their beſt Contentments. For as the old ſaying is, <hi>Venter non habet aures: the Belly hath no ears.</hi> And too much inſight in the means which procure bodily pleaſures doth blind or darken the <hi>Common ſenſe.</hi> Others not ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to feed the belly with meat, as the ear with pleaſant ſounds, or the eye with delightful ſpectacles; do by both means rob the reaſonable ſoul of her beſt ſolace, and as it were <hi>block up theſe ports</hi> and havens, by which proviſion ſhould come into her.</p>
               <p>Every handy-craft or art of husbandry requires an ordinary capacitie, not of the Common ſenſe only, but of the underſtanding. And yet ſuch as have their minds exerciſed in theſe and the like imployments, are thereby diſ-ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for bearing Rule or Government over more civil and ingenuous men; as may be collected from the wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach, Ecclus.</hi> 38. from the 25. to the 33. Even amongſt the capacities or faculties of the reaſonable ſoul there is not that harmony or concord which were requiſite for her better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Some men in a manner freed from the ſervitude of their outward ſenſes, and able to command their ſervice for contemplation; by too much contemplating upon one ſort of objects, make themſelves uncapable of reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that delight, which other objects would more plentifully afford to theſe Contemplators. Some by ſtudying the Mathematicks too much do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num their apprehenſive faculties or capacities of prudence or civil know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Others whiles they ſeek to give too much ſatisfaction to their deſires or capacities of civil wiſdom, or <hi>humane Prudence,</hi> do infeeble their capacities and ſtarve their deſires of <hi>divine Myſteries</hi> or ſpiritual underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <q>Quite contrary it is in the life to come.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Capacitie of every ſenſe or facultie is improved to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; <note place="margin">The Full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all ſenſes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the Life to come.</note> and no object ſhall intrude or offer it ſelf, but ſuch as are able to give, ſeverally, full Contentment without ſatietie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Harmony or Conſent between the ſeveral Capacities and deſires of every Senſe and Facultie is moſt exact: the ſatisfying of one doth no way prejudice, but rather further another. Every one is apt to bear its part for making up of that full harmony which is required to true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>And, For thoſe groſſer Senſes of <hi>Touch and Taſte</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith the Appetite of meat and drink: All the pleaſures in this life wherewith that are commonly overtaken are (as we ſaid before) medicines of diſeaſes, <hi>rather</hi> than any true Contentments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt degree or ſtep to happineſs, is, To be freed from thoſe diſeaſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they now are pestered.</hi> For though it be a miſerie for a man to want food when he is an hungry, or drink when he is thirſtie, or rayment when he is cold, or needs it for ornament; yet we all conceive it to be a far greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to enjoy continual health and livelineſs, without either hunger or thirſt,
<pb n="3504" facs="tcp:32220:111"/>
or to have perfect comelineſs without clothing or rayment. And for this reaſon that branch of happineſs, which conſiſts in ſatisfying the Capacities of <hi>theſe Senſes,</hi> is in Scripture deſcribed by <hi>Negatives:</hi> As <hi>there ſhall be no hunger there, no thirſt, no greif, no pain.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>Symptomes</hi> of thoſe <hi>groſſer Senſes</hi> in this life, which in the life to come ſhall not enjoy the pleaſures or Contentments which are contrary to theſe annoyances (as we ſay) in <hi>kind,</hi> but <hi>by a happy Exchange:</hi> by ſuch an exchange, as he that turns lead into ſilver, doth forego a great deal of droſs or baſer metal, but gains that which contains the full value of it in a ſmall waight or compaſs.</p>
               <p>Of all and every one of the bodily Contentments we can poſſibly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, the very immortalitie of glorified Bodies, is for qualitie, more then the <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> or Extraction. It containeth health and chearfulneſs of Spirit, with all the pleaſures that accompany them (as we ſay) <hi>Eminenter;</hi> that is, <hi>As one pound waight of Gold fully contains in its worth many hundreds of lead; ſo one Moment of immortalitie, the leaſt waight of glory we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, is worth a full Age of all the health and happineſſe, that can be had on earth.</hi> Inſtead of material food which periſheth with the uſe, and whoſe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth alwayes breed ſatietie, the appetite of meat and drink ſhall be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſatisfied with the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> which (or rather, the <hi>Emblem</hi> or Type of which) our Firſt Parents were not admitted to touch in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When the <hi>Sadduces</hi> captiouſly demanded, Which of thoſe ſeven bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſhould have that woman to his wife in the world to come, which had been ſucceſſively married to all the ſeven? Our Saviour anſwers; <hi>The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world marry and are given in marriage, but they which ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to obtain that world, and the reſurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; neither can they die any more for they are equal to the Angels.</hi> What then ſhall ſuch as have enjoyed the comfort of wedlock be utterly deprived of that comfort in heaven, which was allotted to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, even in the ſtate of innocencie? They ſhall not have it <hi>in kind;</hi> for ſeeing fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, there ſhall not be there any <hi>Two in one fleſh;</hi> but in lieu of this comfort, ſuch as obſerve the Commandements of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be more neerly eſpouſed and joyned in ſpirit unto <hi>Chriſt. For as man and wife make one body: ſo he that is joyned unto the Lord is one ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. This is the conſummation of <hi>that Great Myſtery</hi> which is here begun on earth, and whereof, the firſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in Paradiſe was but the viſible ſign or ſhadow; This is the very perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all pure and chaſt love.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe other <hi>purer Senſes</hi> of <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi> they ſhall enjoy their former Contentments, both <hi>Eminenter</hi> and <hi>Formaliter,</hi> both <hi>in kind,</hi> and by happy exchange. Though enabled they ſhall be, to ſee far more glorious ſights, and to hear more heavenly ſounds then in this life they could either hear or ſee: Yet ſhall they not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enabled to ſee the ſame ſights or hear the ſame ſounds which ſometimes in this life they did. But theſe they ſhall hear and ſee with infinite more delight and joy, becauſe the Capacitie of theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall be improved as far as life it ſelf is improved, which of mortal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes immortal.</p>
               <p>The light was truly heavenly which did ſhine about <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> and the voice was heavenly which ſpake unto him, as he was journeying towards <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus;</hi> but the light did ſtrike him blind, and the voice aſtoniſhed him. What was the reaſon? Being yet in the fleſh, <hi>his Senſes were not capable</hi> of theſe celeſtial impreſsions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3505" facs="tcp:32220:111"/>
But this you will ſay was a judgement upon Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>yet a Perſecuter:</hi> So was not <hi>Saint Peter</hi> when he ſaw our <hi>Saviours Tranſfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> upon the Mount. This was but a glimpſe of that glory which ſhall be revealed; and yet it ſo overcharged his ſenſes that it put him in a manner beſides himſelf, beſides his wit or underſtanding: for he knew not what he ſaid, when he ſaid; <hi>Let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moſes, and another for Elias.</hi> Only this he was ſure of in the general, <hi>That it was good being there;</hi> or that if he ſhould alwayes have been, as for the preſent he was, he ſhould have been a moſt happy man; ſpecially if his capacitie to receive or entertain what he then heard or ſaw, had been any way propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable unto them. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> likewiſe after his converſion was ſo Rapt in ſpirit with the Celeſtial words which he heard, that it ſeemed he knew not whether <hi>he were in the body, or out of the body</hi> when he heard them; that is, whether he were locally preſent in Paradiſe, whence thoſe words were ſpoken; or whether his ſpirit were Elevated to hear them in ſuch diſtance; whether of the two it was, certainly ſuch words they were that they could not be uttered by him, or be made known unto others. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. And as the <hi>words</hi> were unutterable, ſo the <hi>joyes</hi> which then poſſeſſed him were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſsible by any known ſimilitude or reſemblance. O how great then ſhall thoſe joyes be, when the ſenſe of hearing ſhall be as capable of theſe Celeſtial voyces, as it now is of earthly? when our ſenſe of ſight ſhall be as fitly proportioned to <hi>the ſpectacles of paradiſe,</hi> as it is now unto the ſtars of the firmament? when all our faculties ſhall be as capable of Celeſtial influences, as they are now of ſublunary impreſsions?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Briefly, all the joyes or contentments of <hi>The life to come,</hi> even compleat happineſs it ſelf, may be reduced to theſe <hi>Two;</hi> Firſt to <hi>joy or happineſs Eſſential.</hi> Secondly to <hi>joy or happineſs</hi> concomitant or <hi>Accidental. Of both in their order,</hi> and how they are ſet forth unto us in Scripture. Joy or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Eſſential</hi> conſiſts in the fruition of Gods preſence.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing the Deitie or Divine nature is every where preſent, is it not now preſent with us on earth? ſure it is; but we are far from it. A light or candle may be preſent to a blind man, and yet he as far from enjoying any comfort of its preſence, as if it were put under a buſhel at the <hi>Antipodes. Such is the caſe of all whoſe ſins have made a ſeparation betwixt their God and them;</hi> He is preſent with them, preſent in them, but they are further removed from <hi>the comfort of his preſence</hi> then the <hi>Center</hi> of the earth is from the Higheſt Heavens. The three children were in the fierie furnace, but it made no impreſſion upon them, they felt no ſmart or pain from it, becauſe the heat of it did not <hi>enter into them.</hi> Thus the <hi>Diuine Nature</hi> or eſſence doth incompaſs all, good and bad, more truly then the furnace did their bodies. yet, he that could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the force or influence of heat from the fire, can likewiſe <hi>withhold the joy</hi> or comfort <hi>of his preſence</hi> from ſuch as love him not. But whereſoever it is, it is the fountain of all joy and happineſs: and ſhall any man be in the fountain of joy and happineſs, and ſhall this fountain be in them, and they not made happy by it? Yes; it is not enough that the fountain of happineſs is in them, they muſt <hi>enter</hi> into the joy of this <hi>Fountain,</hi> before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come happy by it. Now that ſervant which hath once <hi>entred into his maſters joy,</hi> needs no other external contentment or object to ſatisfie the particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of ſenſe, or of any internal faculties. For as the <hi>Being</hi> of every creature is contained in the <hi>Omnipotent</hi> nature, in a more excellent manner then in it ſelf: ſo all the goodneſs or comfortable influence which the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can communicate unto others, is contained in a manner far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="3506" facs="tcp:32220:112"/>
in Gods infinite goodneſs, which is likewiſe more communicative, then any finite goodneſs can be. <hi>This infinite goodneſs dwelleth in Chriſt bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> the ſpirit of all joy and gladneſs is given unto him, but without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. It <hi>pleaſed God, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell;</hi> That as we in this life <hi>from his fulneſs receive grace for grace,</hi> ſo, in the better life or life to come, we ſhould receive <hi>jor for joy;</hi> that is, joy upon joy without ceaſing, without end, even as much as we ſhall be capable of, yea above all that we are able to deſire or conceive.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Our life,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſſ</hi> 3. 3. <hi>is hid with Chriſt in God: when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in Glorie.</hi> All, as many as have their fruit unto Holineſs in this life, have the pledge, the earneſt, or <hi>the Cocket</hi> of the next; But <hi>the life it ſelf,</hi> whereof Holineſs is the pledge or <hi>Cocket, is treaſured up in Chriſt;</hi> and may not be delivered unto us, untill we be changed; untill he appear in glory unchangeable. Whileſt we ſee not him, we ſee not our ſelves, or that life which is treaſured up for us in him.</p>
               <p>This ſight is deferred or reſerved until his appearance; Then this ſight ſhall grow into a perfect taſt. So ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. Now <hi>we ſee through a glaſs;</hi> that is, indiſtinctly, or as we ſee a truth lockt up in a Riddle: <hi>But</hi> then, <hi>When that which is perfect ſhall come,</hi> then <hi>ſhall we ſee face to face. Now</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle of himſelf) <hi>I know in part, but then ſhall I know even as I am known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>John</hi> hath the like myſterie more fully: 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. <hi>beloved, now are we the ſons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like to him, for we ſhall ſee him, as he is.</hi> From all theſe places, but chiefly from the laſt, it is apparent, <hi>That the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our joyes and happineſs is from the viſion or ſight of God in Chriſt.</hi> And hence is this Sight by the learned; and ſuch as have inſight in theſe myſteries, called, <hi>Viſio Beatifica, the Bleſſed viſion,</hi> or the viſion which makes us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: yet happy it makes us, in that, by it, <hi>we become like unto him who is moſt happie,</hi> bleſſed, yea bleſſedneſs it ſelf. This is Saint <hi>Johns</hi> inference, <hi>we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is;</hi> that is, not <hi>through</hi> a glaſs, <hi>but in a glaſs.</hi> Our underſtanding or intellective facultie is as a Glaſs wherein this viſion is made. Now <hi>the underſtanding,</hi> as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> obſerved, <hi>is as a glaſs,</hi> apt to receive the impreſſion of all things intelligible: And (as he imagined) could not be perfected, could never underſtand its own nature aright; untill <hi>it were made all things,</hi> until it had received the images or ſtamps <hi>of all things.</hi> And hence it is, that the more men know, the more they deſire to know. The knowledge of many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars doth but excite our imbred deſire of knowing more; and this deſire can never be ſatisfied, until we know all things. Now to know all things ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, or one after another, is impoſſile. It was the complaint of the father of the Phyſitians, <hi>Ars longa, vita breuis.</hi> The true knowledge of any Art or ſcience, or the ſubject of it, is long in getting, whereas mans <note place="margin">Hippocrates.</note> life is ſhort. There is <hi>no end,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, of writing many books; and much reading</hi> (which is but the hunting after knowledge) <hi>is a wearineſs unto the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. But it being taken as poſſible, or as granted; <hi>That we could come to know the nature of all things</hi> which we ſee, hear, or read of; that we could be as prompt and perfect in this viſible book of nature, as we are in the firſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the eaſieſt book that can be printed for us; that we knew the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Heaven, of earth, and of every creature in them, as diſtinctly as children do one letter from another; and the nature of mixt bodies, as
<pb n="3507" facs="tcp:32220:112"/>
well as they know the juſt value of letters or Syllables put together: <hi>yet could not ſuch knowledge make us happie.</hi> For theſe things how perfectly ſoever known, could not infuſe any new life into us; could not make us partakers of any greater joy or goodneſs then is in themſelves. But in the life of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie our ſouls become living poliſhed glaſſes, wherein the Divine nature, wherein Chriſt God and Man, may be ſeen <hi>as he is:</hi> and he is <hi>truth it ſelf, life it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs it ſelf;</hi> and we are transformed into the ſimilitude of <hi>all theſe</hi> his Attributes.</p>
               <p>There is no picture-maker that can expreſs either the colour or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mans body or countenance ſo exactly as theſe do themſelves in a true glaſs: It receives the true image and ſimilitude of any thing viſible, as more eaſily, ſo more exactly then wax doth the ſtamp and character of the ſeal. For, <hi>That</hi> receives only the <hi>Mathematical Form,</hi> or figure, without the matter or any real qualitie. As a golden ſeal leaves no tincture of gold, nor a ſeal of braſs any propertie of braſs, in the wax, but only the figure; Whereas <hi>a glaſs</hi> beſides the figure or proportion receives the colour, but no other real qualitie.</p>
               <p>But the eye, <hi>which is a kinde of living glaſs,</hi> takes ſome tincture, not of the ſhape or colour only, but of other real qualities or properties of things ſeen. By looking on <hi>Green</hi> or <hi>Azure</hi> the eye is much refreſhed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the natural conſtitution of it reſembles theſe moſt. Yet finds it not the like contentment either in colours too ſad or too bright, becauſe theſe have leſs affinitie with its native temper. Nor is <hi>the effect</hi> or efficacy of colours ſeen, terminated only in the eye, though the eye ſees them; <hi>That</hi> reacheth unto other internal faculties, unto the very <hi>Seat</hi> or <hi>Center</hi> of the Affections. The impreſſion which colors perfectly red (as ſcarlet of the ancient die) make upon the eyes of living creatures which abound in blood, doth ſtir the blood, and inrage their ſpirits to fight, when as otherwiſe they would be quiet. <hi>And to the end they might provoke the Elephants to fight, they ſhewed them the blood of grapes and mulberies.</hi> 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 6. 34. And ſome good <hi>Philoſphers</hi> have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that Bears or others creatures which abound with Melancholick blood, are more inraged at the ſight of colours more dark then ſcarlet, or <note place="margin">See Book. 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9</note> perfect red; So that the eyes of living creatures which ſee things as they are, <hi>not through a glaſs,</hi> but <hi>in themſelves</hi> as <hi>in a perfect glaſs,</hi> are apt to take others impreſſions beſides the figure proportion or colour of thoſe things which they ſtedfaſtly behold.</p>

But as <hi>the firſt Adam was made a living ſoul,</hi> ſo the <hi>ſecond Adam was made a quickning Spirit: A ſpirit of life</hi> to revive the Reliques of Gods image in mens ſouls; And by the reviving of them, to expell or blot out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Satans image in them. All this he doth <hi>in part</hi> even in this life in ſuch as fear and love him. And in <hi>Theſe Two,</hi> to wit, in the <hi>Reviving</hi> of Gods image in us, and in the <hi>Expunction</hi> and wiping out the ſtain of ſin (which is no other then the image of Satan) doth our <hi>Regeneration</hi> conſiſt. And by the <hi>ſpirit of Regeneration</hi> we ſee in part, we know God in part; but <hi>after that which is perfect is come,</hi> that is, when Chriſt ſhall appear in glory, and we ſhall be changed, <hi>Then ſhall that which is imperfect be done away; then ſhall</hi> our ſouls be as a glaſs, clear and poliſhed, apt to receive the image of God wherein we were created in a far better manner then the ſoul of our firſt Progenitor in his integritie was.</p>
               <p n="11">11. We know God by Hear-ſay in this life; we ſee him not: or if we ſee him <hi>in part,</hi> in his word; yet <hi>this</hi> is but like the ſight of things a far off; it makes too little impreſſion upon our ſouls; it works too ſmall alteration in our affections. <hi>Our ſight is not effectual until it grow into a kinde of Taſt. Adam</hi> was indued with life, with knowledge, with righteouſneſs, but his life, his knowledge, and righteouſneſs were changeable. The <hi>life it ſelf,</hi> and the <hi>light of the world</hi> was in the Son of God, <hi>John</hi> 13. <hi>And now dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth bodily in Chriſt,</hi> who is God and man: and when he ſhall appear, the life which is in him ſhall be imprinted on us; we ſhall be partakers of the life which is unchangeable.</p>
               <p>And as is <hi>life</hi> he, ſo is he <hi>light it ſelf,</hi> light unchangeable.</p>
               <p>And when we ſhall ſee him as he is, our knowledge, ſhall from this viſion, be as He is, without poſſibilitie of change, without decay or diminution. God, <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> is Love; and <hi>when we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> we ſhall become like him in <hi>this Attribute</hi> alſo; that is, as his Love to us was ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting without beginning; ſo our love to him ſhall be unceſſant, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without ending. And what expreſſion of true happineſs can be more full, then <hi>to be everlaſtingly beloved of him who is Love it ſelf,</hi> and to love him everlaſtingly?</p>
               <p>The fruition of all things which we deſire, or love, cannot be ſo much as the the fruition of him, who, as <hi>he is all things elſe, ſo is he love it ſelf.</hi> And (as was ſaid before) although we have all things elſe which our hearts deſire, yet till we enjoy his preſence we cannot have <hi>our hearts deſire:</hi> we cannot have the accompliſhment of our love untill we enjoy his preſence who is love it ſelf.

               </p>
               <p>We muſt take notice of our love to God who is inviſible, from the experience of our love unto our brethren whom we have ſeen: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſure our ſelves that we delight in <hi>him,</hi> unleſſe we delight in <hi>his Saints</hi> that are on earth.

               <p n="12">12. Theſe are the <hi>uſual Marks or Tokens</hi> whereby we are taught to know the truth of Our love towards God, and of Our Allegeance to Chriſt.

               <p>The Papiſts will tell you, that <hi>the Communion of Saints</hi> is amongſt them in their Church: So will the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and other <hi>Separatiſts:</hi> So will ſuch as live amongſt us, and yet complain of the burthen of Ceremonies in our Church. And how ſhall men (the unlearned ſpecially) know <hi>which of all theſe,</hi> or whether <hi>any of theſe</hi> are the true <hi>Brethren of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>the Saints</hi> in which we are bound to delight? This, as will be replied, <hi>you may know by their delight in hearing the word;</hi> for <hi>he that loveth God loveth his word;</hi> he that delights in God delighteth in his word. Yea! but many delight in the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward letter of the word only,</hi> or in the word as it is interpreted by Teachers of their own Faction, or after their own Fancie; men, either not able to diſcern the Evidence of truth, or not willing to have it manifeſted unto them. And how then ſhall any man know whether he love the Lord, whether he delight in the Lord, by delighting in any of their Societies, which pretend themſelves to be <hi>Chriſts Brethren,</hi> to be <hi>Gods Saints?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely, <hi>there is a better way then all theſe to delight aright in the Lord,</hi> and to know that we delight in him: and yet a way made known unto us by <hi>Gods Word:</hi> A way, A direct and plain way, which we can not follow but by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely delighting in his Word.</p>
               <p>The Word of God doth tell us, (and all ſorts or Sects of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it) that <hi>God is love,</hi> that <hi>he is righteouſneſſe,</hi> that <hi>he is holineſſe,</hi> that <hi>he is the God of all</hi> peace, that <hi>he is good to all,</hi> that <hi>he is merciful and long-ſuffering.</hi> Now he that in theſe things doth imitate God; he that is charitable and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>to all;</hi> he that is merciful and beneficial <hi>to all,</hi> ſo farre as his means will ſuffer him: he that deals juſtly and truly with his neighbor; he that doth delight in ſo doing, <hi>he doth truly delight in the Lord;</hi> and the Lord in his good time ſhall give him <hi>his hearts deſire.</hi>

               <p>As there is a <hi>ſinceritie of Converſation</hi> required towards men, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there is a <hi>Puritie of heart</hi> and Conſcience towards God; and <hi>he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in this,</hi> or ſeeks after this, <hi>doth delight in the Lord,</hi> and he only ſhall truly know <hi>that he delights in the Lord,</hi> or, <hi>that his hope is ſtedfaſt.</hi> For <hi>every one,</hi> as <hi>Saint John</hi> ſaith, <hi>that hath this hope,</hi> to wit, of ſeeing God as he is, <hi>doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his heart, as he is pure:</hi> And our Saviour ſaith (as a bleſſing to the pure in heart) that <hi>they ſhall ſee God.</hi> They ſhall ſee him in this Life <hi>in his Word,</hi> and in his <hi>works;</hi> and in the life to come they ſhall ſee him <hi>as he is,</hi> and be partakers of everlaſting life, which is the Crown of puritie and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BUt, if in the next life, we enjoy <hi>His Preſence,</hi> who is <hi>Life it ſelf,</hi> who is <hi>Love it ſelf,</hi> who is <hi>All in All,</hi> at whoſe right hand is Fulneſs of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore; What need is there of any Acceſs, of <hi>Accidental</hi> or Concomitant Joyes? It is true! There is <hi>no need</hi> of them, for ſo they ſhould not be <hi>Accidental.</hi> Therefore are they called <hi>Accidental,</hi> becauſe ſuch as enjoy Gods Preſence might be fully happy without them. So God himſelf is moſt happy in himſelf, he is <hi>Happineſſe it ſelf.</hi> Yet even in this, that he is <hi>Goodneſſe it ſelf,</hi> that he is <hi>Happineſſe it ſelf,</hi> he communicates both Goodneſs and Happineſs to his Creatures, ſo far as they are capable of them not by any <note place="margin">Accidental joyes.</note> Neceſſitie, but Freely. And when it is ſaid, <hi>that when we ſhall ſee him as he is, we ſhall be like him,</hi> part of this likeneſs doth herein conſiſt, that we ſhall communicate this Goodneſs and happineſs to others, ſo far as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it. So that the <hi>Accidental</hi> or Concomitant <hi>Joyes</hi> of the life to come (whoſe Eſſence conſiſts in the Fruition of God, as he is Love) although <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-abundant,</hi> yet are they not <hi>ſuperfluous.</hi> There is no waſt, there is nothing poured out from one, which ſhall not be received (in the ſame meaſure or manner) by another.</p>
               <p>But wherein do theſe Concomitant or <hi>Accidental Joyes</hi> conſiſt? Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe <hi>Two Particulars.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Beauteous Place.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the <hi>Glorious Beautie</hi> of the Place, which is called <hi>Sedes Beatorum,</hi> the <hi>Seat or Manſion of the Bleſſed.</hi>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the <hi>Society</hi> or companie of ſuch as are ſo ſeated, and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers <note place="margin">The Holy Companie.</note> of that <hi>Eſſential Bleſſedneſs,</hi> which conſiſts in the ſight and <hi>viſion of God,</hi> as he is <hi>Happineſſe</hi> it ſelf. For <hi>Viſio amati eſt fruitio.</hi> This is that which the Schools call <hi>The Fruition or enjoying of Gods preſence.</hi> Now, that either the <hi>Place</hi> or the <hi>Societie</hi> of Saints and Angels, can add (or conferre any thing) to our happineſs, this proceeds from Gods ſpecial preſence in Both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To begin with <hi>The Place or Seat of the Bleſſed;</hi> How pleaſant ſoever <note place="margin">Firſt in regard of the Place, or Seat of the bleſſed.</note> our <hi>Seat</hi> on earth may be, yet this world it ſelf is but <hi>Vallis lachrymarum,</hi> A Valley of tears, wherein ſome ruful ſpectacles are daily preſented to our eyes; wherein ſome woful news or unpleaſant ſounds poſſeſs our ears. To hear and
<pb n="3511" facs="tcp:32220:114"/>
ſee what we now daily hear and ſee, though we were Spectators only, but no Actors, would abate our Joy, would be an Alloy to our preſent happineſs. Hence it is, that <hi>St. John</hi> deſcribing the <hi>Accidental Joys</hi> of the life to come, ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1. <hi>I ſaw a new heaven and a new earth, for the firſt heaven and the firſt earth were paſſed away, and there was no more Sea.</hi> And again verſe 4. <hi>God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain, for the former things are paſt away.</hi> His meaning is, not only, That no man there ſhall have occaſion to cry; or that no ſorrow or pain ſhall breed there; But that there ſhall be no ſorrow, no cry there, by way of <hi>Sympathie;</hi> that is, no ungrateful ſound or ſpectacle ſhall approach their dwelling in the holy City, which he deſcribes at large in the ſame Chapter, verſe 11. unto the end. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and Form of it you have, verſe 16. <hi>It lyeth four ſquare, the length as large as the breath, twelve thouſand furlongs; and the building of the wall of it was of Jaſper, and the City was pure gold, like unto clear glaſſe.</hi> Verſe 18. &amp;c. Thus he deſcribes <hi>The Beautiful Materials of the Place,</hi> by the moſt glorious and moſt precious materials, which this world affords. And yet that is true of this Deſcription, which the Apoſtle ſaith of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Law; <hi>The gates of pearl,</hi> and <hi>the ſtreets of gold tranſparent as glaſſe,</hi> are no better then <hi>ſhadows of the good things to come,</hi> which are treaſured up in that heavenly Kingdom for all ſuch, as love Chriſt Jeſus, and the glory of his coming.</p>
               <p>Now though it be true, that in Gods houſe there be many Manſions; Yet is not the Beautie or Glorie of them appropriated to one, nor diviſible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome few, but alike Common to all: One hath not the leſs comfort There, becauſe another hath more. Thoſe <hi>Two quarrelling Pronounes, Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> ſhall be excluded thence as common <hi>Barretters.</hi> One cannot ſay <note place="margin">☜</note> to another, <hi>This part of this glorious Kingdom is mine; That is yours;</hi> for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, that ſhall be accompted worthy to be an heir of that Kingdom, ſhall be as Intire an Heir, as if he were ſole Heir. So it is not amongſt the Kings of the earth; the greater Dominions one hath, or the further he extends them, the leſs he leaves unto his neighbors.</p>
               <p>There is ſome ſmall Reſemblance of the Condition <hi>of the Bleſſed Ones</hi> in Heaven, to be found in our Hearing, ſight, and knowledge of things which we have here on earth: A great multitude may hear a ſpeech, and every one hear all. No man hath leſs comfort from the light or heat of the Sun by anothers injoying it (unleſs he purpoſely ſtand between the Sun and him.) No man is prejudiced, but rather furthered by another mans extraordinary knowledge, ſpecially of matters heavenly, and not diviſible into parts. Howbeit here is a vaſt difference, whilſt we live on earth; even when there is no matter of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to any other, but rather of benefit or advantage to many; yet there is matter too much of envy; for that breeds within mans ſelf, it comes not by infection from without. But ſo it is not in the place of bliſſe, in the heavenly City, into which no unclean thing, no unclean thought, ſpecially no envie, no uncharitableneſſe ſhall enter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As is the <hi>Place,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Company or Societie. Every one is Loving, Every one is Lovely,</hi> All be Sons of Peace; their Love and Peace is mutual. <hi>Ye are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In regard of the Company there</note> 
                  <hi>come unto Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and unto the City of the Living God, the heaveniy</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; <hi>and to an innumerable company of Angels. To the general Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt-born, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling,</hi> Heb. 12. 22. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3512" facs="tcp:32220:115"/>
There is no Queſtion (at leaſt there ought none to be) but that the <hi>Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ioy</hi> or bleſſedneſs of the life to come ſhall not be <hi>Arithmetically Equall,</hi> that is, the meaſure of it ſhall not be one and the ſame in all; for every man ſhall be rewarded according to his wayes. The <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> which is <hi>the Gift of God,</hi> is the <hi>Award,</hi> not of <hi>Commutative</hi> Juſtice, nor of <hi>Distributive;</hi> though, if ſo it were, it ſhould be awarded according to <hi>Geometrical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion:</hi> But it is an <hi>Act of mercy</hi> or bountie, and being ſuch, there is no Queſtion, but, <hi>he that loved God more in this world then others, ſhall have a greater proportion in his love.</hi> No Queſtion but he, which hath received a greater <hi>Talent,</hi> and hath imployed it as well or better, then he that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived leſſe; ſhall have a greater reward; And he which hath been more faithful in his Maſters ſervice; or he in whom the Kingdom of Grace hath entred further in this life, ſhall enter further <hi>into his Maſters Ioy,</hi> ſhall partake more fully of the Kingdom of Heaven. And according to the leſſer or greater meaſure of <hi>Eſſential happineſs,</hi> ſhall the meaſure of their expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of joy or thankſgiving be. And yet the Joy, which amounts from their mutual expreſsions, ſhall be equal and the ſame to all. For though every one cannot ſo fully expreſſe his joy or thankſgiving as another doth: yet he that comes ſhort of others in this expreſsion, ſhall joy, even in this, that God is more or better glorified by another, then by himſelf: and ſuch is the diſpoſition of theſe heavenly inhabitants, that, ſo Gods name be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorified by all, they reſpect not by whom it be <hi>comparatively</hi> moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. There are no <hi>Envious Compariſons</hi> there, ſeeing every one of them hath his full portion in that publick and common joy, which amounts from their joynt expreſsions of thankſgiving. The Ditty of their ſong is the ſame, and no man there ſhall be either deaf or ſilent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This <hi>Inequalitie of Eſſential Ioy, and this equalitie of joy Accidental,</hi> cannot (to my apprehenſion) be better repreſented, then by A Chorus, or Quire of voyces well skilled and practiſed to hold perfect conſort. Amongſt a great number thus qualified, it cannot be expected that every one ſhall have either the like clearneſs or ſweetneſs of voyce, or the like command over his voice, that another hath. Nor can he, that hath the beſt natural voyce, or beſt skill in ſinging, impart or communicate either his voyce or skill unto others, which ſing in conſort with him; and yet every one is partaker of the ſweetneſs of anothers voyce as well as of his own. The concent or harmony is alike to all that have muſical ears; And a man, even in this life, is oftimes more delighted to hear another man then himſelf ſing either alone or in conſort: but moſt delight in a full Chorus <hi>A Choir</hi> or conſort. After this manner, the bleſſed Saints and Angels ſhall not impart any part of that <hi>Internal joy</hi> or happineſs, which ariſeth from the <hi>Fruition or viſion of the God of Love,</hi> unto another; nor ſhall he have any need of it, as we ſay, <hi>at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hand:</hi> for every one ſhall have as much of it within himſelf as he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
               <p>But of that <hi>external joy,</hi> which reſults from their joynt conſort in ſinging praiſe and glory unto God, every one ſhall be partaker, and the more they are, the greater ſhall be every ones portion of this delight or joy. And thus much of <hi>life Eternal,</hi> and of the <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> which is contained in it, or is the property of it: whether it be <hi>Bleſſedneſs Eſſential or Concomitant.</hi>
               </p>

                  </note> greateſt grievance, which men thus qualified and affected, in this life ſuffer, is, that they are in a manner trod upon by others, and for the moſt part excluded from rule or Juriſdiction; inferiors to all, ſuperiors to none. And if they be as <hi>poor in wealth,</hi> as <hi>ſpirit,</hi> there is a kind of neceſſity laid upon them for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſuch. For his Obſervation is not yet out of date. <hi>Pauper eris ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſi pauper es Aemilianc, Munera non dantur nunc, niſi divitibus. If a man be once poor, he ſhall be alwayes poor; for no man grows rich by gifts, but he that is able to give.</hi>

               <p>Now to encourage ſuch as already are <hi>poor in ſpirit</hi> to continue this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and to arm their humilitie with conſtancy againſt all the ſecular incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences or grievances, wherewith it is charged; <hi>The Bleſſedneſſe</hi> of the life to come is promiſed to them under the name or Title of a <hi>Kingdom. Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 5. 3. that is, they are neerer to life eternal, to true happineſs and glory, then ambitious or aſpiring minds, which have not a deſire only, but oft-times means and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to attain to honor and dominion over others here on earth. This Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>Poorneſſe in Spirit,</hi> is the firſt degree and ſtep to <hi>Bleſſedneſſe;</hi> And with Reference to this, ſcarcitie of means or external povertie is for ſome men more expedient then wealth; For though many be humbled, which are not humble, yet few are humble which have not been firſt humbled by ſome croſs <note place="margin">☜</note> or affliction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But many are poor in ſpirit, which have no extraordinary occaſion to ſpend their dayes in mourning. Unto ſuch as truly mourn, the very conceit <note place="margin">Second Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> or mention of pomp or jollity is ungrateful. To provoke them to mirth, until <hi>nature have her Forth,</hi> is unſeaſonable, a kind of ſin: To tell them of a Kingdom, were all one as to mock them; yet none there are, who truly mourn, which do not ſeriouſly deſire <hi>Comfort,</hi> though it be but in mourning with them. And for this reaſon it is, that unto ſuch as mourn, our Saviour promiſes the <hi>bleſſedneſſe of the life to come,</hi> not under the ſtyle or title of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but under a title more grateful, and that is, <hi>Comfort.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted;</hi> So they mourn not as thoſe that have no hope, ſo they murmur not, nor repine at Gods providence. As for mourning it ſelf, it is a branch of evil, a kind of puniſhment or chaſtiſement,
<pb n="3514" facs="tcp:32220:116"/>
no way pleaſant for the preſent. Comfort in the Sacred <hi>Dialect,</hi> includes abundance of good things, as appears by <hi>Abrahams</hi> anſwer unto <hi>Dives,</hi> Luke 16. 25. <hi>Son remember, that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things, but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> The very joyes of heaven could not have been ſo ſweet to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> unleſs in this life he had wanted Comfort.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Many again have juſt occaſion to mourn, and whilſt theſe occaſions laſt do not tranſgreſs in the manner of their mourning: they repine not at God; <note place="margin">The third Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to the meek ſpirited ones.</note> are not malicious againſt the men, which find them matter to mourn for: and yet for all this are not <hi>of ſo meek a ſpirit,</hi> as every Good Chriſtian, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or exigences of time require it, ſhould be.</p>

                  <note place="margin">See chapt. 11. §. 7.</note> Now this kind of Temper expoſeth men to many kinds of Inconveniences hard to be digeſted by fleſh and blood.

For, <hi>facies hominis in cauſa propriatan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam facies Leonis.</hi> A mans face or preſence in his own cauſe is as the face of a Lyon.

               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>he that in this Caſe will not vex or moleſt others again, nor himſelf, he is truly meek;</hi> and unto men thus qualified, or to encourage all to be thus quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the <hi>Bleſſedneſſe</hi> of the life to come is promiſed not under the <hi>Title of a Kingdom,</hi> or of <hi>Comfort,</hi> but under the <hi>Title</hi> moſt contrary to the courſe and cuſtom of this world, wherein <hi>Meekneſſe is commonly Accurſed</hi> with loſs of their own poſſeſſion; But, <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>are the meek, for they ſhall inherit or poſſeſſe the earth;</hi> or <hi>the Land: even that good Land,</hi> where there is no <hi>Ejection,</hi> no diſ-inheriting of ſuch as are poſſeſſed of it, and therefore are the meek bleſſed, becauſe Meekneſſe or quietneſſe is the Way or Title to get Poſſeſſion thereof.</p>

Now to diſcern true righteouſneſs from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or to ſever <hi>Christs Cauſe</hi> from our own particular Intereſt or engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a point of extraordinary skill. Whereas it is an eaſie matter to pawn our fame or credit, our very lives in maintenance of that, which we have boldly avouched to be true and juſt. None were more forward to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice themſelves for their Religion, then were the Jews, which yet blaſphemed the name of Chriſt, and the wayes of truth; after they had crucified the Lord of truth and of glory; none more forward then they to raiſe up perſecution againſt the Apoſtles and diſciples in every City; and albeit many of them were put to cruell and ignominious deaths for their ſtiff adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, as they imagined; yet <hi>Martyrs</hi> they were not, becauſe they died not for <hi>Moſes</hi> ſake, nor for his ſake for whom <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote; but for maintenance of their own perverſe opinions and affections: For though they abhorred the Idols of the heathen, yet they committed more abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſacriledge, then the Heathens did; for of all kinds of Idolatry or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious worſhip the moſt untoward and leaſt to be pittied, is, when men are prone to ſacrifice themſelves to their own pride or head-ſtrong ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>

If Satan ſhall tempt us to an immoderate deſire of riches, the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poize to this temptation is likewiſe <hi>two-fold: Firſt,</hi> There is a promiſe of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven, to ſuch as ſeek after it more then earthly treaſure; and this is a treaſure not chargeable with the like carking care in getting it, nor ſubject to the like inconveniences after it be gotten: for, there, <hi>neither ruſt nor moth doth corrupt, nor do theeves break through and ſteal.</hi> Beſides, the heaps of riches even in this life are fruitleſs; for as our Saviour ſaith in another place, though a man have riches in great abundance, yet <hi>his life doth not conſiſt in them.</hi> Ten thouſand talents cannot adde one minute to the length of his dayes; whereas the heavenly treaſures are the crown of life. Or if the hope of theſe heavenly treaſures cannot overſway mens thirſt or longing after earthly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; you may joyn to this, the weight of Saint <hi>James his Wo</hi> againſt this ſin; <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Go to now ye rich men! weep and howl for your miſeries, that ſhall come upon you: your riches are corrupted; and your garments moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten; your gold and ſilver is cankred; and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if this were all, a rich worldling would reply, that he would keep his gold and ſilver from ruſt. This he may do perhaps, whilſt he is alive, but more then he can undertake after it once come unto <hi>Plutus his cuſtody;</hi> Therefore Saint <hi>James,</hi> adds, <hi>the ruſt of it ſhall eat your fleſh as fire:</hi> or, if this be but a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> he ſpeakes no Parables, but plainly, in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>ye have heaped treaſure together for the laſt dayes.

               </p>
               <p n="21">21. Again, if Satan tempt us to do thoſe things, which we ought not to do, <hi>for the favour;</hi> Or to leave thoſe things undone which we ought to do, <hi>for the fear</hi> of great ones; <hi>the ſacred Armorie</hi> affords us weapons ſufficient to repell <hi>Both temptations.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> is that pithy ſentence of Saint <hi>Paul: ye are bought with a price, be not ye the ſervants of men.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> is that of our Saviour, <hi>Fear not them, who after they have killed the body, can do no more: but I will tell you whom ye ſhall fear, one that can deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell fire, yea I ſay unto you, fear him.</hi> Briefly, in all aſſaults, Satan hath only <hi>Weapons Offenſive,</hi> as fiery darts; he hath none <hi>Defenſive:</hi> But <note place="margin">☜</note> if the word of God, as our Apoſtle ſpeakes, dwell plentifully in us, we have both the ſhield and buckler to repell his darts, and the ſword of the ſpirit to chaſe him away: but this word muſt plentifully dwell in us; we muſt entertain it in our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>conſciences,</hi> not only in our lips and tongues; nor let it run out of our mouthes faſter then it comes into our ears.</p>

And unto this two-fold inconvenience he preſcribed this brief Receipt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> That men (in youth eſpecially) ſhould accuſtome themſelves to <hi>abſtinence</hi> and <hi>ſufferance;</hi> to <hi>abſtinence from evil,</hi> and to <hi>ſufferance of evil;</hi> that is, unto abſtinence from unlawful pleaſures, which we call <hi>Malum culpae,</hi> or Evil of Sin; and to endure with patience <hi>malum poenae,</hi> the evil of pain, or of ſome loſs, rather then hazard <hi>The quiet of Conſcience,</hi> by doing that which is evil or unlawful; or by not doing that which is good, ſpecially when we are thereto required.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>brief receipt</hi> or <hi>diet of the Soul,</hi> without ſome other addition, will rather ſerve to <hi>condemn</hi> us Chriſtians, then <hi>enable</hi> us to live a true and Chriſtian life: The <hi>Receipt</hi> though is good in the <hi>General,</hi> but <hi>defective</hi> in theſe <hi>Particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Unleſs he knew more of Gods Will, or of the myſteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, then we know any means by which he could poſſibly know either, being an Heathen; he was ignorant of many evils, from which he was bound to abſtain; and altogether as ignorant what thoſe <hi>good things</hi> were, for whoſe love he was to ſuffer <hi>malum poenae,</hi> the evil of pain, loſs or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, rather then diſclaim them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Albeit he had known what was to be done, what to be left undone; yet being ignorant of this main Article of Chriſtianity, to wit, <hi>of A Life everlaſting,</hi> which is the reward of well-doing, the Crown of Holineſs; and of an <hi>everlaſting Death,</hi> which is the wages of ſin, and iſſue of unlawful pleaſures: His Receipt of <hi>Suſtine &amp; Abſtine</hi> was altogether as fruitleſs and vain, as if a Phyſician ſhould preſcribe a <hi>Doſis</hi> or <hi>Recipe</hi> to his Patient, of ſuch Simples or compounded Medicines, as cannot be had in this part of the world, but muſt be ſought for at the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or at the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> whence there is no hope they can be brought before the Patient be laid in his Grave: The <hi>Medicine which he preſcribes, is no where to be found but in the Word of God:</hi> The Simples whereof it is compounded, can grow from no other root or branch, then from <hi>The Articles of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, and everlaſting death.</hi> The <hi>Belief of the One, is the root of Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Belief of this Article will work obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> from ſinful or unlawful Pleaſures: The <hi>Belief of the other,</hi> is the root of Patience or ſufferance of <hi>malum Poenae,</hi> or of ſufferance for well-doing: Howbeit, to ſpeak exactly, both parts of his <hi>Receipt</hi> may be had from the Belief either of <hi>Everlasting Life,</hi> or <hi>Everlaſting Death,</hi> but moſt compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the belief of both.</p>
               <p>The manner how thence they may be gathered, is expreſſed by our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>St. Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>&amp;c. The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Chriſt; if we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together; for I reckon that the ſuffrings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If all the ſufferings of this life, be not worthy of the glory which ſhall be revealed in us, as the Rule of Faith</hi> teacheth us; then conſcience, and reaſon it ſelf bindes us, to ſuffer all the Perſecutions or Grievances which can be laid upon us, rather then hazard our hopes, or forfeit our Intereſts in the <hi>Glory that ſhall be revealed</hi> in all ſuch, as with patience ſuffer perſecution, or other temporal loſs or detriment for the truths ſake. And <hi>this hope of Glory is as the Root whence Chriſtian patience or ſufferance muſt grow. So is the fear of everlaſting Death, the root of our abſtinence from evil, or of repentance for former want of this abſtinence:</hi> This is the ſame Apoſtles Doctrine, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>For we muſt all appear before the Judgement ſeat of Chriſt, that every one</hi>
                  <pb n="3521" facs="tcp:32220:119"/>
                  <hi>may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord, we perſwade men.</hi> To what doth he perſwade men? <hi>To do thoſe things</hi> which are good, and which being done ſhall be rewarded, <hi>not in Judgement, but in mercy</hi> and loving kindneſs; <hi>Thoſe things</hi> by which we ſhall be reconciled unto God.</p>
               <p>But were not theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> reconciled to God before our Apoſtle thus perſwaded them? Yes; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>God hath recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And when our Apoſtle, and thoſe to whom he wrote, were reconciled unto God through Jeſus Chriſt; we that are now living were by the ſame means reconciled unto God; <hi>For, God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf.</hi> Now if the <hi>world,</hi> that is, not <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that man,</hi> not this or that generation of men, but <hi>all generations, the world of mankind</hi> were reconciled unto God, when our Apoſtle wrote <hi>this Epiſtle,</hi> yea when Chriſt offered himſelf upon the Croſſe, what need is there of any further reconciliation? For that which God doth, he doth moſt perfectly, moſt compleatly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is true; Our reconciliation was moſt perfectly, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly wrought on Gods part by Chriſts death upon the Croſſe, he payed the full price of our Redemption, of our reconciliation; nothing may or can be added thereto. Yet <hi>A Reconciliation there is to be wrought on our parts,</hi> though wrought it cannot be, but by the ſpirit of God, and wrought it is not ordinarily, but by the miniſtry of men, as Gods Deputies or Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors. So the Apoſtle adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>God hath committed to us,</hi> to wit, his Miniſters, <hi>the word of reconciliation. Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though Chriſt did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Active, or Grammatically paſſive only, &amp; reconciliation really paſſive, See Book 10. <hi>Fol.</hi> 3267, and 3278.</note> 
                  <hi>to God.</hi> So then <hi>God hath reconciled us</hi> all unto himſelf from the hour of Chriſts death, and yet <hi>every one of us, for his own particular, muſt be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God</hi> by the Miniſtry of his Embaſſadors: And the efficacy of their Miniſtry is demonſtrated by working true repentance in us. The means again, by which they work this true repentance, muſt be by repreſenting the <hi>Terrour of the Lord,</hi> or, as our Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. by putting them in mind of the laſt and dreadful day. <hi>The times of this ignorance</hi> (to wit, of the old world before Chriſts death) <hi>God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent, becauſe he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs, by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> Thus you ſee how <hi>the terrour</hi> of the laſt day, or <hi>fear of everlaſting death</hi> muſt work in us <hi>an Abſtinence</hi> from evil, or repentance for evil paſt, as the <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Everlaſting Life</hi> doth work patience and <hi>conſtancie in perſecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet both parts of <hi>that brief Receipt, Suſtine et Abſtine,</hi> may be effected by our ſerious meditation upon either branch of our belief concerning life and death everlaſting: For, if <hi>all the ſufferings of this life be not worthy of,</hi> or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent unto <hi>the glory, which ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> we muſt needs be worthy of, and obnoxious to everlaſting death, if we do not with patience ſuffer perſecution in this life, rather then hazard our hopes of <hi>Life Eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; if the ſufferance of everlaſting death be much worſe, then the ſuffering of all perſecutions poſſible in this life, our not repentance at the <hi>Terrour of it,</hi> doth make us uncapable of everlaſting life. Our hopes of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by repentance, if they be ſound and firm, will animate, and in a manner impell us to follow the wayes of life, to bring forth fruits worthy of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="3522" facs="tcp:32220:120"/>
4. Seeing then we are thus invironed on the right hand and on the left, having the <hi>hopes of Eternal Life</hi> ſet before us to encourage us to conſtancy and reſolution; and are ſo ſtrongly beſet with inevitable <hi>fear of everlaſting death,</hi> if like faint hearted ſouldiers, we ſhould retreat, or revoke <hi>our vow in Baptiſme,</hi> may not the Lord in Juſtice take up that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt us, which ſometimes he did againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judah? What could I have done more for my vineyard, that I have not done unto it?</hi> Other means to make men either <hi>good men,</hi> or <hi>good Citizens,</hi> the old world knew none, nor could the wit of the wiſeſt Law-givers deviſe any beſides <hi>poena, et praemium,</hi> Reward and puniſhment. Now, what Kingdom, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth had either ſo bountiful Rewards, or ſo dreadful puniſhments propoſed unto them, as we Chriſtians have? What then is the reaſon, why we of all others are more defective in good duties, moſt fruitful in evil, leſſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or more deſperate tranſgreſſors of our Princes Lawes, then the ſubjects or Citizens of any other well governed Kingdoms ever were? how often do we pawn our hopes of everlaſting life upon leſs occaſions, then <hi>Eſau</hi> did his birth-right, and ſet Chriſt our acknowledged Lord and Redeemer <hi>to ſale</hi> at a lower price, then Judas did?</p>
               <p>The original of this our deſperate neglect or contempt muſt either be <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief</hi> or <hi>unbelief</hi> of the Reward promiſed to well doing, or of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned to evil doers. And it would be a point very hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>Whether, of ſuch as make any conſcience of their wayes,</hi> eſpecially ſince the reformation of Religion; <hi>more have miſcarried through misbelief,</hi> or <hi>through unbelief of this Great Article of our Creed,</hi> Everlaſting life and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death. Our Misbelief, for the moſt part, concerns the <hi>Article of everlaſting life.</hi> Of <hi>everlaſting death,</hi> we are rather unbelievers then misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Misbelief alwayes includes a ſtrong belief:</hi> but the ſtronger our belief, the more dangerous it is, if it be wreſted or miſplaced; and the worſt way we can miſplace our belief of heavenly joyes, is, when we make our ſelves <hi>certain of our ſalvation</hi> before our time; or ranke our ſelves amongſt the <hi>elect</hi> or <hi>heirs</hi> not <hi>diſinheritable</hi> of the heavenly kingdom, before <hi>we have made our Election ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. As the abſolute <hi>infallibilitie</hi> of the preſent Romiſh Church doth make up the meaſure of heatheniſh Idolatry or iniquity: So the <hi>immature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of our own ſalvation or Election, doth make up the meaſure of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Phariſaical Hypocriſie.</hi> The manner how it doth ſo, is this. <q>If no covetous, if no ſacrilegious perſon, if no ſlanderer of his brethren, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viler of his betters,</q> can enter into the Kingdom of heaven (as it is certain they cannot, untill they repent:) then, no man, which is <hi>certain of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vation,</hi> can perſwade himſelf, or be perſwaded that he is, a covetous, or ſacrilegious perſon, that he is a ſlanderer of his brethren, or a reviler of his betters; and hence the <hi>Concluſion</hi> ariſing from the <hi>Premiſſes</hi> is inevitable; that albeit ſuch men <hi>as preſume of their Election</hi> or ſalvation before their time, before they be throughly ſanctified, do all that covetous or ſacrilegious men <note place="margin">☞</note> do, be continual ſlanderers or malicious revilers of their brethren, yet it is impoſſible that they ſhould ſuſpect much leſs condemn themſelves of theſe crimes until they correct their former errours, and rectifie their misbelief or preſumption of their immutable eſtate in grace. Yea, their errour, not being corrected, makes them confident in theſe wicked practiſes, and cauſes them to miſtake hatred to mens perſons, or envy to others good parts, for zeal to Religion; and ſtubbornneſs in Schiſme and faction, for Chriſtian charitie or

good affection unto truth. And if any man of better inſight in the <hi>Stratagems of Satan,</hi> ſhall go about to detect their error or convince them by ſtrength of <hi>Reaſon grounded upon Scripture,</hi> that their miſ-perſwaſions do branch into Blaſphemie, and can bring forth no better fruit then <hi>Phariſaical hypocriſie,</hi> yet they uſually requite his pains, as that young <hi>Spaniſh ſpark</hi> did the Phyſician, which had well nigh cured him of a deſperate Phrenſie; no ſooner had he brought him to know what he was indeed, <hi>no more then a Page,</hi> though to a great <hi>Duke, or Grandee of Spain,</hi> but the Youth, inſtead of a <hi>Fee</hi> or thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgement, began to revile and curſe the Phyſician, for bringing him out of a pleaſant dream of golden mountains, much richer then <hi>the King of Spain</hi> had any; it ſeemed as a kind of hell unto him, to ſee himſelf to be but a Page, who in his raving fits had taken upon him to create Dukes and Earls, and to exerciſe the Acts of Royal Authoritie.

               <p>The true Reaſon why many, who can diſcourſe well of Heavenly matters (and can give a reaſon of their belief, ſufficient to convince the Gainſayers of
<pb n="3524" facs="tcp:32220:121"/>
the truth which they believe) are not ſo able to take or give the true Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the things believed, is much what the ſame with that which Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers aſſign, <hi>Why yong men are no fit Auditors of moral Philoſophy,</hi> or why they prove not ſo good Proficients in this ſtudy, as in other Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, To learn the Mathematicks, as Arithmetick, or Geometry, yong men or children are as apt as men of mature age: And in natural Philoſophy they finde no difficulty, ſave onely want of Experience, which is never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto in juſt and full meaſure, without length of time, or competent number of years. Howbeit, in the former Studies, though all their life time were youth, men might attain to the ſame meaſure of experience, in the ſame courſe of time or number of years that they could if all their life were mature age. But ſo it is not in moral Philoſophy: What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? <q>The Philoſopher tells us, It is, becauſe yong men, or men whoſe affections are unſetled, can have no taſte of moral Goodneſs, or of the ſweetneſs of true vertue:</q> And as his Maſter before him had obſerved; <hi>Omnis vita guſtu quodam ducitur,</hi> We muſt have a Taſte or Reliſh of good or evil, or elſe we ſhall neither follow the one, nor eſchew the other, with that conſtancy, with that life and courage, which is required to Vertue or Morality. <q>We may do many good things which a good Chriſtian ought to do, and yet not live a Chriſtian life: As <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>(Mark</hi> 6. 20.) who <note place="margin">☞</note> feared and obſerved Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> as a holy Juſt Man, and heard him gladly, and when he heard him did many things: yet cut off his head.</q>

To lead a Chriſtian life, is more then to be a meer Moral Man, although it always includes Morality in it: And whatſoever is required to a moral <note place="margin">Unbelief of this <hi>Article</hi> cauſe of unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian careleſs life.</note> life, That and more is neceſſarily required to a Chriſtian and Godly life. <q>And ſeeing the framing of a true Chriſtian Life, depends very much upon the true belief of this Article of Everlaſting Life, and Everlaſting Death, the moſt effectual Method which Gods Ambaſſadors can uſe to this end, muſt be, to exhibit a true taſte or reliſh of the Goodneſs contained in the one, and of the Evil comprized in the other.</q> And this is the Method, which by Gods aſſiſtance, I mean to follow.</p>

               <p>I will begin with <hi>The means how to eſtimate everlaſting Death,</hi> becauſe it is much eaſier to have ſome Taſt or Relliſh of it, then of everlaſting Life.</p>
               <p>There is no evil which a man in this life doth ſuffer, no pain or grief, but may in ſome ſort ſerve a diligent meditator to take a view or eſtimate of the horrors of the ſecond death. But alwayes the greater the evil is, which we have ſuffered or have experience of, the more fit meaſure it is, for calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the endleſs miſeries of the Second Death. <q>And, The very cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or remembrance of ſuch particular evils as we have actually ſuffered, or have experience of, will be more effectual to withdraw us from thoſe means or practiſes, which procure them; then the repreſentation or contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evils in their nature far greater, but of which we have had no Taſt or experience.</q>

<pb n="3525" facs="tcp:32220:121"/>
their ſlaves or bond-men; And their ſlaves being willing to defend the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, which they had uſurpt, took arms againſt their Maſters at their return; But were quickly routed without ſtroke of Sword, or dint of Lance, or other uſual weapon of war. In ſtead of theſe, their Maſters charged them on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back with whips in their hands, with ſucceſs according to their own fore-caſt or expectation. Of hurts or wounds made by Sword or Lance, as they wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did forecaſt, their ſlaves had formerly had no experience; they never had felt the ſmart or grief of either; But their backs had been accuſtomed to the ſcourge or laſh, and the very ſight of theſe weapons, reviving the memory of their former ſmart, more affrighted them on a ſuddain, then any terror of war beſides could have done. To have tried their courage or fortunes, either by puſh of Pike, or dint of Sword, they would have been more forward then wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer men. <hi>Dulce bellum inexpertis</hi> Want of experience in this kind would have made them, <hi>for the firſt brunt</hi> at leaſt, more inſolent and fool-hardy; whereas the very ſight and noiſe of the whip, whereof they had ſo often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, did preſently dant them, and make them ſeek their ſecurity from it by confuſed flight. The Hiſtorical Truth of this Relation, and good ſucceſs of their Stratagem, is ſealed unto us in the Publick Coin of that Country, <hi>whoſe ſtamp to this day is a man on Horſe-back with a whip in his hand.</hi>

It would be a great comfort to us, that are Gods Embaſſadors, if we could but perſwade men to be as afraid to wrong or deface the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men deceaſed, as the modern <hi>Turks</hi> are to offer the leaſt indignity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>ordinary papers ſcattered in the ſtreets;</hi> or to be as careful in preſerving <hi>the Goods of the Church,</hi> as theſe Infidels are to preſerve the leaſt ſcrap of paper that would otherwiſe periſh.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon why they are ſo careful in theſe Toyes, and we ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in matters of ſuch moment, and the like?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They have a <hi>Tradition</hi> (whether received from <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf, or from his Succeſſors their Mufties, I know not, but a Tradition they have) which they ſtrongly believe, That before they can enter into ſuch a heaven as they dream of, they muſt paſs over a long iron grate red hot, without any other fence to ſave their naked feet from ſcorching, ſave only ſo much paper as they ſhall preſerve from periſhing.</q> Now of the pains or tortures, which the violent heat of Iron produceth in naked bodies, they have a kind of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or experience. The conceit or Notion of this pain is freſh and lively, and works more ſtrongly upon their affections, then the dread of hell fire doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many Chriſtians, albeit there is no Chriſtian, which doth not believe the fire of hell to be everlaſting; whereas the <hi>Turk</hi> thinks this his <hi>ſuppoſed Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> to be but temporary, and between pains temporary and pains everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting there is no proportion. How then comes it to paſs that this ſuperſtitious fear of pains but temporary, ſhould ſo far exceed our true fear or belief of <note place="margin">☜</note> pains unceſſant and everlaſting? Many, which truly believe there is a Hell, whoſe fire never goeth out, yet conceive this fire to be an immaterial fire, a fire of whoſe heat or violence they have no ſenſe or feeling in this life, a fire altogether unknown unto them: And as no man much deſireth that good, which he knoweth not, how great ſoever it be; ſo no man much feareth that evil, whereof he hath no ſenſe or feeling, no experimental knowledge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to meaſure the greatneſs of it, but only believes it confuſedly or in groſs; and hence it is that the acknowledgment or belief of ſuch a fire, how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may ſeem to be in the <hi>General abſtract</hi> conceit, is but like a <hi>ſpacious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical body,</hi> which hath neither weight nor motion, which can produce no real effects in the ſoul or affections of man. For this reaſon I have alwayes
<pb n="3526" facs="tcp:32220:122"/>
held it a fruitleſs pains, or a needleſs curioſity to diſpute the Queſtion, <hi>Whether the fire of hell be a material fire or no,</hi> that is, ſuch a fire as may be felt by bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſenſes; ſeeing moſt men conceive no otherwiſe of things immaterial or ſpiritual, then as of <hi>Abſtract Notions,</hi> or of <hi>Mathematical Magnitudes.</hi> As the determination of this Queſtion (were it poſſible in this life to be determined) would be fruitleſs: So the chief reaſon, which ſome have brought to prove the <hi>Negative,</hi> to wit, <hi>That it is not a material fire,</hi> is of no force in true <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie,</hi> much leſs in <hi>Divinitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Their <hi>chief Reaſon</hi> is This; <hi>That if hell fire were a material or bodily fire, it could not immediately work upon the ſoul, which is an immaterial or ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> But let them tell us, how it is poſſible, That the ſoul of man, which is an immortal ſubſtance, ſhould be truly wedded to the body or material ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and I ſhall as eaſily anſwer them, That it is as poſſible for the ſame ſoul to be as really wrought upon by a material fire. As poſsible it is for material fire to propagate death without End to both body and ſoul; as it is for the immaterial or immortal ſoul to communicate life without end to the material ſubſtance of the body. For the bodies of the damned ſhall never ceaſe to be material ſubſtances, and they ſhall live to everlaſting pains by a life communicated unto them from their immaterial and immortal ſouls. And as the bodies do live continually, by reaſon of their continual union with their living immaterial ſouls; ſo the ſoul may die <hi>the ſecond death</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by its union with, or impriſonment in, material, but everlaſting fire. Or if any man be of opinion, that hell fire is no material fire, or hath no reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of that fire, which we ſee and know, yet let him believe that it is a great deal worſe, and that the greateſt torture, which in this life can come by fire, is, though a true, yet but an imperfect ſcantling of the torments of the life to come, and the danger will be leſs.</p>
               <p>Of this opinion were the Antients, and this conceit or notion of hell fire did in ſome, bring forth very good effects. So <hi>Euſebius</hi> in <hi>his Fifth Book and</hi>

But the very ſight of thoſe flames, wherein the Martyrs were tortured, did throughly awake her out of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſlumber; her very fear, or rather conceit of ſuch torments, which they for the time ſuffered, did afford her a meaſure or ſcantling to calculate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable torments of hell fire, which, being now awaked, ſhe began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think her ſelf, that ſhe muſt ſuffer them without hope of releaſe, if ſhe ſhould deny Chriſt or renounce her calling; and thus <hi>expelling the leſſer fear by the greater,</hi> ſhe reſolutely profeſſed her ſelf to be a true Chriſtian in heart, and ſo <note place="margin">☞</note> contrary to the expectation of the perſecutors, and her own former reſolution, increaſed the number of the <hi>glorious Martyrs,</hi> and incouraged others after her to endure the Croſs.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By right fitting or ſuiting the ſeveral members or branches of the <note place="margin">Meditations of the ſecond death to be fitted to ſeveral parts of the body of ſin for the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</note> 
                  <hi>Second Death</hi> unto the ſeveral members of the <hi>Body of ſin.</hi> The force or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of this Medicine depends eſpecially upon the right <hi>Application</hi> of it: And the right <hi>Application</hi> conſiſts in counterpoizing our hopes or deſires of unlawful pleaſures, with the juſt fear of ſutable Evils. Now, as the fear of thoſe evils, whereof we have a diſtinct or comprehenſive notion, hath more weight or force upon our affections, then the fear of evils far greater in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but of which we have only an indiſtinct, confuſed, or general notion (ſuch as a man blind from his birth may have of colours, which in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral he knows to be ſenſible qualities, but what kind of qualities in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular he cannot know:) So, of thoſe evils, whereof we have a ſpecifical or diſtinct notion, thoſe have the greateſt ſway upon our ſeveral corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are moſt directly contrary to our particular delights or pleaſures, which accompany the exerciſe or motions of the ſame affections. So, as the chief, if not the only means, to mortifie the ſeveral members of the <hi>old man</hi> or <hi>body of ſin,</hi> is, to plant the fear of thoſe particular evils <hi>in the ſame ſenſe or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> by whoſe peculiar delights or pleaſures we find our ſelves to be moſt uſually withdrawn from the wayes of life. For, the fear of any evil diſtinctly known, though in it ſelf more weighty, doth not ſo directly or fully counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway any delight or pleaſure, unleſs it be ſeated in <hi>the ſame particular ſubject</hi> with it, and move upon the ſame <hi>Center.</hi> Curioſity of the eye, is not ſo eaſily tamed with any other fear as with fear of blindneſs. Luſt or delight in the pleaſures of the fleſh are not ſo forcibly reſtrained by any other fear, as by fear of ſome loathſome diſeaſe, or grievous pain incident to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments or Organs of ſuch pleaſures. Pride and Ambition ſtand not in ſo much awe of any other puniſhment, as of ſhame, diſ-grace, or diſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But how good ſoever the <hi>Medicine</hi> be, it is either dangerous or unuſeful, unleſs it be applied in due ſeaſon. The ſame Phyſick hath contrary effects upon a full and a faſting ſtomack. And as a great part of the Art of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry conſiſts in the obſervation of times and ſeaſons, wherein to ſow or plant: So a great part of this divine Art of Meditation depends upon our knowledge or obſervance of opportunities beſt fitting the plantation of this fear of particular evils, which muſt counterſway our inclinations to particular pleaſures. This muſt be attempted (as we ſay) <hi>in cold blood;</hi> and in the <hi>Calm</hi> of our affections; or in the abſence of ſtrong temptations, which ſcarce admit of any other Medicine or reſtraint, ſave only <hi>flying to the Force of Prayer.</hi> It was a wiſe <hi>Caveat</hi> of an heathen, that as often as well call thoſe pleaſures or delights of the body or ſenſe, whereof we have had any former experience, to mind, we ſhould not look upon them as they did preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or <hi>came towards us;</hi> for their face or countenance is pleaſant and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; But if we diligently obſerve them in their paſſage from us, they are <note place="margin">Ariſtotle</note> ugly and loathſom, and alwayes leave their ſting behind them. And as the ſeveral delightful Objects of every particular outward ſenſe meet in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Common ſenſe or Phantaſie: So the dregs or Reliques, which every unlawful pleaſure at his departure leaves in the ſenſe or faculty, wherein it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, do all concur to make up the <hi>Sting of Conſcience;</hi> And the Sting of Conſcience (unleſs we wittingly ſtifle the working of it) doth give the trueſt repreſentation of the <hi>Second Death,</hi> and makes the deepeſt impreſſion of hell pains, that in this life can generally be had.</p>

3. There is no man (unleſs he be given over by God to a reprobate ſenſe) whoſe heart will not ſmite him either in the conſciouſneſs of groſſer ſins, unto which he hath in a lower degree been accuſtomed, or of uſual ſins, though for the quality not ſo groſs. Now if men would ſuffer their <hi>Cogitations to reflect</hi> upon the regretings, which alwayes accompany the accompliſhments of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful deſires (as frequently and ſeriouſly, as they in a manner impel them, to reflect upon thoſe inticing Objects, which inflame their breſts with ſuch <note place="margin">☞</note> deſires) theſe cogitations would awake <hi>the natural Sting of Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>This</hi> being awakned or quickned, would not ſuffer them to ſleep any longer in their ſins; For the ſmart or feeling of the <hi>Sting of Conſcience</hi> is as ſenſible and lively a <hi>Prognoſtick of the Worm, which never dieth</hi> (which is the chief part of the <hi>ſecond Death)</hi> as heavineſs of ſpirit, or grudgings, are of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or other diſeaſes, which without preventing Physick or diet do alwayes follow them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But this <hi>Prognoſtick of the ſecond death,</hi> or this fear of hell pains (which the <hi>Sting of Conſcience</hi> alwayes exhibits) muſt be warily taken, and weighed with Judgment. The right obſervance of them (as every other good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or habit) is beſet with <hi>Two</hi> contrary <hi>extremes;</hi> The one in <hi>defect,</hi> The other in <hi>exceſs. The defect is Careleſneſſe, The exceſſe Deſpere,</hi> or too much dejection of mind.</p>
               <p>The intimations or <hi>Prognoſticks,</hi> which the <hi>Sting of Conſcience</hi> exhibits of <hi>death ſpiritual,</hi> are often miſtaken for the effects of bodily melancholy, and the beſt medicine for melancholy is pleaſant ſociety or mirth. Out of this <note place="margin">See <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. § 9, 10.</note> miſtaking, moſt men prevent that Compaſſion, which is due to their own ſouls, after ſuch a manner as <hi>Jewiſh</hi> parents did prevent their natural pity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their children, when they ſacrificed them unto <hi>Molech;</hi> by filling their ears with the loud ſound of wind Inſtruments, leſt the ſhrikes of the Infants (whom they incloſed in an Image of hot glowing braſs) by entring in at their ears might move their Jewiſh hearts to pity. And moſt men, leſt they ſhould be ſtung with grief of ſpirit or conſcience, ſeek to ſtifle their firſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings <note place="margin">☜</note> and repinings either with unhallowed, or unſeaſonable mirth.</p>
               <p>Others by ſeeking to avoid this common extreme, often fall into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, which is of the <hi>Two</hi> the worſe; to wit, diſpere, or too much dejection of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>That which the Heathen obſerved of grief in General, is moſt true of this Particular, the grief of a Wounded Spirit. <hi>Dolori ſi fraena remitt as, nulla ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria non est maxima.</hi> If we let looſe the reins to grief or ſorrow, the leaſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or occaſion of either, will be more weighty then we can well bear.

And unleſs our Cogitations or ſad remembrances of ſins paſt be moderated with Judgment and diſcretion, they will appear to our fancies, like <hi>Cains</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, <hi>greater then can be forgiven,</hi> or then we can hope that the God of mercy will forgive. For holding the <hi>right mean</hi> betwixt theſe <hi>Extrems, Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> and <hi>deſpere,</hi> there is no means ſo effectual as to be rightly inſtructed in the <hi>hope of everlaſting Life,</hi> and Fear of <hi>everlaſting death.

               <p>He that is perſwaded that every one always is in the <hi>Eſtate of the Elect</hi> or of the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> cannot avoid the one or other extreme: And the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to prevent deſpere or being ſwallowed up with grief, either in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſnes of groſſer ſins lately committed, or whiles we reflect upon ſins paſt,

is, to purge our ſelves of <hi>that Erroneous Opinion</hi> concerning <hi>Abſolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or irreverſible ordination to death, before we were born, or from the time of our ſecond birth by baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="5">5 To purge our brain or fancie of <hi>this opinion,</hi> let us take the form and Tenor of the <hi>Final ſentence</hi> into conſideration; which we may do without digreſſion or diverſion. Both branches of this ſentence we have, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. The <note place="margin">☞</note> firſt branch, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>before all worlds,</hi> though this in a good ſenſe is true, moſt true, if we ſpeak <hi>of Gods deſigne or Act; for all his Acts</hi> or deſignes <hi>are</hi> as he is, <hi>Eternal,</hi> without beginning: ſo are not the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned or enacted by him: they take their beginning in time, or with time. The Kingdom prepared for Gods people was prepared when the world was made, not before; ſo good and gracious was our God, that he did not make man or Angel untill he had prepared a place convenient for them; take them as they were his creatures, or workmanſhip, and they were all ordained to a life of bliſs. Paradiſe was made for man, and it may be after man was made, but the Heaven of Heavens was prepared for man before he was <note place="margin">Purge our Braines of The Erroneous Opinion of the Irreſpective <hi>Decree.</hi>
                  </note> made, and made for the Angels, if not before they were made, yet when they were made. But the Sentence of death, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. runs in another <hi>Tenor; Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire;</hi> he doth not ſay <hi>prepared for you</hi> from the foundation of the world, but, <hi>prepared for the Divel and his angels.</hi> Thoſe immortal ſpirits, which now are divels, were ſometime Angels; God made them ſo; They made themſelves divels. Now hell fire was not prepared for them, whilſt they were Angels, not from the foundation of the world, but from the time, wherein of Angels they became Divels: Nor are men at all ordained to it, untill of men they become Satans angels. And as Satan and his angels (the ſpirits which fell with him) continue the <hi>ſelf ſame individual ſubstances,</hi> which they were, when God firſt created them; yet are <hi>no way the ſame, but quite contrary for qualitie</hi> and diſpoſition; ſo the place whereto they are confined, may be for ſubſtance, ſpace, and dimenſion the ſame it was at the firſt creation, but not the ſame for quality; it became a priſon or place of torment when Satan and other ſpirits, which fell with him, of Angels made themſelves Divels. Satan (as ſome think) brought that fire wherein he and his Angels ſhall be tormented, into the bowels of the earth, when <hi>he fell like lightning from heaven:</hi> However, if the Angels had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there had been no hell, no tormenting fire: and unleſs men become the Divels Angels, they ſhall not be caſt into hell fire. <hi>God doth not ordain men to be Satans angels,</hi> but men continuing his ſons or ſervants, God ordaines them to take their portion with him.</p>
               <p>So that if we remove the opinion of <hi>Abſolute-Reprobation,</hi> or of irreverſible ordination of mens perſons unto death, before they were baptized or born; or if men would be confirmed in faith, that no ſuch Sentence or Decree is gone out againſt them whilſt they have either will, deſire, or opportunitie to call upon God through Jeſus Chriſt for remiſſion of ſins, whether by confeſſion of them, or by abſolution from them upon ſuch confeſſion, or by receiving the Sacrament of Chriſts body and blood, no danger can accrue from the frequent meditation of <hi>everlaſting death,</hi> or from ſuch repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">Meditations or a Taſt of Eternal death here, fits us better for a taſt of eternal life hereafter.</note> of the horrours of it, as the often reflecting upon our ſins paſt, and the working of the <hi>Sting of Conſcience,</hi> upon ſuch reflections, will preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>

For no man ordinarily can have a <hi>true Taſt</hi> or relliſh of Eternal Life, but he, which hath had ſome <hi>Taſt</hi> or grudging of everlaſting death. The ſenſe, or Taſt, or Overture, of the <hi>ſecond death</hi> doth make the leaſt relliſh of the <hi>ſecond reſurrection</hi> unto Life to ſeem more ſweet and pleaſant. Now it is the relliſh or ſecret intimation of Celeſtial joyes, which muſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and incourage us to undertake all the dangers or diſcontents, wherewith the way unto the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> (the land of promiſe and of our reſt) is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. The moſt forcible Reaſons, which the Divineſt Orator can uſe, or the beſt words, wherewith he can apparel his reaſons or perſwaſions, are but vain, unleſs he can with them or by them inſtill this ſecret taſt or relliſh into mens ſouls. All the deſcriptions, which the Leaders of the <hi>Gaules</hi> could make, of the pleaſures or Commodities of <hi>Italy;</hi> all the newes or reports, which they could deviſe or cauſe to be made in their publique meetings, as it were upon our <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> could not ſo much animate their followers to adventure upon the ſtrait and difficult paſſages over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> as did the taſt of the <hi>Italian Grape.</hi> And that, which did eſpecially aggravate the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites Daſtardy</hi> for not undertaking that ſacred warre, whereunto God had called them, againſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and the <hi>Hittites,</hi> &amp;c. was the ſight of <hi>thoſe Grapes,</hi> which, ſuch as were ſent to diſcover that good Land, had brought from <hi>Eſchol.</hi> Their unuſual greatneſs, which all the hoſt might have ſeen; and their extraordinary relliſh, which many did or might have taſted, was a pledge or aſſurance of the truth of Gods promiſes concerning the fertility or pleaſantneſs of that Land. For as we ſay <hi>Ex ungue Leonem;</hi> The terrour of the Lion, which we never ſaw, may be taken from his paw: Or as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did take the juſt quantity of <hi>Hercules</hi> his body by the print of his foot; ſo might the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> have taken the true eſtimate of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> from the unuſual quality and extraordinary quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that bunch of grapes, which their mutinous ſpies or Intelligencers could not deny to be the native fruit of that ſoil. But of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and daſtardy, and what both theſe and the ſlanderous reports, which their ſpies or intelligencers did raiſe of that good Land, myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally import, we ſhall take occaſion, if God permit, hereafter to handle.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Such a pledge as theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had of Gods promiſes concerning the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> we may have, and muſt have of the pleaſures of the <hi>Celeſtial Canaan,</hi> before we become valorous in our undertakings for it. And if we once attain to a true <hi>Taſt</hi> or relliſh of its goodneſs; the leaſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it will ſerve as a true meaſure to notifie the incomparable exceſs of <hi>thoſe joyes</hi> in compariſon of any earthly pleaſures or annoyances, the one or other of which, and nothing beſides them, can occaſion our diverſion from the wayes, which lead unto them.</p>
               <p>The force or efficacie, which experienced pleaſures or contentments have <note place="margin">The force which the Taſt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures hath upon mens ſouls.</note> upon mens ſouls or affections, <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his ſucceſſors too well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, and ſo by a known repreſentation of a counterfeit heaven, and by a reall and experienced taſt of imaginary or feigned pleaſures in the life to come, did make their followers more zealous and confident in propagating their Empire and Religion, then either Chriſtian Preachers or Magiſtrates can make their Chriſtian people. The obedience of Turkiſh children to their parents, of their greateſt Nobles to their Soveraign, of their ſouldiers to their Commanders, of inferiour Commanders to their Superiors or Generals, far exceeds any obedience, which we Chriſtians uſually perform <note place="margin">See <hi>Book.</hi> 10. <hi>fol.</hi> 3181.</note> to our Superiours in what kind ſoever. One Erroneous principle notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

they have, <hi>That all things are ſo decreed by God as nothing can fall out otherwiſe then it doth: and from this</hi> prejudicate conceipt, when opportunitie ſuggeſts fair hopes unto the ſon of obtaining his fathers Crown, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it no ſin, but a religious Act, for the Son to depoſe the Father, as preſuming it is Gods Will thus to have it, whenſoever he offers opportunity. But when there is no hope to gain a Crown by rebellion, no intimation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the ſignes of the time, that God will proſper their attempts againſt their Superiors, there is no ſubject in any Chriſtian Kingdom, that will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the greateſt dignity, whereto his Soveraign Lord can advance him, with ſuch Loyal reſpect and ſubmiſſion, as the ſons or grand-children of their Emperours will imbrace the ſentence of death, though no way deſerved, only in obedience to his deſignes and pleaſure. There is no malefactor amongſt us, though openly convicted of capital crimes, that will ſubmit himſelf to the ſentence of the Law, with that cheerfulneſs of mind, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regreting affections, as their inferiour Commanders or common ſouldiers will ſurrender their lives into their Superiors hands, be the ſervice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they appoint them never ſo dreadful or deſperate.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now the great motives by which Turkiſh Prieſts or their Magiſtrates work this abſolute ſubmiſſion and compleat obedience in inferiors, is either <hi>fear of Hell</hi> or torments after this life in caſe they ſhall diſobey; or <hi>hopes of Heaven</hi> if they continue loyal and obedient; and yet the hell, which they fear, is no way ſo terrible as that Hell, with whoſe torments we dayly threaten the diſobedient: Their hopes of heaven are nothing ſo glorious, as thoſe hopes, which God promiſeth, and we profeſſe we believe them to be the reward of our obedience to our God, to our Prince, and to his juſt Lawes, whether Eccleſiaſtick or Civil. Whence then doth this great difference or odds ariſe between their obedience and ours? From no other root then this. <hi>They propoſe unto their followers ſuch an heaven, ſuch contentments after this life, as they may have a true taſt or relliſh of in this life,</hi> by whoſe multiplication the incomparable exceſſe of future contentments in reſpect of preſent, may by ordinary capacities be eaſily taken. There is no delight or pleaſure, which men in this world can take in the dayes of plenty, ſecurity, and peace; no pleaſures of the outward ſenſes, of touch or taſt, which they do not hope to enjoy in far greater meaſure in heaven without annoyance, interruption or diſturbance, then their Emperour or Grand-Segnior in this life can do. The meaneſt amongſt them perſwades himſelf he ſhal have more conſorts or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, then their Luxurious Emperors have, all more beautiful then any earthly creatures can be. There is no delight again in War or feats of arms, which their Common ſouldiers hope not to enjoy, without danger or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigation of their bodies, in far greater meaſure, then the greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders or Generals of their Armies do. And being thus poſſeſſed with this <hi>Two fold perſwaſion,</hi> Firſt, <hi>That Obedience to Superiors doth merit heaven:</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the joyes of heaven are for nature and quality the ſame with ſuch earthly pleaſures</hi> and contentments, which they have taſted, but infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceed them for quantity and duration; To perſwade them, to lay down this life in hope of attaining the life to come, by obedience to their Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, or in love to their Religion, is a matter of no greater difficulty, then to induce a Merchant to lay out an hundred pounds ſterling in his own Country; upon ſuch aſſurance as this world affords, to receive ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds either in the ſame coyne, or in valuable commodities in another Country by way of return or bill of exchange.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But as for us Chriſtians, albeit our <hi>hopes</hi> of heaven be far more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="3535" facs="tcp:32220:126"/>
then theirs can be; albeit our <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the ground of our hopes, be moſt firm and ſound (whereas their belief of ſuch a heaven as they hope for, is but grounded upon the ſand) yet in as much as the moſt part of Chriſtians have no diſtinct conceit or notion of the heavenly joys, which they hope for, but believe them only <hi>in general</hi> or in groſs to be exceeding great; their <hi>Faith</hi> is in a manner but <hi>dead,</hi> their <hi>Hopes</hi> have no operations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their affections, they do not ſway them to conſtancie in any honorable adventures or undertakings for the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> We, that be Gods Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors may ſpend our ſpirits and our breaths, and be anſwered only with Religion conſiſting in words, or with a zeal of <hi>hearing</hi> Gods Word, not of <hi>doing</hi> it. The Caſe of moſt Hearers is much what like to the Caſe of a man extreamly ſick and oppreſt with diſtempered humors. There is no man ſo ſick (unleſs he be poſſeſt with deep melancholy or a frenzie) but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>in the general,</hi> that ſuch a Diet, as his Phyſician preſcribes him, is good; that ſuch meats, as he ſeeth men in health to feed upon with delight, are pleaſant and uſeful for preſerving health. But preſs him to make his words good by his practiſe <hi>in particular,</hi> and you ſhall find a <hi>Real Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> thoſe meats which out of his former experience he acknowledgeth to be ſweet and pleaſant, are to him in this diſtemper and indiſpoſition of body, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and abominable. The beſt Diet, which the <hi>Phyſician</hi> can preſcribe him, is nothing ſo welcom to him, as thoſe meats and drinks, which the diſtempered humor longeth after. And albeit you urge him with the authoritie of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, Galen,</hi> or other famous Profeſſors of Phyſick, yet you ſhall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to follow their Counſel, until he have in ſome meaſure recovered <hi>his Taſt;</hi> and the only means to recover <hi>it,</hi> muſt be, by the removing the noxious humor, wherewith it is oppreſſed. Yet ſuch as are bodily ſick have had ſome Taſt and experience of wholſom food in the time of their health: for bodily health ordinarily goes before bodily ſickneſs. But, <hi>The ſpiritual diſeaſes of our Conſciences have precedencie of ſpiritual health; we all are ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick from our birth, even in the womb.</hi> And for this reaſon it is, That to work a <hi>Longing</hi> in us after a ſpiritual health, or to bring us in love with true ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al food, is a matter of far greater difficulty, then to bring a man bodily ſick unto a liking of wholſom bodily food. We may perſwade Men <hi>in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> That the joys of heaven infinitely exceed all the pleaſures of this life; And thus far they will eaſily believe us; But without ſome <hi>Taſt or relliſh of them,</hi> no man will ſet his heart to ſeek after them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For us to give men, or men to take <hi>A True Relliſh</hi> of them, it is not (ordinarily) poſſible, until our hearts and conſciences be in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <note place="margin">The Taſt or true relliſh of eternal joys how gained.</note> disburthened of fleſhly luſts, of worldly deſires; or freed from minding earthly matters. The ordinary Phyſick, which God doth uſe in working this <hi>Firſt Cure,</hi> is ſome Croſs, affliction or chaſtiſement. Every Croſs or branch of affliction, which in this life can befall us, is in the intention of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as a peculiar Medicine to purge our ſouls of ſome one vain delight or other.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>If we would ſeriouſly ruminate upon the particular afflictions, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us, or ſuffer the ſting of conſcience to have its work whenſoever our hearts do</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The uſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to that purpoſe.</note> 
                  <hi>ſmite us; This would be a good preparation for the recovery of our ſpiritual Taſt;</hi> without whoſe recovery, we cannot be purified according to the purification of the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>But, ſay the Lord hath laid no croſs, no affliction upon us, yet this is a Diet ſo neceſſary for the ſoul, <hi>That every one, in caſe the Lord do not, muſt afflict his own ſoul;</hi> that is, he muſt ſometimes humble himſelf in faſting and prayer;
<pb n="3536" facs="tcp:32220:127"/>
for this, in the language of <hi>Canaan, is to afflict the ſoul:</hi> without ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes voluntarily undertaken (not as meritorious or profitable in themſelves, but as uſeful for enjoying of our ſelves, and the gaining of free and retired thoughts) our <hi>ſpiritual Taſt</hi> is not uſually recoverable; or, being in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure recovered, cannot be preſerved.</p>
               <p>But you will ask, Wherein doth this <hi>ſpiritual Taſt</hi> conſiſt? what is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it? or that which anſwers unto it, as bodily food doth unto bodily taſt? or What is the beſt dyet for recovering of it?</p>
               <p>This you are to learn from our Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink;</hi> it neither conſiſts in our uſe or abſtinence from theſe: what is it then? <hi>Righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Theſe words (if you mark them) are well placed: Firſt <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> Then, <hi>peace;</hi> laſtly, <hi>Joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> For as the Prophet had ſaid long before, <hi>Opus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">That Taſt is the peace of conſcience and joy in the holy Ghoſt, to which the working of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> 
                  <hi>juſtitiae pax:</hi> Peace, the peace of conſcience towards God, towards men, and with our own ſouls and affections, is the reſultance or work of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as it is oppoſed unto iniquity. For, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God, Eſai.</hi> 57. 21. <hi>Joy</hi> there may be without this peace or ſerenity of conſcience; but no <hi>Joy in the Holy-Ghoſt</hi> without it. <hi>Peace</hi> of conſcience is as the firſt <hi>Taſt</hi> or ſmell of eternal reſt; The firſt ſign or Symptome of ſpiritual health reſtored. <hi>Joy in the Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is to the ſoul as that chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or livelineſſe, which accompanieth perfect health, is unto the body. Righteouſneſs, or its works, are as the food or dyet, by which this ſpiritual health and livelineſſe of the ſoul is procured.</p>
               <p n="11">11. So then he that deſires to have a true <hi>Taſt of the heavenly gift,</hi> or <hi>of the powers of the life to come,</hi> muſt enure himſelf to the works of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of that <hi>Univerſal Righteouſneſs,</hi> whoſe practiſe is commended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in the Affirmative and poſitive precepts of the firſt and ſecond Table. <note place="margin">The work of righteouſneſs univerſal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> It is not enough to abſtain from the evil works prohibited in the <hi>Negative precepts</hi> of both Tables. This abſtinence is as the matter or privation of that true righteouſneſs, whereof peace is the work or fruit. Howbeit even this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choative Righteouſneſs,</hi> or imperfect <hi>Embryon</hi> of it, is ſeldom or never framed and conceived without ſome chaſtiſement or correction; which are as gentle Remembrancers of the horrours of the <hi>ſecond death</hi> Nor is this <hi>Inchoative</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The uſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction or chaſtiſement to that purpoſe</note> or privative <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> alwayes framed by chaſtiſements or ſuch remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, but, <hi>by patient ſuffering of them,</hi> or by embracing them, as ſo many tokens or pledges of our heavenly Fathers providence and loving care over us. Hence ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>If you endure chaſtiſement, God dealeth with you as with ſons; for what ſon is he, whom the Father chaſtiſeth not?</hi> Surely no gracious or beloved ſon: ſo the ſame Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon, whom he receiveth.</hi> Sons then he hath whom he doth not receive, becauſe they will not endure chaſtiſement or receive correction from him with ſubmiſſion and patience. Theſe he gives over as degenerate and loſt ſons. And <hi>there is not a more fearful ſigne of Gods diſpleaſure toward men, then his long-ſuffering of them without chaſtiſement. If ye be without chaſtiſement</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 8.) <hi>whereof all are partakers, then are ye baſtards and not ſons:</hi> But if all be partakers of it, how can any be without it? Yes, they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chaſtiſement, which will not <hi>patiently ſuffer it;</hi> which will not embrace it as a pledge, of their heavenly Fathers love, and theſe are <hi>baſtards.</hi> What is that? A baſtard is a ſon, but (in the language of men;) unlawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Hath God any ſuch ſons or children? God forbid! All are his ſons, all are his children by right of Creation, and by right of Redemption; and
<pb n="3537" facs="tcp:32220:127"/>
both theſe are lawful titles of Father-hood and dominion over us. <hi>Baſtards then they are, who refuſe chaſtiſement, in this ſenſe only, that they are ſtubborn and diſobedient, or miſaffected towards the Father of mankind:</hi> They imagine him not to be ſo kind and loving to all his ſons, not to themſelves in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as earthly parents are to their lawfully begotten children. This is that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which our Apoſtle ſeeks to avert from God, or rather that ſuſpition, which he ſeeks to remove from all, <hi>who call him their Father,</hi> and that by an Argument, as the Schools ſpeak, <hi>a Fortiore,</hi> ver. 9, 10. <hi>Furthermore, we have had Fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection unto the Father of ſpirits, and live? For they verily for a few dayes chaſtened us as ſeemed good unto them</hi> (ſometime perhaps without actual intendment, or expreſs fore-ſight of any good unto us) <hi>but he,</hi> to wit, our heavenly Father, <hi>chaſtiſeth us for our profit, that we might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. The End of his chaſtiſement is alwayes This; That we may ſerve him in Righteouſneſs, and have our fruit unto Holineſs, whoſe <hi>End is everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Life.</hi> And <hi>One chief part of our Righteouſneſs conſiſts in the patient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of our ſelves unto his chaſtiſements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt part of Righteouſneſs in reſpect of what Law ſoever, is, not to tranſgreſs the Law:</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, to ſubmit our ſelves unto the penalty, which the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, in caſe we tranſgreſs it.</p>
               <p>To plead the <hi>former part</hi> of this Righteouſneſs, in reſpect of Gods Law, we cannot; To perform the <hi>ſecond part</hi> of it we are bound upon pain of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our right of ſons. The penalty of diſobedience to it, or refuſal of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements in this life, is <hi>The woful eſtate of baſtards</hi> or of Sons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>The ſum of that, which hath been ſaid concerning our meditation of the <hi>ſecond death</hi> (eſpecially as this Meditation is <hi>A Preparative</hi> to the works of Righteouſneſs or of Holineſs) is excellently comprized by our Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Now no chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheleſſe, afterwards, it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſſe, unto them, which are exerciſed thereby.</hi> The burnt child, as we ſay, dreads the fire; and he is more then a child, a very Infant, or witleſs child, which will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the ſcorching flames of it, by the experience which he hath of its heat. Now there is no chaſtiſement, no correction, that is grievous for the preſent, but ought to be as a <hi>Gentle Remembrancer</hi> unto us of hell pains, or ſuch a fair <hi>Caveat</hi> for avoiding them, as the experienced heat of viſible and known fire <note place="margin">☜</note> (unto him that ſtands neer it) is of the harms, which it would procure, if he ſhould be caſt into it. And if we would make this or the like uſe of all the croſſes and afflictions, of all the bodily pains and grievances, of all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of mind or conſcience, which in this life we ſuffer, we ſhould be more careful then we are to avoid the temptations, by which Satan ſeeks to draw us into that everlaſting fire, which is prepared for him and his angels. This abſtinence from evil is the <hi>Firſt branch</hi> of our patience in affliction; The <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> is the fruit of righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>But I ſuppoſe the Reader will deſire a <hi>further Taſt,</hi> Firſt, <hi>Of the peace of Conſcience.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Of that joy in the holy Ghoſt</hi> wherein the Kingdom of heaven conſiſts. And the Explication of theſe <hi>Two great Points</hi> follows in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>In the Interim, the beſt Uſe, which can be made of the Doctrine hitherto delivered, is made unto our hands by our Apoſtle himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12, 13,
<pb n="3538" facs="tcp:32220:128"/>
14. <hi>Wherefore lift up the hands, which hang down, and the feeble knees: and make ſtraight paths for your feet, leſt that, which is lame, be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed. Follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord. Looking diligently leſt any man fail of the grace of God; leſt any root of bitterneſſe ſpringing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled. Leſt there be any Fornicator or prophane perſon, as</hi> Eſau, <hi>who for one morſell of meat ſold his birthright. For ye know that after when he would have inherited the bleſsing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though he ſought it carefully with tears.</hi>

                     <hi>The Coldneſs of our</hi> Hope <hi>of</hi> Life Eternal <hi>cauſeth deviation from the wayes of Righteouſneſs, and is cauſed by our</hi> No-Taſt <hi>or ſpiritual diſreliſh of that</hi> Life. <hi>The work of the Miniſtery is to plant</hi> this <hi>Taſt, and to preſerve</hi> it <hi>in Gods people.</hi> Two Objects <hi>of this</hi> Taſt: 1. Peace <hi>of Conſcience.</hi> 2. Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>That</hi> Peace <hi>may beſt be ſhadowed out unto us in the known ſweetneſs of Temporal Peace. The Paſsions of the natural man are in a continual mutinie. To men that yet have no experience of it, The nature of</hi> Joy in the Holy Ghoſt <hi>may be beſt exemplified by that chearful gladneſſe of Heart which is the fruit of Civil Peace. It is the</hi> Prerogative of man <hi>to Enjoy himſelf and to poſſeſſe his own ſoul. In the knowledge of any Truth there is</hi> Joy. <hi>But</hi> True Joy <hi>is only in the</hi> Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>and of ſaving Truthes. The Difference betwixt</hi> Joy <hi>and</hi> Gladneſſe <hi>in</hi> Engliſh, Greek, <hi>and</hi> Latin.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe very <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Life Eternal</hi> would be of it ſelf ſufficient to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poize all the <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and all the grievances incident to this mortal life (by <hi>the one</hi> or <hi>other of which</hi> our ſouls and affections are withdrawn from purſuit of that happy and bleſſed life, which hath its beginning here on earth, but hath no End in Heaven;) were the Belief of <hi>it</hi> firmly rooted in our ſouls. If any man ſwerve from the wayes of righteouſneſs, whether in the <hi>General courſe</hi> of his life, or in <hi>particular Acts,</hi> it is through want of <hi>this Hope</hi> either in the <hi>Act</hi> or in the <hi>Habit.</hi> The want of this <hi>Hope</hi> in the Habit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from habitual want of our <hi>ſpiritual Taſt:</hi> The want of the ſame <hi>Hope</hi> in <hi>particular Acts</hi> proceeds from the interruption of this <hi>Taſt</hi> in ſuch as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have been partakers of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3539" facs="tcp:32220:128"/>
The chief part then of our Miniſtery is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To plant <hi>This Taſt: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> To preſerve <hi>it</hi> in our hearers. In <hi>theſe Two</hi> conſiſts <hi>Tota Ars Medendi;</hi> the whole method of ſpiritual Phyſick. The objects of our <hi>ſpiritual Taſt</hi> are <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> for in <hi>theſe two</hi> conſiſts the Kingdom of God (as was obſerved before out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17.) Without <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> there is no <hi>Peace;</hi> Without <hi>Peace</hi> of conſcience, there is no <hi>Joy.</hi> Firſt (then) of <hi>Peace:</hi> Secondly of <hi>Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Under the name of <hi>Peace,</hi> All bleſſings ſpiritual are included: <hi>It is the Fruit of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>the Root or ſtemme of Joy.</hi> The beſt tydings, which the Angels could bring unto the people at our Saviours birth, were tydings of <hi>Joy;</hi> And in their <hi>hymn,</hi> after they had aſcribed <hi>Glory to God,</hi> they declare the Original of this <hi>Joy</hi> to be <hi>Peace</hi> on earth, and Good-will towards men. The beſt Legacie which our Saviour had to beſtow upon his Apoſtles before his death (after he had, as it were, made his <hi>laſt Will and Teſtament)</hi> was <hi>Peace, John</hi> 14. 27 <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth give I unto you, Let not your heart be troubled, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let it be afraid.</hi> And at his firſt appearance to his Diſciples being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together after his Reſurrection, he came and ſtood in the midſt of them, and ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 19. <hi>Peace be with you.</hi> And after he had ſhewed them his hands and his ſide, he ſaid to them again, <hi>Peace be unto you, ver.</hi> 21. The ſame <hi>Salutation</hi> is recorded by Saint <hi>Luke Chap.</hi> 24. 36. And this <hi>Salutation</hi> is continued to the Church as the ſum and brief of all good things which we can deſire for our ſelves or wiſh to others. <hi>Peace be to this Houſe and to all that dwell in it,</hi> Be the very ſolemn words, which, <hi>The Prieſt</hi> going to viſit the ſick, is, by the appointment of our Church, <hi>to take with him,</hi> and <hi>to ſay</hi> when he enters into the ſick perſons houſe. And this (I ſuppoſe) is injoyned, not ſo much with reference to <hi>The like form of Salutation</hi> commonly uſed among the Jewes, as, either in <hi>Imitation</hi> of that <hi>Form of Bleſsing</hi> preſcribed by our Saviour; or (rather) in obedience and obſervation of that Precept given by Him <hi>(Matth.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 5.) <hi>Salute the Houſe ye enter into:</hi> and, <hi>Say, Peace be to this Houſe.</hi> And ſo likewiſe (by the Churches Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) we conclude our prayers, <hi>The peace of God</hi> (that is,) The <hi>Peace</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Kingdom of God conſiſts) <hi>which paſſeth all underſtanding keep your harts and minds in the knowledge of God and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> The Form of this <hi>Bleſsing</hi> is taken from our Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. And therein we do but pray for that which the Apoſtle promiſeth (in Gods name) to the <hi>Philippians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But if this <hi>Peace</hi> (as our Apoſtle there ſpeakes) ſurpaſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, how ſhall we ſeek after it or diſcover the nature of it? or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">How the Peace of God paſſeth all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> of that joy in the holy Ghoſt, which is the fruit of it? Or is this <hi>Peace</hi> and this <hi>Ioy</hi> (one, or both of them) that <hi>New Name</hi> (written in the white ſtone <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 17.) Which Chriſt promiſeth to give to him that overcometh, which no man knoweth ſaving he which hath it? For <hi>Anſwer,</hi> we ſay, This <hi>Peace</hi> ſurpaſſeth the underſtanding of all men, who are not acquainted with it; But if it muſt <hi>keep our hearts, and minds through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſure we muſt have an experimental knowledge of it; we muſt feel and perceive it. So in effect the <hi>Prophet Eſay</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Eſay</hi> 64. 4. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of any man the things which God hath prepared for them which love him.</hi> But all this is to be underſtood of the <hi>Natural Man,</hi> or of the man as yet not partaker of the ſpirit of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For as the Apoſtle tels us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>God hath revealed theſe things even unto us by his ſpirit; for the ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things</hi>
                  <pb n="3540" facs="tcp:32220:129"/>
                  <hi>of God.</hi> And Again, ver. 12. <hi>We have received, not the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit, which is of God; that we may know the things, that are freely given to us of God.</hi> The ſame ſpirit gives us a true relliſh of that Peace whence theſe joys do ſpring.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if ſuch as have the <hi>Taſt</hi> or Relliſh of it know it better by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, then they can by any <hi>Map</hi> or deſcription of it; How ſhall we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade ſuch as do not know it to ſeek after it? Or what deſcription ſhall we make of it, to bring them in love with it? The beſt Deſcription, which we can make of it, muſt be taken from <hi>the known ſweetneſſe of Temporal Peace,</hi> which is but the Emblem or ſhadow of it. And the ſweetneſs of Civil peace is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes much better known, much better eſteemed <hi>Carendo, quam Fruendo,</hi> by ſome interpoſition of want, then by continual fruition of it. <hi>A conſuet is nulla fit paſsio.</hi> We of this land, which have longer enjoyed Civil Peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, then any Nation in the world beſides, have not ſo true a relliſh of the ſweetneſs of it, as moſt of our neighbor Nations, which, within theſe few years have often felt the bitterneſs of warre, as well domeſtick or Civil, as Forraign. Neceſſary therefore it will be for us, which neither have ſeen or felt the enemies Sword for theſe Threeſcore years and more, to uſe <note place="margin">This was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thirtie years ago, or more.</note> ſome <hi>Fiction of Warre</hi> for right conceiving the ſweetneſs even of <hi>Civill Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Imagine then we lived in ſuch a Land or State, as the State of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in the dayes, <hi>wherein Eſaias</hi> prophecied, or in the dayes <hi>whereof</hi> he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, Chap. 9. ver. 19. 20. <hi>Through the wrath of the Lord of hoſts is the Land darkened, and the People ſhall be as the fewel of the fire, no man ſhall ſpare his brother: And he ſhall ſnatch on the right hand, and be hungry, and he ſhall eat on the left hand, and ſhall not be ſatisfied, they ſhall eat every man the fleſh of his own arm; Manaſſes</hi> ſhall be ready to devour <hi>Ephraim</hi> his brother Tribe, and <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s intentions againſt him ſhall be as cruel, and yet both, like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> brethren only in miſchief and cruelty, ſhall conſpire to ruinate <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> the ſoveraign Tribe of that people.</p>
               <p>Thus imagine the Port Towns in this Kingdom were noyſom neighbors to one another by ſea, one Shire or Province ready to make inroads or invaſion upon another: or every mans hand in the ſame Town or Shire to be lift up againſt his neighbor, or that a mans worſt enemies were of his own houſe: So many Servants, Inmates or Sojourners, ſo many Theeves; the children rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to rob and ſpoil their parents without hope of redreſs by ordinary proceſs of wholſome Laws; Might ſtill overcoming Right.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, imagine a forraign potent Enemie lying ſtill in wait to take all advantages, which theſe civil broils or inteſtine diſſenſions afford for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing the whole State or Nation, for bringing the Nobles into Captivity, for putting ſuch, as made reſiſtance, unto the ſword; to put their children to death before their parents eyes, and to abuſe the bodies of the wives and daughters of ſuch as put themſelves upon their courteſie.</p>
               <p>If, unto a State or Kingdom in this diſtreſs or perplexitie through civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion and domeſtick broils, any hope of <hi>Peace</hi> and unitie amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could be truly ſuggeſted, how beautiful would the feet of ſuch as brought theſe glad tydings be? And if theſe hopes were ſeconded with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable ſucceſs, I leave it to your mature conſideration, what publick joy and exultation would enſue; Every man would be ready to bear his part in that ſong.</p>

Now though civil and inteſtine broyls are much worſe then open war with a forraign Enemy; yet the moſt perfect patern of miſery, which we can frame unto our ſelves, as effects of civil diſſenſions within any City or Kingdom, is but a <hi>Model</hi> or picture of that inteſtine war, which every man (if we take him in the ſtate of nature, or before he be reconciled to God through Chriſt) may find within himſelf, within his own ſoul and affections. For, <hi>Every Man is a little World</hi> or Common-wealth, and the leſs the ſtate or ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty is, wherein civil diſſenſion is bred and nouriſhed, the more grievous it is. It is more dangerous when fire doth kindle in the ſame ſtreet or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor houſes, then when it it kindles afar off, though in the ſame Town; but when the houſe wherein we dwell is ſet on fire, the danger is greateſt. But moſt bitter and grievous is that diſſenſion or diſtraction, which is bred and nouriſhed in the <hi>ſame breſt,</hi> as either between the affections and paſſions, <note place="margin">The Tumult and diſcord of Paſſions in a natural man.</note> which lodge in the ſenſitive part; or between them and the reaſonable ſoul or conſcience; or the perpetual conflict between the fleſh and the ſpirit.

                  <q>And the fruits of this Peace are pithily deſcribed by the Prophet, <hi>When every man may ſit under his own Vine, and under his own Fig-tree;</hi> that is, (to give you the importance of this Proverbial ſpeech in plain Engliſh) When eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may reap the fruits of his own labors or imployments, or of the labors, imployments, or increaſe of other Creatures, which God hath put in ſubjection to him; when he may ſo reap them without moleſtation, without danger of annoyance.</q> It is not the Poſſeſſion of Lands, of Wares, or other good things whatſoever we are lawfully entitled unto, but the <hi>quiet Fruition</hi> or enjoying of them, which fills our hearts with gladneſs: To have a full Flock, and to be deprived of the milk and of the increaſe of it; to have a goodly Vineyard, and to be debarred from gathering the grapes of it, is matter of ſorrow and grief, <hi>A principal calamity of War:</hi> But to enjoy theſe and the like commodities, without danger or moleſtation, is a ſpecial <hi>Comfort of temporal or civil Peace.</hi> And in as much as no man can truly injoy thoſe good things (which he poſſeſſeth or hath right unto) but in time of <hi>civil Peace;</hi> Hence it is, that under the name of <hi>this Peace,</hi> all good things Temporal are contained, for without Peace we cannot enjoy them.</p>

How much more graciouſly doth God deal with thoſe that hearken to his Word, and obey the motions of his Spirit? We being by nature more dead unto the <hi>Fruit of holineſſe,</hi> and more deſtitute of <hi>ſpiritual Life,</hi> then the <hi>Vine</hi> or <hi>Fig-tree</hi> is of the <hi>Life ſenſitive,</hi> he infuſeth a new ſenſe or Taſt into our ſouls, and makes them more fruitful then the Fig-tree, which is never without fruit, either ripe or green; and makes us withall <hi>ſenſible partakers</hi> of the ſweetneſs, of all the Fruit, which <hi>his Spirit</hi> bringeth forth in us; and from the Taſt of this <hi>Fruit of Holineſſe</hi> ariſeth that <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Gladneſſe of ſpirit,</hi> which is the pledge and earneſt of Eternal Life.</p>

Whereas the contemplation of the <hi>myſtery of godlineſs</hi> (ſo it be frequent and ſerious) doth alwayes imprint and inſtill the ſweet influence of life and joy into our ſouls.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of humane Sciences, as it may be comprehended by the wit of man; So it is terminated with this life: But the knowledge of Chriſt, or rather Chriſt himſelf (who is the ſubject of divine knowledge) is an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible fountain of truth, whoſe Current ſtill, even in this life, increaſeth as our capacities to receive it increaſe, and ſo ſhall increaſe in the world to come without ſtint or reſtraint. For the fruit or iſſue of it, as you heard before, is everlaſting life, and that is a life, which hath a beginning here on earth, but ſhall have no end in heaven.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Fruits of Holineſſe</hi> (as hath been ſaid) are <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and in the Fruition of this Peace and Joy, conſiſts that <hi>Taſt of Eternal Life,</hi> which in this world can be had. And this Taſt muſt be perfected and eſtabliſhed by the Knowledge of Chriſt, and him crucified. Which Knowledge hath been the Main Subject both of my private Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of my labors publiſhed in the ſeventh book of Commentaries upon the Creed.</p>
               <p>We are now to inquire, how this <hi>Taſt of Eternal Life</hi> muſt be preſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <note place="margin">How this taſt'd of eternal life is preſerved.</note> 
                  <hi>The Rule</hi> is moſt true in the <hi>General; That it muſt be preſerved and perfected</hi>
                  <pb n="3548" facs="tcp:32220:133"/>
                  <hi>by the ſame means, by which it was firſt planted,</hi> and that is, <hi>by the Knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> So that it is but One Queſtion how the knowledge of Chriſt may be perfected in us, and how this Taſt of eternal life may be preſerved. The next Particular ſubordinate unto this General, is, <hi>by what means ſuch as either have, or might have had, the Taſt of Eternal Life, come to be deprived of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A great Queſtion not impertinent to this inquiry hath been of late; <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith or Grace being once had may be loſt, or whether loſt only for a time, or for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, as I have often told you, there is more Contention about this Point amongſt modern Writers, then Contradiction between their Opinions; if <note place="margin">Of queſtions touching fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from Grace.</note> they would calmly and diſtinctly expreſs their meaning.</p>
               <p>That from <hi>ſome Degree of Faith,</hi> or from <hi>ſome kind of Grace</hi> a man may fall, no man denies. That no man can fall from the Grace of Election or Predeſtination, I do not queſtion. And further then This, it is not ſafe for any to be peremptory in any Poſitive Aſſertion; nor fit to diſpute without or beyond theſe Liſts. As for ſuch as take upon them to diſpute this or the like Queſtion, in theſe Terms: <hi>[Whether a man may fall from ſaving Grace]</hi> they bring it in the end to an iſſue untriable in this life, at leaſt on their parts. For admit it for a truth (which ſome do queſtion) that a man may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>(Certitudine Fidei)</hi> by the certainty of Faith, of his preſent eſtate in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace; Yet no man knows anothers heart; he hath no taſt or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledge of thoſe gifts and graces, which God beſtows upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: yet unleſs he know the nature and quality of thoſe Gifts and Graces, wherwith others are indowed, as he doth the nature &amp; quality of thoſe Graces, wherewith his own heart is ſeaſoned; it will be impoſsible for him to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether the Graces, which God hath beſtowed upon him, be for their nature or ſpecifical quality the very ſame with thoſe, which others have had, and finally loſe them. Yea, whether the Grace, whereby one man is finally ſaved, be for ſpecifical quality the ſame with that, by which another is ſaved. Only this we know and believe, <hi>That whoſoever is ſaved, is ſaved only by the free grace of God,</hi> not as it is a <hi>Quality inherent in us, but as it unites us unto Chriſt,</hi> who is the Author and Fountain of all heavenly Gifts and Graces. As for the particular manner how God doth work <hi>in us,</hi> or <hi>by us;</hi> me thinks the Obſervation of the Wiſe King might long ſince have put a Period to all the curious diſputes of this Age. So he ſaid, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>As thou knoweſt not what is the way of the ſpirit</hi> (by the Spirit, I take it he means <hi>Vis Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix) nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her, that is with child: even ſo thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, either this or that, or whether they both ſhall be alike good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore, to wave all theſe and the like Curious Queſtions, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther breed Contention then Edification, we will build this Diſcourſe upon theſe Two ſure Foundations.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Illumination of our minds and Spirits, that the Taſt of the heavenly Gift, the participation of the Holy Ghoſt, the relliſh of the good Word of God, and of the Powers of the Life to come, are all of them True Graces of God through Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Second,</hi> That from theſe Graces ſome men have fallen, and may yet fall both totally and finally.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The former Principle, to wit, That the participation of the Holy Ghoſt, the Taſt of the heavenly Gift, &amp;c. are Graces of God through Jeſus Chriſt; none but a <hi>Pelagian</hi> will queſtion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> That from theſe Graces a man may fall both totally and
<pb n="3549" facs="tcp:32220:133"/>
finally, no Chriſtian ſhould queſtion. For, it is ſuppoſed by our Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6, 7. For no man fals into the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, but he which hath had theſe Graces, and is fallen from them. But ſhall we hence conclude, that every one, which hath had the Taſt of the Good Word of God, and of the powers of the Life to come, and loſeth it for a while, or for a long time, doth thereby fall into the Sin againſt the holy Ghoſt? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid! <hi>It is not every falling away from theſe Gifts and Graces, but a falling from them into Apoſtacie,</hi> which makes up the meaſure of that irremiſſible ſin. It is not every ſin, but the ſin of blaſphemie againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable. And blaſphemie againſt the Holy Ghoſt alwayes includes a ſlanderous diſpoſition againſt the wayes of truth, a renunciation of Chriſt as their Redeemer, and a back-ſliding either into Atheiſm, Judaiſm, or Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſm.</p>
               <p>Now many there be, who live a diſſolute and ungodly life, whoſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are as bad as may be, which yet do not ſlander the way of truth, which do <note place="margin">See the Authors Opinion more fully about <hi>Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Book 8. Chap. 3. which Book, though publiſhed 21. years ſince, I ſuppoſe, was written after This.</note> not ſo much as wiſh in heart, much leſs profeſs themſelves to be Jews, Turks, or Mahumetans, rather then the Diſciples of Chriſt. Nor do all, which ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt, and his profeſſion fall into this unpardonable ſin, but only ſuch as have taſted of his Goodneſs, and afterwards fall from him, and ſpeak and think contumeliouſly of him, and of the Religion, which he hath taught us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The whole Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (ſome few excepted) did murmur againſt God and againſt his Servant <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet all that murmured were not cut off from ſeeing of that Good Land, but only thoſe, which had ſeen his wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> at the red Sea, and in the wilderneſs; and, being of years to lay them to heart, provoked him <hi>ten times,</hi> that is, as often as they had ſeen them. As the rejection of thoſe murmuring <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was a Type of ſuch as are Reprobated from the Kingdom of Heaven: So the ſin of thoſe, that were ſent to view the Land, was a peculiar Type or ſhadow of <hi>the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Theſe men, after they had ſeen this good and pleaſant Land, after they had taſted the fruits of it, brought a malicious ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon it, that it was a Land, which ate up its own Inhabitants, that it was not worth the pains and danger, which they were to undertake in encountering the <hi>Anakims</hi> and others, which were much ſtronger then they, and would not be put out of their own poſſeſſions, but by ſtrong hand and much blood on both parts. In this manner, if any man, after God hath endowed him with <hi>the heavenly Gift,</hi> and with <hi>the Taſt of the Powers of the Life to come,</hi> ſhall ſo farre fall away from Chriſt, as to think that the promiſes of that Bleſſed Life are not worthy of that ſpiritual warfare, without which it cannot be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; unworthy of that ſincerity and integrity of life, which is peremptorily enjoyned all that ſeek after it; And in this reſolution, rather, in this want of true Reſolution, <hi>for ſake the Church of God</hi> and <hi>deſpite the Spirit of Grace,</hi> he by thus doing, fals into <hi>this irremiſsible ſin.</hi> But as our Apoſtle ſaith unto theſe <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſo may I ſay of you, <hi>I hope better things of you;</hi> yea I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all and every of you are free from this ſin. None of you can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ignorance of the wayes of Life: Let me therefore exhort you in the words of our Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 11, 12. <hi>This we deſire, that every one of you ſhew all diligence to the full aſſurance of hope, unto the end: that you be not ſlothful followers of them, which through faith and patience inherit the promiſe.</hi> Or, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Give all diligence to make your election ſure:</hi> Not by way of Syllogiſm, but by good Practiſe and Converſation.</p>

4. Reaſon not thus with your ſelves;</p>
               <q>
                  <l>He that hath once taſted of ſaving Grace cannot loſe the tast of it.</l>
                  <l>But I have taſted of ſaving Grace:</l>
                  <l>Therefore I cannot loſe the Taſt of it.</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God doth not promiſe the Kingdom of Heaven to ſubtil diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but to faithful practiſers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider how eaſie a matter it will be for Satan, when temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ariſe, to ſhake all the joynts of the former Syllogiſm, and to diſsipate and break the <hi>Jamor Propoſition [He that once taſted of ſaving Grace cannot loſe it]</hi> into ſhivers. For, <hi>That</hi> (in any ordinary or intelligible ſenſe) is <hi>ſaving Grace,</hi> from which, if a man do not fall (or loſe the taſt of it) he ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, without addition of any other Grace beſides that, which it is ſuppoſed he hath. Is it then apparent, that a man may <hi>fall from that Grace,</hi> or loſe the <hi>Taſt of that Grace,</hi> in which, if he did continue, or not loſe the <hi>Taſt</hi> of it, he ſhould be ſaved? Yes! This is as clear as the day light. For whoſoever doth continue in the <hi>Participation of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or doth not loſe <hi>the Taſt of the heavenly Gift,</hi> or <hi>of the Powers of the World to come,</hi> ſhall never periſh, ſhall be ſaved. Impoſſible it is that any man ſhould enter into the eſtate of death, or of reprobation, ſo long as he hath the Taſt of the life to come implanted in his heart and ſpirit: and this is for nature and quality <hi>ſaving Grace.</hi> But ſome that have <hi>taſted of this Grace,</hi> do utterly loſe the <hi>taſt</hi> of it, and ſo <hi>fall from Grace</hi> in it ſelf ſufficient to ſave their ſouls. For though all that loſe <hi>this taſt</hi> do not <hi>ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> yet no man can <hi>ſin againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost</hi> until he loſe <hi>this taſt;</hi> and yet no man can loſe <hi>this taſt,</hi> but he that hath had it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Concluſion</hi> then is moſt <hi>pregnant,</hi> that it is more poſſible, or a ſhorter paſſage, for a man to <hi>fall from ſeving Grace,</hi> or to loſe the <hi>taſt of it,</hi> then to ſin <hi>againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The moſt uſeful meditations then will be to diſcover the Means, whereby ſuch as once have had the <hi>tast of the heavenly Grace,</hi> do come to loſe it, with their ſeveral degrees, and theſe are divers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is to be ſuppoſed that God doth by his Spirit infuſe <hi>this tast</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mens ſouls, not continually or unceſſantly, But, as we ſay, by Fits or Turns: <note place="margin">They only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy and keep this Taſt, that diligently ſeek after it and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prize it.</note> This <hi>taſt of the powers of the Life to come</hi> is ſometimes <hi>Tranſient;</hi> we cannot have it when we liſt; but muſt expect Gods providence, and attend his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for the renewing of it, and crave the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, for produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it, by humble ſupplication and prayer. <hi>Want of the due eſteem of it whilſt we have it; negligence in the duty of prayer and other Godly exerciſes, doth deprive us of it, when we might have had it renewed in us;</hi> God doth not promiſe that any ſhall injoy this pearl beſides ſuch as diligently ſeek after it: And when they have found it <hi>(or rather when it hath found them)</hi> do duly prize it. And as this Taſt of eternal life is often for a time loſt, or much prejudiced by meer negligence in ſacred duties, ſo it may be choaked and ſtifled by errors or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwaſions, which inſinuate themſelves into mens thoughts or phantaſies, after they have been partakers of it.</p>
               <p>Many there be, which will unfeignedly acknowledge that the pledge or <hi>Earneſt of Eternal Life,</hi> which they have received, is of more worth and value <note place="margin">The danger of ſeeking to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy worldly Contentments, together with this heavenly Taſt.</note> then all the pleaſures or contentments of this world, which can oppoſe or counterſway the deſires of it; And yet the ſame men (through the ſleights and ſubtilty of Satan) play but the Sophiſters with their own ſouls; Thus Aſſuming or Reſolving; That albeit <hi>the taſt of the heavenly Gift</hi> be more to
<pb n="3551" facs="tcp:32220:134"/>
be deſired, then all the temporal contentments, which are incompatible with it; yet <hi>the Taſt</hi> of theſe heavenly joyes, and the contentments of this life, which may be enjoyed with it, are better then it alone; for One good how little ſoever, being added to another how great ſoever, makes ſome addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">See this Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in <hi>Ariſtotles Rhetor.</hi>
                  </note> of goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus many covetous men, and oppreſſors will eaſily be perſwaded, that they may increaſe their temporal eſtate without any forfeiture of their eſtate in Gods ſpiritual bleſsings. The ambitious or aſpiring mind thinks he may glorifie God more by his high place or dignitie in Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, then by continuing a private and retired life. As for the drunkard, the glutton, and the laſcivious man, they ſeldom are perſwaded that they may continue their wonted courſes and enjoy the <hi>Taſt of the heavenly</hi> Gift. And for this reaſon, many that have been ſubject to theſe ſins, have been more eaſily won to the love of truth and of ſaving grace, then the Proud, the Covetous, the Ambitious or Envious men are, becauſe the one in his ſober thoughts fore-ſees the danger and acknowledgeth his ſins, whereas the other rejoyceth continually in his courſes without ſuſpition of danger,</p>
               <p n="6">6. Or if the covetous or ambitious mind ſometimes ſuſpects his wayes, yet being ingaged to purſue them, leſt he might be thought to have varied in his courſe of life, the beſt repentance, which he uſually attains unto, is but like his in the <hi>Poet</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>If I were to begin the world again, I ſhould happily make choice of another kind of life, but being ingaged, the next point is to make the beſt of that courſe of life, which I have choſen.</hi> And yet the more he makes of it, the worſe he ſpeeds in it in the <hi>main chance,</hi> the more he prejudiceth the <hi>Habitual</hi> or <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Taſt</hi> of Eternal life; for the more we are accuſtomed to any courſe of life, the more we delight in it and are weaned from it with greater difficultie. And yet we muſt be weaned even from the world it ſelf, before we can rightly <hi>Taſt</hi> the <hi>ſincere milk</hi> of the Goſpel, or be capable of that <hi>ſtrong meat,</hi> which is contained in this <hi>Article of Eternal Life,</hi> and others concerning Chriſt, by which <hi>The Taſt of this Life</hi> muſt be fed and nouriſhed. So that of all ſins, pride, covetouſneſs and Ambition are the moſt dangerous; both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be of more credit or leſs infamie in the world; and becauſe they multiply their Acts the moſt, and may work unceſſantly.</p>
               <p>But though it be for the moſt part as true of theſe times, wherein we live, as it was in the days of our Saviours converſation here on earth, <hi>that Publicans and open ſinners are oftentimes neerer to the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> then many, which live a more ſober or civil life, but yet are covetous, vain-glorious, or envious, as the Scribes and Phariſees were; yet there is no man, that ſets his heart <hi>to Taſt of any unlawful pleaſures,</hi> though of thoſe pleaſures, which in his ſober thoughts he condemnes, but doth hereby weaken or <hi>dead his Taſt of the food of Life,</hi> and make himſelf ſubject to former temptations, <note place="margin">Taſt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful pleaſures deads and looſeth the heavenly Taſt.</note> whenſoever they ſhall aſſault him.

               <p>Thus much the heathens had obſerved by light of nature; and what <note place="margin">Unlawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acts deſtroy the heavenly taſt both by Efficiency and Demerit,</note> they ſpeak of morally <hi>Vicious Habits</hi> or cuſtomes, is moſt true of wicked or ungodly practiſes or cuſtomes; for beſides this; that every ſinful Act (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be committed out of deliberation or choice) doth increaſe the ſtrength of the Habit or implanted deſire, whence it flowes, it doth withall provoke <hi>God who is the giver of every good and perfect gift, the only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of men from ſin</hi> and wickedneſs, both to revoke thoſe good gifts, which he hath given them, and to withdraw the influence of his reſtraining Grace from them; according to the Tenor of our Saviours words, <hi>And from him that hath not, ſhall be taken even that which he hath:</hi> And thoſe once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away,</p>
               <q>Tunc vaga proſiliet froenis natura remotis.</q>
               <p>Our natural corrupt deſires run further ryot on a ſuddain, then, whilſt we were in the courſe of nature, they ordinarily did, or could have done; and become ſo far exorbitant, that men either loſe <hi>the Taſt of the heavenly Gift altogether,</hi> or cannot be reclaimed by it, without the aſſiſtance of ſome <hi>new Grace</hi> or <hi>heavenly Gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A queſtion there is amongſt the School Divines, <hi>whether any actual ſin, how groſſe ſoever, can expell or extinguiſh grace by natural efficacy</hi> (as cold expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, or moyſture quencheth, heat) <hi>or only by way of Demerit.</hi> 
                  <q>That by way of <hi>Demerit,</hi> vitious Acts may quench <hi>this Taſt of eternal life,</hi> all do grant; that is, They may and do provoke God, who is the giver of all Grace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to withhold that Grace, which otherwiſe he would beſtow upon ſuch men, or to take away ſuch Graces from them, as he hath already beſtowed upon them.</q> But that any vicious Acts or Habits ſhould expell Grace after the ſame manner, as one vicious moral habit doth expell the contrary vertue (as drunkenneſs doth expell ſobriety, or as intemperance in any kind doth temperance) this ſome great School-men deny or queſtion. But, leaving theſe curious and inextricable diſputes, we will hold our ſelves only to ſuch uſeful Queries as fall under our former Aym or Level.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The moſt uſeful query</hi> in this caſe is, <hi>Whether it be ordinarily poſsible, that the Taſt of the heavenly Gift, or of the powers of the life to come</hi> (where it hath been <note place="margin">How worldly pleaſures and temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments come to prevail againſt the taſt of Eternal life.</note> once planted) <hi>can be prejudiced by the propoſal of any temporal contentment, whilſt they ſtand in actual competition, or whilſt we deliberate whether the purſuit of the one be to be preferred (for the preſent) to the other.</hi> That any man, which hath any True Notion or relliſh of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> ſhould be ſwayed to follow the wayes of Death, otherwiſe then through incogitancy,
<pb n="3553" facs="tcp:32220:135"/>
or want of actual conſideration, may juſtly ſeem moſt improbable, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. For he that truly apprehends or relliſheth the ſweet <hi>Fruits of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> the <hi>Peace of Conſcience, Joy in the Holy Ghost</hi> (of if any other pledge there be of Eternal Life) cannot but acknowledge, that <hi>Theſe</hi> are more worth then any temporal Contentment, which can come in Competition with <hi>them.</hi> Now it is a meer madneſs to make choice of a <hi>Leſſer Good before a Greater,</hi> ſo long as it is actually apprehended or acknowledged to be Greater: there muſt be a defect or intermiſſion in the precedent Deliberation before any man can be overtaken with this kind of madneſs. Carnal contentments we apprehend or relliſh by our natural faculties; <hi>Peace of Conſcience</hi> or ſpiritual joy are <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Faculties natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> Two Scales.</note> apprehended or relliſhed only by <hi>Grace;</hi> and theſe <hi>two ſeveral apprehenſive Faculties are as the two Scales</hi> in a Balance: Whence, it may ſeem as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for one that hath a true apprehenſion or relliſh of <hi>ſpiritual Good</hi> to be over-ſwayed to the contrary evil with any temporal Contentment, which for the preſent can be preſented to his deliberation, as for a greater weight being put in the one ſcale of the balance to be over-poized by a leſſer weight put in the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Compariſon,</hi> I confeſs, if it be rightly weighed, will hold moſt exactly: If the <hi>Scales be even or equipendent,</hi> and the <hi>Beam</hi> or Balance be equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, it is impoſſible that a leſſer weight put into the one Scale ſhould coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoize a greater; But in Caſe the beam or balance be unequally divided, that is, if one part be longer then the other, a leſſer weight put in that Scale, which hath the longer part of the balance, will over-poize a farre greater weight put into the other Scale.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This was an uſual kind of Couſenage in ancient times, practiſed by ſuch as ſold coſtly wares, and was excellently diſcovered by <hi>Ariſtotle in his Mechanical Queſtions.</hi> The truth of his diſcovery is moſt apparent in the <hi>Ancel Weight</hi> or Balance (which moſt of you have ſeen) wherein one pound weight put upon the one end of the Balance, will counterpoize a ſtone weight put upon the other end. And the inequality between the ſeveral por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame Beam or balance may be ſuch, that a ſtone weight being put upon the one end will fetch back a hundred ſtone weight being put upon the other.</p>
               <p>From this <hi>Experimental Principle</hi> did the great Mathematician, <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> ground that Aſſertion, which ſeemed a Paradox. <hi>Da ubi conſiſtam, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volvam terram.</hi> If he might chuſe his diſtance or ſtanding place he would roule the whole earth about by his own ſtrength. As imagine the Line (which goes from the Center of the earth unto that part of the heavens, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our heads, and through it) were as firm and ſtrong as a pillar of braſs or ſteel, the ſtrength of one mans arm placed in the higheſt Heaven, or in ſuch a place, as this Mathematician deſired to have footing in, might poize or turn about the whole earth and all the creatures in it.</p>
               <p>The former diſcovery of falſhood in viſible and material balances is clear to ſenſe, and may be demonſtrated to reaſon; but the heart of man is more deceitful then any balance, and the deceit of it was never diſcovered either by the Mathematician, or by the Philoſopher, nor is it diſcernable without dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent circumſpection to a mans own ſelf. <q>The deceit in the General herein conſiſts, That, Albeit, the apprehenſive Faculties, by which we diſcern ſpiritual Joy, and temporal Contentments, be, to our ſeeming, as equally ſet as any two Scales in a balance can be, or though our actual apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of matters ſpiritual be for the preſent more lively and quick, then our apprehenſions of temporal contentment: yet our habitual propenſion or
<pb n="3554" facs="tcp:32220:136"/>
cuſtomary inclination to ſome temporal pleaſures or delights may be much greater then our propenſion or inclination to any ſpiritual good.</q> And yet this exorbitant propenſion or inclination unto things temporal, may be inſenſibly contracted, and the ſtrength for a long time not apprehended, not ſuſpected by us. As bad humors gather (unwittingly to us) in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and grow to a deadly or deſperate iſſue before we apprehend any danger: ſo may our propenſions or affections, to ſome earthly vanity or other, increaſe and multiply, before we apprehend their ſtrength or ſtiffeneſs. And in this Caſe alone, when our natural propenſions or affections to any temporal Contentment, exceed our propenſions to <hi>ſpiritual Joy or Peace of Conſcience;</hi> a temporal and <hi>momentary good</hi> being propoſed to our <hi>Actual or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate choice,</hi> may over-ſway the greateſt ſpiritual Good, which we can for the preſent oppoſe unto it; ſuch a Good, as before this temptation did ariſe, we would have choſen before any temporal Contentment, which we did actually apprehend, or could think of.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If it be further demanded, <hi>Whether in this Caſe a leſſer Good may be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen before a Greater;</hi> or <hi>whether this can happen without ſome ſpice of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhould frame our Anſwer by the former Compariſon between a leſſer weight and a greater being put into the <hi>even Scales</hi> of an <hi>unequal balance;</hi> That the leſſer weight ſhould over-poize the Greater it were unpoſſible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the propenſion of that part of the Balance, wherein the leſſer weight is put, did further exceed the propenſion of the other part, wherein the greater weight was put, then the greater weight doth the leſſer, ſuppoſing they were to be weighed not in <hi>even Scales</hi> only, but in an <hi>equal balance.</hi> If the greater weight (or material to be weighed) have the ſame <hi>Proportion</hi> to the leſs, that <hi>Six</hi> hath to <hi>Four,</hi> and the one part of the Balance, wherein the leſſer weight is put, have the ſame <hi>Proportion</hi> of length or propenſion, which ſix hath to four, neither ſhall over-poize other. But if the propenſions of the ſeveral parts of the ſame balance have the ſame proportion that <hi>Seven</hi> hath to <hi>Four,</hi> Four Pounds put in the one ſcale will over-poize Six pounds put in the other. By the greater propenſion you are to underſtand not a greater declination or lower pendence of the one ſcale in reſpect of the other, but a greater facility or aptitude to be declined or moved downwards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> had long ago obſerved, that <hi>Circuli majores ſemper moven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiores,</hi> The greater compaſs the wheel hath, the more apt it is to be moved, and being once moved it moves more ſwiftly then a leſſer. And for the ſame reaſon the longer part of the ſame <hi>Diameter</hi> or beam in a Balance is more propenſe or apt to be moved then the ſhorter part, though the weight or ſtrength which poizeth both, be equal. For it moves not only by vertue of its own weight or ſtrength which poizeth it, but by the vertue of his own propenſion or inclination to be moved. Every further degree of its propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion or inclination to be moved falls into the ſame reckoning with the weight or ſtrength, which moves or poizeth it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſe is the ſame</hi> in the Queſtion propoſed between <hi>A Greater and a Leſſer Good,</hi> as between temporal Contentment and ſpiritual Joy, conſidered in the General; or between their ſeveral Branches. We muſt not compare the Objects or matters of the ſeveral Contentments only; for ſo it is evident that a leſſer Good is uſually choſen before a Greater: But we muſt conſider the Objects as they jump or meet with our propenſions or inclinations to them.</p>
               <p>Now albeit any branch of ſpiritual <hi>Goodneſs</hi> may be actually apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3555" facs="tcp:32220:136"/>
as <hi>much the better</hi> before it come to actual Competition or counterpoize with ſome temporal Good; yet if our propenſion to any branch of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good be greater then our propenſion to the contrary ſpiritual Good; the propenſion to the temporal good, when it meets with a ſutable Object, and opportunity to embrace it, is ſo Actuated and enlived <hi>by it,</hi> that it breaks out into a deſire; and the goodneſs of our deſire doth ſo intermingle it ſelf with the fore-apprehended goodneſs of the thing deſired, that they concurre as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to make up the ſame meaſure of Goodneſs, as a Crown of gold and a Crown of ſilver do to make up the ſame ſum of money. Whence, if Our deſire or propenſion to any temporal Contentment be greater then our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion to the former <hi>ſpiritual Good;</hi> the goodneſs of the Object deſired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added unto it will over-ſway our inclination to the <hi>ſpiritual Good;</hi> and however in the abſence of tempting Objects we eſteem the <hi>ſpiritual Good</hi> to be much greater then any temporal Contentment, yet the goodneſs of the deſire or propenſion to any temporal contentment, if it be exceſſive, after once it come to joyn with a leſſer Actual Good, will ſway our choice to that which is worſe, although there be no defect in the preſent Act of delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="11">11, <hi>Theſe Diſcuſsions</hi> though unto ſome they may ſeem too Curious, yet are they uſeful, and give us the true meaning of our Saviours Advice or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <note place="margin">Moderating of worldly deſires and natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for gaining and preſerving the heavenly taſt.</note> unto all that deſire to come unto him. <hi>If any man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26, 27. <hi>come to me and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Siſters, yea and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple: and whoſoever doth not bear his croſs, and come after me, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> And again, after two Similitudes and Parables premiſed, the One, <hi>Of a man intending to build a houſe;</hi> The Other, <hi>Of a King going to make war againſt another King;</hi> he concludes in the ſame words, ver. 33. <hi>So likewiſe whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> This is the firſt reckoning or account, which a Chriſtian muſt make before he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake <note place="margin">☜</note> that Sacred War againſt the Prince of this world, or before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate himſelf to be <hi>A ſpiritual Temple unto the Lord;</hi> otherwiſe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh both enterprizes raſhly and unadviſedly.</p>

But the Law concerning the obſervation of <hi>Lent,</hi> as well in reſpect of dyer, as of frequenting the houſe of God, is not of this or the laſt years ſtanding; it hath the warrant and cuſtome of the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> and the higheſt authoritie of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to give it countenance. And whilſt either the Church, or Lawes of the Kingdom do enjoyn you to do theſe things, which in themſelves are not unlawful, in <hi>obeying them you obey Gods Law, which commands obedience:</hi> in diſobeying them you diſobey the Lawes of God, which forbid diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the higher powers.

                  <hi>Eternal</hi> (as you have it verſe the 22.) is the <hi>End of Holineſſe,</hi> or of the ſervice of God.

Yet theſe Ends are Contrary the one to the other; and ſo are the wayes, which lead unto them.

But however <hi>ſin</hi> be injuſtice, and the <hi>author of ſin</hi> be moſt unjuſt; yet herein they both obſerve the Rule of Juſtice, that they pay their ſervants their wages <hi>to a mite:</hi> and unleſſe the righteous Judge did moderate their cruelty, they would pay their ſervants more then is their due. But doth not the <hi>Just Judge</hi> deal ſo with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?

               <p>This is or ſhould be the brief iſſue of that great Controverſie between the Romaniſts and Reformed Churches: <hi>An bona opera renatorum mereantur vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam aeternam.</hi> Whether the Good Works of men regenerate do deſerve or

               <p>To handle them (eſpecially in Pulpit) upon other occaſions, or to go out of our way to meet with them, is but to nurſe Contention.

               <p>Thoſe Anſwers, which are often given by Romaniſts unto other places of Scripture (alleadged by our Writers) will appear impertinent, if they be rightly examined by our Apoſtles Concluſion in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                     <hi>Fathers of the Church,</hi> and that albeit the ſame Word be not ſo <hi>frequent in the Scripture,</hi> yet the <hi>matter</hi> it ſelf, which <hi>the Fathers</hi> expreſſe by the word <hi>[mereri]</hi> is often intimated or neceſſarily implyed in <hi>Terms Equivalent;</hi> And if we agree upon the <hi>Matter,</hi> it is but a vanity to wrangle about Words.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Both points of their Allegation deſerve the ſcanning.</p>
               <p>To the Firſt, Concerning the word <hi>[mereri,</hi> or <hi>to merit]</hi> in the Latine Fathers; we reply, that as Coyns or metals inſtamped, ſo Words do change their value or importance in different Ages, and in ſeveral Nations: Cuſtom <note place="margin">Hor. de Arte.</note> hath as great authority in the one Caſe, as Soveraign power hath in the other. <hi>Mereri, to merit,</hi> imports as much (in the antient ſecular Roman or Latine Writers) as to deſerve that which we ſue for, or attain unto, or to have a <hi>juſt Title</hi> unto it: So a Souldier is ſaid to <hi>merit</hi> his pay, a ſervant his wages, and good States-men or Commanders in warre, their honours. But unto this pitch or ſcantling the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Writers,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtine, St. Jerome;</hi> or later, as St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> do not extend the word <hi>Merit: Mereri</hi> (according to their meanings) is no more then <hi>Aſſequi,</hi> that is, to attain or get that, which men deſire. So <hi>Turonenſis</hi> brings in a blind man ſupplicating to an Holy Man of his time, in this form <hi>[Ut poſsim per preces tuas mereri viſum;] that I may merit my ſight through your prayers.</hi> In which words, the word <hi>Mereri,</hi> to <hi>merit,</hi> can imply no more, either in the poor mans meaning, or in this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, then <hi>Aſſequi,</hi> to get or obtain. For no man can <hi>merit</hi> any thing by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers prayers: If theſe could properly <hi>merit</hi> or deſerve any thing at Gods hand, the <hi>merit</hi> ſhould be his, whoſe prayers God vouchſafed to hear; not his, for whom he prayed.</p>
               <p>The ſame word <hi>Mereri,</hi> with ſome Writers, doth not import ſo much as <hi>to obtain</hi> or get any thing at Gods hands, by vertue of our own or others pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but only <hi>to be an Occaſion</hi> or <hi>Condition,</hi> without which, that, which befals us, though not deſired by us, ſhould not have befallen us. So, (as we ſaid before) one ſpeaks of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, <hi>Felix peccatum quod talem meruit redempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi>
                  <pb n="3560" facs="tcp:32220:139"/>
O happy ſin, which merited ſuch a Redeemer! Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world, which could leſs deſerve any benefit at Gods hand then ſin, which yet was the Occaſion or Condition, without which the <hi>Son of God</hi> had not been incarnate, at leaſt had not been Conſecrated through Affliction to be our Redeemer. No Act or work of God, no not the firſt work of Creation, was of more free Gift or bounty (as the Romaniſts grant) or leſs <hi>merited</hi> (either <hi>de Condigno,</hi> or <hi>de Congruo</hi> by any work of ours) then the work of our Redemption. So that the word <hi>Merit,</hi> how often ſoever it be uſed by the <hi>Antient Latine Fathers,</hi> carries no weight to ſway us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conceipt of <hi>True Worth</hi> in our Works for the purchaſing of eternal life.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But what if the Holy Ghoſt ſpeak thus, in <hi>Formal</hi> or Equivalent <hi>Terms,</hi> as that <hi>Eternal life is the wages or ſtipend of our Works,</hi> or that our <hi>Works are worthy of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> or of the life to come? Shall we not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto him? Yes we will, if the Romiſh Church can prove unto us, that <hi>He</hi> thus ſpake or meant.

                  </gap>, or <hi>Merces,</hi> that is, a <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>ſtipend.</hi> Now our Saviour himſelf thus ſpeaketh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 11, 12. <hi>Bleſſed are you when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil against you falſely for my ſake: Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your Reward in heaven; for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> From <hi>this</hi> and the like places, they labor to infer, that the patience of <hi>Martyrs</hi> is <hi>meritorious</hi> of Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>To this and the like places, the Anſwer is eaſie: The Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. So our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, that the very <hi>Hypocrites</hi> (which do all their works to be ſeen of men, if they gain applauſe) have their <hi>Reward.</hi> Yet no man will ſay, that a diſſembler or hypocrite doth deſerve or merit this Reward, but rather pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And <hi>Rewards,</hi> we know, are ſometimes <hi>given freely, out of meer bountie and liberalitie,</hi> as well as by way of <hi>deſert</hi> or <hi>merit.</hi> Yea, it is not <hi>properly a Reward,</hi> unleſſe it be a Gratuitie or Largeſſe. That which a man works for upon Covenant, or that which he receives by way of hire, is not a <hi>Reward,</hi> but a juſt <hi>Pay</hi> or <hi>Stipend;</hi> and though it be moſt true, <hi>that God renders to every one according to all his wayes;</hi> yet in proprietie of ſpeech, he is ſaid to <hi>reward</hi> none, but thoſe whom he remembers in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and bountie. For ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that ſeek him;</hi> not ſo of ſuch as ſeek him not, for them he puniſheth; and no branch of puniſhment is any branch of Reward.</p>
               <p>This then we learn from our <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> That <hi>the firſt thing to be believed in all ages,</hi> is this, <hi>That there is a God:</hi> The <hi>ſecond,</hi> That <hi>this God is a Rewarder of thoſe that ſeek him.</hi> This truly infers, That <hi>His Reward is worth the ſeeking after,</hi> whether it be beſtowed upon us in this, or in the life to come: but it doth not infer, that our ſeeking after it, is <hi>meritorious,</hi> or worthy of the leaſt of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And though Eternal Life be the <hi>Beſt and Laſt Reward</hi> of ſuch as ſeek God, yet it is not the <hi>Only Reward</hi> that he beſtowes on them that ſeek him: yea he beſtowes Eternal Life, or the Life of Glorie upon none, upon whom he doth not firſt beſtow the <hi>Reward of Grace. The Kingdom of Grace is but the Entrance into the Kingdom of Glorie.</hi> And when we teach <hi>new Converts</hi> to

pray in the firſt Place for <hi>The Kingdom of Grace,</hi> and to pray for it, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Gift of God. Yea and the Romaniſts themſelves do grant, that no man can merit the Kingdom of Grace, which is properly the <hi>Reward</hi> of ſuch as ſeek God; ſo that all their Arguments, which they draw from this <hi>Topick,</hi> that <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">4. Their next chief <hi>Topick</hi> is, that <hi>Our works or endeavors are ſaid to be</hi> worthy <note place="margin">The Rom-third Argument.</note> 
                  <hi>of Eternal Life,</hi> and that in Canonical Scriptures.

If his leiſure had ſerved him to look upon the Circumſtances of the Text with his own eyes, he might clearly have ſeen, that our Saviour there ſpeaks <hi>not of Eternal Life, or of the Reward or Gift of God,</hi> but of that Hire, which is due unto the Preachers of the Goſpel from ſuch as are inſtructed in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The other Teſtimonies alledged by him, are more Pertinent, though not Concludent; And they are in number <hi>Three.</hi>

               <p>This laſt Teſtimony affords them <hi>A new Topick</hi> or Frame of Arguments, which they draw from this and the like places, wherein, <hi>The works or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Saints are aſſigned as True Cauſes, Why</hi> they enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.

Thus, when we come to the knowledge of the <hi>cauſe by the Effect; The effect is the cauſe of our knowledge of the cauſe:</hi> As others giving place unto him, or the carrying of the Enſignes of Authority before him, is not the <hi>cauſe</hi> why this or that man is the chief Magiſtrate for the time being, but rather, his being the chief Magiſtrate <hi>is the cauſe</hi> why all others give him place, and why the Enſignes of Authoritie are born before him. Yet theſe and the like <hi>Effects</hi> are the true <hi>cauſe</hi> or reaſon of a ſtrangers knowledge of him to be the chief Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>this Rule</hi> we are to interpret that ſaying of our Saviour <hi>many ſins are forgiven her, for ſhe loved much.</hi> In which ſpeech it may not be denied, but that the Particle, <hi>For,</hi> imports <hi>A true cauſe;</hi> yet <hi>no cauſe of the thing it ſelf,</hi> to wit, of her love. For this were utterly to reverſe or thwart our Saviours meaning, which was no other then this; <hi>That the forgiveneſſe of her ſins was the cauſe of her love:</hi> ſo was not her Love <hi>the cauſe</hi> of the forgiveneſs of her ſins, which by our adverſaries confeſſion being of <hi>Free Grace,</hi> and of the <hi>Firſt Grace</hi> which was beſtowed upon her, could not be <hi>merited</hi> or <hi>deſerved.</hi> Howbeit the manner of expreſſing of her loue by waſhing his feet with her tears, and wiping them with her hairs, was <hi>The true cauſe</hi> of every underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or <hi>Obſervant mans knowledge,</hi> that many ſins were forgiven her; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe had an apprehenſion of her manifold ſins thus freely forgiven her, ſhe could not have loved him ſo much, or made ſuch expreſſion of her Love.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

But if one ſhould further ask, <hi>Why the pardon being freely promiſed to all; the principal malefactors (it may be) are pardoned, or reſtored to their blood or advanced to dignities, whereas others which were included in the ſame pardon are exiled</hi> or put to death?

                  <hi>Truly cauſal,</hi> 
                  <q>if we ſhould ſay, the one part ſubmitted themſelves and craved allowance of their pardon, whereas the other ſtood out and rejected it.</q> For it is to be preſumed, that no Prince being able to quell his rebellious adverſaries will ſuffer any to enjoy the benefit of a General Pardon (how freely ſoever it be granted) unleſſe they ſubmit themſelves unto it, and crave the benefit of it, with ſuch humility as becomes malefactors or men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious. Much leſſe will he reſtore any to blood, or advance them to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, whom he knowes or ſuſpects ſtill to continue ill affected or diſloyal in heart. So then the not-ſubmiſſion or continuance in rebellion is <hi>The true and Poſitive Cauſe</hi> why the one ſort enjoy no benefit of the <hi>General Pardon,</hi> but are more ſeverely dealt withall for rejecting the princes Grace then they ſhould have been dealt withall if no Pardon had been granted. The humble ſubmiſſion of the other, and their penitence for their former miſdeeds, is <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> that is, a neceſſarie means or Condition, without which the Prince (how gracious ſoever) would not ſuffer them to enjoy the benefit of their Pardon, would not reſtore them to their blood, would not advance them to greater dignities.</p>
               <p>This is the very <hi>Caſe of Adam</hi> and all his ſons. All of us were <hi>Traytors and Rebels</hi> againſt the <hi>Great God and King of Heaven,</hi> who is better able to quell the whole hoſt of mankinde than any Prince his meaneſt Rebellious ſubjects; yet it pleaſed him to pardon us more freely then any earthly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate can do a malefactor. If then the reaſon be demanded, <hi>Why any of mankinde are ſaved?

               <p>But if it be further demanded <hi>Why ſome of mankinde enjoy the benefit of this Pardon, and inherit Eternal Life? Why others are ſentenced to everlaſting death:</hi> When as the <hi>free Pardon</hi> with its benefits were ſeriouſly and ſincerely tendred <hi>to all?</hi> The <hi>Anſwer is Orthodoxal</hi> and True; <hi>Becauſe</hi> ſome in true humilitie accepted of the <hi>Pardon</hi> and craved allowance of it: whereas others rejected it, and ſleighted ſuch Proclamations or ſignifications of it, as the God of mercy and compaſsion had given out, not to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that man only,</hi> but <hi>To all the World.</hi> So that the Omiſsion of thoſe good works which our Saviour mentions in the <hi>final ſentence,</hi> is <hi>the true cauſe</hi> why the wicked are excluded from all benefit of it. The performance of the ſame works (as feeding of the hungry, viſitation of the ſick &amp;c.) is the <hi>Inſtrumental cauſe, or means ſubordinate to the Principal cauſe,</hi> why Chriſts ſheep are ſuffered or admitted to enjoy the benefit of the ſame <hi>free Pardon;</hi> but <hi>no cauſe at all</hi> why the Pardon was proclaimed, or why the Kingdom of Heaven was prepared for them; <hi>For that was prepared for them from the Foundation of the world,</hi> before they had any Actual Being, before they could <hi>merit</hi> any thing at the hands of men, much leſſe at the hand of God, either <hi>de Congruo</hi> or <hi>de Condigno:</hi> For all <hi>merit</hi> ſuppoſeth ſome prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent work, and every work or operation preſuppoſeth Actual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <note place="margin">The <hi>Freeneſſe of the Pardon</hi> excludes not all qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requires ſincere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of good Duties.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. But how freely ſoever, the General pardon be iſſued out, or the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven be either promiſed or really beſtowed (and it is as freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowd or given as it is promiſed) the free gift, or beſtowing of it is ſo far from excluding <hi>all Qualifications</hi> in the parties on whom it is freely beſtowed: that <hi>it neceſſarily requires a ſincere performance of thoſe good duties,</hi> which are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the <hi>Final ſentence; Come ye bleſſed of my Father, for I was an hungry</hi>

The Second was, <hi>The Confirmation of the Doctrine joyntly maintained by all reformed Churches,</hi> which (for the preſent) we ſhall confirm from One place of Scripture (only, beſides the Words of the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.) and <note place="margin">Works not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but indeed Unworthy of eternal life.</note> that is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 18. <hi>I reckon</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, or I give it up as upon an account) <hi>that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are</hi> Not Worthy [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] <hi>to be compared with the glory, that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any Works of men Regenerate were Meritorious or Worthy of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, Theſe, by our adverſaries confeſſion, ſhould be the ſufferings of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs, ſpecially of ſuch Glorious Martyrs as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was; Yet Theſe he ſaith are not Worthy to be compared unto, or, are of no Worth in reſpect of the glory, that ſhall be revealed in us.</p>
               <p>But if the precious names of thoſe in <hi>Sardis,</hi> that is, the Saints there, were to walk with God Becauſe they were Worthy, how ſhall the ſufferings of St, <hi>Paul</hi> or of St. <hi>Peter</hi> be held Unworthy <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in no wiſe Worthy, or moſt unworthy of the glory, which was to be revealed in them? For this includes as much, if not ſomewhat more, then to walk with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is ready: The Sufferings of the Saints were not Unworthy in reſpect of Gods Free Grace or Mercie; not Unworthy of enjoying the benefit of his free Pardon, for all ſhall be excluded from it, that are Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it.</p>
               <p>But the grievous and moſt patient ſufferings of the Apoſtles themſelves are here adjudged by our Apoſtle to be altogether Unworthy of the Glory that ſhall be revealed, in reſpect of Gods Juſtice; Or if he ſhould enter into Judgment with them, after theſe three branches of Grace, Faith, Hope and Charity, had fructified in them.</p>
               <p>But have they no Anſwer to this Objection? Yes, <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine</hi> (the only man, which ever that Church had for traverſing the Teſtimonie or verdict of Scriptures, alleadged by our Writers) hath Two in ſtore, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two branches of one and the ſame anſwer. <q>His anſwer in General is this: That our Apoſtle in this place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. doth ſpeak of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of works done by juſt and holy men, not of the abſolute Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between them and the glory, which ſhall be revealed.</q> If we reſpect the Subſtance of their works, they are not equal, (for the one is momentany or temporal, and the other eternal) to the reward or gift of God which is eternal life or glory; yet, ſaith he, there is a true or juſt Proportion between them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To put a Colour upon this Diſtinction, he gives Inſtance; <hi>Firſt,</hi> in the ſufferings of our Saviour, which were but temporary, and no way compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>for duration of time</hi> with the everlaſting pains of hell, which without his ſufferings we all ſhould have ſuffered; and yet his temporary ſufferings did make a full and juſt ſatisfaction for the ſins of men, which deſerved everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting torments. For what was wanting to the duration or continuance of his ſufferings, was ſupplyed by the dignity of his perſon, which ſuffered them: In like ſort (as he would have it) the worth or dignitie of that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, from which the ſufferings of Martyrs, or other good works of juſt and holy men do proceed, may make up that defect, which they apparently have in reſpect of their ſhort duration or continuance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3566" facs="tcp:32220:142"/>
His Second Inſtance is; that the pleaſures or contentments of ſin are in no wiſe comparable to the everlaſting torments of hell, which yet theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary pleaſures juſtly deſerve for the contempt of God and his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and thus (as he would have us believe) the good works of Saints, though but few and ſhort, may, through the vertue of Grace or Charity, as juſtly deſerve eternal glory.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But as his Anſwer in General is Sophiſtical, ſo the Inſtances which he brings to prove it are moſt impertinent, and, if they be well ſcanned, moſt <note place="margin">How Chriſts, temporal ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite merit.</note> pregnant for Us againſt him.</p>
               <p>To the Firſt, we reply, as all Divines agree, That Chriſts ſufferings, though but temporary for duration, and for quality not infinite, did make a full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſins of mankind, becauſe the Perſon of the ſufferer was truly and abſolutely infinite; his ſatisfaction or the value of his ſufferings were truly infinite, <hi>Non quia paſſus eſt infinita, ſed quia paſſus eſt infinitus:</hi> 
                  <q>Not becauſe he ſuffered infinite pains, but becauſe He, who ſuffered thoſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and unknown pains, was truly infinite.</q> But neither the perſons of the Saints, which ſuffered martyrdom, nor any pains, which they ſuffered, or good works, which they did, had any juſt Proportion to Infinity; and therefore could not be Meritorious of eternal Glory (which is for duration infinite) either in reſpect of their perſons, or of their charity, which queſtionleſs was much leſs then Chriſts love and charity towards us, as man, though this was not ſo abſolutely Infinite, as the love and charity of his Godhead. So that this Inſtance is not only impertinent, but altogether unadviſed; and the Reader may well wonder how ſuch groſs and ſomnolent incogitancie could poſſibly ſurprize ſo wary a man, ſo great a Scholar as <hi>Cardinal Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> was.</p>
               <p>His Second Inſtance though it include no ſuch groſs incogitancie, as the <note place="margin">Why the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin, though tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, deſerve eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> former, nevertheleſs it is involved in an error, too common, not only to the Romaniſt, but to many in reformed Churches. For the pleaſures of ſin, though but temporary, deſerve eternal death (betwixt which and them (in themſelves conſidered) there is no juſt proportion;) But the True Reaſon, why they juſtly deſerve this death, is, becauſe men by continuing in ſin, and by following the pleaſures of it, do reject or put from them the promiſes of Eternal Life, betwixt which and everlaſting death there is a juſt proportion. And when Life and Death everlaſting are propoſed unto us, the One out of <note place="margin">See this Book Fol. 3498.</note> Mercie, the other out of Juſtice, it is moſt Juſt dealing with God, to give ſuch as chuſe the pleaſures of ſin before the Fruits of Holineſs, <hi>the native iſſue of their choice:</hi> But it could not have ſtood with the Juſtice of God to have puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our firſt Parents tranſgreſſion with everlaſting death, unleſs out of his Free Bounty and liberality he had made them capable, not of a temporal only, but of an everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>But now that <hi>Adam</hi> hath ſinned, and made himſelf and his poſterity ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto everlaſting death, doth not this Original Sin or every Actual Sin, which iſſueth from it, deſerve everlaſting death?</p>
               <p>Yes, they do; and would inevitably bring death upon all, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Gods Mercy or Free Pardon made in Chriſt. But this free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don being preſuppoſed, and being proclaimed unto the world, it is not <hi>Sin Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,</hi> or the <hi>Poſitive ſins of men</hi> in themſelves conſidered, which bring ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death upon them, <hi>but their wilful neglect or ſlighting of Gods mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in Chriſt</hi> (or of the means, which God affords them for attaining this mercy) which leaves them without Excuſe or Apology; or which <hi>makes up the full meaſure</hi> of their iniquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3567" facs="tcp:32220:142"/>
This is our Saviours Doctrine, <hi>John</hi> 3. 17. <hi>God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved.</hi> From what original then doth the condemnation of the world proceed? Our Saviour tels us, ver. 19. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſſe more then light, becauſe their deeds were evil.</hi> It is not then the works of darkneſs in themſelves conſidered, but conſidered <hi>with mens love unto them</hi> or delight in them, that doth induce a neglect or hate of light, which brings condemnation upon the world. Now if the works of darkneſs or pleaſures of ſin, which are but momentany, do not <hi>in themſelves</hi> procure everlaſting death, albeit they proceed from Sin Original, much leſſe ſhall the good Works of Gods Saints, albeit they proceed from Grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure or deſerve everlaſting life. For the Grace by which we do them, is from God, not from our ſelves, but the evil works, which we do, are our own, God hath no ſhare in them. So that the <hi>Height</hi> or <hi>Accompliſhment of ſin</hi> conſiſts <hi>in the neglect</hi> or contempt <hi>of Eternal Life,</hi> and the neglect hereof could not be ſo heynous, if this life could be deſerved by us, or if it were awarded to us out of Juſtice, not out of meer Mercie and Grace.</p>
               <p n="11">11. This difference betwixt the Title, which <hi>Bad works have to Death,</hi> and the Want of Title, which the <hi>Beſt works have to Life Everlaſting,</hi> is moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly expreſt by <hi>St. Paul, Rom.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> ſaith He, and wages are merited, are never detained without ſome interruption of the courſe juſtice; But <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is not the wages of holineſs, but <hi>the Gift of God.</hi> And if in any ſort it might be deſerved or merited; the Apoſtle, queſtionleſs, would have ſaid, it had been, if not <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>He grounds his hopes (as the Advocates for the Romiſh Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) not ſo much upon Gods <hi>Free mercie</hi> or Favour, by which only the <hi>Firſt Grace</hi> was beſtowed upon them, as upon <hi>Gods Juſtice:</hi> And if his hopes be grounded upon <hi>Gods Juſtice,</hi> more then upon his <hi>Free Mereie</hi> or Favour; Then, the Recovery of their former eſtate, or the prevention of that Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, into which they were falling, was more <hi>from the merit of their former works,</hi> then from <hi>Gods Free Mercie or Grace.</hi> Now, That the Apoſtle did ground his hopes of their Recovery, upon Gods Juſtice, they take it as proved from the tenth verſe: <hi>For God is not</hi> unrighteous <hi>to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have ſhewed towards his name, in that ye have miniſtred to the Saints, and do miniſter.</hi> Theſe words ſeem to import, That if God at this <note place="margin">Gods Juſtice and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us does not imply the <hi>merit of our works:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I have been bold to put this Argument, drawn from our Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. as far <hi>home</hi> as any Advocate for the Romiſh Church hath done or can do, Becauſe the true and <hi>punctual Anſwer</hi> unto it will eaſily reach all other Arguments, which they can draw from the like <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Topick,</hi> as when it is ſaid, <hi>God ſhall reward us in righteouſneſſe,</hi> or as a righteous Judge, &amp;c.</p>

And to preſent a fact puniſhable by the Law of God is alwayes lawful and juſt: Yet this was no part of that Juſtice or righteouſneſs, which the Holy Ghoſt commends in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>he was a juſt man.</hi> To be <hi>Iuſt</hi> then in his Dialect <hi>(in this Caſe)</hi> was to be <hi>A loving, a friendly and favourable man;</hi> And if the Romiſh Church would take <hi>Righteouſneſſe in the ſame ſenſe</hi> in thoſe places, wherein it is ſaid, that <hi>he ſhall reward the Saints as a righteous Iudge,</hi> and crown them with Glory; their <hi>Conceit of merit</hi> could find no ſupportance from thoſe Teſtimonies of Scriptures, which they moſt alledge for it.</p>

                  <hi>it be by faith alone, or by faith and works.</hi> The Romiſh Church grants, that <hi>we are juſtified by faith in Chriſts blood or merits, Tanquam per Cauſam efficientem,</hi> as by a true efficient Cauſe; ſeeing all the <hi>Grace,</hi> which we firſt receive, is beſtowed upon us for <hi>Chriſts ſake.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The formall Cauſe of every thing requires ſome efficient or Agent for the production or reſultance of it; but being once produced or exiſtent, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the interpoſition or intervention of any other Cauſe whatſoever for the production or exiſtence of its formall Effect.

Thus, ſay the Romaniſts, that <hi>grace cannot be produced in us but by the vertue and efficiency of Chriſts merits, but being by them once produced, it doth juſtifie us immediatly by the ſtrength and vertue of it inherent in us, and by the ſame ſtrength and vertue working in us it doth produce its formall effect, to wit, the increaſe of grace, and laſtly eternal life.</hi>

For if our ſins be <hi>formally remitted by the infuſion of grace,</hi> and if <hi>by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the ſame grace we be formally juſtified,</hi> the only true meaning of <hi>this Petition</hi> is in true Reſolution, <q>This; Lord makes us ſuch, or remit our ſins after ſuch a manner, that we ſhall not ſtand in need of thy remiſſion or forgivenſs of them, or that we ſhall not ſtand in need of the mediation of thine only Son: For if they be remitted immediatly by <hi>grace,</hi> ſo long as this <hi>grace</hi> endures, all mediation is ſuperfluous, is impoſſible.</q>

               <p>This <hi>Inconvenience</hi> is farther improved by <hi>the ſame Doctrine</hi> ſo far as it concerns the <hi>merits of works</hi> done in charitie; And prophanes <hi>thoſe Two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Petitions</hi> in the ſame our Lords Prayer <hi>[Thy Kingdom come; Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven:]</hi> no leſſe then their <hi>Doctrine of Juſtification</hi> doth that Petition <hi>[Forgive us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that treſpaſſe</hi>

                  <hi>againſt us,]</hi> For if works done by <hi>grace</hi> or charitie could truly <hi>merit</hi> eternal life, the effect of all the three Petitions ſhould be but this, <q>Lord let thy Kingdom of Grace ſo come unto us, Lord let thy will be ſo done by us here on earth, that as we have been long debters unto thee for giving thine only Son to die for our ſins, and for the purchaſing of the <hi>Firſt Grace</hi> unto us, ſo let us by <hi>this grace</hi> be inabled to make both <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Him</hi> debters to us by the <hi>merit of this grace,</hi> and debters in no meaner a ſum then the retribution or payment of Eternal Life.</q>

               <p>And thus much here, Of the ſtate or iſſue of the controverſie betwixt us and the Romiſh Church concerning merits;</p>
               <p>The <hi>Appendix</hi> or ſecond Branch whereof (according to the order propoſed in the twentie ſeventh Chapter, Section 1.) was; <hi>The state of this very Queſtion, Betwixt God the righteous Judge of All, and our own ſouls or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,</hi> or if you will, betwixt our Conſciences and us. And this being rightly ſtated, will put into our mouthes <hi>That true confeſsion</hi> which every Chriſtian ſoul muſt make, ſo often as it ſhall become <hi>A Petitioner</hi> unto God who made it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This we know, and all do grant, <hi>That God made the Firſt Man righteous.</hi> Whether this Original righteouſneſs were a ſupernatural Grace or no, is A queſtion betwixt us and the Romiſh Church, and it hath been touched by us, if not throughly handled in the very entrance or begining of the tenth Book. Certain it is, that it was <hi>A Grace,</hi> and either a part of mans <hi>Being</hi> (or of our nature, as it was the workmanſhip of God;) or A Grace conferred upon our nature with its Firſt <hi>Being:</hi> And A Grace, which could no way be Merited either <hi>De condigno, or de congruo. Their very First Being was the meer gift of</hi>
                  <pb n="3574" facs="tcp:32220:146"/>
                  <hi>God.</hi> So were all the Qualifications and Graces wherewith it was indued. Suppoſe man had continued in this firſt eſtate, this had been but a continuance of that free Gift of God, which was beſtowed upon him with his beginning. If he had been advanced or tranſlated to a better or more perfect eſtate, this likewiſe had been a new Free Gift or Grace of God, which could not be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by man: For his very Firſt Eſtate was more worth, then all the Labor and endeavors, which God required at his hands for the preſerving of it; ſo that he was ſtill indebted unto God as well for every moment or hour of life in ſuch an happy eſtate, as he was for his firſt Creation; and if he had been advanced to any better eſtate, this had made him a new Debter unto his Maker, it had been more then A Continuance of the former Debt. The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt iſſue or beſt effect of all his endeavors could only have made him Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable or not unworthy of the Continuance of Gods Favour and grace, which he moſt freely extends to all, that do not make themſelves Unworthy of them: That the Firſt Man then was endowed with grace, this was <hi>Gods ſole Work:</hi> That he made himſelf unworthy of this <hi>Firſt Grace,</hi> and ſo loſt it, this was <hi>his own work.</hi> Yet after he had made himſelf and his poſterity thus Unworthy of the <hi>Firſt Grace,</hi> God beſtows a <hi>Second</hi> upon him, the <hi>Grace of Redemption,</hi> and this Grace could not be merited by him; it was <hi>A more Free gift of</hi> God, then his firſt Creation was; That was <hi>an Act or gift of his Bounty,</hi> this later, was <hi>An Act of his abundant Mercie.</hi> Bounty extends it ſelf to ſuch as are <hi>not worthy</hi> of it; but Mercie reacheth to ſuch as are moſt <hi>unworthy</hi> of Bounty, to ſuch as deſerve the ſeverity of punitive Juſtice. What ſhall we ſay then? that the <hi>Second grace,</hi> which was promiſed to mankind in the womans ſeed, though it cannot be merited by any, yet being freely and actually beſtowed upon them, may merit the Continuance of it, the Increaſe of it, or advancement to a better Eſtate?</p>
               <p n="8">8. To be freed from the <hi>Sentence of Death,</hi> which was denounced againſt our Firſt Parents is an extraordinary Grace or Bleſſing of God, and <hi>This Bleſsing we all receive by the Grace of Baptiſm:</hi> and <hi>this Bleſſing</hi> we all enjoy ſo long as we continue in Grace; and the longer we enjoy this Grace or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the more ſtill we are indebted to our Gracious God, then they are, which never receive it, which want it.</p>
               <p>Now it is not poſſible that we ſhould <hi>merit</hi> any thing at Gods hands by the long enjoyment of that bleſſing, which the longer, or in greater meaſure we enjoy, the more ſtill we are indebted unto him, that gives it. <hi>To what uſe or end then doth this Grace ſerve? Only to make us more indebted to God, then we were for our natural Being?</hi> Nay! But to make us ſee the miſery of our Firſt Eſtate better then we could poſſibly ſee it whilſt we continued in it, and <note place="margin">☞</note> to enable us to make a better and more thankful acknowledgment of our Debt to God for all his bleſsings, then without <hi>this Grace</hi> (or this bleſsing of Redemption) we poſsibly could do. Let the Advocates then of the Romiſh Church extol the excellency of Grace unto the Skies or Heavens, whence it deſcends, we will not in this contradict them, but only requeſt them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the more excellent Grace in it ſelf is, the greater ſhould their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation be, that make no better uſe of it then they do, if God ſhould enter into Judgment with them. And certainly that man hath received but a mean portion or Talent of Grace, which ſees not his accounts to God to be much encreaſed, if God ſhould call him to a ſtrict account for not imploying his Talent, or not ſtirring up that Grace of God, which is in him.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But ſuppoſe we did <hi>ſtir up this Grace,</hi> or ſuffer our ſelves <hi>to be ſtirred up by it</hi> to good works, to what uſe or end doth our fruitfulneſs in Good Works
<pb n="3575" facs="tcp:32220:146"/>
ſerve? To this end only, <hi>that we may not be found unworthy</hi> either of the Continuance of Gods Gracious Favour, or of the Continual Increaſe of it.</p>
               <p>To acknowledge the Firſt Receit of Grace to be the ſole work of God, and yet to aſcribe in part the Increaſe of it to our own Merits, or right uſe of it, is no more then the Phariſee confeſt, when he ſaid, <hi>Lord, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, nor as this Publicane.</hi> Here was a true acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he received <hi>this Grace</hi> (by whoſe good uſe he thought himſelf better then other men) freely from God. But in making this Compariſon, he gloried as if he had not received it; or, as if, having received it, he was not ſo great a Debter unto God, as the Publicane was, nor liable to the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his ſins paſt or preſent. Queſtionleſſe this Phariſee had been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of better Grace, at leaſt of better means of ſalvation, then the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can had been. And if this conceit of his own worth, in compariſon of other men, had not polluted his works, there is no Queſtion but that he had been more righteous then the Publican, yet the Publican went home more juſtified then the Phariſee; not for the worth of any good works, which he had done, but by unfeigned acknowledgment of his own Unworthineſs, if God ſhould have entered into Judgment with him.</p>
               <p>That Form of Prayer or acknowledgment, which the Publican made, would at this day well beſeem even thoſe, which have received a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Grace, then either he or the Phariſee had done; even thoſe, which have been more fruitful in Good Works, then both of them were. Or if the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican be no fit perſon for ſanctified men to imitate; certainly the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> is a fit one, and yet his confeſsion of his own unworthineſs, if God ſhould have dealt in Juſtice with him, was more pathetically humble, then the Publicans was, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 8, 9. <hi>Oh Lord, to us belongeth confuſion of face, to our Kings, to our Princes, and to our Fathers, becauſe we have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee; to thee, O Lord our God, belongeth mercies and forgiveneſſes, though we have rebelled againſt thee.</hi> He placeth no part of his Confidence in the Merit either of his prayer or faſting, which yet were both excellent works, proceeding from charity, and excellently performed by him: but how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſoever theſe Duties be performed by him or any, they neither can Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ought for their own worth in themſelves, nor from the vertue of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, for all his promiſes are promiſes of Mercie, and he that ſeeks for mercie, though promiſed by God, muſt ſincerely and ſeriouſly renounce all works, even the beſt works which he hath done; that is, he muſt diſclaim all Merit or confidence in works, otherwiſe he cannot take hold of Gods promiſes of mercie, but ſolliciteth God to deal in juſtice with him. <note place="margin">How works are excluded from Juſtification.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. And yet here I muſt requeſt the Reader to call that to mind, which hath been often inculcated before, that whenſoever our Apoſtle excludes all works from Juſtification or Election, he is to be underſtood only of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Works, or Conceit of Merit. He excludes not their Preſence, but neceſſarily requires it to our Juſtification, as to the making of our Election ſure, He only denies any Cauſal Efficiencie in them for procuring theſe or the like bleſsings of God; leaſt of all, for obtaining of eternal life, unto which Good works are moſt neceſſary. For our Apoſtle takes it as granted, that we muſt deny our ſelves before we can do any good works; but we muſt do good works before we can renounce them, and we muſt renounce them in all our ſuits and pleas, ſpecially for thoſe bleſsings, which God, out of his Free Grace and mercie, promiſed us. A Doctrine, which would to God ſome late Writers of Reformed Churches had taken into ſerious conſideration, whilſt
<pb n="3576" facs="tcp:32220:147"/>
they earneſtly pleaded for the Free Grace of God in our Election. For ſo they would never have taught us, as (to my apprehenſion) they do, that our <hi>Election</hi> to Eternal life is a more free grace of God then the <hi>donation</hi> of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life it ſelf, then which, as no bleſſing of God is more Great, ſo none can be more Free. But the abſolute Freedom of the Gift doth no way exclude but rather require <hi>ſome Qualifications in the Donee:</hi> and for this Reaſon it is, that the practiſe of Good works is in ſpecial ſort required for the attaining of Eternal Life; Becauſe <hi>That</hi> is the greateſt and moſt Free Act of Grace, which <hi>The God of Mercie</hi> hath to beſtow upon us: in reſpect of <hi>it</hi> our beſt deeds are <hi>moſt unworthy,</hi> and the leſſe <hi>worthy</hi> they are, the more unfeignedly they are to be renounced: And ſeeing our Apoſtle, when he excludes works from any plea of mercie, doth only exclude <hi>Confidence</hi> or <hi>Conceit of Merit</hi> in them; in whatſoever ſenſe he excludes them from Election or Juſtification, he excludes them in an higher degree of the ſame ſenſe, from the Donation of eternal Life; Otherwiſe that could not be (as our Apoſtle ſaith) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Free Gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. But as in all other points of Controverſie betwixt Us and the Romiſh Church, ſo in this ſpecially concerning <hi>Merits,</hi> I am alwayes jealous of both <note place="margin">Two rocks to be avoide here, <hi>Confid. in</hi> merit of Works, and <hi>Praemature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi> or preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Election.</note> 
                  <hi>Readers</hi> and <hi>Hearers,</hi> leſt whilſt they hear one Error refuted, they take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to run into the Contrary. For preventing this inconvenience in this preſent point <hi>I muſt Requeſt</hi> all in the <hi>Firſt Place</hi> to Obſerve, that <hi>Both of us fully agree in</hi> this General, <hi>that God is a Rewarder of them that ſeek him;</hi> and no man can truly ſeek him, but by a true and lively working Faith. The Queſtion betwixt us is only this; <hi>Whether God Reward ſuch as ſeek him according to the Rule of Juſtice, or according to the Rule of his boundleſſe Mercy;</hi> or whether our works (his Grace and promiſe preſuppoſed) be <hi>worthy of</hi> his Reward, or only make us <hi>not altogether unworthy</hi> or <hi>not uncapable</hi> of his Mercie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Point</hi> which I would commend to all mens <hi>Conſideration</hi> is This, that as our Apoſtle in the fore-cited place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. doth not ground his hope of thoſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> recovery upon Gods Juſtice, ſo he doth not ground it upon the <hi>Infallibility</hi> or immutable eſtate of their Election. He doth not ſo much as intimate that they could not poſſibly fall, becauſe their perſons were Elected, for this was more then either he or they knew, more then moſt men can poſſibly know, more then any man in their Caſe may ſafely perſwade himſelf. He that makes his <hi>perſonal Election</hi> the only <hi>Anchor</hi> of his Faith, in ſuch temptations as theſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> at that time were overtaken with, ſhall fall into as bad, perhaps a worſe, Error, then if he held, That his Good works formerly done might <hi>merit</hi> his Recovery unto his former eſtate, ſo he will but addreſs himſelf to do the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Conceit of merit</hi> (though we take men in their beſt eſtate, or when they are leaſt conſcious of groſſer ſins) <hi>is a Symptom of heatheniſh pride or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</hi> For the Heathens thought they could make the Gods or divine Powers beholding unto them. But to ſtay our ſelves in the conſciouſneſs of grievous ſins lately committed upon perſwaſions of our <hi>perſonal Election,</hi> is the moſt dangerous root of Hypocritical Pride that can be planted in our corrupt nature.</p>
               <p>Now any Symptom or Branch of pride or vain-glory is leſs deadly then <hi>the Root of Pride,</hi> vain-glory or phariſaical hypocriſie. Far be it from any of us to think, that the like ſin committed by a man regenerate doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <note place="margin">☞</note> worſe at Gods hands, then if it had been committed by an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or meer natural man, becauſe he thinks himſelf to be of the number of the Elect; For if this ſin or tranſgreſsion be for <hi>Subſtance</hi> the ſame, the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi>
                  <pb n="3577" facs="tcp:32220:147"/>
make it a great deal worſe in a regenerate, then in a meer natural man. That ſaying of the heathen <hi>Satyriſt</hi> or Cenſurer of ill manners holds as true in Divinitie as in Morality:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Omne animi vitium tanto conſpectius in ſe</l>
                  <l>Crimen habet, quanto major qui peccat habetur.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The crime or fault is ſo much the greater, by how much the partie offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in his own eſteem or others better qualified.</p>
               <p n="12">12. From what Original is it then, that the righteous Judge doth oft-times leſſe puniſh the ſins of men, which have lived a godly life, then he doth the like ſins in men not as yet regenerate, or in men that have been altogether barren of good works? The true Reſolution of this Probleme or Queſtion muſt be taken from that <hi>general rule or Maxime,</hi> That God will render to every man according to all his wayes either in Juſtice or in mercy. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit God alwayes puniſh the ungodly in this life <hi>Citra condignum</hi> in leſſe meaſure then they deſerve, becauſe his mercy and long ſuffering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits the execution of his punitive juſtice; yet he alwayes rewards the good works, which we do, <hi>Ultra condignum,</hi> far above their deſervings; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the beſt works, which we can do, <hi>deſerve no reward at all,</hi> yet his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs will not ſuffer the leaſt good works, which we do, to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Reward. Rewarded we ſhall be either with ſome <hi>Poſitive Bleſsing</hi> or with the Mitigation of ſome puniſhment, which our evil works had juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerved. From this Original it is, that albeit the bad works of men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, or endowed with grace, do <hi>weigh</hi> heavier in the ſcale of Gods Juſtice, then the like works of men unregenerate do; yet they do not <hi>ſway</hi> ſo much, becauſe whiles he weighes the bad works of men regenerate in the ſcale of his juſtice, he weighes the good works, which they have formerly done, in the ſcale of his mercy and bounty. But as for ſuch as have lived a lewd and godleſs life, and have made themſelves unworthy of his mercy, their groſſer ſins are weighed in the ſcale of his Juſtice without a Counterpoize, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do ſway the further, and nearer towards hell, albeit for their nature and quality they be not more heynous, then ſome offences of the regenerate. So that God is no Accepter of perſons, albeit in this life he puniſheth the ſame ſin more grievouſly in one, then in another; for this he doth not with any reſpect unto their perſons, but with reſpect unto his own mercy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one ſort are Capable, the other are altogether unworthy. And this was the true meaning of our Apoſtle, and the ground of his Hope or good perſwaſion of theſe Hebrews <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>But we are perſwaded better things of you, and things that accompany ſalvation. For God is not unrighteous to forget your works and labour of love which ye have ſhewed towards his name, in that ye have Miniſtred to the Saints, and do Miniſter.</hi>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THe Points remaining</hi> to be handled are <hi>Three.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> is in part touched before: That Eternal Life is nor only <hi>The gift of God,</hi> or as the <hi>Vulgar</hi> renders the Original <hi>Gratia Dei,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The gift of God</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is (as if you would ſay) <hi>The Gift of Gifts,</hi> the <hi>greatest Gift,</hi> and the <hi>Freeſt Gift,</hi> that God hath to beſtow on mankind <hi>for, in,</hi> or <hi>through</hi> Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. <hi>The ſecond;</hi> that, The Abſolute Freedom or graciouſneſs of this Gift doth not exclude <hi>all Qualifications</hi> of works or inclinations to good works, but only <hi>confidence</hi> in works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third</hi> is, <hi>The Qualification</hi> required in all ſuch as hope to receive <hi>this Gift;</hi> or, <hi>The manner</hi> how they are to work out their own ſalvation, that they may be capable, or at leaſt not Totally uncapable of this <hi>free gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>the firſt,</hi> That Eternal Life is <hi>the Gift of Gifts,</hi> or the moſt free or Gracious Gift, that God hath to beſtow on man, may be eaſily proved from <note place="margin">Eternal life a moſt <hi>Free Gift of God.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Conditions</hi> required in a <hi>Free Gift.</hi> And <hi>Theſe are Two. The firſt</hi> reſpects the eſtate or condition of the <hi>Donor,</hi> as that he be not tied by any neceſſitie either <hi>natural, moral,</hi> or <hi>politick</hi> to beſtow his benevolence. The <hi>ſecond condition</hi> reſpects the <hi>Donee;</hi> And it is <hi>Abſentia,</hi> if not <hi>Carentia meriti;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without, if not a want of deſert or merit: In <hi>both reſpects</hi> Life Eternal is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>The moſt excellent and moſt undeſerved Gift, that can be given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it is <hi>freely given</hi> without any conſtraint or <hi>Tie of neceſsity, is clear;</hi> For no operations of the moſt Holy and <hi>Bleſſed Trinitie</hi> beſides the Eternal Generation of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and the Eternal Proceſſion of <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> have any <hi>Natural neceſsitie</hi> in them. Theſe be operations of the Divine <hi>nature:</hi> all extraneous things are works of Gods divine <hi>will</hi> and pleaſure. God, who worketh all things, worketh all things elſe <hi>according to the Counſel of his Will;</hi> that is, he <hi>ſo worketh</hi> them, he <hi>ſo preſerveth</hi> and ordereth them, as it was free for him from eternity <hi>not to make them, not to preſerve</hi> them, <hi>not ſo to order them,</hi> as he doth. He was when the world was not, and
<pb n="3579" facs="tcp:32220:148"/>
might ſo have continued. And this clearly evinceth that there was no <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural neceſsitie,</hi> why he ſhould create the world, or any thing in it; for ſo the world ſhould have been, as he is, eternal without beginning. Nor was there any <hi>Moral neceſsity,</hi> that he ſhould create the world, or man, or Angel; for none could have impeached him of injuſtice or unkindneſs, or of other tranſgreſsion of any Law or Rule, if he had never given them ſuch <hi>Being,</hi> as they have. Nor was there any <hi>Politick neceſsitie,</hi> that he ſhould <note place="margin">Gods infinite Freedom.</note> create the world or man or Angel, in whoſe creation he had no reſpect to any private end; he gained nothing by their <hi>Being;</hi> the beſt of them are but Unprofitable ſervants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was <hi>free</hi> then for God to create or not to create man: but as it was his pleaſure to create him; ſo it was <hi>neceſſary</hi> that man being created by him, he ſhould be created good and righteous. Suppoſe then the Firſt man had continued in his Firſt Eſtate, that is, righteous and good; his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could have <hi>merited</hi> nothing of God, much leſſe Eternal Life. It was as <hi>free</hi> to God to have annihilated him, or to have reſolved him into nothing, as it was to make him of nothing. Indeed to have puniſhed him with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death, unleſſe he had wilfully, and through his own default, loſt his <hi>Orgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteouſneſs,</hi> could not have ſtood with the righteouſneſs or goodneſs of God. There was a <hi>morall neceſsity</hi> that his Creator ſhould not puniſh him with everlaſting death, unleſſe he had tranſgreſſed his Law, and made himſelf <hi>unworthy</hi> of everlaſting life. But the Firſt Man did wilfully and freely (that is, without any neceſsity) tranſgreſſe the Law of his God, and make himſelf, and his poſteritie <hi>unworthy</hi> of eternal life. That God upon this tranſgreſsion did not inſtantly puniſh him with everlaſting death, this was <hi>An Act of the Free Grace</hi> and mercy of God: thus he might have done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any impeachment to his Juſtice, without any diſparagement to his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That unto man thus ill deſerving he made <hi>A Promiſe of Redemption,</hi> and of Reſtitution to a better Eſtate, then he loſt, this was <hi>An Act of his Mercie</hi> and gracious goodneſs; a more <hi>Free Act</hi> then his firſt Creation; For that was not deſerved and therefore <hi>Free;</hi> But not ſo <hi>Free</hi> as the Promiſe of his Redemption, after he had juſtly deſerved the contrary, to wit, condemnation unto everlaſting death. But this Promiſe of Redemption through the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Seed</hi> being <hi>freely</hi> made; is not the performance of it on Gods part ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary? Is he not bound by promiſe to beſtow his Grace on all them, to whom he promiſed Redemption? Though he be Debter unto no man, yet he is <hi>Faithful in himſelf</hi> and cannot deny himſelf, or not perform, what he hath promiſed. It is true; if the parties to whom he promiſeth do ſo demean themſelves as they ſhould, or as by the <hi>Second Covenant</hi> they ſtand bound. But who is he can make <hi>this Plea</hi> with God? Who is he, that can truly ſay, there was any neceſsity at that time when the promiſe was made to our firſt Parents in the <hi>Womans Seed,</hi> that he ſhould be begotten or born, or that he was ſuch a child of promiſe, from the time of <hi>Adams Fall,</hi> as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was? And if there were no neceſsity then, that he ſhould be born, what neceſsity is there that he ſhould be partaker of Grace after he is born? Or what neceſsity is there, that after <hi>the Grace of Baptiſm</hi> received he ſhould come to be of the number of the Elect? No man can plead <hi>any worth or merit</hi> in himſelf for the receiving of Grace; or <hi>any neceſsity,</hi> whereby God is tyed by promiſe or otherwiſe to beſtow Grace or perſeverance in Grace upon him in particular. <note place="margin">The true way of laying hold on General Promiſes.</note>

               <p n="3">3. It was no Contradiction in <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine</hi> (as ſome conceive it) after he had ſtrongly diſputed for <hi>Merit of Works,</hi> thus to conclude, <hi>Tutiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimum eſt, It is the ſafeſt way to place our Confidence in the Merits of Chriſt.</hi> This Reſolution of his will truly inferre, that albeit the Queſtion concerning <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> were doubtful, yet we Proteſtants take the more uſeful and ſafer way, and the way which <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine himſelf</hi> in his Devotions, and, as I hope, on his death bed, did take.</p>
               <p>Yet admit his Doctrine concerning <hi>Merits,</hi> had been true <hi>indefinitely</hi> taken; There had been no Contradiction between his <hi>Premiſſes</hi> and <hi>Concluſion;</hi> For many things, which are unqueſtionable in <hi>Theſi,</hi> or in the General, are doubtful or vncertain in <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> when we come to make particular Application. This Doctrine is moſt true in <hi>Theſi, That God is faithful in all his promiſes,</hi> that <hi>he cannot deny himſelf,</hi> or <hi>falſifie his promiſe;</hi> Yet is it not ſafe for Thee or Me thus to infer: that <hi>God cannot deny eternal life to us in particular,</hi> becauſe he hath promiſed it as ſincerely to <hi>Thee</hi> or <hi>Me,</hi> as to any others: The abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <note place="margin">It follows not; <hi>God cannot deny himſelf;</hi> ergo, I <hi>am in, and ſhall perſevere in the ſtate of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </note> and unchangeable Fidelity of God will not inferre (how ſtrongly ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we believe it) <hi>That either Thou or I are faithful for the preſent;</hi> or ſhall <hi>continue faithfull unto the End,</hi> or until our finall victory over the divel, the world, and the fleſh; which is the True Importance of this Phraſe <hi>[To the End]</hi> in many places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now Gods promiſe of eternal Life is not immediately terminated <hi>To any mans Perſon</hi> or <hi>Individual Entity,</hi> but <hi>unto ſuch as continue faithful unto the End,</hi> or <hi>unto ſuch as overcome;</hi> as you may obſerve in many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; eſpecially, in the ſecond and third Chapters of <hi>The Revelation of St. John.</hi> Now it is a great deal more eaſie for a man to aſſure himſelf that he is faithful for the preſent, or victorious in reſpect of inſtant temptations, then to aſſure himſelf that he ſhall continue victorious in reſpect of temptations that may befal him. And yet in reſpect of the deceitfulneſs of our own hearts, it is not ſafe for moſt men to make it as an Article of their Faith, or point of Abſolute Belief, that they are ſo faithful for the preſent, as that God cannot deny Eternal Life unto them, though not in reſpect of their Merits, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Promiſe, if they ſhould inſtantly depart this life; So that ſuch as have as full and perfect Intereſt in the Promiſes of God, as others have, may forfeit their Intereſt, as well by Immature Perſwaſions or Preſumptions, <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Equally dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to confide in <hi>Merit,</hi> and to preſume of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</hi>

                  <hi>they are of the number of the Elect,</hi> as by conceit of Merit or Confidence in works. Both perſwaſions are dangerous, becauſe both prejudice the <hi>Free Mercie</hi> and <hi>Grace of God</hi> in beſtowing eternal Life, or in diſpenſing the means required unto it. The Romiſh Church ſaith, it was Free for God to give us Grace (or ability to do the works of Grace) or not to give it; but this Grace being Freely given, and the works performed, it is not Free, but Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in reſpect of Gods Juſtice, to give eternal Life as the Reward of Works. Others, oppoſite enough to the Papiſts, ſay, that it was Free for God to Elect, or not to Elect us unto eternal Life: but being Elected, it is not Free for God to deny eternal Life unto us; For this, in their language, were to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or falſifie his promiſe. Yet by their leave, <hi>If we were thus Elected from Eternity, it was never Free for God to Elect or not to Elect us:</hi> and ſo eternal Life ſhould not be the Award of Gods Free Merrie and Grace as <hi>now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> but an Act of his Fidelity or promiſe paſt, before we had any being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the world was made. But if God had not the ſame <hi>Free Power</hi> at this day to Elect or not to Elect any man now living, or not the ſame <hi>Free Power</hi> to ſhew mercie on whom he will, and to harden whom he will, which it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed once he had, he ſhould not have the ſame Power over us, which the <note place="margin">See Book 10.

                  <q>
                     <hi>Tutiſſimum eſt,</hi> It is the ſafeſt way, the only way, abſolutely to rely all our life time upon Gods Free mercie and Grace, and to make continual ſupplications unto God the Father through Chriſt, that as he hath prepared a Kingdom for us from the foundation of the world, ſo he would prepare and fit us for it:</q> For without preparation or fit Qualification, we are not capable of it; and thus we come unto the <hi>Second Point</hi> propoſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <q>The <hi>Second Point</hi> (to which the Third is annexed or ſub-joyned) <note place="margin">The Free Gift of eternal life excludes not due Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</note> was, That the Abſolute Freedom of this Gift doth not exclude all Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in the parties, on whom it is beſtowed, but rather requires better qualifications in them, then can be found in others, which exclude it, or make themſelves uncapable of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Truth of this Aſſertion you may eaſily conceive by this one Inſtance or Example. Suppoſe you, that are Governors of this <note n="*" place="margin">This was preached at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Tine.</hi>

He ſhould wrong you much, that ſhould conceive, that you did intend only to have the number filled up, though it were by ſuch as the Poet deſcribes, but in a verſe ſomewhat better;</p>
               <q>Qui numeri eſſent, &amp; fruges conſumere nati.</q>
               <p>That is, by perſons good for nothing, but only to devour Gods Bleſſings. To admit all ſorts of people promiſcuouſly into <hi>ſuch a Foundation</hi> without reſpect of any <hi>Good Qualification,</hi> would be an Act of Prodigality or impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rather then of <hi>Free Bounty</hi> or Gracious Charity. And can you imagine or ſuſpect that <hi>the moſt juſt and righteous Judge,</hi> the only wiſe immortal God, who requires no more of us, then that <hi>we ſhould be perfect as he is perfect,</hi> that we ſhould be bountiful as he is bountiful, and merciful as he is merciful, doth not more conſtantly obſerve the <hi>Rules of his eternal Equity,</hi> Bountie and Mercie, then we can obſerve our Saviours <hi>Rules,</hi> which are but the <hi>Copy</hi> of them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we made this our chief care and only ſtudy? <hi>Thus to do,</hi> is natural unto him, not ſo unto us: we cannot imitate the paterns, which He ſets us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty, and many interruptions. We may Freely beſtow our Alms or Rewards, but we cannot <hi>qualifie</hi> the parties that are to receive them; we may prepare good things for them, but we cannot prepare their hearts to receive them well or worthily. But God doth not only prepare the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven for us, but muſt alſo prepare us for it: otherwiſe as our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>We ſhall come ſhort of the promiſe which is left us for entring into his reſt.</hi> And no man can come ſhort of the promiſe, or of the bleſſing promiſed, but he that had a true Intereſt in the promiſe, or he,

for whom the bleſſing promiſed was prepared.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What ſhall we ſay then, That any, for whom the Kingdom of Heaven was prepared from the Foundation of the world, ſhall finally miſs of it, or be <note place="margin">For whom was the Kingdom of heaven prepared?</note> excluded from it, at the end of the world? ſo our Apoſtle in the fore-cited place evidently ſuppoſeth.</p>
               <p>Was it then prepared <hi>for all,</hi> or <hi>for a Certain number?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A curious and tickliſh Queſtion:</hi> Yet about which if any Contention have grown or may grow, this cannot ariſe but only from the malice, ignorance, or incogitancie of the men, which diſpute and handle it. For between <hi>theſe two Propoſitions</hi> themſelves <hi>[The Kindom of Heaven was prepared for all; The Kingdom of Heaven was not prepared for all;]</hi> there is no Contradiction, if men would not look upon them through ſome imperfect Logical Rules, which hold true only in ſome Caſes or Subjects: If we ſhould ſay <hi>[That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See the 10. Book <hi>Chapt.</hi> 42. <hi>Fol.</hi> 3236. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>of heaven was prepared for the ſelf ſame man</hi> (Saint Peter for example) <hi>from Eternity;</hi> And, <hi>The kingdom of heaven was not prepared for the ſame</hi> Saint Peter <hi>from Eternity:]</hi> we ſhould ſay no otherwiſe then the Holy Ghoſt hath taught us. There is no more Contradiction between the Affirmative and the Negative, then if one ſhould ſay <hi>[The inhabitants of this town are rich; The Inhabitants of this town are not rich,</hi> but poor.]</p>
               <p>The Rule is generall; that <hi>Betwixt an Indefinite Affirmative, and an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Negative there is no Contradiction.</hi> Now though Saint Peter were all his life time <hi>One and the ſame Individual man for Perſon,</hi> if we conſider him only as he ſtands in the <hi>Predicament of ſubſtance,</hi> yet he was not all his life time <hi>One and the ſelf ſame Object in reſpect of Gods decree of mercy or Judgement,</hi> or for the preparation of Eternal life. To affirm this were to contradict the Holy Spirit, whoſe unqueſtionable <hi>Maxim</hi> it is; that <hi>God renders to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all his wayes.</hi> Now if Saint <hi>Peters</hi> wayes and works were not at all times the ſame, <hi>he was not at all times the ſame individual Object of Gods Decree.</hi> God had One Award for him whilſt he denied his Maſter, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him from under-going the Croſſe for us; and Another Award for him whilſt he reſolutely confeſt Chriſt before Princes, though certain to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Croſſe himſelf for ſo doing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But where doth <hi>The Spirit of God</hi> teach us this <hi>Logick,</hi> or thus to diſtinguiſh? <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 40. The ſtory is plain, ſave that the one <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>It was the mother of Zebedees children;</hi> The other ſaith, <hi>that the ſons themſelves</hi> (to wit, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>James)</hi> came with this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition unto our Saviour, that <hi>The one might ſit on the right hand, the other on his left hand in his Kingdom.</hi> And it is plain out of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> that the Petition was as well exhibited by the <hi>ſons,</hi> as by the <hi>mother;</hi> as it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe plain by our Saviours Reply; and his <hi>Interrogation: ye know not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what ye ask: To drink of the cup, whereof he did drink, and to be baptized with the baptiſme where with he was baptized</hi> he grants was poſſible for them, though perhaps in another ſenſe then they conceived, when they anſwered his Interrogatory. However, <hi>to ſit on his left hand or on his right hand,</hi> as he finally concludes, <hi>was not his to give, but was to be given to them, for whom it was prepared by his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But hence ariſeth <hi>A Dilemma Captious</hi> at the firſt ſight; for, <hi>If the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven were prepared for theſe two Apoſtles, then it was his to give them; for he muſt give it to them, for whom it is prepared;</hi> and ſo he gave it to the <hi>Thief upon the Croſſe:</hi> Or if the Kingdom of heaven <hi>were not prepared for them from the beginning of the world,</hi> they might not, they could not enter into it. <hi>What ſhall we ſay</hi> then; that <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did never enter
<pb n="3583" facs="tcp:32220:150"/>
the Kingdom of heaven? God for bib! the very phraſe and Character of our Saviours Speech, and the circumſtance of the Text ſhould (me thinks) call that Logical Diſtinction to any mans mind, that had ever learned it, or known it before; if not teach ſuch, as knew it not, to make it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Diſtinction</hi> I mean of <hi>Senſus diviſus</hi> and <hi>compoſitus,</hi> which indeed is the <hi>only Diſtinction</hi> for reſolving many difficulties in Divinitie, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of which, many other impertinent and unartificial ones have been, and are daily, ſought out. <q>The meaning of the <hi>Diſtinction</hi> in this particular <note place="margin">Humilitie a neceſſary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> is this, If we conſider <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> with their <hi>preſent Qualifications,</hi> it is true that the Kingdom of Heaven was not prepared for them, they could not enter in at the ſtrait gate, that leads unto it, until their preſent ſwelling humour of ſecular ambition or pride was aſſwaged; for God from eternity had excluded pride and ambition from any inheritance in the Kingdom of his Son. But this bad habit or diſpoſition being laid aſide, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (wherewith as yet they were not inveſted) to wit, true humilitie, being put upon them, the Kingdom of Heaven was prepared for them, and prepared for them thus qualified from the Foundation of the world.</q> Our <hi>Saviours Anſwer</hi> unto them imports no more then <hi>Saint Peter</hi> doth, when he ſaith, <hi>Deus dat gratiam humilibus, ſed reſiſtit ſuperbis, God giveth grace to the humble, but reſiſteth the proud;</hi> and ſo our <hi>Saviour</hi> repels their Petition for the preſent, becauſe it did proceed from ſecular pride; and from this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular took occaſion, not only to teach <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> but the other Ten alſo, <hi>the neceſsitie of humility,</hi> as a qualification without which no man ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, either into the <hi>Kingdom of Grace</hi> in this life, or into the <hi>Kingdom of glory</hi> in the life to come.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For albeit the <hi>other Ten</hi> did much miſlike this ambitious humour of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> yet (as one obſerves) that, <hi>Diogenes Calcavit faſtum Platonis cum majori faſtu:</hi> So the <hi>Ten Apoſtles</hi> bewray more then a ſpice of the like ambitious humour in themſelves by the manner of their miſlike or indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the Petition of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> Unwilling they were to give place and precedence unto them, albeit they were their Lord and Maſters kinſmen; <hi>when the ten heard it</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 24.) <hi>they were moved with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the two brethren; but Jeſus called them unto him and ſaid, ye know the Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them, and they, that are great, exerciſe authoritie upon them. But it ſhall not be ſo among you: but whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your miniſter: and whoſoever will be chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, let him be your ſervant, Even as the Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many.</hi> The ſame Leſſon had been taught them twice before; As, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 34. <hi>by the way they had diſputed amongſt themſelves, who ſhould be greateſt: and he ſate down, and called the twelve and ſaith unto them, If any deſire to be firſt, he ſhall be the laſt of all, and ſervant of all; and he took a child, and ſet him in the midſt of them, and when he had taken him in his arms, he ſaid unto them, whoſoever ſhall receive one of ſuch children in my name, receiveth me, and whoſoever ſhall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that ſent me.</hi> This admonition you ſee doth equally <note place="margin">The third Point.</note> concern all the Twelve: not <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> alone. The <hi>Tenor</hi> of the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this; that <hi>no man is fit for the Kingdom of heaven, unleſs he become as a child, unleſs, he receive it as a child,</hi> that is, unleſs they better affect a humble and childiſh diſpoſition, as well in themſelves, as in others, then any pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence or worldly dignity. Thus much our Saviour expreſly taught them, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 13. <hi>They brought yong children unto him, that he ſhould touch them; and his</hi>

                  <hi>diſciples rebuked thoſe, that brought them. But when Jeſus ſaw it, he was much diſpleaſed, and ſaith unto them; Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God Verely I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he ſhall not enter therein; and he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and bleſſed them.</hi> Thus he treated them, not with reference to their Individual Perſons, but to their Qualifications; hereby giving his diſciples to underſtand, that all ſuch as ſeek to be actually bleſſed by him, whatſoever their Parentage, or other Prerogatives be, they muſt be ſo qualified, as theſe children were; not ſo qualified, they are not capable of the Kingdom of Heaven. We muſt ſo demean our ſelves towards our heavenly Father, out of knowledge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, <note place="margin">The Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Free Gift.</note> as little children do themſelves towards their earthly parents out of ſimplicity or inſtinct of nature. In reſpect of <hi>malice</hi> towards. God or man we muſt be as little children, but in <hi>knowledge</hi> of our own infirmities, or more then childiſh impotency, we muſt be men.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

In this property we agree too well with them; for as St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sufficit ſibi liberum arbitrium admalum, adbonum non.</hi> We have a Liberty or Freedom of Will to defile our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by falling or back-ſliding after Baptiſm; but no Freedom of will, no power of our ſelves to riſe again unto newneſs of life. The Knowledge, wherein we muſt in this Caſe exceed little children, muſt be out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of this our Impotencie or infirmitie to frame our Petitions unto God with the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 2. <hi>Waſh me throughly from my iniquity, and cleanſe me from my ſin;</hi> And again, ver. 10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me: cast me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy ſpirit from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Little Children, though they be ſet upon their feet, after their Fall, they are not able to ſtand upright, although they adventure not to go, unleſs they be ſupported by their nurſes, or other helper; and it is our Apoſtles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto <hi>ſuch as ſtand,</hi> to <hi>take heedleſt they fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is this circumſpection in their power after Grace received?</p>
               <p>No; no more then it is in the power of Little Children to keep themſelves from falling.</p>
               <p>To what end then doth this Admonition ſerve?</p>
               <p>To make us more careful by the knowledge of this our infirmitie continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to uſe that or the like prayer, <hi>Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with thy gracious favour, and further us with thy continual help.</hi>

               <p>If we truly acknowledge our ſelves to be but <hi>Little Children,</hi> we cannot but know, that without his preventing Grace we muſt ſtill wallow in our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral filthineſs and uncleanneſs, that without his Concomitant Grace we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand, and that without his Subſequent Grace we can make no progreſs towards eternal Life: All our doings muſt be begun, muſt be continued, and ended in him by his Grace; otherwiſe we ſhall fail of the end here propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto us by our Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Little Children</hi> are ſenſible of hunger or want of Food, yet cannot provide it, cannot be their own carvers of it, cannot take it, unleſs it be reached unto them. We then become in ſome degree the children of God, when we
<pb n="3585" facs="tcp:32220:151"/>
feel a want of ſpiritual Food, or when we hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, But power we have none after Grace received to give ſatisfaction to this hunger and thirſt after good things: The beſt knowledge that in this Caſe we have, is, <hi>To Beg Food Convenient</hi> at our heavenly Fathers hands in that or the like Form of Prayer, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> And thus to beg it out of full aſſurance, that he is more ready to hear our requeſts, then any earthly Father is to give his children bread, or any earthly Mother to give her ſucking Infants milk when they cry for it; For ſome Mothers are unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, others may forget their children, but ſo will not God forget his, ſo they be <hi>children in malice,</hi> not in the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of his Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Little Children</hi> again if they be expoſed to cold, or heat, or any other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that may accrew from hoſtile or ravenous creatures, have no power or ſtrength to defend themſelves, all that they can do is but to cry for help from others.</p>
               <p>Now the ſpiritual and Ghoſtly enemies of every Child of God, and the dangers, whereto they daily expoſe themſelves, are more in number, then the bodily dangers, whereof little Children are capable; Leſſe able we are, though endowed with ſome meaſure of Grace, to reſiſt the Devil, who goeth about like a roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may devour, then a ſucking child to withſtand a Bear or Wolf, that ſhould come upon him. To what end then doth God beſtow his Grace upon us, if with this we cannot defend our ſelves, as with a weapon? Only to this end, that we ſhould daily pray for his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al protection, as his Son hath taught us: <hi>Lord lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,</hi> ſpecially from the Author of evil; <hi>for thine is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the power and the glory.</hi> Thou only art able to ſubdue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Prince of this world, and to deſtroy him, who hath the power of death.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, albeit we muſt exceed Little Children in the acknowledgment of our infirmities, and though our capacities to conceive theſe and the like forms of prayer be greater then theirs, yet in reſpect of moſt particulars we are in this too like Little Children, that <hi>we know not how to pray,</hi> or ask thoſe things, which for the preſent we ſtand moſt in need of. And in this point our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge muſt exceed theirs, that we muſt have a knowledge of this infirmity, and out of the conſciouſneſs of it pray more fervently unto our heavenly Father, that he would teach us how to pray, or hear the ſupplications of his Spirit for us, whoſe language we perfectly underſtand not: and not to indent with him for other particulars, but only to grant us what he knows to be beſt for us, and moſt available, though not for our preſent occaſions, yet for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Everlaſting life. Until we learn this leſſon of Humility and meekneſs, which <hi>The Son of God</hi> himſelf ſo often commends unto us by his own example, by Precept, and Inſtances, we ſhall find no true Reſt unto our ſouls; we ſhall not have that <hi>Full Aſſurance of hope unto the end,</hi> whereof our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But is this Qualification of becoming like Little Children alone ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient?</p>
               <p>No: he that ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever receiveth not the Kingdom of heaven as a little child ſhall not enter therein,</hi> hath alſo ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Except your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ſhall exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth he Inſtance in them, as in the moſt wicked men, that were?</p>
               <p>So his Inſtance ſhould not have been ſo pertinent, at leaſt his Admonition not ſo peremptory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3586" facs="tcp:32220:152"/>
The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> if they had not thought ſo of themſelves, were the moſt righteous men then living; they were the only <hi>Preciſians</hi> of thoſe times, and obſerved many Rules of righteouſneſs more exactly, then moſt men now living do any.</p>
               <p>Wherein then did they come ſhort of the promiſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By making Extraordinary Conſcience of ſome neceſſary duties, and little or none</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Why Chriſt inſtanceth in the Scribes and Phariſees.</note> 
                  <hi>at all of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The old Serpent deceived them, as he doth many Chriſtians to this day, by that <hi>Fallacie</hi> or <hi>Sophiſm,</hi> which we call <hi>A Dicto ſecundum quid ad ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that is, in uſing their known zealous obſervance of ſome good duties as an Argument, that they were <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> more righteous then other men, ſpecially then thoſe, whom they ſaw groſs tranſgreſſors of ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, which they made conſcience of. They did acknowledge, that they had received many Graces from God, for which they <hi>thanked</hi> him; but yet <hi>they gloried, as if they had not received them,</hi> and this polluted all their works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A good man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, is merciful unto his beaſt.</hi> This property of Good men is in the <hi>Turks,</hi> for they are more compaſſionate towards their dogs, more careful for begging them benevolence of ſtrangers and paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for feeding them in the open ſtreets, then moſt Chriſtians are for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their poor brethren; yet is that property of wicked men, which <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Turkiſh mercie</note> in the ſame place deſcribes, more remarkable in them. Their mercies are cruel; for out of this compaſſionate affection towards dumb creatures they will be ready to kill a Chriſtian man, if he chance to wrong or harm them. It is a good thing then to be zealous of good works; but unleſs this zeal be uniform, that is, unleſs it proportionably, if not equally, reſpect good works of every kind: <hi>partial or deformed zeal will bring forth compleat Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. But it is an eaſie matter to tell men, that their zeal muſt be uniform and unpartial; the point wherein ſatisfaction will be deſired is this: How this uniformity of zeal in good works muſt be wrought and planted in men? This men muſt learn from that fundamental Rule of our Saviour. <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye would that men ſhould do to you ſo do to them: for this the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> All of Us deſire or wiſh, that, not <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that man</hi> only, but that every <note place="margin">See the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes following upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Do as you would be done to.</hi>
                  </note> man ſhould deal juſtly, friendly, and kindly with us; ſhould think or ſpeak well of us, whilſt we do or intend well; ſhould Judge charitably of us when they know nothing to the contrary, and cenſure us charitably, if we chance to do amiſſe. The Rule of practiſe then in brief is this; that <hi>we make payment by the ſame meaſure, by which we borrow;</hi> that is do good, as occaſions or abilities ſerve, to every man as he is a man or our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; though in more abundant meaſure unto ſuch, as are our Chriſtian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and of the ſame Church and Religion. To be charitable in word, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed, in thought, towards all, even towards ſuch, as deſerve puniſhment or cenſure.</p>
               <p>Another branch of the ſame Rule is this; If any have really ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves kind unto us, to do unto them as they have done; If any have dealt rigidly or unkindly with us, not to do as they have done, but as we deſired they ſhould have done unto us; for our deſires to be well dealt withall are juſt, but ſo were not their dealings with us: And why ſhould we make other mens unjuſt dealing with us, rather then our own juſt deſires of being friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt withall, the Rule of our future actions, or dealings with the ſame men? For God will judge us by the former Rule, the Tenour whereof is
<pb n="3587" facs="tcp:32220:152"/>
this, <hi>not to do as we have been done unto,</hi> ſpecially if we have been unjuſtly dealt withall, <hi>but to do to every man, as we deſire they ſhould have done unto us.</hi> The ſame Rule may be yet further extended thus; we muſt do to every man not only as we deſire that every man ſhould do to us, but as we deſire that God ſhould do to us, or for us: So when we pray that God would forgive us our treſpaſſes, we muſt be ready to forgive them, that have treſpaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. If we deſire that God would relieve us in diſtreſs, comfort us in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or ſuccour us in need, we muſt be ready to relieve our neighbors in their diſtreſs, to ſuccour and comfort them (as we are able) in time of need; not thus (in ſome good meaſure) qualified, we do not pray in faith, our prayers are not truly religious; For as St. <hi>James</hi> tels us, Chap. 1. verſe the laſt. <hi>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this; to viſit the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe and widdows in their affliction, and to keep himſelf unſpotted of the world.</hi>

1. THis portion of Scripture is divided, by our Saviour himſelf, into Theſe <hi>two Generals:</hi> the firſt, <hi>A Sentence,</hi> which, <hi>for the matter,</hi> is <hi>Two-fold; Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Two Generals. 1. A ſentence and that Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> verſe 34. &amp;c. And again ver. 41. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> But many <hi>Sentences</hi> are given, which are not put in <hi>Execution!</hi> Yet this being the <hi>Final Sentence,</hi> that ſhall be given upon <hi>all men,</hi> and upon <hi>all their works,</hi> there is no queſtion, but it <note place="margin">2 The Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</note> ſhall be put in <hi>Execution.</hi> If <hi>reaſon,</hi> grounded upon <hi>Scripture,</hi> be not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to inforce our <hi>belief,</hi> as well concerning the <hi>Execution</hi> of the <hi>Sentence,</hi> as the Equitie thereof, we have an <hi>Expreſſe Teſtimonie</hi> of the <hi>Judge himſelf</hi> for the <hi>certaintie</hi> of this <hi>Execution,</hi> ver. 46. <hi>And theſe</hi> (to wit, <hi>the Goats,</hi> which were placed on his left hand, that is, all workers of iniquitie or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hearers of the word of life) <hi>ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sentence</hi> it ſelf, hath (by the perverſneſs of mans will, or by the curioſitie of ſome wits) been made the matter of many controverſies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <note place="margin">Controverſies about the Sentence.</note> in latter times: Of which we ſhall deliver our <hi>Opinion,</hi> as it ſhall fall out, in the proſecution of the <hi>Poſitive Truth,</hi> which we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poſitive Truthes,</hi> which I would commend unto the Readers medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are <hi>Three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Life everlaſting ſhall be awarded, Secundum opera,</hi> or that <hi>all men ſhall receive their final doom according to their works.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Three Poſitive verities or Concluſions.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond,</hi> which will neceſſarily follow upon this; <hi>That good Works are neceſſarie to ſalvation,</hi> or to the inheritance of this Kingdom here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third, That good works are neceſſarie to our admiſsion into this kingdom,</hi> Non tanqnam <hi>Cauſa</hi> regnandi, ſed quia <hi>Via</hi> ad regnum, <hi>not as meritorious Cauſes,</hi> for which this kingdom is by right due to us, or to any, <hi>but as the neceſſarie Way</hi> or path, by which all ſuch, as ſeek to enter into this Kingdom, muſt paſſe.</p>
               <p>To begin with the <hi>Firſt Point;</hi> That <hi>the Final reward or retribution ſhall be Secundum opera, according to mens works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. About <hi>this Poſition,</hi> Controverſie between us and the Romiſh Church there needed to have been none; unleſs ſome in that Church had been more deſirous to open a gap to new contentions, then ready to bring the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies already ſet on foot, to a <hi>Tryable Iſſue,</hi> by reducing them to ſome Point of Contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But <hi>ſome of good Note</hi> in that Church for learning and moderation, have left <hi>this Animadverſion</hi> upon Theſe words of <hi>Saint Matthew,</hi> That this place alone doth ſufficiently evince, that the Final Award or retribution ſhall be made <hi>Secundum Opera, non Secundum Fidem,</hi> according to <hi>works,</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </q> That God ſhould render to every man, either in this life, or at the laſt day, according unto his works, yea according to all his works, we never denied, For <hi>Solomon</hi> had long ſince ſaid as much, in his prayer to God. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 30. Yea all <hi>works,</hi> even the moſt ſecret <hi>works,</hi> thoſe of the heart not excepted, ſhall have their <hi>Proper Award,</hi> and every man ſhall reap according to that he hath ſowen; Whether he hath ſowen unto the fleſh, or unto the ſpirit. But that this <hi>Final Retribution</hi> ſhould be made, <hi>Secundum Opera, non Secundum Fidem,</hi> according to works <hi>only,</hi> not according to <hi>Faith,</hi> we cannot grant, without contradiction to the truth delivered by our Saviour and <hi>Saint Paul.</hi> For <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> by both their Doctrines, are
<pb n="3589" facs="tcp:32220:153"/>
ſo ſtrictly linkt together, that if the <hi>Final Retribution</hi> be made according to mens <hi>works,</hi> it muſt likewiſe be awarded according to mens <hi>Faith.</hi> And unleſſe the Advocates of the modern Romiſh Church, had been dipoſed to follow thoſe Hypocrites againſt whom <hi>Saint James</hi> diſputes in his ſecond Chapter (in their notions or apprehenſions of <hi>Faith)</hi> more then <hi>Saint James,</hi> yea more then <hi>Saint Paul;</hi> Nay more then our Saviour himſelf: they could not be ignorant of that contradiction, which is implied in their Aſſertion, <note place="margin">See The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cited by this Author in his fourth Book <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. &amp;c. about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparableneſs of Faith and works.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Final Retribution is made according to</hi> Works, <hi>not according to</hi> Faith. <hi>Know ye,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>that they which are of faith, the ſame are the children of Abraham:</hi> ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>The father of the faithful;</hi> And none can be <hi>his ſons</hi> or children, but by propagation or participation of his faith. Our Saviour ſaith unto the Jewes, <hi>John</hi> 8. 39. <hi>If ye were Abrahams children, ye would do the works of Abraham;</hi> And if they had done the works, they ſhould have had the <hi>Reward of Abraham.</hi> Yet, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They that be of faith are bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then it is true, that God rewarded <hi>Abraham</hi> according to his <hi>Works,</hi> and yet withall according to his <hi>Faith:</hi> yea he was therefore rewarded with bleſſing according to his <hi>works,</hi> becauſe his works were done in <hi>Faith,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he was faithful in his works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But do theſe Romaniſts which ſay, that we ſhall be rewarded according to <hi>Works,</hi> not according to <hi>Faith,</hi> as evidently contradict their pretended Patron <hi>Saint Iames,</hi> as they do <hi>Saint Paul?</hi> They do, without Queſtion; if we look into his intent and ſcope in that very place, from which they ſeek to magnifie <hi>Works</hi> above <hi>Faith,</hi> as well in point of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> as in reſpect of <hi>ſalvation</hi> or Final Retribution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Was not Abraham our Father</hi> (ſaith <hi>Saint James</hi> Chap. 2. 21.) <hi>juſtified by works, when he offered Iſaac his ſon upon the Altar?</hi> Yet the ſame Apoſtle doth not deny, but rather ſuppoſe, that <hi>Abraham</hi> offered up <hi>Iſaac</hi> by <hi>Faith;</hi> for ſo he addes ver. 23. that by <hi>this work, that Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. If this Scripture</hi> were fulfilled by <hi>this work,</hi> then <hi>Abrahams Faith did work in this work,</hi> or rather, <hi>did work this work;</hi> it was his <hi>working Faith</hi> or belief, which was imputed unto him for righteouſneſs; and it was impoſſible, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſhould be rewarded according to this <hi>work,</hi> and not be rewarded as well according to his <hi>Faith,</hi> as according to his <hi>Work.</hi> 
                  <q>Indeed if <hi>Abraham</hi> had profeſt only in General, <hi>That he did believe God and his word,</hi> but had ſtarted back from this or the like Service, which God had enjoyned him, he had not been <hi>juſtified.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But why not <hi>juſtified?</hi> only becauſe he had no <hi>works?</hi> nay, rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, not having ſuch <hi>works</hi> as God required at his hands, his <hi>Faith</hi> had not been ſound and perfect; and his <hi>Faith</hi> being not ſound and perfect, had not been imputed unto him for righteouſneſs. Now the Scripture plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, and <hi>St. James</hi> takes it as granted, that <hi>Abraham's belief,</hi> not his <hi>works,</hi> was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Albeit <hi>Saint James</hi> doth ſay, that the <hi>Belief was perfected by the work,</hi> yet all the perfection was the perfection of his <hi>Faith;</hi> the uſe and End of his <hi>work</hi> or of his <hi>Tryal</hi> was to perfect or ſtrengthen his <hi>Faith;</hi> as we ſay <hi>exerciſe of body doth perfect or confirm health;</hi> but it will not therefore follow, that <hi>Exerciſe of body is better then health,</hi> ſeeing all the perfection, that it hath, is at the ſervice of health. So far was this <hi>work</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by which <hi>Saint James</hi> ſaith <hi>his faith was perfected,</hi> from being a diſtinct perfection from the perfection of his <hi>faith,</hi> that <hi>Saint Paul</hi> includes the very <hi>Work</hi> in his <hi>Faith,</hi>

But how great ſoever <hi>this work</hi> were, the ſtrength, by which it was wrought, was meerly the ſtrength of his <hi>Faith;</hi> ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief, but was ſtrong in faith giving glory to God, and being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that what God had promiſed, he was alſo able to perform, and therefore was it imputed to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> So that if any man do not <hi>the works</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> it is becauſe he hath not <hi>the faith of Abraham;</hi> Impoſſible it were for any man that hath the ſame meaſure of <hi>Faith,</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> had, not to do the like <hi>works,</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> did. What meaſure of <hi>works truly good</hi> any man doth, ſo much, or ſo great a meaſure he hath of <hi>true Faith;</hi> And ſo far as any man is <hi>Rewarded according to his works,</hi> he is likewiſe rewarded according to his <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may extend that Saying of our Saviour (though ſpoken then, but to one man) unto all and every man <hi>[According to their faith ſo ſhall it be done unto them.]</hi> And our Saviour in the Parable next before <hi>This Sentence,</hi> expreſly avoucheth; that the Final Award or retribution ſhall be according to <hi>Faith; Matth.</hi> 25. 23. <hi>Well done thou good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> No man ſhall be rewarded for any <hi>Works,</hi> unleſs they were the <hi>Works of Faith,</hi> or done in <hi>Faith.</hi> To ſpeak properly it is the <hi>Fidelity of our Works,</hi> or our Fidelity in Working, which ſhall be rewarded. As for thoſe Hypocrites, againſt whom St, <hi>James</hi> diſputes (and from whoſe <hi>Notion</hi> or Conceit of <hi>Faith</hi> the Romiſh School-men, for the moſt part, take their <hi>Deſcription of Faith)</hi> they had altogether as little of <hi>Abrahams Faith,</hi> as they had of <hi>Abrahams Works;</hi> For if they had been partakers of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams faith,</hi> then, as our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> infers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7, <hi>They had been the ſons of Abraham;</hi> and if they had been <hi>the ſons of Abraham,</hi> they would (by our <hi>Saviours</hi> Inference) <hi>have done the works of Abraham.</hi> Such <hi>faith</hi> as they made brags of, could not juſtifie them, becauſe it was a <hi>dead and fruitleſſe faith,</hi> devoid of <hi>works.</hi> Such <hi>works,</hi> as the Romiſh Church doth magnifie in oppoſition to <hi>faith,</hi> can neither juſtifie, nor receive any Reward, becauſe they are no <hi>faithful Works;</hi> but rather like ſeeming fruits without any Root. They put their <hi>works</hi> upon their <hi>faith,</hi> as we do ſweet flowers upon dead Corpſes. Neither can give life or perfection to others. The beſt <hi>Cenſure</hi> that Chriſtian Faith or Charity will permit us to give of their doctrine <hi>Concerning the nature of faith and works,</hi> is This; That albeit, they all profeſs to believe that, which their Church believes, yet the moſt of them do neither believe nor practiſe as the Church (in theſe points) teacheth. Their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in this particular is much better then their knowledge of moſt of the reſt.</p>

                  <hi>works</hi> from the work of Juſtification, ſome Roman Writers (I dare not ſay all) ſought <hi>to be even with them</hi> by excluding <hi>faith</hi> from ſharing with <hi>works</hi> in the Final Award or retribution. For beſides this <hi>Eagerneſs of extream Oppoſition</hi> or deſire to be <hi>contrary</hi> unto us, it is not imaginable what could move any learned Writer amongſt them to Affirm that this <hi>final Retribution ſhall be according to VVorks,</hi> and <hi>Deny</hi> it, According to <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. About the <hi>Second Poſition</hi> there is no Controverſie betwixt us and the <note place="margin">Good works neceſſary to Salvation.</note> Romiſh Church; we hold <hi>Good works to be as neceſſary to ſalvation, as they do;</hi> As <hi>neceſſary</hi> according to <hi>both Branches of Neceſsity. Neceſſarie</hi> they are, <hi>Neceſsitate praecepti,</hi> and neceſſarie likewiſe <hi>Neceſsitate medii; neceſſarie</hi> by Precept or duty, for God hath commanded us to do them, he hath redeemed us to the end that we ſhould ſerve him in righteouſneſs and holineſs. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, which are in this ſenſe <hi>neceſſary,</hi> in that their Omiſſion doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily include a breach of Gods Commandement, and by conſequent a ſin, do not alwayes induce or argue a Forfeiture of our Eſtate in Grace, or utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from the' Kingdom of heaven: For this Reaſon we ſay, That <hi>Good works are neceſſary,</hi> not only <hi>Neceſsitate praecepti,</hi> by way of Command, but <hi>Neceſsitate medii,</hi> as the way and means, ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſalvation, that without the practiſe of them, no man can be admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Through the Omiſsion of Good works, many do forfeit that Intereſt, which they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Omiſſion of Good Works forfeit our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the promiſes.</note> 
                  <hi>truly had in the promiſes of everlaſting Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>promiſe it ſelf,</hi> all that are partakers of the Word and Sacrament, all that acknowledge the Word revealed to be the way unto everlaſting life, have <hi>A true Intereſt.</hi> Of <hi>the pledge</hi> or earneſt of the bleſſing promiſed, that is of juſtifying or ſanctifying Grace, none are partakers, but ſuch as are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in <hi>Good works,</hi> according to the means or abilities, which God hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them.</p>
               <p>Whether it be poſſible for ſuch as are once eſtated in Grace to give over the Practiſe of <hi>Good works,</hi> that here we leave to ſuch as deſire to exerciſe their wits in the controverſies about Falling from Grace: (and the rather becauſe we have ſpoke a word of that Point in the 26. Chapter of this Book.) Let them determine of the Categorical Affirmative or Negative as they pleaſe: This Conditional is moſt certain: <q>[If it be poſſible for him, that hath Grace or Faith (in what meaſure ſoever) inherent, to give over the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Good Works; he ſhall thereby forfeit his preſent eſtate in Gods promiſes and defeat his hopes of inheriting the Kingdom of God.]</q> 
                  <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>ſhall break one of theſe Commandements and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall do, and teach them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. For I ſay unto you that except your righteouſneſſe ſhall exceed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 5. 20. Yet did theſe Scribes and Phariſees many Good Works, and made conſcience of many Duties, which many Preciſe Ones in our dayes do not trouble their Conſciences withal. This notwithſtanding, Theſe Scribes and Phariſees did exclude themſelves from the Kingdom of Heaven (as here eſtabliſhed on earth) by leaving other Good Works (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, or for the moſt part) undone, which the Law of God did no leſſe require at their hands. Even the Good Works, which they did, were not well done by them, becauſe they were not done in Faith; they never came ſo near unto the Kingdom of Heaven, as to acknowledge Chriſt for their Lord; much leſſe to be partakers of thoſe Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Aſcenſion were beſtowed on men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3592" facs="tcp:32220:155"/>
Nor ſhall all they, which were partakers of thoſe Gifts, and which did ſtill acknowledge him for their Lord, enter into the Kingdom, which is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for ſuch as <hi>continue in well doing.</hi> So ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Not every one that</hi> ſaith <hi>unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom, but he that</hi> doth, &amp;c. <hi>Many will then ſay, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name? and in thy name have caſt out divels? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profeſs unto them; I never knew you; Depart from me ye workers of iniquitie,</hi> Matth. 7. 21, 22.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But, in this place, We ſee the Sentence is not awarded for Poſitive <note place="margin">Damnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions.</hi>
                  </note> Works of iniquitie, but for <hi>Omiſsion of the duties of charitie;</hi> 
                  <q>He ſaith not, Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels, Becauſe ye have oppreſſed the poor and ſtranger; or, for that ye have robbed the Fatherleſs and made a prey of the widdow.</q> Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are works of iniquity, and deſerve Excluſion from the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>But is it a Work of iniquity, <hi>not to work at all?</hi> As not to give meat unto the hungry? Not to give drink unto the thirſtie? Not to cloath the naked, or lodge the harbourleſs? Yes; even <hi>theſe Omiſsions</hi> deſerve Excluſion from the Kingdom of Heaven: Either by their connexion with ſins of oppreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it is ſcarce poſsible that any which hear Chriſts promiſes ſhould be barren of good Works, unleſs they were too fruitful in the works of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and oppreſsion; or rather becauſe, as our Saviour elſewhere infers, that, <hi>Not to ſave mens lives, when means and opportunitie is offered, is to kill;</hi> Not to feed the hungrie, is a bloody ſin; Not to cloath the naked, is as the ſin of Oppreſsion.</p>
               <p>The Doing of ſome Good Works cannot excuſe men for the Omiſsion of others which be as neceſſary; To propheſie in Chriſts name is a Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Work; to caſt out Divels is a Work of Greater Charity and comfort to the poſſeſſed, then to viſit the priſoners; and yet ſuch as have done theſe and many other wonderful Works ſhall not be admitted at the Laſt Day.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Goodneſs of the Works which we are bound to do, there muſt be an Uniformitie in them; Otherwiſe they are not done in <hi>Faith.</hi> Now the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> and belief, which inclines our hearts to works of one kind, will incline them to the practiſe of every kind, which we know or believe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at our hands by our Lord and Maſter. That even the beſt Works of mercy, or moſt beneficial unto others, are not acceptable unto God; unleſs they be done out of <hi>Faith</hi> &amp; obedience to our Maſters Will, is clear from our Apoſtles <hi>Verdict of Enoch, Heb.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>Before his tranſlation,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>he had this teſtimonie, that he pleaſed God;</hi> For ſo it is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>that he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God;</hi> the <hi>way,</hi> by which he walked, was his Good Works and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, but <hi>The Guide of this way and his works was his Faith.</hi> So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle infers, <hi>without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God; for he that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them, that diligently ſeek him.</hi> ver. 6. As God is the Author of goodneſs, yea goodneſs it ſelf; ſo we cannot come unto him by any other way, then by doing good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet that, which muſt make even our beſt Works pleaſing to him, muſt be our Belief in him, and in his goodneſs, and that he is <hi>A bountiful Rewarder</hi> of all that do good;</p>
               <p>The good Works even of the Heathen, and of ſuch as knew neither him nor his Providence; of ſuch, as in ſtead of him worſhipped falſe gods, were rewarded by him; but with rewards and bleſſings only Temporal: He was
<pb n="3593" facs="tcp:32220:155"/>
their Rewarder; but not himſelf their Reward. This was the Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar of Abraham his friend, and of Abrahams children, that is, of all ſuch, as do the works of Abraham out of the Faith of Abraham, that is, out of a lively apprehenſion and true eſteem of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Unto all ſuch he himſelf ſhall be <hi>merces magna nimis,</hi> or <hi>valdè magna,</hi> Their exceeding great Reward. Unto men thus qualified, and only unto them, it ſhall be ſaid; <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> This Kingdom ſhall be a Kingdom of everlaſting bliſs; and yet the greateſt bleſſedneſs of this Kingdom ſhall conſiſt in the fruition or enjoying of the preſence of this Everlaſting King, who is goodneſs it ſelf; the participation of whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the very Life and Eſſence of that happineſs, which all deſire, but none ſhall attain, beſides ſuch as do His Will by well doing. To be ſeparated for ever from his preſence is the ſource of all the miſerie, which ſhall befall the damned or accurſed.</p>
               <p>But from this place of our Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. The Romaniſt (alwayes <note place="margin">The Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts wreſting <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 6. to maintain merit of Works.</note> ready like the ſpider to ſuck poiſon from ſuch flowers in this garden of God as naturally afford honey to ſuch as ſeek God) labours to infer, as he doth out of the words of the text, <hi>That the Everlaſting Kingdom here promiſed is the juſt Reward of our good works,</hi> and is as properly <hi>merited,</hi> as everlaſting death is by the Omiſſion of the works here mentioned, or by the Poſitive Works of inquitie. So that I ſhould here according to my propoſed <hi>method</hi> proceed unto the third point, That <hi>theſe good works, how neceſſary ſoever they be,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The third Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive truth mentioned §. 1. handled Chap. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>are neceſſary only Tanquam via ad regnum, non tanquam cauſa regnandi, only as the Way and Means, which lead unto this Kingdom, not as the cauſes of its prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us, or of our admiſsion unto it.</hi> But for the preſent, I chuſe rather to make ſome uſe or Application of what hath been ſaid concerning <hi>the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Good Works,</hi> then to diſpute of their Efficacie or Cauſality for attaining this Kingdom, intending to touch that a little more in the next Chapter, though with reference to what I have ſpoken in the 27. and 28. Chapters.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You ſee that Good Works done in faith (or, which is all one, a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith) are abſolutely neceſſarie unto ſalvation. But are they as neceſſary to Juſtification? If they be; how is it ſaid by <hi>St. Auſtine,</hi> and approved by the Articles of the Church of <hi>England; Bona opera ſequuntur hominem juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatum, non praecedunt in homine juſtificando?</hi> Good works follow Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they do not go before it. <q>This Orthodoxal Truth only imports thus much, That no man can do thoſe works, which are capable of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before he be inabled by God to do them; and that this ability to do them is from the Gift of Juſtifying Faith.</q> Now every one that hath this Faith in his heart is ſaid to be Juſtified, that is, abſolved from the Guilt of ſins paſt, and freed from the Tyranny and Dominion of ſin, by receiving this pledge or earneſt of Gods mercie: and in this ſenſe is Juſtification taken by St. <hi>James,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>a man is juſtified by works,</hi> that is, He is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>the Son of faithful Abraham,</hi> nor may he preſume upon his own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Juſtification or eſtate in Grace, until he be qualified and enabled to do the Works of <hi>Abraham.</hi> In the ſame ſenſe is Juſtification taken by St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 22. 11 <hi>Qui justus eſt juſtificetur ad huc; Let him that is righteous be righteous ſtill, or more juſtified.</hi> 
                  <q>And in this ſort Children or Infants are ſaid to be Juſtified by the Infuſion of Faith. The practiſe of Good Works is not required to their Juſtification before they come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil. But neither is the apprehenſion or actual Belief of
<pb n="3594" facs="tcp:32220:156"/>
Gods mercies in Chriſt required of them;</q> Though they be juſtified and ſaved for the Merits of Chriſt and through his blood, as we are. Yet is not the Rule for Application of theſe Merits, the ſame in them and in men of years and diſcretion: (Though, with ſome abatement or allowance, it holds in ſuch as are converted to Chriſt upon their death beds; Theſe muſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Gods mercies in Chriſt, reſolve to do Good Works; and leave teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of ſorrow for their paſt negligence in doing Good Works:) For in ſuch as are endued with knowledge of Chriſt, and are enlightned to ſee their miſerable eſtate by nature, the ſelf ſame Faith which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends Gods mercies in Chriſt, cannot be idle, it will be working that which is Good and acceptable in the ſight of God. In vain it it ſhall be for them to ſue for mercie at Gods hands through the Merits of Chriſt, unleſs for love to Chriſt (whoſe Merits for them and Goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, Faith apprehends) they be ready to do the works, which he hath commended unto them. For (as you heard before) <hi>not every one that ſaith unto him, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of his Father, which is in Heaven;</hi> and his Fathers Will is, that we do thoſe things, which he here commands.</p>
               <p>But another ſpecial Branch of the ſame Will is, <hi>That when we have done all this, we faithfully acknowledge our ſelves to be unprofitable ſervants.</hi> This our Plea for mercie (as men altogether unworthy for our beſt Works ſake to be partaker of Gods Goodneſs or of everlaſting bliſs) is that juſtification, <note place="margin">☞</note> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much inſiſts upon in moſt of his Epiſtles: and unto This Juſtification, that is, to our good ſucceſs in making this Plea, Good works are neceſſary and uſually Precedent; or, as it is uſually taught by Good wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; Good works are neceſſary <hi>quoad preſentiam,</hi> (to juſtification) <hi>non quoad efficientiam:</hi> Their <hi>preſence is neceſſarie to Juſtification, their Efficacy or efficiencie is not neceſſary;</hi> for as you have heard before, and ſhall afterwards <hi>(Chap.</hi> 31.) hear; meritorious efficiencie they have none.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But let us ever remember, as I often put the Reader in mind, when it is ſaid, <hi>VVe muſt renounce all our works in the Plea of Iuſtification or ſuite of Pardon for our ſins;</hi> This muſt be underſtood Of thoſe good Works, which we have done, not of thoſe, which we have left undone; For theſe are not ours. Theſe, the Hypocrites and unbeleevers will be ready to renonnce. He alone truly renounceth his Works, that doth Good Works, and yet when he hath done them, puts no truſt or confidence in them, and ſeeks not to improve them ſo far as to make them <hi>meritorious,</hi> but wholly relies upon <hi>Gods mercies in Chriſt,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing from the <hi>Law</hi> unto the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Nor is it <hi>every ſort</hi> of Relyance upon <hi>Gods mercies in Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>A faithful</hi> and ſtedfaſt relyance, that can avail; and <hi>no man can faithfully rely upon Chriſts merits, but he that is faithful in doing his Fathers VVill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. But is this Neceſſitie of good Works to be equally extended to all ſorts of Good works? So ſaith <hi>Saint James, Chap.</hi> 2. 10, 11. <hi>VVhoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guiltie of all; for he that ſaid, do not commit adulterie, ſaid alſo, do not kill. Now if thou commit no adulterie, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the Law.</hi> 
                  <q>His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, That albeit we are diligent in many points of Gods ſervice, yet if we wittingly diſpenſe with our ſouls in other parts of it, this is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we Truly and faithfully obſerve no part. For, if we did obſerve <note place="margin">See this Authors Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith or fourth Book. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.</note> Any part of his Commandments, out of Faith or ſincere obedience to Gods Will, we would obſerve, as much as in us lies, every branch of his Will revealed.</q>

               <p>

For as true Faith will not admit <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> Reſpects of Perſons (which was the fault in the beginning of that Chapter taxed by <hi>St. Iames,</hi> and gave occaſion to the <hi>Maxim</hi> or principle in the words laſt cited) ſo doth it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all <gap reason="foreign">

This is the true intent and meaning of the Apoſtle, which ſome (to the wounding of their brethrens weak conſciences) have extended too far, who ſay expreſly (or at leaſt are ſo defective in expreſſing themſelves, as they occaſion others to think) <q>That if a man either poſitively or more grievouſly tranſgreſs in breach of Gods <hi>Negative Precepts,</hi> or often fail in performance of ſome <hi>Poſitive Duties</hi> commanded by him, it is all one as if he had tranſgreſſed all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is more then can be gathered from <hi>St. James</hi> in this place; or from <note place="margin">A Siniſter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Saint James.</hi> 2. 10.</note> any other part of Gods word, which only condemnes <hi>Partialitie</hi> to Gods Commandments. Now a man may treſpaſs oftner and more grievouſly againſt ſome one, or more of Gods commandments (whether <hi>Negative</hi> or <hi>Affirmative)</hi> then he doth againſt others, and yet do all this, not out of any paſſionate affected <hi>Partialitie</hi> towards Gods Commandments, or for want of uniformitie in his <hi>Faith</hi> or Affections towards Chriſt; but only out of the <hi>Inequalitie</hi> of his own natural or acquired inclinations to ſome peculiar ſins or vices in reſpect of others. Some men, as well before Regeneration or knowledge of Chriſt, as after, may be naturally, or out of cuſtome, more prone to wantonneſs, then unto covetouſneſs. Others again by natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or bad cuſtome, may be more prone to covetouſneſs, to ambition, or unadviſed anger, then unto wantonneſs. Others again by bad education may be more prone to raſh oathes or cauſleſs ſwearing then to any the former vices. One ſort, after their regeneration, or after they come to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their wayes, may offend more often and more grievouſly againſt the third Commandment, then againſt the ſixth or ſeventh.

Is not this the faſt, that I have choſen? to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor, that are caſt out, to thy houſe? when thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh.</hi> Again, <hi>Faſting</hi> is uſeful or expedient only at ſome certain times and ſeaſons: <hi>Theſe duties</hi> here mentioned <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34. &amp;c. are at all times neceſſarie, they are never out of ſeaſon; they are (upon the reſpects laſt mentioned) moſt ſeaſonable when we <hi>Faſt,</hi> and yet in ſome ſort more ſeaſonable when we <hi>Feaſt.</hi> For feaſting of our ſelves or of the Rich, <hi>being unmindful of the poor and needy is to bring a curſe upon our ſelves, and</hi>

               <p>St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> obſerves, that, the duty of praying continually is not literally meant of praying alwayes with our lips, nor of multiplying ſet hours of Devotion; but <hi>Omne opus bonum; Every good work is a Real Prayer,</hi> ſpecially if we conſecrate our ſelves to it by prayer. The continuance of Good works begun and undertaken by prayer, is a continuation of our prayers; So that by <hi>Praying often,</hi> and <hi>doing Good to others continually,</hi> we may be ſaid to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve or fulfill that precept <hi>Pray continually.</hi>

                  <q>He grants withal, That the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Righteous depends upon Gods Bleſſing and Predeſtination, upon which likewiſe their Good works depend, Leſt any ſhould <hi>glory</hi> in himſelf;</q> A ſin forbidden, by Gods Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>That <hi>All then is to be attributed to Gods mercie,</hi> that <hi>no man may glorie in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or in his works,</hi> is true, Our enemies, in this Point, being Judges; is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <note place="margin">A Catholick verity.</note> by <hi>our Adverſaries,</hi> even in this place, from which they ſeek to eſtabliſh Merits.

               </p>
               <p>The other; That <hi>this Doctrine of merit is taught by the Holy Ghoſt, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Chriſt himſelf, by his Prophets, or Apoſtles;</hi> for ſo it muſt be taught, if it be impoſed as an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> although we could not convince it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Former, or any other <hi>Article of Faith.</hi>

3. That the Doctrine of <hi>Merits</hi> doth not contradict the Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which aſcribes our ſalvation <hi>wholly to the mercie of God; Janſenius</hi> ſeeks to juſtifie by <hi>this One Reaſon:</hi> For that the Romiſh Church doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <note place="margin">The ſtate of the Queſtion,</note> thoſe <hi>Good Works,</hi> (wherein ſhe placeth <hi>Merits)</hi> to proceed from the <hi>Mercie of God.</hi> But <hi>this ſpeech of his [Habemus bona opera a miſcricor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Dei:</hi> By or from the mercies of God we have our Good Works:] is Indefinite; that is, It is uncertain how far this man himſelf, or any of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, do acknowledge Good Works to proceed from the Mercie of God. If he had ſaid, that <hi>All our Good Works are wholly from God,</hi> this had agreed well with both branches of his Former Concluſion; As Firſt, <hi>That All were to be given to the mercie of God;</hi> And Secondly, <hi>That no man might glorie in himſelf or in his works.</hi> But if his Speech had been thus farre extended, it would have left no room for merits; whereas the Doctrine of Merits muſt have place in all the writings, that come from the Roman Preſs, albeit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Writer himſelf had aſſigned them none. But if either <hi>All our Good Works</hi> be not from God; or if <hi>All of them</hi> be from God <hi>Quoad Originem,</hi> only as they are in the Root, but not as they are in their Growth and perfection; Then there may perhaps ſome place be left for Merit. So much of them, as proceeds from our ſelves and not from God, might be accounted our own; but yet being ours, there is no neceſſity, that God ſhould reward them with everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>For the clearer underſtanding of our adverſaries meaning, and <hi>the State of the Queſtion</hi> betwixt us and them, we may conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Root or Faculty; <note place="margin">Conſider three things.</note> 
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> the Stemme or Habit of meritorious works. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Fruit, or works themſelves, or the exerciſe or practiſe, of, or according to, their Habit. The Root or Facultie whence works truly good do ſpring (as moſt of the Romiſh Church now acknowledge) is <hi>Grace infuſed.</hi> And this Infuſion of Grace (by which men in their Divinity are firſt juſtified) they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be wholly from God. And in that they acknowledge the <hi>Firſt Grace,</hi> or <hi>Root of Good Works</hi> to be <hi>wholly from Gods mercie,</hi> they conſequently deny that it can be <hi>merited.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Maxim</hi> in their modern Schools, as we ſhewed before, that, <hi>Fundamentum meriti non cadit ſub merito, The Foundation of merits cannot be merited.</hi> And this <hi>Foundation of merits is the Firſt Grace,</hi> by which man is firſt juſtified: But after this Grace be once infuſed, the Uſe of it depends upon mans Free-will: He that uſeth this Talent well, or not amiſs, ſhall have more given him. This Overplus the Romiſh Church aſcribes to the Merit of Works: And by the habitual and conſtant uſe of Grace, and Free-will, Life Eternal it ſelf (by their Doctrine) may be properly merited. We acknowledge that whoſoever doth not hide the Talent of Grace, but imploys it aright, ſhall certainly receive increaſe of Grace from God, and be partaker of joy according to the meaſure of his Works, though not For his Works ſake, or for his right uſe of Grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſay the Increaſe of Grace is no more from any Works or Merits <note place="margin">Increaſe of Grace no more merited then the Firſt Grace.</note> of Works, then the Firſt Grace it ſelf is. The inheritance of Eternal Life can no more be purchaſed by the fulleſt meaſure of Grace, or greateſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Works (that in this life can be attained unto) then the Firſt Grace can be purchaſed by Works. That the Firſt Grace is not given for our Works, is not procured by them, the Romiſh Church now acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth.</p>
               <p>This beginning of <hi>Grace or foundation of merits</hi> they confeſſe that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the ſole bleſſing or Predeſtination of God. And ſo ſay we, <hi>All increaſe of Grace; the Preparation of this Kingdom for us, our Preparation</hi>

No man can do well, unleſs he be enabled firſt by God to do well; and the more he is enabled by Gods Gifts and Graces beſtowed upon him, the more he is bound to God. Nor can we ever in this life be ſo thankful unto God for Gifts already received, as we ought to be. The leaſt increaſe of Grace after the <hi>Firſt Grace</hi> given, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the greateſt meaſure of our ſervice or thankfulneſs; if we could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially eſteem or rate them by their proper worth or weight. So that the more Grace we receive from God, or the better our Works are, the more ſtill we are indebted to him that inables us to work: and as our debt to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, ſo our Title, to <hi>Merit</hi> any thing at his hands (queſtionleſſe) decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
               <p>To conclude then;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which creates a new Title of bond or debt unto God from us, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be the Ground-title of merits (that is, Of any debts or dues from God</hi>

                  <hi>Therefore, Neither the Firſt Grace, nor any increaſe of Grace can be</hi> Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum meriti, <hi>any Foundation or Ground-title unto merits:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But rather, ſeeing <hi>Merits</hi> include a Debt or due from God to us, he that moſt aboundeth in <hi>Grace,</hi> which is the <hi>Free Gift of God,</hi> will be moſt ready to diſclaim all Merits.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

But that Good Works ſhould deſerve Eternal Life, Only upon ſuppoſal of Gods promiſe, ſome of the greateſt Scholars (I will not ſay of the beſt men amongſt them) will not yield. But to take them at their Beſt; As when they ſay, that <hi>Good works do merit as much as God hath promiſed to Reward them with;</hi> This is too bad.

conſideration of what he promiſeth, he is tyed in Law to perform his promiſe; and is a debter till he perform it: The <hi>performance is not a meer courteſie or bountie, but an Act of Commutative Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>Aſſuming</hi> of a ſhilling may bind a man to the payment of many pounds. Whereſoever there is <hi>Quid pro quo,</hi> or <hi>Ratio dati et accepti, ſomething as well given as taken</hi> upon mutual promiſe, there is an <hi>Act of Commutative Justice;</hi> And whereſoever there is not <hi>Ratio dati et accepti, Somewhat given as well taken,</hi> there can be nothing due in <hi>Juſtice.</hi> From this <hi>ground</hi> ſome great Schoolmen in the Romiſh Church deny <hi>Juſtice commutative,</hi> or that branch of Juſtice, which is the Rule of all matters of bargain or ſale, to be properly in God, becauſe there cannot be <hi>Ratio dati et accepti, any mutual giving</hi> or <hi>taking between God and his creatures;</hi> For he gives us all that we have or can have; we cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly give him any thing which he hath not. And for this reaſon albeit he were purpoſed to beſtow the greateſt meaſure of <hi>Grace</hi> upon us, that any creature is capable of, this could not include any <hi>Grace of merit;</hi> for ſtill <hi>the more place Grace hath in our hearts; the leſs room there is for Merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is; that our Lord and Saviour did <hi>merit</hi> heaven at his Fathers hands for us; but the ground or foundation of this <hi>His merit,</hi> was, not only the fulneſſe of <hi>Grace</hi> in him as man, but that he being in the Form of God, the Son of God, equal to his Father, did humble himſelf and become man for us, and did his Father ſervice as man; he therefore did <hi>merit</hi> all graces for us, becauſe he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> not by Adoption, or creation, but by Eternal Generation. To be <hi>the Sons of God</hi> by Adoption, or to be made his ſons by Grace, is a bleſſing beſtowed on us, for the which we become Debters to God the Father and ſervants to God the Son; ſo deeply indebted to both, that albeit we ſhould do ten times more then we do, we ſhould ſtill be unprofitable ſervants; we could not make the leaſt <hi>Recompence</hi> for that, which he hath done for us.</p>
               <p>The manner of the Apoſtles Interrogation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 35. <hi>Quis prior illi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dedit? who hath firſt given to him?</hi> includes an <hi>univerſal negation,</hi> No man hath given ought to God; No man can give any thing unto him. And if none can give any thing unto him, none can receive any thing from him by way of <hi>merit</hi> or valuable conſideration, but of meer mercy and free Bounty.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If we would ſcan the <hi>Tenor</hi> of all Gods promiſes made unto us in Scripture, with ſuch accurateneſs as Lawyers do Tenures of Land; we ſhould find; that he <hi>only promiſeth to be merciful and bountiful unto us;</hi> whether we limit his promiſes to the <hi>First Grace,</hi> which we receive from him, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them to <hi>All after-increaſe of Grace,</hi> or to the accompliſhing of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings promiſed in this life by our admiſſion unto life eternal in the world to come. Now if <hi>Mercy and Bounty be the Compleat Object of all his promiſes,</hi> then may we not expect performance or accompliſhment of his promiſes as a <hi>Juſt recompence or merit</hi> for any ſervice, which we do him, but only as the Fruit or effect of his mercy or loving kindneſs.</p>
               <p>If a loving earthly father ſhould allot his ſon a liberal Penſion before he could in modeſtie ask it, or in diſcretion expect it, and promiſe him withall, that if he did employ this preſent years Penſion well, he would allow him more liberally for the next year following; in this caſe, how well ſoever his ſon did either demean himſelf, or uſe his preſent Penſion; yet ſeeing the whole profit did redound unto himſelf, not unto his father; the more boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully his father deals with him in the years following, the more ſtill he is bound unto him. An ingenuous or gracious ſon would not <hi>challenge</hi> the
<pb n="3603" facs="tcp:32220:160"/>
ſecond or third years Penſion as <hi>more due</hi> unto him by <hi>right</hi> or <hi>merit,</hi> then the Firſt, albeit he had his fathers promiſe for theſe two years, which he had not for the firſt: For the fathers promiſe was only to be good and bountiful unto him, ſo he would be dutifully thankful for his bountie. Now to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or <hi>challenge</hi> that by way of <hi>right</hi> and <hi>merit,</hi> which is promiſed meerly out of <hi>favour</hi> or loving kindneſs, and upon condition of dutiful demeanour, is <hi>a tranſgreſsion of duty,</hi> an high degree of unthankfulneſs, eſpecially from a ſon unto the father. For every ſon by the Law of God and nature owes obedience and reſpect unto his Father; and though there be <hi>no mutual bond of Obedience,</hi> yet is there <hi>a bond of mutual dutie</hi> between an earthly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his ſon; at leaſt the father as well as the ſon owes obedience unto Gods Law, and Gods Law enjoyns every father unto kind uſuage of his ſon, ſo he challenge it not by way of debt or <hi>merit,</hi> but in love, humilitie, or obedience.</p>
               <p>But on our heavenly Father no bond of Obedience, of debt, or dutie can be laid; what good ſoever he doth unto us, it is meerly from his <hi>Free Mercy</hi> and loving kindneſs. It was his meer goodneſs to Create us; to give our Firſt Parents ſuch <hi>Being,</hi> as once they had. This Firſt <hi>Being</hi> could not be <hi>merited,</hi> nor doth any Romaniſt affirm it could. Having loſt that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein we were created, it was more then <hi>meer Goodneſs,</hi> the <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of mercy,</hi> to make us any promiſe of Reſtauration to our <hi>Firſt blood and Dignitie.</hi> And after this promiſe made, it is but the continuation or increaſe of the ſame abundant mercy to <hi>beſtow the Grace of Adoption</hi> upon us; and no more it is then a continuance or Overplus of this abundant mercy, <hi>to increaſe</hi> this Grace of Adoption in us, yearly, dayly, and hourly. Laſtly to crown this continuance of his Grace and mercy towards us with an Everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is but an abundant exceſs of the ſame mercy and loving kindneſs, out of which he firſt promiſed the Grace of Adoption, and dayly increaſed it. <hi>Si merita noſtra aliquid facerent, ad damnationem noſtram veniret. Non venit ille ad inſpectionem meritorum, ſed ad remiſsionem peccatorum. Non fuiſti, et factus es: Quid Deo dediſti? malus fuiſti, et liberatus es: Quid Deo dediſti?

               </p>
               <p>Briefly, in that <hi>Gods Mercie and Goodnes</hi> is abſolutely infinite, it can admit of no External Motive or inducement, either for beſtowing the <hi>Firſt Grace</hi> upon us, or for increaſing it, or for the perpetuation of it: we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve or <hi>merit</hi> the withdrawing of his mercies from us, or the decreaſe of his bleſsings; but deſerve or <hi>merit</hi> their increaſe we cannot; for <hi>merit</hi> ſuppoſeth more then a <hi>motive</hi> or inducement; it neceſſarily includeth a Tie or <hi>Oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> whereas no obligement or inducement can be laid upon infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe continuation and increaſe is likewiſe ſucceſsively infinite (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all period or reſtraint) unto all ſuch, as do not <hi>merit</hi> or provoke the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction or diminution of it,</p>

of many <hi>Good works,</hi> which the Publicans did not ſo much as approve, much leſs practiſe, leaſt of all practiſe with zeal and conſtancie. But were they therefore nearer to the Kingdom of heaven here promiſed? or were they more juſtified by their <hi>works,</hi> then the Publicans were, which did not work? The <hi>Parable of the Phariſee and Publican, Luke</hi> 18. doth witneſs the contrary. <hi>I tell you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, verſe 14. <hi>this man went down unto his houſe rather juſtified then the other,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Phariſee.</hi> What was it then, that made the <hi>Phariſee</hi> more uncapable of juſtification, then the <hi>Publican?</hi> want of works! No! As he alledgeth (and no man could diſprove his allegation) <hi>He faſted twice in the week, and gave Tithe of all, that ever he poſſeſt.</hi> What then? Only <hi>The opinion of merits,</hi> or over-weening conceipt of the <hi>worth</hi> of theſe his <hi>Poſitive works,</hi> or of his abſtinence from groſſe and mortal ſins.</p>
               <p>But it may be, he aſcribed all this to <hi>His own Free-Will,</hi> not to the favour and grace of God? Not ſo! <hi>For</hi> if we compare him with the modern Papiſts in <hi>this Point,</hi> we are bound in conſcience to pronounce the ſame ſentence of them, that our Saviour did of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and the <hi>Publican.</hi> The <hi>Phariſee, that very Phariſee, which our Saviour ſaid was leſs juſtified then the Publican, is more juſtifiable then any modern Romaniſt, which beleeves the doctrine of</hi> merits, <hi>as now it is taught; or deſpiſeth our Church, as leſs holy then the Church of Rome, for denying the merit of works.</hi> For even this <hi>Phariſee,</hi> albeit he thought himſelf a great deal better then the <hi>Publican,</hi> yet did he not aſcribe this to himſelf, or to his <hi>Free-will;</hi> for ſo he makes his confeſsion, ver. 11. <hi>God I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, Extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this Publican.</hi> In ſaying <hi>thus,</hi> he did acknowledge not only his <hi>Poſitive good works</hi> (as faſting and paying tithes) but his <hi>Abſtinence from evil,</hi> as from extortion &amp;c. to be <hi>from God:</hi> For <hi>he thanks</hi> him that he was not an extortioner; and his ſolemn Thanks include an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it was his gift whom he thanks, that he was no extortioner, no unjuſt or adulterous perſon. That the <hi>Phariſee</hi> did conceive as the Romaniſt doth, that the <hi>Firſt Grace,</hi> by which he began to be more obſervant of Gods Lawes, then the Publicans, or other men, were, was <hi>only from God;</hi> and that the <hi>increaſe of this Grace,</hi> or his proficiencie in good life and works was from himſelf, or the effect of his Free-will, this is more then can be laid unto his charge; For he ſaith not, <hi>God I thank thee that thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or reclaimed me from ſo ſinful paths, as this Publican walks in:</hi> To have ſaid thus much, and no more, might have left a ſuſpition, that he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>Firſt Grace</hi> of his converſion to be Gods meer Gift, not ſo the <hi>Second</hi> or <hi>Third Grace;</hi> or the increaſe of <hi>Grace,</hi> or his proficiencie in good Life. But now he ſaith <hi>[God I thank thee that I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican;]</hi> This includeth an acknowledgment, that all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whereof until this very day he deemed himſelf poſſeſt, was <hi>from God,</hi> was his <hi>Free Gift.</hi> So that it would be very hard to faſten any part of the doctrine of <hi>merits,</hi> which is now ſtiffely maintained by the Romiſh Church, upon this <hi>Phariſee.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That this was his meaning, any honeſt plain dealing man that ſhould read him only upon thoſe words of this Text, would eaſily be perſwaded; howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, in the <hi>Proceſs</hi> or <hi>Sentence</hi> againſt the wicked, ver. 41. he expreſly unſayes the moſt part of that, which he here ſeems to ſay; being thereto inforced by the Real circumſtances of <hi>the Text.</hi> He ingeniouſly acknowledgeth, what <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> had obſerved before him, That our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith unto thoſe on his right hand, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father:</hi> but unto thoſe on his left hand, though he ſay, <hi>Depart ye Curſed,</hi> yet he ſaith not, <hi>Ye curſed of my Father.</hi>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the condemnation of men is not ſo to be aſcribed unto the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, as mens ſalvation is: For God created no man to the end, that he ſhould periſh; but men by their <hi>Free-will,</hi> or Wilfulneſs in ſin, do make themſelves liable or obnoxious to thoſe torments, which principally <hi>were prepared for the Divel and his Angels.</hi> For this Reaſon, ſaith the ſame <hi>Janſenius, Chriſt</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>that the Kingdom, unto which he cals the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, was prepared for the Good Angels, as the fire is prepared for the Divel and bad Angels,</hi> leſt we ſhould hence collect, that men might by <hi>Good works deſerve or merit</hi> the ſocietie of Good Angels after the ſame manner, that they do <hi>merit</hi> the company or fellowſhip of evil Angels or Divels. For, as he adds, <hi>The merits or Good Works of men do not depend only upon our Free will, but they iſſue from the Grace and bountie of God:</hi> And our Saviour (as this Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes) in ſaying, <hi>That this Kingdom was prepared for the righteous ſince, or from, the foundation of the world;</hi> and in ſaying, <hi>hell was not prepared for wicked men</hi> but <hi>for the Divel and his Angels,</hi> doth hereby give us to underſtand, That the ſalvation of the righteous is to be aſcribed unto the <hi>mercie of God,</hi> and the condemnation of the unjuſt, not unto God, but unto their own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
               <p n="10">10.

But this favourable conſtruction being permitted or allowed him, yet to ſay, as he doth, That <hi>the beſt works of men</hi> (how much, or how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they depend upon mans Free-will) do in any ſort, either in whole or in part, <hi>merit the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> this directly contradicts his former Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Totum deputandum eſt miſericordiae Dei,</hi> That <hi>all</hi> is to be imputed to the Mercie of God: <hi>Quod totum eſt a Deo, non poteſt vel in parte aſcribi meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis noſtris;</hi> That, which is wholly from Gods mercie, cannot ſo much as in part or at all be aſcribed unto our merits. For what is the Reaſon why the Firſt Grace cannot (in their doctrine) be Merited? is it not, becauſe it is <hi>wholly</hi> from the mercy of God? now if this Kingdom of heaven or mans ſalvation be <hi>wholly</hi> from the mercy of God, it can no more be Merited by any increaſe of Grace or Good Works, then the Firſt Grace it ſelf can be Merited. <note place="margin">See the 27th <hi>Chapter of this Book,</hi> where this Argument is moſt fully anſwered, and that with ſome variation of what is here.</note>

But what ſhall we punctually anſwer to the Grammatical Inference drawn from <hi>the form of our Saviours ſpeech; Inherit the Kingdom</hi> &amp;c. <hi>FOR I was an hungred and you gave me,</hi> &amp;c. The uſual Anſwer is, that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or Illative, <hi>For, Becauſe,</hi> and the like, do not alwayes denote the Cauſe of the thing it ſelf, but ſometimes only the Conſequence of what is
<pb n="3607" facs="tcp:32220:162"/>
ſpoken. But ſeeing the Form of this ſpeech is, as Grammarians ſpeak, Cauſal; to ſay that a Conjunction Cauſal doth not alwayes import ſome Cauſe, were to deny Principles, and affirm that the Grammar Rule were to be corrected. But admitting that this Conjunction doth always import ſome Cauſe; it will not hence follow, that it alwayes imports the Real Cauſe of the thing it ſelf which is known, But oftentimes the Cauſe only of our knowledge of it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſuch Cauſal Particles do not alwayes import ſome Efficacious Cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but only <hi>Cauſam ſine qua non,</hi> ſome neceſſarie means, or condition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the prime and principal Cauſe (eſpecially if it work freely) doth not produce its intended effect.</p>
               <p>To give you Examples or inſtances of theſe Obſervations. If a ſtranger coming into a Citie ſhould ſay; ſurely yonder Gentleman is the chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, becauſe the ſword is born before him; No wiſe man would hence col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that the bearing of the ſword before him is <hi>The Cauſe,</hi> why he is the chief Magiſtrate; For, his lawful Election, <hi>is The Cauſe</hi> of that, and that is the Cauſe why the ſword is born before him. Yet may we not for this reaſon deny, that the former ſpeech doth neceſſarily import a <hi>Cauſe;</hi> for, the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſword before him is the true <hi>True Cauſe of his knowing him</hi> to be the chief magiſtrate. And in as much as we oftentimes come to know the <hi>Cauſe by the Effect,</hi> this word, <hi>For,</hi> or other <hi>Conjunction</hi> Cauſal doth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times point out the <hi>Effect,</hi> rather then the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the thing it ſelf. So it doth in the ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 45. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto thee, her ſins, which are many, are forgiven, for ſhe loved much. However ſome Romaniſts,</hi> whoſe delight it is to ſet <hi>Chriſtian Charitie and faith</hi> at odds; would hence collect, that Charitie is the Cauſe of the forgiveneſs of ſins; yet their greateſt Scholars acknowledge their error or overſight, and ingenuouſly acknowledge (their underſtanding being convinced by the evidence of truth) that <hi>This wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Love was not the Cauſe,</hi> why her ſins were forgiven; but, that the <hi>Free for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of her ſins,</hi> which were many, was the <hi>True Cauſe,</hi> why ſhe loved ſo much: however her extraordinary love being teſtified in ſuch ſolemn ſort, was a <hi>true Cauſe</hi> or reaſon, by which all that ſaw her might know, both, that her ſins had been many, and that ſhe had an internal feeling or apprehenſion of their forgiveneſs. And the true reaſon, why the <hi>Phariſee</hi> did neither bear ſuch love unto our Saviour, nor exhibit the like ſignes of reſpect unto him, was, becauſe he did not feel himſelf ſick, much leſſe did he feel or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the cure of his ſickneſs, as the woman did. For if he had known either the meaſure of his own ſins, or that our Saviour was <hi>the Phyſician of his ſoul,</hi> he would have given better Teſtification of his love and reſpect unto him, then he did by a Complemental Invitation of him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. To inſtance again; If of two parties equally ſuſpected of Felonie a man admitted to hear their examination or tryal ſhould ſay; <hi>This is the thief, For, Two competent witneſſes have given evidence againſt him,</hi> no man would hence infer, that the evidence, given in againſt him by two honeſt men, was the <hi>Cauſe</hi> why he was a thief; and yet was it the <hi>true Cauſe,</hi> why he knew him to be the thief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Revelation or authentick Declaration of any truth before unknown is the true Cauſe of our knowledge of it, but not of the Truth it ſelf:</hi> for that is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> why the Declaration or our knowledge of it is true. Now amongſt ſuch as profeſſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and call him <hi>Lord,</hi> it is unknown to us who be the true heirs of this heavenly kingdom, who be not: but in the day of Final Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which all ſhall be judged by their <hi>works,</hi> the ſheep ſhall be known from the goats; and the firſt certain knowledge, which we ſhall have of this
<pb n="3608" facs="tcp:32220:163"/>
difference, ſhall be from <hi>The Declarative ſentence of the Judge,</hi> who cannot erre; and his <hi>Declaration,</hi> as you ſee, ſhall be made <hi>according to their works:</hi> The ones performance of the <hi>Good works,</hi> here mentioned, declared and teſtified by the Judge, ſhall be the <hi>True Cauſe, by which men and Angels ſhall know them</hi> to be heirs of the everlaſting Kingdom; the others Omiſſion of the like <hi>works,</hi> teſtified likewiſe by the ſame <hi>Judge,</hi> ſhall be the <hi>true cauſe, by which we ſhall know them to be altogether unworthy of Gods favour</hi> or mercy, moſt worthy of everlaſting death. We ſhall then truly know, that the one ſort are crowned, as <hi>Saint Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>according to Gods Grace,</hi> and that the other are condemned <hi>according to Juſtice:</hi> That the ones omiſſion of <hi>Good Works is the true Cauſe</hi> of condemnation, and that the others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of <hi>Good works</hi> is not the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of their ſalvation, but the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> only, or a <hi>Teſtimonie</hi> that they are the Sons of God, and that they did <hi>Good works</hi> by the ſecret Operation of <hi>the ſpirit of Grace</hi> in them. And thus much, if you obſerve it, is implyed in the Reply or Anſwer of them that be ſaved, to their Judge; <hi>Lord, When ſaw we thee an hungred,</hi> &amp;c? So farre they ſhall be from conceiting their works to be meritorious, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of eternal bliſs, that they ſhall be ready to diſclaim them, as not worthie of it; ready to blame their ſluggiſh backwardneſs or want of chearfulneſs to have done much better, ſeeing what they did unto their poor brethren (as now they perceive) ſhall be ſo graciouſly accepted; that Chriſt in his Throne of Majeſtie will acknowledge that he takes them as kindly, as if they had been done unto himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Caſe is the ſame, as if a Gracious Prince of his own free motion and goodneſs ſhould proclaim a general Pardon to a multitude of Rebels, Thieves and Traytors, ſo they would accept of it, and make their peace with their honeſt neighbors, whom they have wronged. All of them in ſhew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Pardon, but ſome of them in the <hi>Interim</hi> ſecretly practiſe treaſon or diſturb the publick peace. If at the general Aſſize, or at their Arraignment, the Judge upon certain notice of their ſeveral demeanors, ſhould ſay to the one ſort, I reſtore you to your former ſtate and dignity, <hi>Becauſe</hi> ſince the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of your Pardon you have demeaned your ſelves as becomes Loyal Subjects and thankful men: And to the other, you I condemn to death, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> you have abuſed your Soveraigns Clemency: No man would aſcribe the reſtauration of the one unto their good demeanor, in the <hi>Interim</hi> betwixt the getting of their Pardon and their Arraignment, but unto the Princes Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie: Albeit the condemnation of the other were wholly to be aſcribed unto their miſdemeanors, not unto any want of Clemencie in the Prince, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. The good demeanor of the one could but be at the moſt, <hi>Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſine qua non, A neceſſary Condition, without which</hi> the Princes Clemencie in his Pardon expreſt, could not profit them. And ſo we ſay of Good Works; They are <hi>Cauſae ſine quibus non,</hi> neceſſary <hi>Conditions</hi> or <hi>means, without which</hi> no man ſhall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven; but no Poſitive or meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cauſes of our inheritance in it.</p>
               <p>To conclude; If any one ſhould ask me, <hi>Why all men that profeſs they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive in Chriſt ſhall not be ſaved,</hi> Albeit Chriſt died for <hi>All;</hi> albeit the <hi>Pardon</hi> General be proclaimed to all? The beſt Cauſe or Reaſon I could render, would be This; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> All, that profeſs they believe in Chriſt, do not <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe in Him;</hi> For, if they did, They would be careful to maintain Good Works, and glorifie God by being Fruitful in them.</p>

                  <hi>Our great Author had in his Eighth Book and third Chapter ſadly complained of ſome, that made this</hi> Great Rule of Charitie, Equitie and Juſtice, <hi>[Do as you would be done unto;]</hi> This Law of nature and Precept of our Law-giver; <hi>A noſe of wax, A verie</hi> Lesbian <hi>Leaden Rule.</hi>

Sure then if any place of Scripture, beſides thoſe which contain the very Foundation of Chriſtian Faith, as Chriſts Incarnation, Paſſion, or Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, be more neceſſary to be learned then other, then is <hi>this</hi> moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and moſt worthy the Practiſe: Seeing all Doctrines of good Life, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and upright Converſation are derived hence, as <hi>particular Concluſions</hi> in Arts and Sciences from their <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Principles.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. For any Coherence of theſe words with any precedent or conſequent, we need not be ſollicitous. It ſufficeth to know, <hi>They are a principal part of our Saviours Sermon upon the Mount;</hi> in which He delivered the true meaning of the Fundamental Parts of the Law, purging <hi>the Text,</hi> from the corrupt Gloſſes of the Scribes and Phariſees. Every Sentence therein is a Maxim of Life, and as it were an intire compleat Body of it ſelf, not a limb or member of any other particular Diſcourſe. Every <hi>full Sentence</hi> of it, <hi>This Main Rule</hi> eſpecially, may be anatomized by it ſelf, without unripping any other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning. For which Reaſon, ſome Learned have thought, that <hi>St. Matthew</hi> was not curious to relate every ſentence in that Rank and Order as it came from our Saviours Mouth: but ſet them down, as any one would do all the memorable good ſentences he could call to mind (of a good Diſcourſe read or heard) placing that perhaps firſt which was ſpoke laſt, or that laſt which was ſpoke in the middeſt.</p>
               <p>Yet if (as in Deſcription of Shires, men uſually annex ſome parts of the Bordering Countries) any deſire to have the Particular words or Speeches <note place="margin">The Coherence</note> of our Saviour, whereunto this Illative <hi>[Therefore]</hi> is to be referred; he muſt look back unto the fifth Chapter of this Goſpel, verſe 42. <hi>Give to him that asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow turn thou not away.</hi> For ſo St. <hi>Luke</hi> (who is more obſervant of our Saviours method in this Sermon then St. <hi>Matthew)</hi> in the ſixth Chapter of his Goſpel, verſe 30, 31. Couples theſe two Sentences together, which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> had ſet ſo farre aſunder. And immediately after the words of the Text he inferres by Arguments, that Duty of loving our Enemies (which he had ſet down the precept for, before, verſe the 27.) though St. <hi>Matthew</hi> place both Duty and Arguments immediately af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the Sentence before cited, <hi>viz. [Give to him that asketh,</hi> &amp;c.] So that this Precept <hi>[Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you,</hi> &amp;c.] as is moſt probable, came in, between the matter of that 42, and 43, verſe of that fifth Chapter.</p>
               <p>And yet it might be repeated again in the latter end of that Sermon by our Saviour: At leaſt, for ſome ſpecial Uſe or Reaſon placed there by St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew:</hi> becauſe, being the Foundation or Principle whence all other Duties of Good Life are derived, it ſeems the Evangeliſt would intimate thus much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, That of all our Saviours Sermon, which contained the very Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Law, this was the ſum; And for this Reaſon he adds that Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie (concerning the Excellencie of this Rule) which St. <hi>Luke</hi> omits, namely, <hi>That in it is contained the Law and the Prophets.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, To ſhew in what ſenſe or how farre the Obſervation of it is, <hi>The Fulfilling of the Law and the Prophets Doctrine;</hi> with ſuch Exceptions as may be brought againſt it.</p>

Thirdly, Of the meanes and method of putting this Rule in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
               <p>It was A Saying of the Father of Phyſiicans, <hi>Natura eſt Medica;</hi> let Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians do what they can, Nature muſt effect the Cure. The Phyſician may either ſtrengthen Nature when it is Feeble, or eaſe it from the oppreſſion of Humors; But Nature muſt work the Cure.</p>
               <p>This is, in proportion, true, for matters of Moralitie or Good Life. <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra eſt optima Magiſtra;</hi> All that the beſt Teachers can perform in natural or moral Knowledge, is but to help or cheriſh thoſe natural Notions or Seeds of Truth and Goodneſs which are ingrafted in our Souls. Art doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe or pour in, but rather ripen and draw out, that which lay hid before. And it is the skill of every inſtructor to apply himſelf to every mans nature, and to begin with ſuch Truths as every one can eaſily aſſent unto, as ſoon as he hears them; albeit without help of a Teacher he could not have found them out himſelf. And yet the more eaſily we aſſent to any Truth, the leſſe we perceive how we were moved thereto: and the leſſe we perceive it, the more ready we are to imagin that we did more then half move our ſelves, or that we could have found out that by our ſelves which we have learned of others. Whereas in truth there is nothing more hard then to ſpeak to the purpoſe, and yet ſo (in matters of Morality and Good Life) as every man of ordinary capacitie, ſhall think, upon the hearing of it, that he could have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or ſaid the like.</p>

               <p>This, as the Great Rhetorician ſaith, is the ſureſt token of a perfect Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For this Reaſon, He that knew what was in man, better then man did what was in himſelf; He that ſpake as never man ſpake, and taught as never man taught, doth ground his Doctrine of good Life and Manners upon ſuch Evident Principles as his very Adverſaries could not deny, (whereunto any civil natural man would aſſent, albeit he could not have found them out;) and illuſtrates it by ſuch plain and natural Similitudes, as every man of ordinary capacitie might conceive. As here in this place, This Rule it ſelf <hi>[What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye would, &amp;c.]</hi> is a Principle of nature; at leaſt the Negative of it <hi>[Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne feceris;]</hi> is ſo.</p>
               <p>The Uſe or Conſequence of the Rule (though) <hi>That to obſerve this ſhould be the fulfilling of the Law and the Prophets,</hi> none could have drawn, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our Saviour had firſt told us ſo. And yet the Deduction or derivation of all moral Precepts (as I hope will appear) is eaſie to find, ſince he hath taught us to ſeek it. Seeing then, He that ſpake as never man ſpake, and taught as never man taught, doth ground his Doctrine upon ſuch Principles as were in us by nature; I ſhall take leave to imitate Him <hi>(quantum, Deum mortalis poſſum)</hi> and to ſhew the Equitie and Truth of this Precept; <hi>Firſt,</hi> as it binds us by Nature: and <hi>Secondly,</hi> as it binds us in Chriſtianitie. Or <hi>Firſt,</hi> as far as the equitie of it may be gathered by natural Reaſon; Then <hi>Secondly,</hi> as it is ſet down in holy Scripture.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That <hi>This is a Dictate of the Law of Nature,</hi> is evident from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Heathen and meer natural men. <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperor, albeit no Chriſtian, yet as ſome report of him, did like beſt of the Chriſtians for
<pb n="3614" facs="tcp:32220:166"/>
their good Life, becauſe they moſt practiſed this Rule. And the Negative of it, <hi>[VVhat you would not have others do unto you, do not you to them,]</hi> ſeemed ſuch an excellent Ground of Civil Juſtice and honeſt dealing, that he cauſed <note place="margin">Severus</note> it to be written in the places of Civil Juſtice, or Courts of Judgment, as we do the Sentences of the Law or Commandments in our Churches: which he would not have done (or ſhould have done to ſmall purpoſe) unleſs he had known the Rule had been written before in every mans heart, ſo men would look into them. And ſuch amongſt us (I am perſwaded) as know not whether this ſentence be in the Law of God or in the Goſpel of Chriſt, or no; or ſuch as little think whether it be there or no, if they ſee one inſult over another in diſtreſs, deal hardly with a ſtranger, or laugh at anothers mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, or the like, will naturally uſe this or the like Reaſon to diſſwade him: <hi>If you were in their caſe you would not be well pleaſed with this Uſage; Do</hi> (in Gods name) <hi>as you would be done unto.</hi> The force of which and other like Reaſons is grounded upon this Rule or Principle of Nature. Nor is there any man that hath (as we ſay) <hi>any good nature in him,</hi> albeit ignorant in moſt points of Religion, but will in his ſober mood be much moved with ſuch Reproofs; and however he may ſeem little to be affected with them whilſt he is in the heat of paſſion, yet his own Conſcience, after his paſsion ceaſeth, will ſecretly condemn him for ſo doing.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The Grounds of Equitie in this Rule are two</hi> (though the one be ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the other.)</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Actual aequality of Nature in all men:</hi> For though there be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or diſtinction of men by place, pre-eminence, or dignitie; yet <hi>in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Two Grounds of this Rule, or Law of Nature</note> 
                  <hi>Nature</hi> all men are equal, all alike ſubject to corruption and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The poſsible equalitie of condition amongſt all men.</hi> For ſeeing the Beſt men are but men, what is one mans Caſe may be anothers, becauſe <hi>his Nature,</hi> much more <hi>his Eſtate</hi> or Condition is ſubject to change. <hi>No Prince</hi> was ever ſo firmly eſtabliſhed in his <hi>Throne,</hi> but might be pulled down thence to lie with Beggars in the Duſt. Antient Times yielding more frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Circumrotation of this Sphaere or Wheel of mutabilitie, their obſervations to this purpoſe were Rife. <hi>Quod cuiquam contigit, cuivis poteſt.</hi> Whatſoever hath befaln any man, good or bad, might befal any one of all.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Et ſubito eſt</hi> Irus, <hi>qui modo</hi> Croeſus <hi>erat.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>One turn (as the Heathens would have ſaid) of Fortunes Wheel might raiſe up Beggars or Servants to the Throne, and bring down Monarchs to the Duſt.</p>
               <p>From this <hi>Actual Equalitie of all men by Nature,</hi> and this <hi>Poſsible Equalitie of all men in Condition,</hi> was it, that even among the Heathen he was thought inhumane, no natural man but a Monſter, that would not be affected with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers extraordinary miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Former of theſe two</hi> (in natures not extreamly depraved) doth work a <hi>Sympathie</hi> or Fellow feeling of others miſerie; and <hi>the Latter,</hi> that is, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of ſuffering the like, doth work <hi>Fear</hi> of doing the evil intended, or <hi>Penitencie</hi> after it be done. Likeneſs or Identity of nature cauſeth Sympathy or Fellow-feeling in bruit Beaſts: if one pant for Grief, others of the ſame kind will be affected with it. Ignorant and ſimple men do many things by inſtinct of nature; whereof Philoſophers only know the Reaſon. And even in ſuch as did not expreſly know this Rule, Nature her ſelf
<pb n="3615" facs="tcp:32220:166"/>
did oft-times work and ſhew by the Effects, that it was hidden in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when he had condemned <hi>Croeſus</hi> his conquered Enemy to be burnt, only calling to mind, what a Potent Prince he had ſately been, and as <note place="margin">Cyrus</note> unlikely to have come to that end as himſelf was before the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie gotten, was afraid (as the Hiſtorian notes) leaſt ſome like plague might have come upon himſelf, and ſo pitying himſelf rather then the other, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called the Sentence.</p>
               <p>From the ſame Reaſon did that <hi>noble Roman</hi> weep amain, when he ſaw <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> the Enemie Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> ſet on fire, though by the Senates Decree: as <note place="margin">Scipio</note> if he could have wiſhed that her flames might have been quenched with his and other Romans Tears. The preſent Calamitie of that late famous and mightie Citie, put him in mind, That <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, though then ſitting as a Queen that knew no ſorrow, might one day be as bright with fire as for the preſent ſhe was with Glory. Yet was the difference betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s eſtate as great, betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> greater, then can ordinarily be found between man and man. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was Conqueror, and had gotten the ſtrength of a mighty Kingdom to his former by his Enemies Fall. And <hi>Rome</hi> had never the like occaſion to be ſecure as ſhe had by <hi>Carthages</hi> deſtruction, which ſtanding would never ſuffer her to be quiet, being the only City of all the world that was able to give Her check.</p>
               <p>Thus, could we but conſider, That, <hi>whoſoever we be, we be but men; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our eſtate be, it is but Humane,</hi> ſubject to chance and obnoxious to change; Nature would tell us, that whatſoever is evil whileſt done unto us, is evil alſo to be done to others: And ſeeing there is no evil which we can do to others, but the like may be done unto us, we ſhould be as unwilling to do any evil at all to others, as we are to have any done to us. For Nature it ſelf doth (as it were of courſe) ſuggeſt a fear of being done to, as men have done to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Hence ſprings that <hi>Negative precept. Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, whatſoever is good whilſt it is done to us, the ſame is Good whileſt done to others in like caſe; nay, as good to them as unto us. And ſeeing <hi>All Good is to be deſired,</hi> we ſhould be as deſirous to <hi>do good</hi> to others as to <hi>have good done</hi> to our ſelves. Yea, ſeeing, according to the mind of Chriſt, <hi>Beatius eſt Dare quam accipere, Acts</hi> 20. 36. <hi>to do good</hi> is better then <hi>to have good done</hi> to us, (as every action is better then Paſſion) we ſhould therefore be more deſirous of that. And hence riſeth the Affirmative Precept, <hi>Do as you would be done to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even the Heathen knew, that, <hi>it was better to give then to take.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Quas dederis ſolas ſemper habebis opes:</q>
               <p>It was more to have a Conſcience fraught with the memory of Good Turns done, or benefits beſtowed on others, then to have ſtore of poſſeſsions or goods, and yet therewith to do little or no good.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Yet are not theſe <hi>Two Rules</hi> ſo plain and evident unto natural Reaſon; but natural paſsion and ſelf-love will find exceptions againſt <note place="margin">Exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe two Rules.</note> them.</p>
               <p>There is no man will deny that <hi>theſe Rules</hi> were very Good in the old World or Golden Age: or that they be Good now if all men would be content to obſerve them alike. But he ſhall be ſure to live by the loſſe that reſolves to do better to any others, then it is likely any will do to him. Nay,
<pb n="3616" facs="tcp:32220:167"/>
many in their heat of diſcontent at others bad uſage of them, will not ſtick quite to invert <hi>this Rule,</hi> and think that it is juſt and right, at leaſt no wrong, to uſe others as they have been uſed themſelves. (Thus I have known ſome uſe more ſeverity towards their inferiors, then did well agree with their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſpoſition, only, becauſe they had been ſeverely uſed by others whileſt they were inferiors.) And this they think not amiſſe, ſo they do it with no ill mind, but only becauſe they would not be the <hi>onely men</hi> that ſhould be noted and marked as fit to ſuffer abuſe and wrongs whilſt their equals go Scot-free. Thus ſundry ſhut up from others by reaſon of infection have ſought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect others, only becauſe they would have companions in their miſeries, albeit it was not Man, but God that brought that Bodily Evil upon them. And thus many rude and barbarous Beggars (being denied harbor or relief of ſuch as might afford it them) through a conceit of their own forlorn eſtate, will ſeek to make others as poor, or more miſerable then themſelves, only that they may have ſome to be their equals or inferiors.</p>
               <p>The like ſuggeſtions of evil and wrong in ſome degree or other, will eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans Paſsions preſent unto his thoughts: yet who ſo is but naturally wiſe, either will not hear them, or (if this be too hard to put them off, becauſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſo familiar and intimate with the ſoul) will not give ſentence untill he have heard Reaſon ſpeak, which would oppoſe him Thus.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When thou waſt hardly and deſpightfully uſed by others (ſuppoſe <note place="margin">The Anſwer to the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</note> abuſed in perſon, diſgraced in ſpeech, or indamaged in Goods, &amp;c.) did they well or ill that ſo did uſe thee? If well, why waſt thou moved therewith? Why doſt thou complain? Or rather why wouldſt thou not be ſo well uſed again? If evil they did, why ſeekeſt thou then to imitate them in the evil which thou hateſt? for if it were evil in them whilſt it was done to thee, then will it be evil in thee whilſt thou doſt the like to others: Yea, perhaps much worſe in thee, becauſe, thou having ſuffered the like wrong before, thou better knows what an heynous Fact it is to do the like. For none knows, none poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can know, ſo well what a greivous ſin oppreſsion is, as he that hath been violently oppreſſed by others. None can ſo diſtinctly perceive what an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offence ſlander, defamation or ſcurrilitie is, as he that hath been ſcourged by ſcurrilous Tongues, or wronged in his good Name by falſe accuſers, ſly informers, or envious whiſperers. Generally, the nature and qualitie of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that happens to one man from another, is much better known by ſuffering then by doing it. For he that does it firſt, perhaps ſcarce knows well what he doth; he ſees the nature of it but (as it were) afarre off; But he that ſuffers it feels it, at hand, and knows it by experience.</p>
               <p>Now the greater we know any evil to be, and the more feeling touch we have of the nature and quality of it, the more grievous is our ſin if we pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the like. Wherefore he that hath been moſt hardly dealt withall, ſins moſt, if he deal ſo with others; for he doth that to others which he is moſt unwilling ſhould be done unto himſelf: becauſe he beſt knows the ſmart of the <note place="margin">☞</note> evil, and according to his unwillingneſs of having the like done to himſelf will the ſmart of the ſting of Conſcience be for doing ſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps, or ſome mans Paſsions would here Reply; <hi>Theſe reaſons hold true, if we ſhould ſo uſe them that never did us wrong, as others have wrongfully uſed us; but if the partie that uſed us ill come in our way, we do him but right, if we uſe him juſt ſo as he hath uſed us: For Juſtice it ſelf conſiſts in Equalitie;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and if we pay him but in the ſame meaſure that he did mete to us, he is juſtly dealt withal.</hi>

                  <pb n="3617" facs="tcp:32220:167"/>
Its true indeed! he is but juſtly dealt withall; becauſe he is but done to as he had done to others. So a thief or murderer is but juſtly dealt withall if he be hanged: yet if every man that hath his goods ſtoln ſhould do this which is but right unto a Thief; or if every man that hath his friend or brother ſlain ſhould but do that which <hi>is due</hi> and ſhould be done unto a murderer, not expecting the Judges ſentence, both might do themſelves great wrong in doing that which was but right and due to the offenders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively. And ſo ſhall every one wrong his own ſoul and conſcience, that will prevent him in his judgements to whom vengeance belongeth (by taking Revenge into his own hands) and not expect his good leaſure, by lawful and publick means.</p>
               <p>The Law of nature is, <hi>Do As thou wouldſt be done to:</hi> not <hi>As thou haſt been done to, againſt thy will.</hi> For what-ſoever was evil in another whilſt done to thee, is evil in thee whilſt thou doſt the ſame to him. Thy fact is as his fact: and thy ſin as his ſin; The evil is one and the ſame. Only thou maiſt alledge, that he was more prone to do the ſame evil, becauſe he did it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Provocation, and thou doſt it provoked: that is as much as to ſay, he hath overcome thee in evil, but thou alſo art overcome of evil, the evil hath overcome that which is good in Thee, Thy paſſion overbears thy Reaſon and Judgement: which is ſuch an offence againſt the Law of nature, as it would be againſt the Law of this Land, if a Tumultuous multitude ſhould take the Lawes (as we ſay) into their own hand and execute malefactors without the Judges or Magiſtrates conſent.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>What then</hi> (will ſome ſay) <hi>ſhall I pocket up every wrong? ſhall</hi> I <hi>make myſelf a But or mark for all to ſhoot at? ſhall I proſtitute my perſon to abuſe, my good name to ſlander, my goods to ſpoil without redreſſe?</hi> God forbid! For vengeance is Gods and he will repay; and he hath Powers on earth which <note place="margin">More excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt that Rule and Anſwers to them.</note> bear not the ſword in vain. If it be an open injury, by whoſe example if it ſhould go unpuniſhed, others might be imboldened to do the like, and if the preſent offendant might thereby grow inſolent or retchleſs, likely to do the like again to others as well as to thee, Thou doſt no way Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, rather <hi>Two ways</hi> obſerve <hi>This Rule of natures Law,</hi> if thou ſolicit his chaſtiſement at the <hi>Lawful Magiſtrates</hi> hand. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thou ſhalt teach the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender <hi>the practiſe of this Rule,</hi> which, before, he knew not or neglected, though bound thereto as well as Thou.

For theſe Ends and purpoſes to proſecute any injurie done by any private perſon before a Publick Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or wrongs done by an inferior Magiſtrate before his <hi>lawful Superior,</hi> is but juſt and right, a Dutie whereunto we are bound by the law of nature, if the party offending be inſolent and ſtub born, likely to hold on his wonted courſe, unleſſe reſtrained by the Magiſtrate. But if the offence be private betwixt thee and thy neighbour, not likely to redound to any further publick Harm; if it was an offence of infirmitie, or proceeded from ſome natural unruly paſſion, for which he is afterwards heartily ſorie; then thou art bound in conſcience to remit it. For if thou conſidereſt thine own infirmities, thou canſt not but find thy ſelf obnoxious to like paſſions, and that thou maiſt at one Time or other be as far overſeen, and yet couldeſt wiſh in thine hart that ſuch thine eſcapes or overſights ſhould not be proſecuted to the uttermoſt, but rather be pardoned upon ſubmiſſion or penitencie. And experience doth <note place="margin">Rigid cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Prono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick of falling.</note> teach us, that ſuch as are too rigid or auſtere cenſurers of other mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, do oft-times fall into the like or worſe themſelves; even into ſuch as they are otherwiſe leaſt inclined unto (but, in that they are men, the ſons of ſinful <hi>Adam,</hi> they are in ſome degree or other inclined unto any evil;) And therefore whilſt they proſecute ſuch as upon infirmitie or Paſſion fall into ſome Enormous crime, as if they were not men but monſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Noxious creatures of another kind, their judgement is juſt, if they themſelves fall into the like, that they may know themſelves to be <hi>but men,</hi> not altogether free from paſſion and infirmities. <hi>Vide interpretes in</hi> 7. <hi>cap.

                     <hi>Q.</hi> If nature alone binde men to do good to their enemies.</note> may ſeem doubtful, <hi>whether a man be bound by her Lawes to do good unto his enemie;</hi> as to relieve him in diſtreſſe, to defend him in danger or the like: This <hi>Rule of nature</hi> may ſeem not to bind men hereunto. For many men oft-times would chuſe to ſuffer great loſſe rather then to be beholden to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: ſometimes rather to ſtarve for hunger, then to be upbraided with his Benevolence: or to incur evident danger of Death, rather, then it ſhould be ſaid, <hi>That his deadly enemie had preſerved his life.</hi> He that is thus minded (the ſalvage and Giant-like ſpirit would ſay <hi>Bravely minded)</hi> may in the Jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his reſolution think himſelf no way bound to do his enemie any good, of whom he lookes for none; nay, of whom he would receive none, though it ſhould be thruſt upon him. Yet natural Reaſon and conſcience (ſo this man would hear them ſpeak and abide their cenſure) would condemn him, if he refuſed to do good unto his enemie. <hi>The Rule</hi> is miſ-applyed by Paſſion: for nature and Reaſon bid us, <hi>That we ſhould do that to every man which we would have any man do for us;</hi> not to do that to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> man which we expect from them alone. Now, there is no man ſo wilfull, unleſs he be witleſſe alſo, but would be relieved in diſtreſſe, delivered from danger, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted from loſſe, albeit not by <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> man whom he diſliketh, yet by ſome one or other whom he likes better. Wherefore, ſeeing Reaſon teacheth us, <hi>That to do good to others,</hi> as they are men, <hi>is good it in ſelf,</hi> it teacheth us (ſo we would learn of it) to good unto whomſoever. For why ſhould enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (or our enemy) hinder us from doing that which our conſciences approve for good. If thy enemie be of that ſtrange temper above deſcribed, and one that would ſcorn to be beholden to thee; <hi>ſteal</hi> thy good in upon him, and do
<pb n="3619" facs="tcp:32220:168"/>
him good ſo as that he ſhall not know from whom it came. Thou art bound to miniſter comfort to him, as a compaſſionate and cunning Phyſician doth Phyſick to a melancholick or diſtempered patient. But thou wilt ſay, <hi>ſo</hi> I <hi>ſhall loſe all my thanks for all my pains and coſt.</hi> I anſwer by asking Thee, is the honour (or thanks) that cometh from God alone, of no value? The Heathen could ſay to his friend <hi>We are each to other Theatrum ſatis amplum a</hi> Theater ſufficiently large for matter of content and contemplation. By doing <hi>So</hi> thou ſhalt be ſure to gain <hi>The Teſtimonie of a good</hi> Conſcience. And herein thou maiſt juſtly triumph over thine enemie, in that thou art better aminded towards him, then thou couldſt expect that he would be towards thee. Theſe are the beſt terms of compariſon that thou canſt ſtand upon with thine enemy, if thou canſt truly, ſay, <hi>That thou art A better man then he:</hi> and if, <hi>the mind be the man</hi> then he is truly and properly ſaid to be <hi>The better man,</hi> that <hi>is better aminded towards all men, in as much as they are men.</hi> This is the perfection and goodneſs of men as they are <hi>Civil and natural</hi> men: and this is that <hi>Law of nature,</hi> which <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. 15. was written in the Gentiles hearts. <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the law,</hi> that is, not the written Law of God, <hi>do by nature the things</hi> of the law (or contained in the Law) <hi>theſe having not the Law are a law unto themſelves: which ſhew</hi> the effects of <hi>the Law written in their hearts, their conſciences alwayes bearing witneſs, and their thoughts accuſing one another or elſe excuſing.</hi>

               <p n="13">13. But however the Heathen had this <hi>Fundamental Law</hi> of nature, <hi>This Root of Righteouſneſs</hi> (as without offence I hope I may term it, becauſe it was a <hi>Relique of Gods image</hi> in them) with many branches of it, ingrafted in their hearts; yet, as their conſciences might <hi>acquit</hi> them for performing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular duties which it injoyned, ſo might they <hi>accuſe</hi> them for negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in more.</p>
               <p>For neither did they practiſe ſo much as they knew to be good, nor did they know all that to be good which <hi>This Rule</hi> might have taught them to be ſuch. And albeit, the better ſort of them will riſe up in Judgement againſt us, and may condemn even the beſt ſort of Chriſtians (as the world counts them) now living; Yet moſt of them we may ſuppoſe (eſpecially in later times) were as negligent hearers of <hi>natures Lore,</hi> as we are of the Doctrine of Grace. <hi>God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. had <hi>given ſome of them over to a Reprobate ſenſe,</hi> That ſeeing they would not practiſe what they knew for good, they ſhould not know Good from Bad. And as the learned obſerve, when mankind had like Retchleſs unthrifts corrupted their wayes, and like ungratefull Tenants to their Landlord, Or undutiful ſubjects to their Prince, had cancelled the Original inſtruments of their inheritance, Or copie of that Law by which they were to be tried, dayly defacing and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it by their foul tranſgreſsions and ſtain of ſins: it pleaſed <hi>The Lord</hi> in mercie, to renew it once again in viſible and material Characters ingraven in ſtone, adding to it the commentaries of Prophets and other Holy men, that ſo his people might once again copie out that Covenant whoſe Original they had loſt: (the written law being but as the ſampler or drawn work which was to have been wrought out by the law of nature;) and imprint it again in their harts by meditation and practiſe. Yet once again the people of the Jewes (unto whom this written Law was committed) did by their falſe interpretations and Hypocritical gloſſes corrupt the true ſence and meaning of <hi>Gods Law,</hi> as the nations before had defaced <hi>the Law of nature</hi> by their fooliſh imaginations and conceited ſelf-love. Nevertheleſs, as ſin did abound in man, ſo did Gods grace and favour ſuperabound. For, when hoth <hi>the Law of nature</hi>
                  <pb n="3620" facs="tcp:32220:169"/>
was almoſt wholly loſt among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (drown'd in Gentiliſme, as the Latin tongue is in the Italian) and the <hi>Jews</hi> (who ſhould have allured others by their good example and continual proſperitic (had they continued faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in obſerving it) to obſerve the <hi>written Law of God,)</hi> had quite corrupted it: God ſent his <hi>Only Son</hi> in the <hi>nature of man</hi> and <hi>Form of a Servant,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Grace into mens hearts, to revive the dead Root of <hi>Natures Law,</hi> when it was almoſt periſhed; and alſo to purifie and cleanſe <hi>Gods written Law,</hi> from the falſe interpretations of the Scribes and Phariſees, which he performs in this ſeventh Chapter and in the two precedent. So our Saviour ſaith, Chap. 5. v. 17. <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy</hi> (or diſſolve) <hi>the Law or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy them, but to fulfil them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how did <hi>Chriſt</hi> come to fulfil the Law? Only by his own <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How Chriſt fulfilled the Law.</note> and example?</p>
               <p>No, not ſo only; but <hi>by propoſing unto us the true ſenſe and meaning of the moral Law:</hi> which, all that were to be his followers, were to fulfil in a more ſpiritual and better manner then either the beſt of the Heathens, or the moſt ſtrict Sect of the <hi>Jews</hi> of that time, did. For they had abrogated the force and ſenſe of ſundry Commandements, and ſtood more upon the letter then the meaning of the Law. Wherefore he adds, verſe 20. <hi>I ſay unto you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> It is evident then, from our Saviours words, that both the righteouſneſſe commanded in the <hi>moral Law,</hi> and in the <hi>Prophets,</hi> muſt be fulfilled <hi>in better meaſure by Chriſtians</hi> then it was either by the Scribes or the Phariſees; and that the beſt and moſt eaſie way of fulfilling both the Law and the Prophets is the practiſing of this Rule, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye ſo unto them, For this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Let us ſee then what we have more from <hi>His Doctrine</hi> then from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the <hi>Right Practiſe</hi> of this <hi>Royalleſt Rule.</hi> By <hi>Chriſts Doctrine</hi> we have <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Grounds</hi> of the former Precept (which Nature afforded us) better fortified and confirmed unto us; And alſo have <hi>Motives</hi> or inducements, which may ſway <hi>Reaſon</hi> againſt <hi>Paſsion</hi> to the practiſe of the ſame <hi>Rule,</hi> more certain and infinitely greater then the Heathen or meer natural man had any. (I muſt requeſt you to call to mind what was ſaid before; <note n="*" place="margin">See §. 8.</note> That the Ground of this Precept, was, <hi>The Equalitie of all men by nature.)</hi> The Heathen knew this full well, <hi>That all men were of one kind, all mortal, all capable of Reaſon, and conſequently of right and wrong.</hi> And from this knowledge, even ſuch among them as held no Creation, no dependence of man upon the Divine Power, did often ſhew commendable effects of this Law written in their hearts in ſundry duties of Good neighborhood (as we ſpeak) and civil kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: As for any Affinity or Bonds of ſociety between man and man, at leaſt between men of divers Countries, more then is between beaſts of the ſame kind, moſt of them acknowledged none; nor did they acknowledge as much affinity betwixt Creatures of any kind as we do that acknowledge all things to have one Creator. Herein then is <hi>Our Equalitie</hi> and Affinity greater, that we all acknowledge one God for our Father, who is in a more peculiar ſort the Creator of every man, then of any other corruptible Creature.</p>
               <p>Again, All we Chriſtians acknowledge One Chriſt for our Head, of whoſe Body we are Members; hence ariſeth another <hi>Peculiar Equalitie,</hi> from the equal price of our Redemption which was all one for the Rich and Poor, for the Little and Mighty Ones of the Earth. This God pre-figured in the Law,

                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. verſe 11, 12, 15. <hi>Afterwards the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes: <hi>When thou takeſt the ſum of the Children of Iſrael after their number, then they ſhall give every man a Redemption of his life unto the Lord, when thou telleſt them, that there be no plague among them when thou counteſt them. The Rich ſhall not paſſe, and the poor ſhall not diminiſh from half a ſhekel, when ye ſhall give an Offering unto the Lord for the Redemption of your Lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>this ſtrict Dependencie</hi> of all men upon one and the ſame Creator, and this <hi>Equality</hi> and Brother-hood which we have in one Father, doth our Saviour <hi>Chriſt, Luke</hi> 6 v. 36. draw that precept <hi>Of loving our Enemies:</hi> which he makes as it were an <hi>Eſſential property</hi> of all ſuch as truly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge One God. Not that all men were not bound thereto, and might have known ſo much by nature, but that it was a greater ſhame and more praepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous ſin, in ſuch as did acknowledge <hi>One God,</hi> not to perform that Duty. The Conſciences of the Gentiles, as <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, might <hi>ſecretly accuſe them:</hi> But the Others words and ſpeeches did bear <hi>open Teſtimony</hi> againſt them, if they neglected ſo to do; ſo ſaith our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> immediately upon the words of the Text,<hi>—For if you love them which love you, what thank ſhall you have? for even the ſinners love thoſe that love them.—</hi>
                  <hi>And if you do good for them which do good for you, what thank ſhall ye have? for even the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do the ſame. And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thank ſhall ye have? for even the ſinners lend to ſinners, to receive the like. Wherefore love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend looking for nothing again, and your reward ſhall be great, and ye ſhall be the children of the moſt High: for he is kind to the unkind and to the evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. This further confirms what out of the principles of Nature was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly gathered, to wit, that where it is ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever you would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye ſo unto them:</hi> The meaning is not, <q>
                     <hi>What ye would have</hi> this <hi>or</hi> that <hi>man do unto you, do ye ſo unto</hi> the ſame <hi>man;</hi> but rather thus, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that</hi> any man <hi>ſhould do unto you, do ye the like in like caſe</hi> to every man, <hi>in that he is man,</hi> in that he is your fellow Creature, in that he is the Son of your heavenly Father, be he otherwiſe friend, or foe.</q> Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we <hi>may;</hi> nay we <hi>muſt</hi> inlarge this Precept, if we will have the full mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, Thus. <q>Whatſoever ye would ſhould be done unto you, whether by <hi>Man,</hi> by <hi>Angel</hi> (or any other of Gods miniſtring Spirits or procurer of mankinds good) or by God himſelf, That do <hi>to every man</hi> becauſe every man that God to his Father, who as He hath a care and providence over all, ſo is it his will that every Creature under him, all men eſpecially that call him <hi>Father,</hi> ſhould be his Miniſters in procuring and furthering any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good, of whom this our heavenly Father vouchſafes to take care and charge.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A lively Emblem of this Duty we have in the Ravens feeding of <hi>Eliah,</hi> being deſtitute of all ordinary means of Food; If we conſider the nature of this Bird, none more Ravenous, none more Greedy of the Prey then it: yet becauſe <hi>the Lord feeds the young Ravens, when they call upon him,</hi> being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſtitute of ordinary relief from their Dams or old Ones (as both <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> obſerve; and the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> alludes to it in that ſpeech) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Lord commanded them to afford the like help to <hi>Elias</hi> being forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or rather perſecuted by the King and his Officers, who ſhould have yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him houſe and harbour; and from their example we ſhould learn the practiſe, <hi>to do for others, as either the Lord hath done,</hi> or, we expect he ſhould <hi>do for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much I ſay is fully and directly included in our Saviours Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="3622" facs="tcp:32220:170"/>
and Concluſions drawn from this Principal Rule, albeit ſo much be not fully expreſt in his words; eſpecially if we obſerve the Greek phraſe only: But the language (whoſe manner of Dialect the Evangeliſts retain though wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Greek Tongue) will very well bear, and our Saviours words <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 36. verſe enforce as much, <hi>Be ye therefore merciful as your H. Father is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> and in the 6. of <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 14. He tels us, that if we look for mercie at Gods hand, we muſt ſhew mercie <hi>unto men;</hi> not to our friends or brethren by kindred or Nation, <hi>but unto men.</hi> The place is ſo much the more worth our obſervation, becauſe he adds no Expoſition or Comment to any one Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in all the Lords Prayer, ſave only that He gives this Note upon that <hi>[And forgive us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us;]</hi> his Note is this, <hi>If ye forgive men their Treſpaſſes, your Heavenly Father will alſo forgive you;—But if you do not forgive men their Treſpaſſes, no more will your Heavenly Father forgive you your Treſpaſſes.</hi> Wherefore, as we deſire God to forgive us our Treſpaſſes, though we have been his Enemies, ſo muſt we be ready to forgive our Enemies: and as we deſire all good of him; ſo muſt we be ready not only to forgive, but even to do any good to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. If he be our enemie deſervedly, we ſhould therefore do him good that we might make amends for the occaſion offered: if our Enemy he be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt occaſion given by us, we ſhould conſider, that this voluntary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in him is the work of Satan, but he Himſelf, <hi>as man,</hi> is our fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the workmanſhip of Gods own hand; <hi>God made him man,</hi> but the Divel made him an Enemy: And we ſhould ſeek by all meanes poſſible to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the works of Satan, and to repair the handy work of God: that is, we ſhould love his perſon, and ſeek to reform his vice; we ſhould overcome his evil with our good-will to him: if he be hungry we ſhould give him meat; if thirſtie, drink; as the Apoſtle commands. In ſum, we muſt feed Him, but <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 20.</note> ſeek to ſtarve <hi>his Humor,</hi> by ſubſtracting all occaſions of exaſperating his mind, and ſeeking occaſions to do him good; ſo, the heat of his malice ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to work upon, will by little and little, die, as fire goes out when the fewel fails.</p>
               <p n="16">16. For a Friends ſake that has indeared us to him for many, of whom we yet expect more kindneſſes, we think it good manners to tolerate many things, which otherwiſe we would not. And ſhall not Chriſtian Faith and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion teach us much more to remit all for Gods ſake, of whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived our ſelves, our very bodies and ſouls and all that we have? of whom we yet expect much more then we have received, even everlaſting life and immortal bodies to be crowned with Glory? What if our Enemies have ſought to take away this miſerable and mortal life? God freely gave it us, who likewiſe at his pleaſure may juſtly challenge it. And if we cannot juſtly complain if he ſhould take it from us, is it an hard Precept that he wills us not to revenge, yea not to complain by way of revenge, of ſuch as would but could not take it from us?</p>
               <p>The Lord may as juſtly command us to forbear all deſire of revenge, all complaint of ſuch as would take away our Life, as he himſelf can take it.</p>
               <p>That they would ſo have done, was their own, That they could not do ſo unto us, is the Lords doing, to whom we owe all thankfulneſs for preſerving it, and this may be the beſt occaſion of ſhewing our thankfulneſs, if we for his ſake forgive ſuch as ſought to take away our Lives. Nay if we would but examine <hi>this Precept</hi> by <hi>exact Reaſon</hi> (paſſion ſet aſide) in as much as God hath freely given us life, he might moſt Juſtly command us not to murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="3623" facs="tcp:32220:170"/>
ſuch as ſhould take it from us. For who can appoint him his Time? or who can refuſe any for his Executioner whom the Supream Judge of Heaven and Earth ſhall permit? But in as much as God hath preſerved our lives which our Enemies ſought, he may juſtly command, and we muſt obey him, ſo commanding, to do any good unto them that ſought our evil. God is a a more <hi>Abſolute Lord</hi> over the lives of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> then they are over their Lands or goods; he hath a more abſolute intereſt in all mens actions and affections then any man hath in his own goods or fruits of his ground. Now what Lord or Maſter is there that would indure ſuch a ſervant as would not beſtow his goods or benevolence on whomſoever it pleaſed him to appoint, albeit he were his ſervants enemie? If this we refuſe, and yet acknowledge our ſelves to be Gods ſervants, may not God juſtly ſay unto us? <hi>Ex tuo ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius ore judicaberis.</hi> If any refuſe to ſet his affections on whomſoever God ſhall appoint him, to employ his actions for whoſe good it pleaſeth him, albeit he be our open enemie. How much more ought we to do it if we conſider the Hope of reward in the life to come?</p>
               <p n="17">17. Thus you ſee <hi>The Firſt ground of this precept</hi> drawn from <hi>The equalitie of all men by nature,</hi> improved, and fortified by the Doctrine of Faith, that is, by <hi>The acknowledgement of One Father and Creator,</hi> and yet may it be further confirmed, if we conſider <hi>what Affinitie,</hi> nay <hi>what Conſanguinitie</hi> we all have <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and, <hi>what he hath done for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, if we be Chriſts) <hi>fleſh of his Fleſh, and bone of his Bone.</hi> Our conjunction with him (if we be or would be conjoyned with Him) although it be ſpiritual and myſtical, yet is it a True, a real and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjunction. He is a True and lively Head; we are true and lively mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of him, and one of another: And muſt have as true a fellow feeling one of anothers harms or ſorrows, as one part of our own body hath of the pain of another. No body Politick ever on earth, not the moſt united in place, in Lawes, cuſtomes or any other Bond of Civil Societie whatſoever, had, or can have the like union, or ſo near conjunction, as all that are members of Chriſts myſtical Bodie truly have; as all that profeſſe themſelves members thereof ſhould in practiſe teſtifie that they have: otherwiſe, <hi>as the Lawyers ſay, Proteſtatio non valet contra factum.</hi> It is in vain to profeſſe thou art a Chriſtian, in vain to proteſt thou art a true profeſſor or Proteſtant, if thy deeds and reſolution, if thy practice do not ſeal the truth of thy profeſſion or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation: for not doing this (as the <hi>Apoſtle ſaith)</hi> thou ſhalt confeſſe Chriſt and Chriſtianitie with thy lips, but deny both Him and it, in thy deeds and in thy practiſe: and ſo thou ſhalt be judged, not according to thy <hi>ſayings,</hi> but according to thy <hi>works</hi> and reſolution, or omiſſions of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Would you know then what ſome of the Heathen have thought of the duties of every member in a body Politick? <hi>Plato</hi> in his fifth Book, <hi>De Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica,</hi> hath a compariſon to this purpoſe. If a man receive a wound in any part, as in his foot or hand; or have but ſome pain or grief in his finger, we will not ſay, <hi>That his hand or foot is wounded, or that his finger feels pain;</hi> But, <hi>The man himſelf hath ſuffered a wound in his hand or foot;</hi> That <hi>he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath a great pain;</hi> &amp;c. For albeit the pain or grief ſpring firſt from <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that part,</hi> yet it overflowes and affects the whole bodie; The branches of it ſpread throughout all parts: and every part is worſe becauſe one part is ſo ill. Yea every part forbears its natural function or recreation in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for the eaſe of this; The head wants its ſleep, other parts their reſt, by reaſon of the ſpirits recourſe thither, as ſo many comforters ſent from them
<pb n="3624" facs="tcp:32220:171"/>
to viſit their ſick friend or fellow member. In like manner <hi>Plato</hi> thought it meet, that in every City or Common-weal, as often as any good or harm did happen to any Citizen or Free denizon thereof, it ſhould not be counted <hi>that</hi> mans good or harm only, but the good or harm of the <hi>whole</hi> City; and every member thereof ſhould be alike affected. If <hi>this</hi> the Heathens by meer light of nature could diſcern to be the dutie of the meer natural man, what tongue of man or Angel can expreſſe in Terms befitting ſo high A myſterie, <hi>what Brotherhood, what fellowſhip, what Sympathie,</hi> and what affection ſhould be between the members of Chriſts Body? for no ſociety like this; no fellowſhip like to that in Him. This union exceeds all other much more then the union of one part of our heart with another doth the union of the heart with the foot.

               <p>It is worth the conſideration, and I beſeech you to conſider; what a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it would ſeem to a wiſe man, if becauſe the finger did ake or pain him, a mans head or heart and inward thoughts ſhould preſently reſolve to cut it off, or vex it more becauſe it did vex them. Yet ſuch is our malice and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if, becauſe our brother or fellow member in Chriſt (ſo we muſt account all that Communicate with us in the ſame Sacraments) doth vex or torment us, we ſhould therefore reſolve to vex and torment him again. This is A Symptome of ſuch helliſh Phrenzie as the Poet deſcribes;</p>

               <p>As monſtrous and pitifull a Spectacle to the eyes of Faith, as it would be to the eyes of the Body to ſee, as we have heard of ſome (hanged quick in irons) ready to ſtarve for hunger, and deſtitute of hopes of other food, to eat the fleſh of their armes to ſatisfie their gnawing entrals. So monſtrous is their ſin, ſo miſerable their eſtate, that to ſatiate their revengeful minds, or to wreck their imbred ſpite, do harm, vex or torment their Fellow-members in Chriſt. <hi>If you bite and devour one another,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16.) <hi>ſee that ye be not not conſumed one of another.</hi> 
                  <q>His meaning is; Whoſoever doth vex or harm his brother, ſhall feel the ſmart of it himſelf one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as certainly as the heart or ſoul that wounds or cuts an outward mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhall feel the ſmart or want of it.</q> And again, that whoſoever yeelds any comfort to his diſtreſſed or comfortleſs brother, ſhall as certainly be partaker of the good he does to him, as the heart, which directs or the hand which applies the medicine to any ill affected part, ſhall find eaſe and reſt by the mitigation of the ſickly members pain.</p>

               <p>Unto what part of <hi>the Affirmative Precept,</hi> it is moſt requiſite I ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you; or from what part of the <hi>Negative</hi> I ſhould diſſwade you, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell: becauſe I am ignorant in what part of the one you are defective, or in what part of the other you moſt exceed. <hi>In both (no doubt) we all offend:</hi> both, In not doing to others (in ſundry caſes) as we deſire it ſhould be done to us; and alſo, in doing that to others which we would not have them do to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two eſpecial Breaches</hi> of this Law of Nature I have obſerved (ſo farre as my experience reacheth) and have heard noted by others to be almoſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral through out the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The one,</hi> in not affording our diſtreſſed brethren that comfort for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this life, which in their caſe we would deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The other,</hi> in procuring their undoing or grievous loſs by our greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of enlarging our own eſtates, advancing our ſelves, or increaſing our wealth and commoditie.</p>
               <p>For <hi>the Firſt,</hi> None of us can be ignorant, how in ofttimes, <hi>Sometimes the Famin, oft-times,</hi> nay <hi>alwayes for this ſeven or eight years paſt, the Plague</hi> of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence hath raged one where or other, throughout the Land. The grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Maladie albeit we know not fully, yet that we know it in ſome ſort, and eſteem of it as a grievous maladie, <hi>A Plague indeed ſent from God,</hi> our fear of it when it is near unto us doth ſufficiently witneſs: and from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our own fear or care to avoid it, we may gather how deſirous we would be of any comfort, if it ſhould ſeize upon us: Of <hi>any comfort</hi> I ſay, either bodily to caſe the pain by <hi>Lenitives,</hi> or to prevent the laſt danger of it by Phyſick and good Diet. Or if in theſe we could have no Hope, the leſs we had in them, the more deſirous would we be of ſpiritual comfort under the wings of the Almighty. The leſs help, Art, or Nature, or men themſelves could afford us, the more earneſtly would we deſire hearty prayers for ſuccor and comfort from the Almightie. It would much ſtrengthen our Faith and Hope, to know that others did joyn with us in fervent prayers for mercie; and it would much leſſen our bodily grief and diſcontent of mind, to know that they did bear a part with us: it would abate our ſorrow to know that they did abate their wonted mirth and jollitie as in compaſſion to us. The <hi>Saying</hi> is moſt true;</p>
               <q>Solamen miſeris ſocios habuiſſe doloris:</q>
               <p>But the ſolace is moſt comfortable, when men do willingly and not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint ſhare with us in our miſerie: for then they take as it were part of our burthen from us, and put it upon their own ſhoulders: So as that which is moſt heavie and grievous whilſt it is only laid upon one or ſome few, becomes very light and eaſie when it is divided and laid upon many willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the burden.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many like, but more effectual Arguments, all of us could plead for our ſelves, if we were in this or any other kind of miſerie. But who is he
<pb n="3627" facs="tcp:32220:172"/>
of a thouſand that would lay half of this to heart when ſorrow lies heavieſt upon his poor diſtreſſed brethren? I know not how men in this place are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; but elſewhere for the moſt part, if they be ſo mindful of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed brethren, as to relieve their wants and furniſh them with the neceſſaries of this life, they think it almoſt a work of ſuper-erogation: and if they ſhould not be commended for it at firſt, they would be more ſlack to do the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>But that they ſhould afflict or pinch themſelves for others penurie; That they ſhould abate their ordinary mirth for others ſorrow, is an ungrateful Doctrine, almoſt a Point of Puritaniſm. Or if ſome be thus well minded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their neighbors or allyes they think they have ſufficiently diſcharged their dutie: They think this Precept of our Saviour extends it ſelf no further then the Statutes of the Land, binding them to do good (ſuch good as they would have done to them) only to the men of their own or the next Pariſh. As for the miſeries of ſuch as are afarre off, the ſound of them enters not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ears; their ſighs and groans move not their hearts.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould tell the people of one Shire or Countrie, That they ought to mourn and lament, to faſt and pray for the afflictions of others ſome forty miles off, or in the utmoſt confines of another Countrie in this Realm, They would be ready (I am afraid) to laugh at our folly, and count us as uncivil as any voluntary diſturbes of their ſports. But here I truſt I may be bold to ſay as much as the Lord hath ſaid, whoſe word requires, at leaſt as much, I think much more then I have done.</p>

THat <hi>this Precept [Do as ye would be done to]</hi> doth contain as much as that Other <hi>[Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thy ſelf]</hi> is evident to every man at the firſt ſight.

And if we love others (or our neighbours) as our ſelves, then we have fulfilled the Law. So <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Owe nothing to any man, but to love one another, for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law; for this, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery. Thou ſhalt not kill. Thou ſhalt not ſteal. Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſſe. Thou ſhalt not covet. And if there be any other Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying, even in this, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thy ſelf.</hi>

For being asked <hi>which was the greateſt Commandment in the Law?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy God with all thine Heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind; This is the firſt and great Commandment:</hi> As if he had ſaid, <q>This is that Commandment which contains in it moſt of the Reſt; or all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our duty towards God; But there is <hi>A ſecond like unto it,</hi> Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf, <hi>and on theſe two commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets;</hi> Hence as ſome collect, our Saviour in my Text, ſaith not, <hi>This is the</hi> whole <hi>Law and the Prophets;</hi>
                  </q> But, <hi>This is the Law and the Prophets:</hi> becauſe <hi>This precept,</hi> to their ſeeming, is but equivalent unto <hi>That, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> which is but <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>leſſe of the Two,</hi> on which hangeth the <hi>whole Law and the Prophets?</hi>

Yet may it be further Queſtioned, <hi>In what ſenſe Theſe Commandments are ſaid to be Two?</hi> as whether they be, as we ſay, <hi>Primò diverſa;</hi> as diſtinct as the Commandments of <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Theft;</hi> neither of which is any way included in the other, or dependent upon it: Or whether they be only ſo diſtinguiſhed as the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> and the <hi>New;</hi> that is, as is ſaid, <hi>Novum Teſtamentum velatum eſt in veteri, et vetus Revelatum in Novo:</hi> The New Teſtament is in the Old, but invailed; and the Old, revealed in the New: ſo we may ſay, That, the firſt and great Commandment, Of loving God withall our heart, and all our ſoul, is implicitly contained in the ſecond, of loving our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="3630" facs="tcp:32220:174"/>
as our ſelves: and the ſecond again expresſly or impulſively contained in the former.</p>
               <p>Thus much is certain that no man loves his neighbour aright, unleſs he love him for Gods ſake whom He loves above all and whoſe love com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all other love. In this ſence ſaith <hi>St. James, whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law beſides, and fail in one Commandment</hi> (that is wittingly and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or if he would grant himſelf an Indulgence or diſpenſation of breaking that one) <hi>He is guiltie of all.</hi> Why of all? <hi>St. James</hi> adds; <hi>He that ſaid thou ſhalt not commit Adulterie, ſaid alſo, thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> His meaning is, <hi>He that gave one commandment gave all:</hi> and therefore, he that breakes one willingly and wittingly, keepes none truly and ſincerely; becauſe He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them not, in as much <hi>as God commanded them</hi> to be kept, for then He would be deſirous to obſerve all alike: or if he ſhew divers effects of love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his neighbour, theſe proceed not from the love of God, for that would command all his Affections, and every effect of love as well as One. He can expect no reward of God as the fruit of ſuch love, becauſe it is not throughly rooted in the entire and ſincere Love of God. So that their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> who reſtrain <hi>this precept</hi> only to the <hi>ſecond Table,</hi> admit a double ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is not proved by them, that <hi>This Precept</hi> is <hi>adaequate,</hi> or only but <hi>aequivalent</hi> to that, <hi>Love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If it were, yet the fulfiling of <hi>This</hi> might be <hi>Interpretativè</hi> the fulfilling of the Law, ſeeing no man can love his neighbour, but he muſt love God above all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is as true again that no man can love God, unleſs he love his brother alſo; ſo ſaith <hi>St. John,</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt. ch.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. If any man ſay <hi>He loves God and hate his brother, he is a lyar; for how can he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> So that our love to God muſt be the motive or incitement for us to love our neighbour: and yet the ſame love of God muſt be <hi>perfected and made compleat</hi> in us by practiſing love for his ſake upon our neighbours. So ſaith <hi>St. John,</hi> verſe 11. <hi>If God ſo loved</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">So Chriſt ſaid to St. <hi>Peters Loveſt thou me? Feed my ſheep:</hi> So David ſaid to God. Pſal. 16 <hi>My goodneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not to thee: But to the Saints that are in earth, and to the excellent in whom is all my delight.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>us, we ought alſo to love one another; no man hath ſeen God at any time.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <q>We cannot direct our love immediatly to God himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He dwelleth in light that none can attain unto; but our love muſt be beſtowed upon our neighbours, that is, upon men, in whom His Image ſhineth, and loving them in Him and for His ſake, we love him more then them: and this is it which <hi>S. John</hi> ſaith in the ſame place, <hi>If we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfect in us.</hi>
                  </q> And in like ſort, when we do to men as we deſire they ſhould do unto us (becauſe this is a Duty accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, and proceeds from the love we bear to him) we do not only perform our duty towards men, but alſo our duty towards God. So that <hi>This Rule</hi> rightly practiſed, is the whole Law and the Prophets, and in effect equivalent to thoſe Two Commandments, <hi>Love God above all;</hi> and thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf: as appears out of the former Collections. But is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if we obſerve the <hi>Former Extent</hi> or expoſition of it, which was thus<hi>—Whatſoever ye would ſhould be done unto you, either by God or man,</hi> That <hi>do to all men as they are your fellow creatures, for your Creators ſake.</hi> Or if we would further ſearch out the exact Temper and conſtitution of mind whereat this precept aims, it conſiſts (as I may ſo ſpeak in Aequilibrio:) <hi>in the aequipoiſe of our deſires of doing and receiving good,</hi> whether the Good be to be directed immediately unto God or to our neighbours for his ſake. That is, we ſhould be <hi>as ready</hi> to glorifie Gods name both ſecretly, with our hearts, and by
<pb n="3631" facs="tcp:32220:174"/>
outward profeſſion and practiſe of good Deeds, <hi>as we are deſirous to receive</hi> any bleſſing or benefit from him.</p>
               <p>And thus it is evident that the exact performance of this Precept would be the <hi>exact fulfilling of the Law and Prophets;</hi> that the performance of every part of this duty ſincerely, in ſome, though not in <hi>perfect meaſure,</hi> is in like ſort, the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>Quoad perfectionem vel integritatem</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See St. <hi>Aug: De Civit. Dei. Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Cap</hi> 4. and 15. <hi>Cap.</hi> 22. and <hi>Lud. vives's Comment.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>partium,</hi> as the Schools ſay, though not <hi>quoad perfectionem Graduum:</hi> that is, obſerving this Rule (as it hath been expounded) we ſhall obſerve <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Commandment or part</hi> of the Law, though none of them in that <hi>perfect and exact meaſure</hi> which we ſhould; but performing <hi>the former,</hi> the Blood of Chriſt Jeſus ſhall cleanſe us from all our guilt of ſin whereto we are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if God ſhould enter into judgment with us for not performing of <hi>the later.</hi> Thus you have ſeen how this precept doth directly concern both the <hi>Firſt and Second Table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet further! That even that love and duty which we owe unto our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors doth <hi>Collaterally</hi> likewiſe reſpect every Preceept of the Firſt Table: for we are bound by this love we owe one to another, every one according to his calling, opportunity and ability, to inſtruct another in the knowledge of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precept, whether of the Firſt or Second Table, or any other part of the Law, and to incite one another to the performance of the ſame, and to dehort from their Breach or Tranſgreſſion. So ſaith the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. v. 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but thou ſhalt plainly rebuke thy neighbor and ſuffer him not to ſin,</hi> not to tranſgreſs any of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The ſum of all is this. The Law of Nature, and the Law of God, teach every man to know what is good for himſelf; and thereupon to fix his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: and this Rule of Nature, whoſe practiſe is here enjoyned by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, binds every man to be as willing to further his Neighbor or Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in purſuit of any lawful good, as he is deſirous of the ſame himſelf; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe deſires be of things pertaining to this life, or to the hopes and means of obtaining the life to come. <note place="margin">An <hi>Objection</hi> againſt this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Yet againſt this Precept it may be Objected, That it may ſeem to eſtabliſh the <hi>Pythagorean Retaliation,</hi> which was ſuch an error in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent error of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> is in <hi>Religion.</hi> Both of them tending to an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie of all ſorts of men.</hi> So may <hi>this Rule</hi> ſeem at firſt ſight to make <hi>all men Equal.</hi> For if every man muſt do to others as he would be done unto; Then, moſt the Maſter perform the like duties to the ſervant as he expects from him; ſo muſt the Prince unto his Subjects, the Magiſtrate to ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; the Father to the Son, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There be ſome common Grounds which will ſerve to Anſwer other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which may be made;</p>
               <p>As firſt, What-ever ye <hi>would &amp;c.</hi> muſt be underſtood of a <hi>Regulated Will, A Will</hi> not tainted with any inordinate ſelf-love or ſinful deſires.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It muſt be interpreted with <hi>A Salvo</hi> to all Gods other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, They muſt ſtand as God has ſet them, reconciled to one another, and not be ſet at variance by our exorbitant <hi>willes or</hi> affections.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It muſt not be extended to the diſſolving of Order, and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Dignities or Powers ordained by God.</p>
               <p>But this Objection may have its proper Solution <hi>two wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, The meaning of the Precept is not, that we ſhould do <hi>the ſelf ſame to every man in every eſtate,</hi> which we expect he ſhould do <hi>to us, living in that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">An Anſwer to the Objection.</note> 
                  <hi>eſtate wherein we are;</hi> For ſeeing there is an <hi>Inequality of Eſtates,</hi> there muſt
<pb n="3632" facs="tcp:32220:175"/>
be alſo an <hi>Inequality</hi> or diverſity <hi>of Duties</hi> belonging to thoſe ſeveral E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
               <p>The meaning then is thus, <q>Whatſoever you could wiſh that men ſhould do unto you, ſuppoſing you were in the ſame eſtate they are in, that you muſt do to them now they are in that eſtate.</q> Thus the <hi>Greateſt Monarch</hi> on earth, in as much as He is but man, and might have been or may be yet ſubject to anothers pleaſure, muſt ſtoop to this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>what uſage he would expect of his Prince if he himſelf were a Subject;</hi> and he muſt afford the ſelf fame to them. So muſt the Father likewiſe conſider what uſage he did expect of his Parents, and the like he muſt afford unto his children. So likewiſe muſt every Inferiour ſeriouſly conſider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, what reſpect he would deſire of his Inferiours were he in place of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and the ſelf ſame he muſt afford unto ſuch as are his lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; Otherwiſe (beſides the evil of confuſion) if either Superiour or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour uſe other loſs reſpectively or more contemptuouſly, then they would be content withall, themſelves, the Righteous Judge will reduce all to equality. Thus <hi>St. Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Children</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>obey your parents in all things for that is well-pleaſing to the Lord:</hi> and verſe 21. <hi>Fathers provoke not your children to anger.</hi> And concerning ſervants he ſaith more expresſly, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Servants be obedient unto them that are your maſters according to the fleſh; not with eye-ſervice as men pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart: and ye maſters</hi> (as it followes in the 9. verſe) <hi>do the ſame things unto them, putting away threatning, and know that your maſter alſo is in Heaven, neither is there reſpect of perſons with him.</hi> If either ſervants would uſe their maſters otherwiſe then they would be uſed if they were maſters, or maſters Uſe their ſervants otherwiſe then they would be Uſed if they were ſuch, God will bring a more miſerable ſervitude on the One and continue it on the other.</p>
               <p>From theſe places of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> we may likewiſe frame a <hi>Second Anſwer</hi> to to the former <hi>Objection,</hi> Thus. If we compare men in their ſeveral eſtates wherein they live, wherein they are, not wherein they may be, then this mutual Duty of <hi>doing as we would be done unto</hi> muſt not be paid (as we ſay) <hi>in Kind,</hi> but in <hi>Proportion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Rule is this; ſeeing all men delight in comfort and contentation of mind, &amp; only that is ſuch which is truly good in reſpect of the party which deſires it, every man ſhould be deſirous to do that good to others which is beſt befitting his eſtate wherein he may take true comfort and beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</q> Seing great perſonages take great comfort in honour and ſerviceable reſpects, inferiours ſhould with a good mind give Honor to whom Honor is due; and they ſhould be as ready, though not to Honor their inferiours, yet to afford them that wherein they have more delght, as in relieving the poor and needy by Hoſpitalitie; in countenancing others of competent eſtate in their commendable courſes; in protecting them from wrong; or (in a word) according to the Exigence of their ſeveral ſtates or occaſions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again it may be objected, That <hi>this Rule</hi> however we interpret it; muſt be violated by the Publick Magiſtrate in inflicting puniſhment upon Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <note place="margin">A Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> For many a man that hath deſerved Death according to Poſitive Laws, will naturally, and that I think without offence, be moſt deſirous of life, and would make earneſt ſuit for his releaſe.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion is, <hi>Whether the publick Magiſtrate in this Caſe ſhould do as he would be done unto if he were in the like Caſe.</hi> For it may ſeem, that either he muſt tranſgreſs the Poſitive Laws to which he is ſworn; or violate this <hi>Law</hi>
                  <pb n="3633" facs="tcp:32220:175"/>
                  <hi>of Nature</hi> which is more ſacred then any Poſitive Law.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Anſwer</hi> is eaſie, from that which hath been ſaid before. No publick Officer is here to propoſe unto himſelf this one man or Malefactors Caſe, but rather the Common-wealths, or ſuch in it as deſerve better, and yet might be further endangered, by Malefactors eſcaping unpuniſhed; if his Caſe were theirs, he would be deſirous to have the Law executed, and therefore muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them this their juſt deſire, if it be in his power, otherwiſe ſuch pity finds oft-times at Gods hands the reward of Cruelty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A notable Example</hi> whereof we have in <hi>Alexander de Medices,</hi> the firſt of that Family that took upon him to be the <hi>Prince of Florence,</hi> but not ſo willing to execute Juſtice as to uſurp Authority. He, contrary to his Country Laws, granted pardon to a Murtherer at one of his neer Kinſmens Requeſt, who afterwards willing to purchaſe Fame by freeing his Country from his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>Duke Alexanders</hi> Tyranny, uſed the former Malefactors help in killing the Duke which had given him life at his requeſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But to return to that we were upon, when theſe Objections croſſed our way: God weighs our ſecret thoughts more exactly then we can do bodies groſs and ſenſible. As the Balance is juſt in our ſight, when both ends are even, and both alike apt to be aequally moved with equal weights; ſo <note place="margin">Mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are right balanced, when they be as ready <hi>to do,</hi> as <hi>to receive good.</hi>
                  </note> are our thoughts in Gods ſight, juſt, when we are as <hi>apt to do good, as ready to receive it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may deſire or receive good either from men or from God, and we may return good reſpectively to both; kindneſſes (as we ſay in kind) to men; Duties of obedience, praiſe, and thanks &amp;c. unto God. To men we may repay good either for their own ſakes, or becauſe we would deſire good from them in like caſe; or elſe, becauſe we expect good from God. The equalitie of our conditions as men, as fellow-creatures, or brethren in Chriſt, bindes us to afford the ſame meaſure of good to others; not which they have meaſured to us, but as we deſire they ſhould do to us if we were in their caſe. <hi>Every man knows his own deſires, and therefore cannot he ignorant what he ſhould do.</hi> If they have dealt ill with us, we may not in any caſe deal ſo with them; for we were unwilling to receive ill, and therefore ſhould be as unwilling to repay it; and the rather, for fear God do to us as we do to them; Becauſe in ſo doing we took his office into our hands. If they have done us any good, we are more ſtrictly bound to repay them in larger meaſure then we received it; becauſe we were prevented by them: As in a Balance even ſet, the Rebound doth alwayes exceed the firſt <hi>ſway</hi> or motion; ſo in repaying ſuch good to our brethren, as God hath graciouſly dealt to us, we ſhould exceed the former proportion; becauſe we are bound to diſtribute to their neceſſities, ſo is not He to ours. And alwayes the freer the Gift is, the greater ſhould the receivers thankfulneſs be.</p>
               <p>This was that which aggravated the unthankful ſervants offence, that ſeeing his maſter had freely forgiven him, yet he would not forgive his fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. <hi>(Mat.</hi> 18. 23.) We are in many reſpects bound moſt ſtrictly, to render unto God himſelf according to his reward. (It was <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> ſin that he did not ſo. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 32. 24,) <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe he hath prevented us with his bleſſings; he gave us <hi>Being</hi> before we could deſire it; and with it He gave us a deſire of continuing it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he gave it Us of his meer freewill and abundant kindneſs: And therefore in all equitie we are bound, <hi>Firſt</hi> to render what poſſibly we can <hi>unto Him,</hi> and that with greater alacritie and cheerfulneſs then unto man for his ſake; as Reaſon teacheth us, to perform our perſonal duties and ſervices to our Parents, Patrons, and Benefactors with greater care
<pb n="3634" facs="tcp:32220:176"/>
and forwardneſs, then ſuch offices as for their ſakes we owe to their Followers or Favorites. Hence may we deſcry the equitie of thoſe <hi>two main Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> on which the whole Law and Prophets depend: <hi>[Love God above all; and thy neighbor as thy ſelf.]</hi> All the ſervices of worſhip, of praiſe, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or the like, which we return immediately to God himſelf, belong unto the <hi>Firſt Table.</hi> All the duties we perform to men, either becauſe we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or could deſire like kindneſs from them; or becauſe we expect ſome greater matters from God, belong unto the ſecond Table. It remains we ſee how this Rule doth direct our thoughts for the true practice of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Commandment: <hi>What I omitt, your own meditation may eaſily ſupply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. None of us (as in charity I preſume) is ſo ignorant of God or his Goodneſs, but often prayes that he would continue his bleſſings of life and health unto us: deſiring withall, that he would do ſome other good unto us, which yet we want, Could we in the next place take a perfect meaſure of our own <hi>deſires</hi> of what we want, whilſt they are freſh, and at the height, and withall duly weigh <hi>thoſe Bleſsings</hi> of life and health, conſidering the full and ſole dependence they have on the good-wil and pleaſure of our God; the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the one and <hi>weight</hi> of the other, could not but impell and ſway our minds to performance of ſuch duties towards God, as his Law and <hi>this Rule</hi> of Reaſon require. Theſe are good Beginnings of ſuch perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, as this Rule requires. But here we uſually commit a double over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. <note place="margin">A double overſight</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We do not weigh bleſsings received as duly and truly as we ſhould. For who is he, that truly conſiders what life is, till he come in danger of death? Or how pleaſant health is, till he be pained with ſome grievous ſickneſs, wound, or other maladie? Or if we come by ſuch occaſions duly to eſteem of life and health, or other bleſsings already injoyed; or to take a true meaſure of our <hi>deſires</hi> of what we want, whilſt <hi>they</hi> are freſh and at the height; yet either we apprehend not, or we conſider not, what abſolute and intire dependance the beginning or continuance of benefits received, or the compleating of others deſired, have on the good-will and pleaſure of our God. We think we are in part beholden to our Parents for our Life, to our Phyſician, to our ſtrength of nature or good diet, for recovery of health; to our own wit or friends for obtaining ſuch things as we deſire. Theſe or like conceits ariſing from ignorance of Gods providence, or want of faith in his Goodneſs, are as ſo many props or ſtayes that hinder the weight of <hi>his beſt Bleſsings,</hi> or the ſtrength of <hi>our deſires</hi> of further good, to have their <hi>full ſhock</hi> upon our ſouls and minds. Otherwiſe, the true conſideration or feeling of their dependence on Gods will and pleaſure, would ſway and impel us, to do our duty to him with the ſame alacritie we deſire good from him; to love him with all our heart, with all our ſouls, with all our ſtrength: yea, we would <note place="margin">☞</note> be as deſirous to do his will and pleaſure, as we are to obtain the things that pleaſe us: as unwilling any way to diſpleaſe him, as we are to forgo any thing we have from him. As willing to conſecrate our lives and actions to his ſervice, as we are to injoy life and uſe of limbs.</p>
               <p>If a Land-lord ſhould command his <hi>Tenant at will</hi> to do him ſuch a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, perhaps to go ſome <hi>errand of importance</hi> for him, or elſe he ſhould go without his <hi>Tenement;</hi> but promiſe him a better if he did it faithfully; The ſweetneſs, as well of what he injoyed, as of the Reward he looked for, would diſperſe it ſelf throughout his thoughts, and ſeaſon his labour with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and make all his very pains ſweet unto him. But if he had lately recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an <hi>Eſtate for Lives,</hi> and could not hope for any further good ſhortly to
<pb n="3635" facs="tcp:32220:176"/>
come from him; although perhaps he would do what his Lord bad him, leaſt he ſhould be upbraided with unthankfulneſs; Yet his ſervice would but be faint and cold in reſpect of the former; like his that wrought (as we ſay) <hi>for the dead Horſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may ſerve to ſet forth the difference betwixt the faithful or true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and the unfaithful or unbelievers heart in the performance of <hi>this great Commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The unbeliever, although he acknowledge in ſome ſort, That he received all he hath, and muſt expect all he hopes for from God; and in this reſpect muſt do what God commands: yet, if at any time he do his Will, it is without all Devotion or Chearfulneſs: partly, becauſe he thinks the Bleſſings he looks for, muſt be gotten by his own indeavor; and ſuch as he hath, have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by his own good husbandrie; nor doth he fear that the Lord ſhould diſpoſſeſs him of life or health, but there will be time enough to gain or renue his Favour, before <hi>his Leaſe</hi> (as he takes it) of life, of health and proſperitie be run out.</p>
               <p>The faithful man ſtedfaſtly believes and knows that God is the Lord and giver of life; that he kils and makes alive, that he wounds and alone makes whole; that we have no hold of either, but only during the Term of his Will and Pleaſure: he firmly believes all the threatnings of his Law; as, that either God will puniſh ſinners with ſudden and unexpected death, ſaying unto them as he did unto the rich man in the Goſpel, <hi>Thou Fool! this night ſhall thy ſoul be taken from thee:</hi> or elſe ſuffers them to injoy life, and health, and other Bleſſings to their greater condemnation. He believes likewiſe all his promiſes to the righteous; to ſuch as do his will. Whence, as well the Goodneſs of all the Bleſſings he injoyes (life, health, wealth, and eſtate) as of thoſe which he hopes for, whether in this life, or in the life to come, do as it were provoke a deſire in him of worſhipping God and doing his will, equal at leaſt to his deſire of either having preſent bleſſings continued, or greater beſtowed upon him. His joy in prayſing God and keeping his Laws, is greater then in the injoying of life, of his ſoul, his ſtrength, or other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p>Now as it recreates an hungry man to <hi>ſmell</hi> meat, but much more to <hi>taſt</hi> it; ſo is it a matter to be more deſired, to <hi>taſt the Goodneſs of God</hi> (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks) then to enjoy the ſweet Savor or Fragrance of him in his Creatures. And we beſt <hi>taſt</hi> the Goodneſs of God, by doing His Will and pleaſure; as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 4. 34. <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi>

For <hi>they ſaid, wherein ſhall we return?</hi> They ſhould have done unto their God accordingly as they deſired he ſhould do to them. They deſired <hi>the Lord</hi> ſhould bleſſe them as <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſpoken, <hi>In the City and in the field; in the fruit of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and in the fruit of their grounds; in the fruit of their cattel, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their kine, and in the flocks of their ſheep, Deut.</hi> 28. 4.

Notwithſtanding, if they would deal better with him, he aſſures them he will deal better with them. <hi>Bring ye all the Tithes into the Storehouſe, that there may be meat in mine houſe, and prove me herewith, ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes if I will not open the windows of Heaven unto you, and pour you out a Bleſsing without meaſure:</hi> And <hi>I will rebuke the Devourer for your ſakes, and he ſhall not devour the fruit of your ground; neither ſhall the Vine be barren in the field, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.

               <p>As he that had wrong'd his brother was the forwarder to repine againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo <hi>the words</hi> of ſuch in this people, as had moſt robbed and ſpoiled God, <hi>were moſt ſtout againſt him.</hi> They ſaid, <hi>It was in vain to ſerve God.</hi> And <hi>what profit is it that we have kept his Commandments?</hi> And <hi>that we have walked humbly before the Lord of Hoſts?

V. 13. <hi>What have we ſpoken againſt thee?</hi> But, that they thought in their hearts, <hi>That God did not reſpect them according to their deſerts,</hi> or that his Bounty had not been ſo great to them as to their Fathers. If they ſaid not, they thought with <hi>Gideon, Ah my Lord! if the Lord be with us, why then is all this come upon us? and where be his miracles which our Fathers have told us? and ſaid, did not the Lord bring us out of Egypt?

               <p>He thought this Change was in God, not in himſelf, or in his Countrymen. As moſt men at this day think, that God is not as ready to hear our prayers as he was to hear the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> or the Fathers in the primitive Church. When as the reaſon why he hears them not, is, becauſe we are not ſo ready to do <hi>His will.</hi> If we perform any obedience to his Laws, it is, for the moſt part, ſuch as thoſe murmurers did: we offer unto him either the vile, or the lame, or elſe but half that which is due: and yet perſwade our ſelves we deal bountifully with him too. In Fine, we do ſo much as ſerves to ground a Phariſaical conceit of our ſelves, not ſo much, or not ſo ſincerely, as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Our God, who knows our hearts,</hi> to think well of us; We do not ſo to him as we deſire he ſhould do to us; for we deſire that he ſhould bleſs us above

1.

               </p>
               <p>The Original and principal <hi>Impediment</hi> of this practiſe, is, becauſe we <hi>cannot,</hi> or <hi>will not, or do not,</hi> ſufficiently and impartially propoſe others mens <hi>Caſes</hi> as our own. And this fals out oft-times, becauſe we are ignorant what our own deſires would be in many <hi>Caſes;</hi> and therefore having <hi>no Rule</hi> within our ſelves we cannot practiſe <hi>This</hi> to the behoof of others. It is ſeen by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that ſuch as have the freſh prints or bleeding ſcarres of any calamitie upon themſelves, will be moſt compaſsionate to others ſuffering the like. The Reaſon is, Theſe men cannot but propoſe other mens afflictions as their own; They know well what they themſelves have deſired to be done unto them in like calamitie: and according to the full meaſure of their own deſires, ariſeth an Alacritie and readineſs to relieve others. The ſight or notification of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mens miſeries, caſts them as it were by a Relapſe into a Fit of their Own: ſo, as they are afflicted whilſt others are tormented, and for this Reaſon are drawn by <hi>Sympathie</hi> to do to others, as it hath been, or as they deſired it ſhould have been, done to them; to bring themſelves out of their preſent pain.</p>
               <p>Thus far nature doth lead us without any actual Intention of mind, or conſideration of performing this dutie as injoyned us either by the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> or of <hi>Grace.</hi> And if we would, as they ſay, but <hi>let nature work,</hi> it would teach us more particulars of every kinde, and how to propoſe every mans Caſe (of like nature) as our own. But ſuch is our natural folly, that we learn not many of theſe leſſons; but only ſuch as experience teacheth us. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then is the difference between the fooliſh, and men ſpiritually wiſe. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the one ſets nature a working. In the other, Reaſon, aſſiſted by Grace, from one or two experiments drawes general Rules.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The impediments which hinder us either in taking a true <hi>eſtimate</hi> of our deſires, or performing that to others which we our ſelves would deſire, are theſe. <hi>Our eager Deſires either of being in better eſtate then we are;</hi> or <hi>our Fears of being in worſe.</hi> Theſe are ſuch ſowre door-keepers as will not ſuffer any other mens deſires or notifications of their miſeries to enter into our ſouls, or to make any impreſſion upon them. If our ſouls or affections were neither inclined much <hi>this way</hi> nor <hi>that way,</hi> but ſtood <hi>at the Puſh,</hi> The bare ſight of any others affection whether joyful or ſad would poſſeſſe us with the like. But whilſt our ſouls are faſt tyed and led captive by ſome one deſire or other unto ſome one Object or other (as commoditie, pleaſure, honour, advancement or the like,) they cannot eaſily be drawn any other way. Yea oft-times the propoſal of others miſeries, makes ſouls ſo affected, cleek the faſter hold; becauſe they apprehend, that to relieve or ſupply thoſe, would (in ſuch proportion) leſſen and weaken the means of effecting what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and have purpoſed to effect. Thus if one that hath ſet his ſoul on riches ſee his brother pinched with want and penurie, he ſtreight imagines, that povertie is the mother of miſerie, and the more he gives, the nearer he ſhall bring himſelf to povertie; and this incires his deſire both of increaſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what he hath already got, that ſo he may be the better fenced againſt povertie, which he fears coming upon him as an armed man. If he ſhould part but with a peny, or ſome ſmall tribute, he thinks himſelf <hi>quite</hi> undone, <hi>crying like the miſer in</hi> Horace, <hi>Quod ſi comminuas vilem redigatur ad aſſem.</hi>

So likewiſe the ambitious man if he ſee one cruſhed or kept down for want of means, he is not ſo much affected with his Caſe, as ſeekes to prevent (if it were poſſible all poſſibilitie of) the like in himſelf, and ſo ſeeking, hales all to himſelf, never conſidering by whoſe wants his increaſe of honor ſhall ariſe. If unto theſe you oppoſe one that relies upon Gods providence, and ſeekes to content himſelf with what is preſent, rather then to intertain great hopes for the future; or one that thinks not, how much better eſtate then he many others have, but thanks God it is ſo well with him, and knows it may be worſe; his mind is eaſily moved to a fellow-feeling of others ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, becauſe it is not faſtened to contrarie hopes, but ſtands rather in ſuſpenſe and more inclinable to expect a meaner, then to hope for a better eſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>beſt Method</hi> therefore for right practizing of <hi>This Rule</hi> will be, <note place="margin">The beſtmeans to put the dutie in practiſe.</note> 
                  <hi>To keep our ſouls as clear as the apple of our eye;</hi> to view all eſtates, but not to be dazelled with the glorie of any: To Frame our hearts ſo as they may take impreſsion from any other mans eſtate, good or bad, but not to ſuffer the deſire of any to incorporate in them. For as, when the colour of any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is inherent in the ſight, it hinders the impreſsion of all others; ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of any ſenſible Good, if it be incorporate in our hearts, will hinder us in the Eſtimate of far better, and make us unapt to Sympathize with our Brethren. <hi>I may do all things</hi> (ſaith <hi>St. Paul) but I will not be brought under the power of any thing;</hi> that is, he would ſo love all ſenſible good, as upon occaſion to be content to hate it; he would not faſten his deſires upon it, for ſo it ſhould command him, not he uſe it. He knew to uſe the world as if he uſed it not, he knew how to abound and how to want. The former Reſolution was the Root of thoſe branches of <hi>this Dutie; who is weak and I am not weak? who is offended and I burn not?</hi> His preſerving himſelf free, was that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> made him as apt to take the impreſsions of others affections, as the eye is to take the ſhapes of viſibles. Hence was it that he could <hi>become all unto all,</hi> being not in ſubjection to any thing: <hi>Et mihi res, non me rebus ſubmittere Conor.</hi> But we who have not attained to this libertie of mind, nor can altogether caſt off this yoke of ſervitude, but have our ſouls as it were overcharged with many unneceſſarie delights and worldly deſires, had ſo much the more need of counterpoizes to bring them back to their <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> to ſuch a ſtate of <hi>Indifferencie</hi> as may eaſily be inclined to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is no man I think of riper years but hath taſted afflictions at one time or other of divers kindes; and hath been acquainted with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts <note place="margin">Keep an exact Regiſter or Calendar of our Good and evil dayes.</note> of as many. The true Character of both ſhould be throughly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in our minds whilſt they are freſh; and dayly renewed by meditation or propoſal of the ſame or like. If we could truly take and ſo retain the true meaſure and eſtimate either of our grief in calamitie or comfort upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, Theſe would ſerve us as ſo many <hi>Keyes</hi> or tunes of ſongs gotten by heart, ſo as we ſhould no ſooner hear another ſound the like <hi>Note</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently we ſhould conſort with him: and if his caſe were mournful we ſhould eaſe him by participation of his ſorrow, &amp; ſeek remedy for it as if it were our own. He that never had experience of calamitie, his miſerie is the greater; and he ſhould do well to make it the leſs, <hi>by going to the Houſe of mourning.</hi> Meditation will work whatſoever Experience doth. <hi>Gutta cavat Lapidem &amp;c.</hi> Others tears, would we be much converſant among the mourners, would pierce at length even hearts of ſtone.</p>

The <hi>Former method</hi> was that which the Lord himſelf ſo oft inculcates to the <hi>Iſraelites, Remember that ye were ſtrangers,</hi> &amp;c. He expected that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance hereof ſhould make them like affected to ſtrangers, and apt to mourn with them as they had done for themſelves, and to afford ſtrangers ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts as he had afforded them.</p>
               <p>This Precept was five or ſix times at the leaſt repeated to them. And not only they that had lived in a ſtrange Land, the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity were bound to celebrate for ever the memorial of their fore-fathers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. For this Reaſon whilſt they reaped Gods benefits in the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, they were to leave ſomewhat for the poor and for the ſtranger, as it is expreſly commanded four ſeveral times, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 9. and 23. 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi>

               <p>All which Laws are not ſo farre yet aboliſhed, but that we may, upon our deliverance from any grief, miſery, or deſtruction, conſecrate ſome part of our goods, endeavours, or imployments, to comfort ſuch as are any where vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with the like, and by the ſolemnitie of ſuch Acts to renew the decaying memory of Gods mercies towards us: So doing, God will remember us with like mercies again. But if we ſuffer his mercie to ſlip out of our minds, by neglecting our brethren ſtanding in need of ſuch comfort, we ſhall cry and not be heard, when calamitie ſhall come upon us, like the unclean ſpirit with more then thrice doubled force.</p>
               <p>Surely, either This, or ſome practiſe Aequivalent to this; is as neceſſarie to us as to the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> For we are all ſubject to that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whereof the Lord ſo often fore-warned <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Even ſuch as ſeem moſt upright, when <note place="margin">☞</note> once they wax fat, ſpurn with the heel, and caſt the memories of their miſeries and Gods former mercies behind their Backs. <hi>Thou art fat, thou art groſſe, thou art laden with fatneſs,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 32. 15. <hi>Therefore he forſook God that made him, and regarded not the ſtrong God of his ſalvation.</hi> Yet did <hi>the Lord</hi> look that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have proved upright.</p>
               <p>What was the reaſon that he waxed thus full and fat?</p>
               <p>Only becauſe he did not uſe that Exerciſe which <hi>God</hi> appointed to keep him under, and his heart from being lifted up. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Take heed,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>leaſt when thou haſt eaten and filled thy ſelf, and haſt built goodly houſes and dwelt therein, and thy beaſts and thy ſheep are increaſed, and thy ſilver and thy gold is multiplied; and all that thou haſt is increaſed; then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt; out of the houſe of Bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The daily and lively Repreſentation or Recognition of this their eſtate ſhould have been as uſual to them as their meat and drink; yea, as it were, their thankſgiving before and after meales. Their viſitation of others with mercie <note place="margin">☞</note> and kindneſs, ſhould have been as a perpetual Homage for their Redemption. Theſe practiſes would have kept the Childrens minds at the ſame equable temper which their fathers were at, upon their firſt deliverance. And leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſhould think this people to have been by nature more groſs, and ſo more ſubject to this diſeaſe, then we our ſelves are, let us conſider how eaſily all conceit of former calamitie will ſlip out of our minds without ſuch <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Recognition</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The nature of any Good is better perceived, <hi>Carendo quam fruendo.</hi> And for this reaſon men in adverſitie can too well remember former proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Thus the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were no ſooner hungrie in the wilderneſs, but fall a longing after the fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt. Extremitie of want adds ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Goodneſs to things indifferent or ſcarce tolerable in their kind!</hi> What would their murmurings have been? Or how ill would they have brooked
<pb n="3644" facs="tcp:32220:181"/>
this exchange, if they had been fed with delicates from <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Table? But the nature of any evil is never thoroughly known but <hi>Patiendo.</hi> And for this cauſe, fulneſs or proſperity expels the conceit of want, as groſſer bodies do <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 11. 25. 27.</note> air out of ſuch places as they are infuſed into: Unleſs there be a viciſſitude or change, if not laid upon us by <hi>the Almighty,</hi> yet voluntarily undertaken; by renouncing the uſe of what we might injoy, or by uſing proſperity as if we uſed it not: and ſometime in our greateſt proſperity by viſiting the Houſe of Mourning, and taking or renewing acquaintance with the Children of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. <hi>Bleſſed is the Rich,</hi> ſaith the Son of <hi>Sirach, which is found without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, and hath not gone after Gold, which hath been tried thereby and found per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, &amp;c.</hi> Ecclus. 31. 8, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus proſperity obliterates all former print or mark of adverſitie, even in ſuch as deſire no greater things then at preſent they enjoy; that they cannot do to others in adverſitie, as they would be done unto. Becauſe they know not what the meaſure of their own deſires would be. What men do not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally apprehend as evil, or are not touched with, they cannot have any deſire to redreſs in themſelves, much leſſe can they relieve or comfort ſuch, of whoſe miſeries they have no ſenſe, or <hi>intelligent conſideration.</hi>

               <p>For theſe Reaſons and others formerly mentioned, thoſe men are more unapt, or more averſe from <hi>Commiſeration,</hi> that are ſtill in chaſe or purſuit of greater wealth, honour, or preferment. The putting on of a better Eſtate puts away all memorie of their own former; and all reſpect to other mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſeries: For when hopes are ſpedd and delightes ſtrong, the good obtained puts, as it were, a new tincture or die upon the mind.</p>
               <p>That theſe are the natural effects of ſuch as long after growth and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might eaſily be proved by Induction, if the enumeration of particulars, which theſe our Times have afforded, were ſafe. It fares ſo with ſuch men in the exchange of fortunes or eſtates, as it doth in change of Diet. Such as find good relliſh in courſeſt fare (whilſt they be in ſtrait condition) uſed to a better, without intermiſſion, though but for ſome ſhort ſpace, have no taſt at all of the former. And afterward uſed to a more fine and curious Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to loath or not to like that which wrought out the Relliſh of the firſt; and ſo on by degrees until they come to that paſs, that they can relliſh nought but dainties. So is it with many in our dayes; who in their younger years could <note place="margin">☞</note> for the affinity of their fortunes have ſympathized with the pooreſt ſoul that goes from door to door; Theſe a little promoted, <hi>know not what the petitions of the poor, mean;</hi> they are ſtrangers to their very language: They cannot conceive what their own deſires would be in ſuch an eſtate. The ſuppoſal of ſuch mens caſes for their own, is <hi>A Suppoſition of impoſsibilitie.</hi> Advanced yet a little higher, they forget what they late have been; and are now further from taking notice of any inferior, living in that Rank from which they late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roſe, though their <hi>ingenuous Brother,</hi> perhaps their better every way (unleſs we value them as men do Sheep or Oxen, by the price of money which they are worth) then they were at their firſt Riſe, from renewing acquaintance with the meaneſt.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> which is the worſt of evils that can be imagined; whilſt they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſome Branches of the <hi>Affirmative Precept,</hi> that is, whilſt they ſeek to pleaſure others in their eagre deſires of preferment, or ſuch things wherein they would be pleaſured again, they bring a neceſſity upon themſelves of tranſgreſsing <hi>the Negative part of this Precept,</hi> that is, <hi>Of doing that to others which they would not have done unto themſelves, if they were in their Caſe.</hi> I am perſwaded, That the miſeries which fall upon the inferior ſorts of men, by the mutual deſires of great men to do one to another, as they would be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; (that is, by pleaſuring one another in their ſuites of honour, preferment, or inlarging their eſtates;) are more then all that God doth otherwiſe lay upon <hi>them</hi> in this life. Many thouſands whom God never curſed, are by theſe meanes forced to ſeek their bread in ſtony places. And is it poſsible that any man can perſwade himſelf? that if he were in ſuch poor mens Caſes he ſhould be well pleaſed with their dealings, who ſeek to enlarge their ſuperfluities by the certain diminiſhing of other mens neceſſaries for life? And yet who is he almoſt that thinks he doth not obſerve <hi>this Precept</hi> well enough, if he be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do another man <hi>as good a Turn</hi> as he expects from him, although he know not to whoſe harm it may redound? If no determinate perſon, for the preſent feel the ſmart, they think Conſcience hath no cauſe to cry. As if <hi>God Almighty</hi> did not ſee as well what evil will hereafter inſue as what is preſent; and did not puniſh immoderate deſires which neceſſarily bring on with them publick Calamities, as well as outragious but private Facts.</p>
               <p n="7">7. With this Fallacie, <hi>A Dicto ſecundum quid ad Simpliciter,</hi> we uſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves in the performance of <hi>this Dutie.</hi> We think it ſufficient, to do as we have been done unto, or if we do to ſome <hi>one</hi> or <hi>few</hi> as we expect <note place="margin">

Whereas, we ſhould examin it, not from our affection to <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi> man, but by our <hi>Indifferencie of receiving and Returning</hi> good towards All. Oft-times to do one man good may be conjoyned with ſome others harm whom we have more reaſon to reſpect. And here we may quickly miſtake in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of their <hi>Exigence</hi> as our own. <hi>If you fulfil the Royal Law according to the Scripture, which ſaith, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thy ſelf, ye do well,</hi> ſaith <hi>St. James.</hi> Chap. 2. 4. <hi>But if ye regard perſons, ye commit ſin, and are rebuked of the Law as Tranſgreſſors.</hi> The Apoſtles Diſcourſe in that place, inferres as much as I have ſaid. And his meaning is, that which <hi>our Saviour</hi> had taught in the Parable of the <hi>Samaritan:</hi> That <hi>every man,</hi> as man, <hi>is our neighbor;</hi> and therefore <hi>this Dutie</hi> of loving others as our ſelves; and doing as we would be done unto, was to be performed to all alike, <hi>without reſpect of perſons;</hi> For that which we are to reſpect, is, <hi>the Exigence of their eſtate.</hi> So much is <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and Eſſentially</hi> included in <hi>the Dutie it ſelf.</hi> Not that we may not be more ready to do good to one man then to another, for this we may do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of Perſons. Do good to all, but <hi>eſpecially to ſuch as are of the Houſhold of Faith.</hi> The Object of <hi>this Dutie</hi> is man, <hi>as man,</hi> in his lawful deſires. Our love then or readineſs of doing good muſt be increaſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the juſt exigencies of their deſires; where <hi>Theſe are equal,</hi> our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of doing good may be augmented according to particular reſpects of nearneſs, &amp;c. as, <hi>To a Chriſtian before a Turk,</hi> to an <hi>Engliſh man</hi> before another. For if we muſt love others as our ſelves we muſt be moſt ready to reſpect that in others which we <hi>(in a Regular Way)</hi> deſire ſhould be moſt reſpected in our ſelves.</p>

Now (next to eternal happineſs) life and the neceſſities thereof we moſt reſpect. And if we ſtand in danger of loſing the one, or ſuffer want of the other, we deſire that <hi>thoſe main Chances</hi> (as we ſay) may be ſecured before we begin to hunt after pleaſures or ſuperfluities. If then we muſt <hi>Do to all men</hi> as we would be done unto, without reſpect of perſons, that is, excluding none; we muſt firſt releive the neceſſities of ſuch as want, and tender the life of ſuch as are in ſickneſs or danger; and then if occaſion require, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or deſerve kindneſſes in matters of innocuous pleaſure, as in feaſting, ſporting, furthering mens advancements, or the like. Otherwiſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the pleaſuring of a <hi>Dear Friend in theſe,</hi> before <hi>the Releif of an Enemies neceſsities</hi> is prepoſterous and a breach of the Law, Becauſe it is <hi>to have reſpect</hi> of perſons.</p>

And in the Revolutions of times, the exigence of ſome peculiar ſeaſons may truly argue Extraordinary favours in ordinarie Gifts; large bounties in ſmall Donatives: yea great exceſs as well in the matter as in the manner of ſuch deſires, as at other times would come ſhort of mediocritie.</p>
               <p>For a man deſcended, and qualified ſo well as <hi>Baruch</hi> (to whom this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was here directed) to ſet up his ſtaff at a Levites lodging door, reſolved to live contented with a poor bed, a ſtool, and a Candleſtick in a corner of ſome Country village; may with Reference to <hi>modern</hi> Practiſes ſeem to argue rather great moderation of deſires, then any immoderate deſire of great matters. But ſuch are the ſtreights, whereinto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Juda</hi> his native Country, now are brought; That to uſe the whole Latitude of his lawful wonted liberties, were to tranſgreſs the bounds of Religious diſcretion; yea, to outrage in licentiouſneſs. So heavie were the burthens, which the Lord had laid upon the mothers neck, that for her beſt born ſons not to ſtoop at her dejection, bewrayes in them a ſtubborn ſpirit of untimely am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>

But though the paper were ſubject to the flame; as Chriſts body (to uſe <hi>Theodorets</hi> applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Type) was unto death: yet the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word of the Lord, which came to <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and which <hi>Baruch</hi> was to preach (after the King had burnt the Roll and the words, which <hi>Baruch</hi> wrote at the mouth of <hi>Jeremie:) Take again another roll, and write in it all the former words, that were in the firſt roll, which Iehoiakim the King of Iudah burnt.</hi>

               <p>Out of the abundance either of grief and ſorrow during the time of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titation from the Kings Inquiſitors, or out of preſent fear leaſt the Tyrants rage might be inlarged againſt him for undertaking this ſecond Charge im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon him by <hi>Jeremy;</hi> or (as it is likely) upon both occaſions, did he utter thoſe Complaints regiſtred in the third verſe of this Chapter. <hi>Wo is</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The deſire of a faithful man, ſpecially of a publick Miniſter, muſt alwayes be ſuited to the condition of the times wherein, and of the parties with whom he lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In times of publick calamitie, or deſolation, the bare Donative of life and libertie is a priviledge more to be eſteemed, then the prerogative of Princes.</hi> Or in other Terms, thus. <hi>Exemption from general plagues, is more then a full recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe for all the grievances, which attend our miniſterial charge, or ſervice in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto the <hi>Former,</hi> (the truth of whoſe Doctrine muſt be the principal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <note place="margin">A Corollarie added to the former.</note> of my preſent meditations) I ſhall add or annex this Uſeful Corollarie. <hi>As the intemperate deſire of myrth, of pleaſure, or preferment, in the dayes of publick Calamitie is in every private man prepoſterous: So where the humor is general, it is the uſual Symptom of a forlorn or dying ſtate, or fearful ſign that God hath forſaken the land, and people wherein it raigneth. Seekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf? Seek them not, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What were the great things which <hi>Baruch</hi> ſought? Exceſſive pleaſure, wealth or honour? Any poſitive delight more then ordinary, or ſolace grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then could agree with his calling? Any exemption from tax, or trouble common to all? The principal, if not the only fault, for which he was taxed by <hi>the Prophet,</hi> was, <hi>his untimely deſire of ordinary eaſe, of freedom from extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and thankleſs pains in ſervice diſtastful to the preſent State, and therefore dangerous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did ever the auſtereſt Founder of moſt ſuperſtitious ſtrict Orders, tie their Followers to a more rigid Rule then <hi>Baruch</hi> here is bound unto? The <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi> or begging Frier may interpret his miniſterial Commiſſion in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe; He does not ride, but go as bare footed as he was born, to Preach the Goſpel unto every Creature under heaven (unto ſtocks and ſtones, as St. <hi>Francis</hi> his Father, they ſay, hath fondly taught him.) But unto which of them was it by Rule of Founder enjoyned? Or what monkiſh Votary did ever voluntarily undertake to proclaim <hi>Romes</hi> final deſolation in <hi>St. Peters Church</hi> in the year of Jubily? Or menace downfal to red Hats, and the triple Crown in the Conſiſtory? Yet all together ſuch, no eaſier was the task which <hi>Jeremy</hi> had enjoyned <hi>Baruch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was <hi>this Injunction</hi> then given him by way of <hi>Counſel,</hi> or neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept? Did he ſuper-erogate ought in undertaking? Or had he not grievouſly ſinned in refuſing this neceſſary (but hard and dangerous) ſervice? Surely a Neceſſity (not from the General Law, but from the particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the time) was laid upon him, and a Woe had followed it, if he had not read the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> Prophecie. The Scholar was not greater then <note place="margin">Things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rent, yea law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, by Circumſtances become unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> his Maſter, nor his liberty more; Both their liberties were alike great, yet both ſubordinate, both ſubject to the diverſitie of times and ſeaſons. Both were free in their perſons, both free in their actions, and choiſe of life: yet
<pb n="3651" facs="tcp:32220:184"/>
both abſolutely bound to walk as they were called.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Had not <hi>Jeremy</hi> as good authority as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and his fellow Prophets had, to have taken a Wife of the Daughters of his people? Doubtleſs the Law was one to Both, and Matrimony alike lawful to Both; <hi>What then</hi> did reſtrain <hi>Jeremy</hi> of that liberty, which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> uſed? Nothing but inſtant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie (which knows no Law) could make the uſe of the Law, unlawful to him; becauſe moſt unexpedient for the preſent. So the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Behold I will cauſe to ceaſe out of this place in your eyes, even in your dayes, the voice of mirth, and the voyce of gladneſs; the voyce of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and the voyce of the Bride.</hi> And ſeeing the Lord at this time had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to pipe unto this people; <hi>Ieremy</hi> had greatly offended, if he had been taken in their marriage Dances. He knew <hi>Children were an heritage, which cometh from the Lord; that the fruit of the womb was his reward; and that in the multitude of ſons was ſtore of blesſings;</hi> Marriage he knew to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable amongſt all, but at this time unſeaſonable for him. Good ſeed is well ſown when it is likely the Crop may ſtand, and proſper. He planteth well, that plants in hope to reap the fruits of his own Labours. But who ſowes wheat, unto the winter floods? or plants a vineyard for his fuel? why then ſhould <hi>Jeremy</hi> at this time become an Husband to beget Sons unto the ſword? Or take a Wife to bring forth Daughters to deſtruction? To this purpoſe the Lord had inhibited <hi>Jeremy</hi> in particular; (But <hi>the Reaſon of the inhibition in like times is perpetually General:) Yhou ſhalt not take thee a VVife, nor have Sons nor Daughters in this place, For thus ſaith the Lord concerning the Sons and concerning the Daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their Mothers, that bear them, and concerning their fathers that beget them in this Land. They ſhall die of grievous deathes and diſeaſes, they ſhall not be lamented; neither ſhall they be buried; but they ſhall be as dung upon the earth; and they ſhall be conſumed by the ſword, and by famine, and their carcaſes ſhall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beaſts of the earth, Ier.</hi> 16. 1. The Prophets and ſweet ſingers of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brought them ſuch joyful Ambaſſages of their eſpouſals unto their God: Their Princes and people, had formerly known ſuch happy dayes, of joy, ſecuritie, and peace, that for <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> to have then affected this rigid courſe of life, which now they follow, would have been but as the taking up of a ſad or doleful <hi>Madrigall</hi> at a marriage feaſt, or as the acting of ſome ominous direful Tragedy upon a Coronation day. But ſeeing the glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry is now departing from Iſrael, the Bridegroom leaving their coaſts, &amp; their mother, whom the Lord had once betrothed unto himſelf in ſureſt bonds of deareſt love, ſtands liable to the ſentence of final divorce; The Children of the Bride-chamber (ſpecially <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and <hi>Baruch)</hi> muſt betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to faſting, prayer, and mourning. <hi>Now</hi> to have uſed their wonted ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, mirth, or feaſting, would have been all one, as if the one had piped, the other had danced (a wanton Jigge or Corranto) in the Solemnities of their mothers Funerals; or as if they had marcht together in a moriſce-dance over their fathers Grave. <note place="margin">He means ſome man that had turned to the Church of Rome.</note>

7. Subordinate to thoſe general Precepts, <hi>[Do as ye would be done unto: Let every man walk as he is called:]</hi> are theſe disjunctive Precepts of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 15. <hi>Rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and weep with them that weep.</hi> Both theſe precepts are neceſſarie, both <hi>moſt neceſſary</hi> in their time, and place; neither neceſſary at all times and in all places, for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible. Hence ſaith <hi>Solomon Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>There is a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance;</hi> So then weeping and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mourning and dancing, are both in their ſeveral turns, or ſeaſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; but <hi>weeping and mourning moſt ſuitable to the occaſions of most times, and more expedient for moſt perſons.</hi> For <hi>it is better to go into the houſe of mourning, then into the houſe of Mirth.</hi> Men ſeldom mourn without juſt occaſions, and few men, but often have juſt occaſions to mourn: But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny laugh when they have juſt cauſe to lament; And to conſort with ſuch in this their follie, were extream impietie; eſpecially in ſuch as <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> were; in all that are <hi>Overſeers,</hi> or <hi>Watchmen</hi> over Gods flock; This made the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, Chap.</hi> 9. 1. to wiſh, <hi>O that mine head were full of water, and mine eyes fountains of tears, that I might weep day and night for the ſlain of the daughter of my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wiſhed <hi>Ieremy</hi> even whilſt Jeruſalem went mad in mirth and Jollity, whilſt her children were bold and audacious to hold on more then an <hi>ordinary Pace</hi> in their wonted courſes from evil to worſe; becauſe they were blind and ignorant, and would not ſee <hi>the day of their viſitation drawing on.</hi> To men therefore endued with reaſon (more eſpecially to Chriſtian men; amongſt them, moſt eſpecially to the Preacher and Paſtor, who have Chriſt Jeſus and the Prophets for their pattern) the Precept is all one; <hi>To mourn with them that mourn, and to mourn for them, whoſe Caſe is mournful,</hi> Though haply not ſo apprehended by them; ſuch as <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Caſe was, when our Saviour beheld it and wept, ſaying; <hi>O that thou hadſt known at the leaſt in this thy day, thoſe things, which belong unto thy peace, but now are they hid from thine eyes.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> the 19. 42. As alſo at this time, when this meſſage came to <hi>Baruch.</hi>

So natural is this precept of the Apoſtle; <hi>weep with them that weep;</hi> that even bruit beaſts, to whom God hath given neither ſpeech nor Language, nor underſtanding to perceive the words of the wiſe, or the exhortation of the eloquent, are yet ſo intelligent, ſo apprehenſive of the vocal ſignes or <note place="margin">Sympathie planted in Bruites.</note> ſignifications of grief uttered from others of their own kind; that they may well ſeem to bear the Emblem of <hi>St. Pauls</hi> Practiſe ingraven in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>Who is weak</hi> (ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 29.) <hi>and I am not weak? who is offended and I burn not?</hi> For what beaſt of the field ſhall groan and others of the ſame kind are not upon the hearing, like affected? which of them panteth for pain or want of breath; and others at this ſpectacle ſtand not amazed either bereft of all motion, or elſe tortured with like? He that Created all things, in number, weight, and due proportion, hath mutually framed their hearts to others groanes, and ſighes, as a ſtringed inſtrument to a <hi>voice Uniſon.</hi> So doubtleſs were our hearts ſet in our firſt Creation, All in juſt proportion to their maker; our voices were conſonant to his word, our affections conformable to his will, all Uniſons amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

Yet doth the mutual bond of our affections remain ſtill greater, then any bond amongſt beaſts; we have this conſort ſet out unto us in Gods written word; <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you even ſo do ye unto them;</hi> for this is the effect of Gods Law, each <note place="margin">

                  </note> part of which we are bound to obey; This is the ſum of the Prophets writings; each period whereof we are bound to believe. What muſick can be more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to a penſive heart; then to have others bear a full conſort with him in grief? Herein then, we do not only omit A <hi>Precept</hi> of Chriſt, but directly violate Gods eternal Law, yea the very <hi>Prime</hi> Fundamental Law of nature, in that we do not Sympathize with others, in ſuch ſort as we deſire they ſhould do with us in like diſtreſſe; in that we miniſter not comfort to others with as great alacritie, and delight, as we deſire to receive it from them. Nature teacheth, and Gods Law commands, <hi>to mourn with them that mourn;</hi> and the <hi>Neceſsitie</hi> of ſuch as mourn, and the true unpartial <hi>eſtimate of our own deſires</hi> of comfort in like Caſe, will give us the exact meaſure of our mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Our mourning is then truly harmonical, when it is for the <hi>Qualitie, ſincere,</hi> and for the <hi>Quantitie,</hi> rightly <hi>proportiond</hi> unto the preſent neceſſitie of times, places, or perſons. And on the contrary, <hi>then</hi> we walk (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeaks) with a heart and a heart, and uſe a deceitful ballance, when our hearts are open to receive comfort or benefit from others, and ſhut or ſtraitned, to return the like; or when we receive any of theſe from God or man with our whole heart, and either repay to the ſame parties from whom we had them, or diſtribute them to others, with a faint or fained heart, without <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>ſuch</hi> delight or joy in doing them good, as we take in having good done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. This <hi>Eternal Rule of Equitie</hi> was <hi>Tranſcendent,</hi> unto that <hi>particular ſtrict Command,</hi> ſo often inculcated to the Iſraelites when they came into the good Land of Promiſe: viz. <hi>Not to forget the ſtranger that lived amongſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The poſitive precept aimed at through this negative, as the <hi>End,</hi> or ſcope, was the <hi>Cheerful relief of the poor ſtranger;</hi> and the immediate <hi>Means</hi> unto this End, was alway to remember that they themſelves had been ſtrangers in the Land of Egypt; Now to remember <hi>that they themſelves had been ſtrangers</hi> is (in the language of the holy Spirit) <hi>ſtill to retain the perfect eſtimate of their former grief, whilſt they were ſtrangers:</hi> to be able continually to ſound the depth of their own miſery, that it might ſerve as a <hi>Key</hi> to tune their hearts in juſt and full conſort to the miſerable. They did then truely remember the ſtrangers, that were within their gates, when they ſorrowed in the ſame manner for them, as they had done for themſelves: when the delight and joy that they had taken in their own deliverance from ſervitude and thraldom, was made the meaſure of their delight, and joy, in freeing others from the yoke of ſervitude, in relieving the poor diſtreſſed ſtranger that ſojourned with them. <hi>True compaſsion is but a fellow feeling of others miſeries:</hi> And <hi>then only are we truly compaſsionate when their miſeries are made ours:</hi> when (as the Apoſtle ſaith) we are weakened at their weakneſs, and burn at their offence, or grievance. Once thus affected, in eaſing them, we eaſe our ſelves; their comfort becomes our comfort: whence ariſeth our cheerfulneſs and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in doing good; for now we do unto them as we deſire they ſhould do unto us: Yea, even as we would do unto our ſelves; ſeeing the only way to caſe our ſelves of this preſent grief, which is by <hi>Sympathie</hi> in us, is by curing the
<pb n="3655" facs="tcp:32220:186"/>
                  <hi>Protopathie</hi> in them. This is equitie and righteouſneſs in the ſight of God, when we afford comfort unto others, according to the ſame meaſure we our ſelves would receive it from others: or when we diſtribute Gods benefits with the like Joy to our fellow ſervants, as we receive them from him: <hi>Delight</hi> in receiving and delight in doing good, ought to be ſo fully reciprocal in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quantitie, that they ſhould differ but as <hi>via Thebis Athenas,</hi> and <hi>Athenis, Thebas;</hi> or as two times three, and three times two. This is (as the wiſe man ſpeaks) truly to <hi>keep the heart,</hi> when we keep it ſtill in this <hi>Aequilibrio,</hi> not more inclined to accept, then to afford a bleſſing; not more prone to rejoyce at our own good, then to ſorrow at others harms; Not more apt to be elevated with our own promotion, then to be depreſſed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers undeſerved dejection, or diſcomfort. And albeit we were able to frame the whole courſe of our lives fully parallel to this ſtreight Rule; yet ſhould we ſtill remain unprofitable ſervants and altogether unable to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogate. All actual, or purpoſed ſwerving whether directly or indirectly from this Level, is a declining to hypocriſie. He that cannot contract his ordinary libertie in the uſe of things pleaſant or profitable for this life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Exigence or Aboading of the inſtant ſeaſon, or doth not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſo to frame and ſettle the habitual bent of his affections, as they may be alike free and apt to be moved with ſad occurences, as with occaſions of joy: ſuch a man may happily often joy in his courſes, but his rejoycing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">☜</note> be in the Lord; his laughter is madneſs, his choiceſt recreation, folly; diſſimulation harboureth in his heart, miſchief is companion of his thoughts; the iſſue of his untimely mirth, is grief and ſorrow everlaſting.</p>

But here I know it will be replied, that this conſtitution of mind is in theſe latter times more rare, then abſolute Complexion in mens bodies, or mixture <hi>ad pondus</hi> in bodies natural. The Replication perhaps is true, but true eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for this reaſon, that every man <hi>ſeeks great things,</hi> greater then <hi>Baruch</hi> here did, for himſelf; And hearts ſtretched by deſires unſeaſonably ſuperfluous or exorbitant, to an higher ſtrain, then is fitting, can hold no conſort with their humbled brethrens <hi>affections;</hi> They can neither be brought to any true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonancie with the times wherein they live, nor with their own Callings.</p>
               <p>Howbeit we require not ſuch an exact or abſolute temper of mans heart as our Creator framed in our firſt Parents. That was the Patern, by which we muſt direct our practiſe; If our intention to imitate this patern, be ſincere; And our indeavors to accompliſh our intentions induſtrious and entire; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is wanting to our abilitie, The ſuper-excellencie of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and merits (far exceeding our firſt Parents worth) ſhall abundantly ſupplie in us, which were firſt the natural Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> then degenerate Sons of the living God, now regenerate by Grace, and adopted Sons in Chriſt. But the experience of others temper in former times (though <hi>Adams</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as now we are, or once were) bewrayes the Complexion of our Age to be deeply tainted with hypocriſie. For this I have found (and every one may find without curious ſearch) that the very ſight, remembrance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal of others miſeries united by the bond of Common dutie, hath brought the minds of ſuch, as have bent their ears to natures diſcipline, or been well inſtructed in Civilitie, unto a perfect <hi>ſympathie,</hi> with as great facilitie, as men tune their voices to others pleaſant ſongs, or faſhion their bodily motions to others muſick.</p>

               <p>Thus the freſh memory of the Camp, the conſideration of the Ark of God, and <hi>Iſraels</hi> and <hi>Joabs</hi> lying abroad in the fields, makes honeſt <hi>Uriah</hi> (joyned with them in the common link of military life; though far diſ-joyned in <note place="margin">Numb. 32. 6. 2 Sam. 11.</note> place) abjure with double oath the ſolace of his lawful bed.</p>

Is Baptiſme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his death but a naked name; that our profeſſed unitie therein cannot unite our hearts in like affections?

ſimilitudes of one head and many members, of one Vine and many branches, but Hyperbolical Metaphors? Is our myſtical union only a meer Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical imagination? are thoſe or the like Praerogatives of our calling, but like the Soloeciſms of the Romiſh Church, matters of meer title, or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, without realitie? Beloved in Chriſt! if either we actually were, or heartily deſired, or truly meant to be true branches of that Coeleſtial Vine; were it poſſible the ſtrongeſt boughes thereof ſhould be ſo often ſhaken, with dangerous blaſts of temptations; and we no whit therewith moved? could ſo many flouriſhing Boughes dayly fade, and we hope that our Luxuriant branches ſhould always flouriſh? ſhould their goodly leaves hourly fall, and we live ſtill as if we never looked for any winter? or ſhould God ſo often threaten to pluck up the vineyard, which his own right hand hath planted; and yet the dreſſers of it ſtill <hi>ſeek after great things, for themſelves,</hi> as if they never dreamt of diſpoſſeſſion? would the moſt of us either ſeek to raiſe our ſelves as high as the higheſt room in the Lords houſe; or make it a chief part of our care how to forecaſt miſpenſe of time in merriment, game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or other worldly pleaſures, or contentments, whilſt ſundry of our poor brethren, and fellow Prophets (perhaps in worth our betters) die of diſcontent; whilſt others younger run mad after riot abroad, leaſt they ſhould be attached by ſorrow and grief at home; whilſt other begin to expect a change, and entertain a liking of Romiſh Proffers.</p>
               <p>Others, which have ever hated Rome more then death, begin to loath their lives, and ſet their longing on the Grave; deſirous to give their bodies to be devoured by that earth, which hath not miniſtered neceſſary ſuſtenance to them; as being overcharged with maintaining the unneceſſary deſires and ſuperfluous pleaſures of worſe deſervers. Or would ſo many (were they true members of Chriſt) ſuffer that flock, which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his precious blood to ſtarve for want of ſpiritual Food: <hi>That</hi> flock, from which they have reap't carnal Commodities in greateſt plenty?</p>
               <p>But here I will not diſpute whether <hi>Non-Reſidence,</hi> or <hi>Pluralitie</hi> be ſimply unlawful: ſuppoſe in former times both had been lawful, both neceſſary, when the greateſt ſcarcitie was of <hi>Scholars</hi> ſufficiently qualified for the miniſtry.

It had been once more lawful for <hi>Baruch</hi> to have ſought the Eaſe of a retired life, then ever it was for any man to trouble himſelf with joyning houſe to houſe, Land to Land, or Church to Church. But <hi>now</hi> it is unlawful: <hi>ſeekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf?</hi> Yet what was <hi>his</hi> ſeeking to theirs? or what are many of their deſerts to his? Theirs eſpecially, who have ſcarce been ſo much as ſcribes to a learned Prophet, ſcarce ever brought up in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at any <hi>Gamaliels</hi> feet? but only came to this our <hi>Sion</hi> as ſo many ſpies, to find out the weakneſs of the place, to diſcover by what devices good Statutes might be fruſtrate, and means made for conferring degrees upon Drones.

After, unto their Titles in the Schools they have gotten an <hi>Ite Praedicate</hi> from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of our ſpiritual warfare, they make their entrance into the Church of Chriſt, juſt ſo, as if it were into the Enemies ſoyl: once inabled to compaſs a convenient Seat, they never think they were placed there as labourers in Chriſts harveſt, to gather and break the bread of life to his people; they only uſe it as a Fort or Sconce to gather ſtrength in, till they can watch an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for expugning a better.

               <p>Theſe beloved have been the abuſes in former times! which any Reverent, and zealous ſpirit that had lived amongſt us, juſtly might, and queſtionleſs would have taxt more ſharply: And yet of ſuch reproofes, the beſt of us might well in ſome meaſure have been ſharers.

For all of us (Beloved in our Lord and Saviour) ſee the dayes wherein we live are <hi>extraordinary evil,</hi> and the time muſt be redeemed by our extraordinary vigilancie, ſobriety and ſanctitie. As others double and treble the ſins of this preſent, in reſpect of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, ſo muſt we in like proportion increaſe our induſtry, and diligence, fervent prayer, good exhortation, charitable deeds and ſacred functions. Thus would you <hi>(Reverend Fathers)</hi> go before us in theſe duties, as you do in dignitie, God would reſtore your loſt ſons to you again; and beſides <hi>Jobs Reſtitution</hi> in this life, you ſhall certainly be partakers of <hi>Daniels Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> in the life to come.

                  <note place="margin">The Anſwer to the former Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> (we muſt conſider) was <hi>The Great Leader of Gods People,</hi> and could not but wiſh their Fall ſhould be under ſome other then himſelf.</p>
               <p>It was a <hi>Donative</hi> more magnificent, then the long reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that being ſlain in warre he ſhould go to his grave in peace. For this included his peoples preſent ſafety, whoſe extirpation had been till this time deferred for his ſake, though now at length, he muſt be taken out of the way, that the Meſſengers of Gods wrath, which could forbear no longer, may have a freer paſſage throughout the Land. No marvel if after thirtie one years raign in proſperitie and peace, he patiently ſuffered violent death, being thus graced with greater honour, then either <hi>Codrus,</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Athens,</hi> or the <hi>Roman Decius,</hi> purchaſed by voluntary ſacrificing themſelves for their people. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the plagues, which theſe men feared, might otherwiſe have been avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Or it may be, the fear it ſelf was but ſome vain deluſion of Satan, alwayes delighted with ſuch ſacrifices. But that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> ſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned before <hi>Ioſias</hi>'s birth, were ſo long reprieved &amp; ſo well intreated for his ſake, we have the great Judges Sentence for our warrant. And therefore the Word of <hi>The Lord</hi> which <hi>Huldah</hi> the Propheteſs had ſent, muſt needs ſeem good to him.</p>
               <p>It was a meſſage more unwelcome, then ſuch a death as <hi>Ioſias</hi> ſuffered, which <hi>Iſaias</hi> brought to his great Grand-father <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> lately delivered from the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and miraculouſly reſtored to life; but more forward to receive <hi>Preſents</hi> from <hi>Berodaſh</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> then to render praiſe and thankſgiving to his God, according to the <hi>Reward</hi> beſtowed upon him. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the dayes come</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaias) that all that is in thine houſe, and that which thy Fathers have laid up in ſtore unto this day, ſhall be carried unto</hi> Babylon: <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be left (ſaith the Lord.)

               <p>Doth he repine or mutter at this ungrateful Meſſage?</p>
               <p>No; But with great ſubmiſſion replies, <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord, which Thou haſt ſpoken.</hi> And he ſaid: <hi>Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my dayes? Iſaiah.</hi> 39. 8.</p>
               <p>Shall we hence collect that this Good King was of that wicked Tyrants mind, who, as he had ſhortened her dayes from whom he had beginning of life, ſo did he envie his <hi>Mother Nature</hi> ſhould ſurvive him; wiſhing the world might be diſſolved at his death, and that <hi>Old Chaos</hi> might be his Tomb?</p>

               <p>This was he, of whom not the people only, but <hi>the</hi> Prophet hath ſaid: <hi>Under his ſhadow we ſhall be ſafe:</hi> As he was a ſhadow (without queſtion) of <hi>that Great Shepheard,</hi> which was to be ſmitten ere the flock were ſcattered; upon the occaſion of whoſe death, his Diſciples likewiſe ſaid, <hi>We truſted it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.</hi> And for <hi>Joſias</hi> to become the true <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 30. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 21, 24.</note> ſhadow, or the bloody picture of that <hi>Great Shepheards death,</hi> was a greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then if the ſhadow in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz</hi> had returned backward ten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in token of prolonging his dayes as long as <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s had been: ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we conſider, that the Saying fulfilled in the Great Prophet, was verified in him: <hi>Of them, which thou gaveſt me, have I loſt none:</hi> Though he were ſlain, yet his Army returned home ſafe, and he went to his grave in peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buried in his own Sepulcher by his Servants.</p>

And elſewhere: <hi>O Hieruſalem, Hieruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee; how often would</hi> I <hi>have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not? Matth.</hi> 23. 37. If Chriſt Jeſus as truly God as man, did thus thirſt after <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> peace, after <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> thus glutted with the Prophets blood, did thirſt moſt eagerly after his; farre be it from us to think his loving kindneſs is utterly eſtranged from us, albeit our ſins have made a great ſeparation betwixt him and us. <hi>Let us not then trifle out the time with Curious Diſputes concerning the manner of his Decree,</hi> but rather ſeek him with all ſpeed and diligence whileſt he may be found; laying ſure hold on his mercie, <hi>before the ſwift approach of his iudgements</hi> (violently haled down each day more than other, by the grievous weight of our ſins) <hi>remove it</hi> without the reach of Ordinary Repentance.</p>

13. It is a truth moſt delightful and comfortable to Contemplate; That, <hi>The Immenſitie of our God is as full of mercy and compaſsion, as the Sea is of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the body of the Sun of light.</hi> But let us withall conſider, That the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant his loving kindneſs towards us, the more ſweet and fragrant his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations have been; the more grievouſly have we provoked his fierce wrath and indignation by our continual wilful refuſal to be gathered under the ſhadow of his wings daily ſtretcht out in mercy for our ſafety. Be we ſure God knows his own, as well as we do ours, and will not be over-reached by us. The lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger we deferre the renewing of his wonted favours, the dearer we muſt account it will coſt us; our ſuit at death will be more difficult. Thoſe prayers, thoſe <note place="margin">☜</note> tears, thoſe ſighs, or other attendants or concomitants of true repentance, which in times paſt would have gone for currant, will hereafter be eſteemed light or counterfeit.</p>
               <p>And yet, alas!

Or poures forth ſuch fervent prayers and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto his God, as our Predeceſſors have done upon leſſe ſignification of his diſpleaſure, and fewer fore-warnings of his judgements, then we have had continually theſe divers years paſt? Yea who is he amongſt all the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> that with <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> hath utterly diſavowed all care or ſtudy of his own advancement or contentment, that he may entirely conſecrate his ſoul, his thoughts, and beſt imployments to his Maſters will, to take away the precious from the vile, to be as Gods mouth, to cauſe others to conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, not to conform himſelf to them? To ſet himſelf as a wall of braſs for this rebellious people to fight againſt; whilſt he thunders out Gods judgments againſt great and ſmall without all reſpect of perſons? Nay doth not Nobility, Gentry and Commonalty, Clergy and Laity, yea, I dare ſay it, as well <hi>ſingula generum,</hi> as <hi>genera ſingulorum,</hi> ſo mightily ſet their minds on great matters, and ſo ſtretch their inventions, either for getting more, or for improving what they have gotten to the utmoſt value, as if we would give God and men to underſtand, that we had no inheritance in that <hi>Good Land,</hi> wherein <hi>The Lord</hi> placed our Fathers, <hi>But only a ſhort Remainder of an expiring Eſtate,</hi> which we deſpere to renew: or, as if we would have it proclaimed in <hi>Gath,</hi> or publiſhed in <hi>Askalon,</hi> that the fear of them is already fallen upon the natural Inhabitants of this Land; now labouring only to prevent them in gathering up the preſent commodities, or to defeat them of their expected ſpoil. We demean our ſelves, juſt as the manner is, when Enemies more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then can ſafely be forthwith entertained with battel, invade the borders of any Nation: In ſuch a Caſe tis held a point of politick husbandry to <note place="margin">I ſuppoſe he means <hi>His Treatiſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies</hi> or divine Fore-warnings, betokening Blood, which was loſt in his life time, and cannot yet be found.</note> waſte the Country round about them, leaſt it might maintain their Armies.

               <p n="14">14. My meſſage unto you <hi>my Brethren the Sons of Levi,</hi> is briefly this: Add not Gods anger to our Countries Curſe, which at this day, whether juſt or no, is bitter and rife againſt us; as if we were all or moſt of us like the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Joſedech,</hi> perſons <hi>Prodigious,</hi> but in a worſe ſenſe then they were; Perſons, that had procured her, much, and did yet portend her, greater ſorrow; partly by our Daſtardly ſilence in good cauſes, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially by our propheſying for Rewards, and humoring the great Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of thoſe dignities, on which our unſatiable deſires are now unſeaſonably ſet.</p>
               <p>

It was <hi>a ſaying</hi> amongſt the Ancient <hi>Romans; Qui Beneficium accipit, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem vendit.</hi> It is thus far improved in true <hi>modern Engliſh;</hi> He that will purchaſe preferments (Eccleſiaſtick eſpecially) muſt adventure to lay his ſoul to pawn. What remedie? Only this, to make a virtue of neceſſitie. For ſo muſt every one do that means to live as a Chriſtian ought. Let us not look ſo much upon the ſiniſter intentions of corrupt minds, as upon the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of our God, even in mens moſt wicked projects.</p>
               <p>And who knowes whether <hi>The Lord</hi> by acquainting us with mens bad dealings in diſpenſing Eccleſiaſtical honour, do not lay the ſame reſtraint upon us his children, which he did upon <hi>Baruch?</hi> Without all queſtion, he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely forbids us to ſeek afer <hi>great matters</hi> in this age, in that he hath cut off all hopes of attaining them by means lawfull and honeſt: And all this he doth for our good, that uſing <hi>Baruchs</hi> freedom, or <hi>Jeremies</hi> Reſolution in our ambaſſage, we may be partakers of their <hi>Priviledge</hi> in the <hi>Great day of viſitation;</hi> wherein, ſuch as in the mean time cruſh, and keep us under by their greatneſs, will be ready to give their wealth for our poverty, and change their honor for our diſgrace, upon condition they might but enjoy life with ſuch libertie and contentments as we do. Or, in Caſe they ſhorten our dayes by vexation or oppreſſion; yet faithfully diſcharging our duties, <hi>whether we live or die, we are the Lords.</hi> And though they out live us an hundred years, yet ſhall they be willing to give a thouſand, yea ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lives, if ſo many they had, ſo they might be but like us for one hour in the day of death. We need not ſearch forain <hi>Chronicles,</hi> nor look far back into ancient <hi>Annales;</hi> The regiſters of our own memories, and our fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations may afford examples of ſome ſons of <hi>Levi,</hi> men, if we rightly value their admirable worth, of place and fortunes mean in reſpect of our ſelves; which after their death (haſtned perhaps by hard uſage) have fild both this and forrain Lands with their good name, as with a perfume ſweet and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the noſtrils of God and man, whilſt thoſe great lights of ſtate (ſo they ſeemed, whilſt paraſitical breath did blaze their fame) which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them to privacie and obſcuritie, were ſuddenly put out but with an everlaſting Stinch. God grant their ſucceſſors better ſucceſſe, that a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious well deſerved fame may long ſurvive them.</p>
               <p>For our ſelves (Beloved) as we all conſort in earneſt deſires and hearty prayers, that the Lord would renew his <hi>Covenant made with Levi, his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life and peace;</hi> ſo let us joyn hearts in this meditation: The only way to derive this bleſſing from this our father unto us his ſons, muſt be by arraying our ſelves with <hi>Phineas</hi> our eldeſt brothers integritie, by putting on his zeal and courage, to walk with the Lord our God in peace, and equitie, and to turn many away from iniquitie. And now <hi>remember them, O my God, that defile their Prieſthood, and break the Covenant of the Prieſthood, and of Levi:</hi> Smite them through their loyns that make a prey of his poſſeſſions; and grinde their heads, as thou didſt <hi>Abimelechs</hi> with broken milſtones from the wals, or with the reliques from the ruinated houſes; yea grinde all their heads, O Lord, to powder, that grinde the faces of his poor and needy children. But peace be upon all ſuch as walk according to this Rule here ſet to <hi>Baruch,</hi> and upon all thoſe that Love God. <hi>To this God, The Father, The Son, and the holy Ghoſt, be aſcribed all honour and glory now and ever.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. It is not my purpoſe now to enter a long Diſpute with the <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> or other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> which may ſeem to have help from this Text to oppoſe Judges and Magiſtrates; Being aſſured, that the Apoſtle who ſo warrants and eſtabliſhes <hi>Power, exerciſed by heathens over Chriſtians,</hi> in the thirteenth Chapter, doth not intend, the leaſt, to diſparage <hi>it</hi> here. It will be Task ſufficient for me to give the <hi>True Extent</hi> and <hi>Limitation</hi> of the Text; which ſays, <hi>That every one that judgeth another is without Excuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The very <hi>Firſt Word</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> you ſee, doth bear the Stamp or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter <note place="margin">The Text is A Concluſion.</note> of <hi>A Concluſion:</hi> Therefore <hi>art thou inexcuſable O man.</hi> Now, every <hi>Concluſion</hi> is a <hi>Propoſition;</hi> though every <hi>Propoſition</hi> be not a <hi>Concluſion.</hi> For, <hi>Every Concluſion is a Propoſition inferred from ſome one or more Propoſitions more clear;</hi> Or, <hi>From which being granted, It will neceſſarily follow.</hi> The firſt Queſtion is, from what <hi>Premiſſes</hi> this <hi>Concluſion</hi> in my Text is inferred. If <note place="margin">Q.

                  <pb n="3679" facs="tcp:32220:198"/>
                  <hi>The Concluſion is oft-times prefixed to the Premiſſes or Propoſitions whence it is inferred.</hi> And thus it is in this Text. To draw our Apoſtles meaning into Logical or School-Form, We muſt place his Propoſitions, Thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſoever doth the ſame things, for which he judgeth another, is without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> (and doth condemn himſelf by judging them.)</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Every one that judgeth others doth the ſame things for which he judgeth them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>Every one that judgeth is without excuſe,</hi> (and doth condemn himſelf by Judging them.)</p>
               <p>It were a Method breif and plain: Firſt, to ſhew the Truth of the <hi>Major.</hi> Secondly, the Validity of the <hi>Minor.</hi> But I muſt, according to my intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given, firſt ſpeak Of <hi>The True Extent and right Limitation</hi> of the <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Concluſion you ſee is Univerſal: <hi>[Every one, whoſoever he be, that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> 
                  <hi>Iudgeth is without Excuſe,</hi> Plea, or Apologie.] But may we hence inferre, that all ſuch as exerciſe Judicature, whether Eccleſiaſtick or Civil are inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Or that the Magiſtracie eſtabliſhed in moſt Chriſtian Kingdoms is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, as queſtionleſs it is, if all ſuch as exerciſe Judicature be inexcuſable? No: To teach this were a kind of Hereſie. The Apoſtles Concluſion then muſt be thus farre <hi>Limited,</hi> in Reference to the Parties judging. <hi>It doth not involve or include All that Iudge others, but ſuch as take upon them to judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being not lawfully thereunto called.</hi> The Judgment, which men <hi>lawfully called</hi> do Adminiſter, is not theirs but the Lords, and ſo far as they exerciſe his Judgment, either in matters Civil or Eccleſiaſtick, they are worthy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, no way liable to this Cenſure <hi>of ſuch as iudge others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor muſt this Concluſion be extended to Facts or Actions ſubject to the External Judicature of Courts; In reſpect of <hi>ſuch,</hi> an unrighteous man (ſo he be a Judge <hi>lawfully called</hi> and conſtituted) may give righteous judgment; and whilſt he does <hi>ſo,</hi> he ſhall not be condemned for judging another who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves judgment <hi>In Foro Exteriore;</hi> yet will God judge him for not judging himſelf <hi>In Foro Interiore</hi> (in caſe he be guilty of ſuch ſins as he judges others for, and judgeth not himſelf) whilſt he judges other mens miſdemeanors. For a man may be free from Human or Poſitive Lawes, and yet be a more grievous Tranſgreſſor of the Law Moral, or of the Law of Nature, then they are whom he condemns to Death, and that deſervedly, for tranſgreſſing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane poſitive Laws: And ſuch an One is highly obliged to judge himſelf, That ſo he may, by Gods Mercie, eſcape the judgment of God.</p>
               <p>But, though this Concluſion do not involve <hi>lawful</hi> Magiſtrates moving <hi>in their own ſphere:</hi> yet doth it lay hold upon and include them alſo, <hi>if they ſhall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Extent of the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, it is not ſimply, <hi>Every one that judgeth;</hi> But every one which does the ſame things which he condemns in another, <hi>that is inexcuſable</hi> or without Plea. So the Apoſtle in the words following ſeemeth to <hi>limit</hi> his <note place="margin">Another Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</note> Concluſion, <hi>For wherein thou judgeſt another thou condemneſt thy ſelf, for thou that judgeſt doeſt the ſame things.</hi> Now he that doth the ſame things which he condemneth in another, is <hi>properly</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Without Apologie,</hi> Excuſe or Plea. He that once grants the <hi>Premiſſes</hi> (or two firſt Propoſitions in a Syllogiſm) is by the Law of Diſputation, preſumed to grant the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.
<pb n="3680" facs="tcp:32220:199"/>
The Law of Reaſon will admit no <hi>Negative Plea.</hi> Much more doth he, which pronounceth Sentence againſt another, conclude himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Sentence, by doing the ſame or like Fact which he condemneth in others. The Sentence which he pronounceth upon any other in this Caſe is more then a Premiſs or Antecedent, a Precedent or <hi>Ruled Caſe</hi> to his own Conviction or condemnation. Now as to make a man grant any Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which he is willing to deny or conceal, there is no way ſo expedite, as to preſs the Premiſſes upon him, from which it neceſſarily follows: ſo to bring a man to condemn or judge himſelf, for any fault or error committed by him, there is no means ſo available, as to let him ſee how he hath judged or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſome others for the ſame or like Fault. <hi>Every Sentence or judgment</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>which a man makes againſt himſelf, is a Concluſion, and for the moſt part a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which no man is willing to grant, unleſs he be by this means drawn unto it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had that Prophet, of whom we read, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 35. delivered his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage (from the Lord) unto King <hi>Ahab,</hi> (without any Premiſſes or Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) <note place="margin">Two Inſtances (in <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>David)</hi> who by judging others did condemn themſelves.</note> in theſe or like plain Terms, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt ſuffered</hi> Benhadad <hi>King of</hi> Syria, <hi>to ſcape out of thine hands, he ſhall do to thee, as thou ſhouldſt have done to him; Ahab</hi> would have put him to his Apologie, or rather have left him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable for medling in affairs of State. But the ſame Spirit of God which gave him knowledge of <hi>Ahabs</hi> tranſgreſsion, and Reſolution to tax or cenſure him for it, did likewiſe teach him <hi>The Art of Diſcretion,</hi> for the manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering his meſſage, and for the clearer Conviction of this <hi>Unruly King:</hi> He <hi>firſt</hi> diſguiſed himſelf with Aſhes upon his face, leſt the King by his habit ſhould diſcern him to be a Prophet: And making <hi>Ahab</hi> no partie, He propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Caſe as his <hi>own</hi> or as the Caſe of ſome inferior man or common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, <hi>He cried unto the King and ſaid, Thy ſervant went out into the midſt of the battel, and behold a man turned aſide and brought a man unto me and ſaid, keep this man, if by any means he be miſsing, then ſhall thy life be for his life, or elſe thou ſhalt pay a talent of ſilver; and as thy ſervant was buſie here and there, he was gone.</hi> Here is the Caſe, or <hi>Species Facti;</hi> The Kings Sentence upon it is more breif, ver. 40. <hi>So ſhall thy judgment be; Thy ſelf hath decided it.</hi> And the King having granted theſe Premiſſes, the Prophet knew it was too late for him to deny the Concluſion, which he immediately preſſeth upon him, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou haſt let go out of thy hands a man whom I appointed to utter deſtruction, therefore thy life ſhall go for his life, and thy people for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and,</hi> upon this Conviction, <hi>the King of Iſrael went to his houſe heavy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the Prophet told the King the ſame Truth directly and bluntly, it might perhaps have diſpleaſed him more, but it could not have made him ſo heavy as now he was; for his diſpleaſure would have found a Vent, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in rage and fury againſt the Prophet. But being thus left without Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy or excuſe, (by condemning another for a leſs fault (if it had been true) then he himſelf had really committed) his diſpleaſure or rage was ſwallowed up in ſilent heavineſs of heart.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Ahab</hi> upon this Conviction had been as ready to judge himſelf by humble Confeſsion of his fault which he could not deny, as he was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the diſguized Prophet for a farre leſs, He might have eſcaped the judgment of the Lord which was here threatned, and did afterwards befall him.</p>
               <p>By the like Sacred Art or cunning, the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> brought King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> unwittingly to condemn himſelf by judging the rich man, which (as the
<pb n="3681" facs="tcp:32220:199"/>
Prophet feigned) had taken away his poor Neighbors Lamb, for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his gueſts.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>Nathan</hi> immediately and directly told this, otherwiſe Good King, as afterwards upon this premiſed Parable he did; <hi>Wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his ſight? thou haſt killed</hi> Uriah <hi>the</hi> Hittite <hi>with the Sword, and haſt taken his Wife to be thy VVife, and haſt ſlain him with the Sword of the Children of</hi> Ammon; the Kings anger, which was greatly kindled againſt the ſuppoſed Rich man, which had wronged his poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, would have kindled more fiercely againſt <hi>Nathan;</hi> But now that his anger againſt this ſuppoſed Rich man, was ſo truly and really kindled as it burſt forth into this Sentence denounced by ſolemn oath, <hi>As the Lord liveth, The man that hath done this thing ſhall ſurely die.</hi> The blow which he thus fiercely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt a ſhadow, doth wound himſelf at the Rebound; for when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> upon the former Premiſſes makes this Concluſion, <hi>Thou art the man, Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. He left him altogether without Plea or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, as ſtanding condemned by his own judgment upon another. And though the Prophet brought him unwittingly to condemn himſelf; yet after his Conviction he willingly acknowledged his fault; and ſo by judging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf eſcaped the judgment of the Lord, in part at leaſt, though not wholly.</p>
               <p>The Facts for which theſe Two Kings did judge theſe imaginary or feigned Perſons, were not ſo hainous or ſo palpable (if they had been true) as were the Real Tranſgreſsions, of which the Prophets did clearly convince themſelves. And whoſoever doth the ſelf-ſame Facts, or Facts worſe then thoſe, for which he judgeth another, is altogether Inexcuſable, and ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by his own Conſcience, condemned by his own mouth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But, albeit This <hi>Major</hi> or Univerſal Propoſition be unqueſtionably true <hi>[VVhoſoever doth the ſame things, for which he judgeth another, doth condemn himſelf; becauſe the doing of the ſame Fact, doth neceſſarily draw the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which he paſſeth upon others, upon himſelf;]</hi> Yet all this, how Univerſally how Unqueſtionably true it be, doth not, to my apprehenſion, make up the Full meaning of this Propoſition, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; The Full Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the Original I take to be this; <hi>Every one that is apt to Iudge or Cenſure others is without Apologie, without Excuſe.</hi> The word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal (rendred by <hi>Mr. Calvin, qui Iudicas;</hi> and in our Engliſh, <hi>thou that Judgeſt)</hi> is a Participle, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now the Hebrew Participles (as every one that hath any inſight in that Dialect will obſerve;) <hi>do more properly denote the Habits or cuſtom, then the tranſient Acts, and are of the ſame value with the Latine Verbals.</hi> So the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now as a man may <hi>appetere vinum</hi> and yet not be <hi>appetens vini,</hi> ſo may he ſometimes judge or cenſure another, and yet not be <hi>A Judge</hi> or <hi>Cenſurer</hi> of others, for that notes <hi>the Habit</hi> or Cuſtom, not the <hi>Act</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>Now every one that taketh upon him the <hi>Habit</hi> or Cuſtom of cenſuring others, is without Apologie or <hi>Inexcuſable,</hi> not only in that he takes upon him that Judicature, which God hath not appointed him to exerciſe; but, <hi>Becauſe</hi>
                  <pb n="3682" facs="tcp:32220:200"/>
                  <hi>it is impoſsible for any man much accuſtomed to judge or cenſure others not to do the ſame things, which he Condemnes in others:</hi> (which was the effect and ſenſe of the <hi>Minor Propoſition.)</hi> For, as St. <hi>James</hi> tels us (not excluding him <note place="margin">The <hi>Minor</hi> of the foregoing <hi>Syllogiſm.</hi>
                  </note> ſelf, who queſtionleſs was one of the beſt men then living,) <hi>in many things we all offend.</hi> And if we offend <hi>in many things</hi> and accuſtom or uſe our ſelves to cenſure <hi>many,</hi> or to paſs our ſentence upon <hi>moſt things</hi> which we ſee amiſs, we cannot poſſibly avoid the condemning of our ſelves, becauſe we cannot poſſibly avoid ſome one or other of thoſe faults, which we cenſure or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in others.</p>
               <p>Again; As it is not every <hi>Matter</hi> for which a man may in <hi>any ſort</hi> be judged (as for natural parts, or buſineſſes of Art, ſuppoſe, unartificially done) ſo neither is it <hi>every kind of judging</hi> or cenſuring which is here meant.

He ſaith in his heart, as the Phariſee did; <hi>I thank God I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican.</hi> The <hi>Phariſee</hi> had taken notice of ſome good <hi>Evidences</hi> or qualities in himſelf, of which he ſaw a want in the <hi>Publican:</hi> and of ſome ill conditions in the <hi>Publican</hi> from which he thought himſelf free in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; <hi>Et ſic ad pauca reſpiciens facilè pronunciat.</hi> This is the ordinarie ground of raſh and uncharitable judgement when men compare their own Good parts with others Bad.</p>

                  </gap> a little further: beſides the <hi>Multiplicitie of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring,</hi> or proneneſs to judge others, <hi>It imports a kinde of Uſurped authority over others.</hi> For whoſoever takes upon him <gap reason="foreign">

Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he would not judge but rather pitty him or pray for him, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf leſt he fall into the like temptation. No man is fit to judge or cenſure another, but he that is able to correct or reform that fault or Error for which he judgeth him. Now <hi>the fervent zeal of correcting or Reforming Abuſes moſt groſſe and palpable, uſally miſleades men not well inſtructed in the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>wayes of God, into worſe errors then thoſe are which they ſeek to Reform in others.</hi> He that will take upon him to be a Reformer of others, muſt firſt be throughly reformed himſelf, muſt be <hi>renued</hi> (as the Apoſtles ſpeakes) <hi>in the ſpirit of his minde,</hi> enabled by <hi>The ſpirit of God,</hi> and by the <hi>knowledge</hi> of his <hi>Providence</hi> to ſee a far off as well as neer at hand; and to forecaſt the inconveniences which may follow long after, as well as to diſcern miſchiefes preſent, or their redreſs.</p>
               <p>And, When our Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Thou that judgeſt another doeſt the ſame things;</hi> His meaning is not, that he doth alwayes the ſame things, <hi>Quoad ſpeciem,</hi> as we ſay <hi>in kind;</hi> or the <hi>ſame</hi> things for outward ſemblance; but oft-times the <hi>ſame things by Equivalencie,</hi> things of the like value or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. And after this manner, Two men may do the <hi>ſame</hi> things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the things done by the one, be quite contrary to the things done by the other. Every <hi>Oppoſition to error is not a Truth;</hi> For, Two Contrary Propoſitions, (as Logicians obſerve) may be alike falſe. And ſo may the <hi>Reformation</hi> of groſſeſt <hi>Errors,</hi> whether in matter of <hi>Manners</hi> or <hi>Opinions</hi> be altogether as bad as the Errors or Abuſes which they ſeek to <hi>Reform,</hi> if they
<pb n="3683" facs="tcp:32220:200"/>
alwayes ſeek the cure of the diſeaſe by contraries. <hi>In maters of Fact</hi> or <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> that <hi>ſaying</hi> of the <hi>Poet</hi> is moſt True;</p>
               <q>Dum vitant ſtulti vitia, in contraria currunt.</q>
               <p>Whilſt unwiſe men ſeek to avoid one vice they run into a contrary vice. And in matter of <hi>Opinion</hi> or ſpeculation That <hi>Saying</hi> of the ſame <hi>Poet</hi> hath been often ratified by woful Experience;</p>
               <q>In vitium ducit culpae fuga, ſi caret arte.</q>
               <p>The eſchewing of one error is the high way to another, if it be done by haſtie inconſiderate flight and not according to the Art and Rules of A <hi>Sober Retreat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of what is ſaid <hi>before,</hi> is plain from the Apoſtles Inſtances, <hi>v.</hi> 21. 22. <hi>Thou that teacheſt, a man ſhould not ſteal; doeſt thou ſteal?</hi> This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a committing of the <hi>ſame</hi> ſin in kinde, for which he judged another. But when he ſaith, <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, committeſt Thou ſacrilege?</hi> This cannot be meant of commiting <hi>the ſame ſin in kinde,</hi> but only by Equivalency; For Idolatry and Sacrilege are contrary; The one is the fruit of ſuperſtitious zeal or blinde devotion; The other of Atheiſm. But as diverſe other <hi>Contraries,</hi> ſo theſe Two agree too well in <hi>One General,</hi> that is, <hi>in robbing God of his honor.</hi> And for this Reaſon, As often as any Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons (ſuppoſe the Jews) which robbed God in his tithes and offerings, did judge or cenſure the heathen for Idolatry, they did condemn themſelves; for they did <hi>the ſame</hi> or worſe. And it is <hi>Generally True,</hi> That <hi>none are ſo rigid Judgers, cenſurers, or Reformers of others, as thoſe that are tainted with the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>contrary Crime or Fault.</hi> And no marvell, ſeeing the unwiſer ſort of men (which are the far greater part) know no other way how to eſchew one vice but by running into the contrary. Like that Lunatick child in the Goſpel, ſometimes falling into the water, and then ſoon after, into the fire, which was a miſerable cure of the harm received in the water: Not much better is the <hi>Reformation</hi> which many in our dayes ſeek to make in themſelves or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Some, whoſe <hi>Zeal,</hi> in youth had outrun their diſcretion, have changed that temper into Retchleſs profaneneſs. Others from a diſſolute riotous courſe of life have been transformed into fierie zealots or Seditious Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In <hi>matters ſpiritual</hi> (whether concerning <hi>Manners</hi> or <hi>Opinion)</hi> The <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man</hi> is no better, no wiſer, than a natural fool in matters Civil. And many which are in part <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> that is, well reformed in Chriſtian Life and manners, are but <hi>Punies</hi> or <hi>Novices</hi> in matters of <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> or of ſmall inſight in the <hi>Sacred Art of Reforming others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in War or battel the ſtrength or courage of the common Souldiers is not ſufficient unleſs they have skilful and well experienced Commanders to direct their obedience: So for the <hi>Reformation</hi> of groſs abuſes or palpable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours in Church and Common-weal, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the beſt gifts of Art and learning, (which for the moſt part are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident but in a few) are no leſs requiſite then Sanctitie and integritie of Life in the multitude that are to be governed and directed by them. To give you then <hi>the Aime and ſcope of our Apoſtle in this Chapter,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> which lived in his time, or in the times betwixt the building of the ſecond Temple and our Saviours death, did take upon them to judge their fathers which had
<pb n="3684" facs="tcp:32220:201"/>
lived before the deſtruction of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, for tranſgreſſing the Law of God: and yet by judging them moſt deſervedly, did more manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelves. For they did <hi>the ſelf-ſame things,</hi> though not <hi>in kind</hi> or in particular, yet <hi>the ſelf-ſame by Equivalencie.</hi> And it is, if not <hi>the only,</hi> or whole, yet the <hi>principal part</hi> of our Apoſtles intention in this Chapter, to prove, <hi>That even the moſt zealous Reformers of Religion amongſt the Iews did the very ſame things which they ſo mightily condemned in the Heathen, or in ſuch as were parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with the Heathens in their idolatrous ſervices;</hi> as you may gather from the ſeventeenth verſe unto the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>The truth of his <hi>General Concluſion</hi> will appear, if we firſt ſhew, How theſe later Jews did condemn themſelves by judging their Fore-fathers; or, that they did the ſelf-ſame things or worſe.</p>
               <p>That theſe did judge their Fathers, as we ſay, <hi>Authoritativè,</hi> their own ſpeeches recorded by our Saviour will plainly witneſs. <hi>If we had been</hi> (ſay they) <hi>in the dayes of our Fathers, we would not have been parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with them in the blood of the Prophets, Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 29. That they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did <hi>the ſame things,</hi> which they condemned in their Fathers, <hi>Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Verdict</hi> upon their hypocriſie in thus ſaying, puts out of Queſtion. <hi>Fill ye up then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the meaſure of your Fathers; ye Serpents! ye generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vipers! how can ye eſcape the damnation of Hell?</hi> He did not command or impel them to fill up the meaſure of their fathers iniquitie, but onely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that they were deſperately ſet <hi>to fill it up</hi> unto the brim. Now they could not <hi>fill it up,</hi> but by doing <hi>the ſame things,</hi> or worſe, then their Fathers had done.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But wherein did their Hypocriſie conſiſt? In pretending one thing <note place="margin">See Book 4. or juſtifying Faith <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> outwardly to the eyes or eares of men, and concealing another ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in their hearts? Did they thus ſpeak only <hi>Ad faciendum populum,</hi> to gain applauſe amongſt the people? Did they ſay otherwiſe then in Conſcience they were perſwaded was true? when they ſaid, <hi>If we had lived in the dayes of our Fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No! To have ſpoken thus, and not to have thought ſo, had been groſs prophaneſs, a branch of Atheiſm or Infidelitie; whereas thoſe men, whom <hi>Our Saviour</hi> thus taxes, were Scribes and Phariſees, and their hypocriſie was Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical.</p>
               <p>Now Phariſaical hypocriſie, or <hi>The Leaven of Phariſees,</hi> hath alwayes <hi>ſome ground of Truth,</hi> and <hi>a great meaſure of zeal</hi> (but of zeal without knowledge or diſcretion) to maintain that which it takes for truth, for its Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. <note place="margin">The compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Hypocriſie Phariſaical.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe Phariſees (which thus ſpake, as Truth it ſelf relates of them) had this ground of truth for their perſwaſion, That if the Prophets and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had lived in their dayes, they knew themſelves ſo free from thoſe groſs abuſes which their Fathers committed, that they would have taken part with the Prophets againſt their Fathers: They had the Teſtimony of their own Conſciences, that they would rather have died themſelves then have conſent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed to the ſhedding of the Prophets blood upon the ſame <hi>Motives</hi> or Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which drew their Fathers to ſhed it.</p>
               <p>How then did they make up the meaſure of their Fathers iniquity? or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their ſin in ſhedding the Prophets or other innocent bloud? By their diſtempered zeal to maintain their <hi>Rigid Reformation</hi> of the moſt groſs and palpable abuſes, which their Fathers had committed, and for which eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they had been plagued by God. The diſeaſes themſelves they knew
<pb n="3685" facs="tcp:32220:201"/>
(by Gods heavy hand upon their Fathers) to be moſt dangerous; and whilſt they ſeek to cure the ſame diſeaſes or prevent like plagues by practiſes quite contrary to the practiſes of their Fathers, they ſecretly nurſe more greivous diſeaſes, and bring more greivous plagues upon themſelves and upon their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Two ſpecial Sins</hi> for which their Fathers had been plagued, and which <note place="margin">Two ſpecial ſins of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jews.</note> did include the moſt groſs, and moſt palpable breach of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can be imagined, were <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and open <hi>violation of the Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were ſins not only groſs and palpable in themſelves, but <hi>ſins Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent,</hi> ſuch as did open a wide gap or ſluce unto other ſins, as well againſt the firſt as the ſecond Table: Sins wherein they did moſt properly partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate with the Heathens and Infidels. Their Idolatry exceeded the height of heatheniſh ſuperſtition; and Sabbath breach was the root of more then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh prophaneneſs.</p>
               <p>Now that the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> as well thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi> as of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably plagued for their Idolatry, as for a grand or capital tranſgreſſion, all men know that read the Scripture. That they were likewiſe plagued in particular for the prophanation of the Sabbath; we may gather from <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> Chap. 13. 17. 18. <hi>Then I contended with the Nobles of</hi> Judah, <hi>and ſaid unto them; What evil thing is this which ye do, and prophane the Sabbath day? Did not your Fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this City? yet ye bring more wrath upon Iſrael, by prophaning the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Fathers had been ſo deeply tainted with this peſtilent diſeaſe, that their poſteritie were not cleanſed from it, by ſeventy years captivity in the Land of <hi>Caldea,</hi> but it breaks forth again immediately upon their return unto the City and Land of their Fathers, which in their abſence had enjoyed its Sabbaths, for it had layen for the moſt part waſte and untilled.</p>
               <p>As theſe two ſins of Idolatry and Prophanation were moſt groſs, ſo this peoples delight in them before this Captivity was great, and the more they delighted in them, the more impatient they were of reproof; and the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient they were of reproof, the more ſtill they were inraged againſt Gods Prophets, that did tax their perſons or oppoſe their practiſes.</p>
               <p>Now as their plagues for theſe tranſgreſſions had been greivous, ſo their poſteritie, after <hi>Nehemiah</hi> his time, were more zealous and ſevere in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Idolatry, and breach of Sabbath, then of any other tranſgreſsions. So ſtrictly did they, in after times, obſerve the Sabbath, that they made a Conſcience of defending themſelves againſt the violent aſſaults of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies upon the <hi>Sabbath day;</hi> and did chuſe rather to die then <hi>to pollute the Sabbath</hi> by making up the breaches made in their wals or fortifications, as ye may gather, 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 2. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> (in his Book, <hi>De Superſtitione)</hi> taxes them for their Follie.

               <p>Their Fathers ſinned grievouſly, in taking that liberty upon the Sabbath, which the Law of God had denied them. Theſe later Jews ſin in refuſing to uſe that liberty which God had in ſome Caſes allowed them, or at leaſt in

applauding themſelves for their <hi>ſtrict Reformation,</hi> and condemning others which in matter of doctrine or practiſe oppoſed them. And this their <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent zeal</hi> to maintain their own <hi>Rigid Reformation,</hi> did in the iſſue draw them <note place="margin">The <hi>Antient Jews</hi> ſins. The later <hi>Jews</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> to worſe practiſes then their Fathers had committed in their groſſeſt propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sabbath. Their Fathers were not at any time more violently bent againſt <hi>Eſay, Jeremy,</hi> or others of Gods Prophets, who taxt their ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous breach of the Sabbath, then theſe later Jews were bent againſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for not complying with them in their <hi>Rigid Reformation</hi> of former abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Their Fathers were not more apt to perſecute the Prophets, as peeviſh diſturbers of their peace by reproving their prophaneneſs, then theſe later Jews were to perſecute our <hi>Saviour,</hi> for a prophane Fellow or Sabbath-breaker, for doing works of mercie and charitie upon the Sabbath; albeit he wrought all his Cures without any manual labour or ſervile work.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Antient <hi>Iews</hi> were ſo delighted in groſs Idolatry, <hi>That they left the houſe of the Lord God of their Fathers, and ſerved Groves and Idols,</hi> by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of the King and his Princes, as you may read, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 17. And not herewith content, they ſtoned <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Son of <hi>Jehoida</hi> their High-Prieſt to death in the houſe of the Lord, for oppoſing their practiſe, or controlling the Kings Licence, by a Countermand from the Lord, as it is ver. 20, 21. <note place="margin">See a following Sermon upon that Fact.</note> This was a <hi>Prodigious Fact,</hi> as the later Jews have curiouſly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated it, and his blood did crie for vengeance, even upon that later generation, which thought they had ſo acurately <hi>reformed</hi> their Fore-fathers abuſes; As <hi>Our Saviour</hi> tels us, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 51. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, IT,</hi> to wit, <hi>the blood of</hi> Zacharias <hi>ſhall be required of this generation.</hi> But how did theſe Jews make up the meaſure of their Fathers ſins which ſhed <hi>Zacharias</hi> blood, <hi>for diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them from Idolatry?</hi> Seeing they did deteſt this very Fact and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of it? By no other means then by <hi>Over-prizing their Rigid Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and by their diſtempered Zeal to maintain it againſt all that ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it.</hi> So farre they ſought to root out this ſin, that they made not only all <hi>Cauſes</hi> but all probable or remote <hi>Occaſions</hi> of renewing Idolatry, to be matter of death; yea, they did rather chuſe to die themſelves, then to admit ſo much as an Image or Picture in their Temple, or upon the wals of it, though ſet up but for <hi>Hiſtorical or Civil</hi> uſe. So vehemently did they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte and loath the very conceit of multiplicity of Gods, that this their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream oppoſition unto <hi>the Heathens, did ſo farre miſ-ſway them</hi> as they could not be brought to admit a <hi>Diſtinction of Perſons in the Trinity.</hi> How often did they accuſe our Saviour of blaſphemy, for ſaying <hi>he was the Son of God,</hi> or <hi>God as well as man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, The cheif matter or occaſion which they took to perſecute our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour unto death, was, for that he would not conſent unto them either for <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> or <hi>practiſe,</hi> in their <hi>Rigid Reformation</hi> of thoſe groſs ſins which their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had committed; or in their uncharitable Expoſitions of the ſecond and fourth Commandement: <hi>Hee could not away with</hi> their Sabbaths <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1. 13.</p>

               <p n="10">10. To <hi>Parallel</hi> both their miſdemeanors with the Iſſues. The Fathers for love unto heatheniſh and ſenſe-pleaſing Idolatry did forſake their God and the ſervice of his houſe wherein he had promiſed to dwell. Theſe later Jewes for their delight and <hi>complacencie</hi> in their known freedom from theſe and the like particular ſins of their fathers, ſolemnly forſake and utterly diſclaim the ſame God, even, when according to his promiſe made to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he had his Tabernacle among them, and did walk with them (as the ancient Jewes expected their <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould) in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner. Their fathers ſlow their High-Prieſt in the Temple: theſe in killing Chriſt did deſtroy the Temple and Tabernacle of God; ſo his body was. Thus to forſake or diſclaim their Meſſias, they had a plauſible pretence or ſhew of truth; That he whom they ſaw to be a man, did take upon him that Authoritie which was proper to God alone. For ſo we read that when he ſaid to one, whom he cured of the palſie, <hi>Be of good cheer!</hi> thy ſins are <hi>forgiven thee:</hi> The Scribes and Phariſees which were then preſent, <hi>began to reaſon ſaying, who is this that ſpeaketh blaſphemy, who can forgive ſins but God alone?</hi> And for thus cenſuring Him, they preſumed they had the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God himſelf. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43. 25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for mine own ſake,</hi> and will <hi>not remember thy ſins.</hi> It was moſt true what they from this place allege, That <hi>God alone can forgive ſins.</hi> But from this preſent miracle, and the manner of our Saviours converſation here on earth, and their own wicked dealing with him, if they had compared theſe with the words immediately precedent in the Prophet, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. they might have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that <hi>He was that only God which did forgive ſins.</hi> For ſo the Prophet had ſaid unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the perſon of this only God, <hi>Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied me with thy iniquities.</hi> This is <hi>One of thoſe many places,</hi> which, even by the Jews confeſſions were evidently <hi>meant of God himſelf,</hi> and yet were never literally and punctually fulfilled or verified but <hi>of God incarnate.</hi> For God did never ſerve with this peoples ſins, was never wearie with their iniquities, ſave only whilſt he took the <hi>form of a ſervant upon him,</hi> and bare their ſins in his fleſh or humane nature.</p>
               <p n="11">11. To recollect more briefly <hi>the manner</hi> how theſe <hi>later Jewes</hi> did the <hi>ſame things</hi> for which they judged their Fathers, albeit their practiſes and diſpoſitions were for the moſt part <hi>clean contrary;</hi> as alſo <hi>by what means</hi> they were drawn to make up the meaſure of their forefathers ſins by ſhedding innocent blood; it is thus. The <hi>ancient Jewes</hi> did ſhed the blood of the Prophets, ſpecially becauſe they ſeverely taxed their Idolatry and breach of Sabbath; But the true reaſon why they ſhed their blood for taxing them, in theſe particulars, was, becauſe theſe and the like practiſes wherein they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with neighbor Nations were <hi>the moſt predominant and plauſible humours of thoſe times;</hi> and did command all their other deſires or affections. Theſe <hi>later Jewes</hi> did kill <hi>the King of Prophets</hi> for oppoſing the practiſes of intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reformation; but the Reaſon why they crucified him for oppoſing them, eſpecially in the Rigid Reformation of theſe two ſins, was, <hi>becauſe ſecret pride and deſire of applauſe, amongſt the people which profeſſed true Religion, was moſt predominant in theſe times of Reformation,</hi> and did overſway all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſires in the Phariſees. Both of them commit <hi>the ſelf ſame ſins</hi> even whilſt they follow <hi>contrary Practiſes,</hi> becauſe both of them had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſervants to their unruly deſires, and <hi>would not obey the Truth,</hi> but were inraged againſt it, whenſoever it fell croſſe upon the deſire, which for the
<pb n="3688" facs="tcp:32220:203"/>
time being, was moſt ſoveraign and had the prerogative in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Thus you ſee, how theſe <hi>later Jews</hi> condemned themſelves by judging their Fore-fathers, even for the moſt abominable Facts or Errors committed <note place="margin">Take we heed of condemning our ſelves by judging the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jews.</note> by them. Let us beware leſt we condemn not our ſelves by judging theſe <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jews,</hi> eſpecially at this time of ſolemn remembrance of his death, wherein we are bound to examine and judge our ſelves, every man his own ſelf, not any other man of what <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Sect</hi> ſoever. What then? May we not ſay or think that theſe <hi>later Jews</hi> did moſt grievouſly ſin (more grievouſly then their Fore-fathers had done) in that they put the Lord of life to death? God forbid, that we ſhould not thus farre cenſure them! But thus farre to cenſure them and no farther, is not to judge them, it is ſuch a <hi>Preparative</hi> or <hi>Precedent Rule</hi> for right examining or judging our ſelves, as <hi>Ahab</hi>'s ſentence againſt the <hi>Prophet,</hi> whom he miſtook for a <hi>Souldier,</hi> or <hi>David</hi>'s againſt the ſuppoſed <hi>Rich man,</hi> which had taken his Neighbors Sheep, was to judge and condemn themſelves: But ſay not in your hearts as theſe <hi>later Jews</hi> did, <hi>If we had lived in the dayes of</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pilate <hi>we would not have been partakers with them or with the Phariſees, Scribes or Prieſts in murthering</hi> that Juſt and Holy One.</p>
               <p>I know there is not any amongſt you but will ſay in his heart, <hi>I thank God I am for the preſent better affected towards Chriſt then theſe later Jews were which put him to death,</hi> and whilſt ye thus ſay, Charity commands me to think, that you ſpeak no otherwiſe then you think, then you are verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in heart. Yet let me intreat you, <hi>not to make This or the like perſwaſion, any part of that Rule by which you are to examine and judge your ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What other Rule then is there left?</p>
               <p>Surely for examining our ſelves, whether we be greater Friends or greater Enemies unto Chriſt then theſe <hi>later Iews</hi> were, <hi>There can be no other certain</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See the fourth chapter of this Book, Fol. 3342.</note> 
                  <hi>Rule beſides our Conformity or Non-conformity to the will of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every perſonal wrong is ſo much the greater or leſs, as it more or leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Good Pleaſure of him that is wronged, if ſo his Will be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Reaſon; or be <hi>a Conſtant Rule of Goodneſſe,</hi> as we all believe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Will was.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Saying</hi> of the <hi>Poet</hi> may be true, in ſome Caſes of Divinity:</p>
               <q>Invitum qui ſervat idem facit occidenti.</q>
               <p>He that perſwades a man, <hi>ready to dy upon good,</hi> to live upon evil Terms, doth wrong him no leſs then he that ſhould kill him when he was deſirous to live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Saviour</hi> taxes <hi>St. Peter</hi> more ſharply for diſſawding him from laying down his life for us, then he did the Scribes, Prieſts and Phariſees, for putting him to a lingring cruel and diſgraceful death, then he did <hi>Judas</hi> for betraying him. For upon this occcaſion he ſaid to <hi>Peter: Get thee behind me Sathan, for thou relliſheſt not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> ſin had been as great as <hi>Iudas</hi> his ſin, if it had been as habituated and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting, or if he ſhould have gathered forces for his Reſcue. For however death (ſuch a diſgraceful cruel and lingring death as our Saviour ſuffered) was bitter unto him, and went much againſt his humane will; or however it more diſpleaſed Him, that <hi>the Iews his own people</hi> ſhould be willing to put him to death, then the ſufferings of death did: yet he was comparatively far more willing to ſuffer the extremity of death and whatſoever they could inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him beſides, then to leave the works of the Divel undiſſolved either in
<pb n="3689" facs="tcp:32220:203"/>
them or in us; either in all of us, or in any one of us. For this purpoſe, ſaith S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> The Son of God was manifeſted that he might diſſolve the works of the Divel. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. What were theſe works of the Divel which he was willing to diſſolve, though it were by diſſolution of his ſoul from his body? Theſe were ſins of all ſorts, original and actual; or more punctually, thus: The main work of Satan which the Son of God came to diſſolve, and did by his death actually diſſolve for all and every one of us, was that bond of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Book.</hi> 8.</note> which Satan <hi>by right of Conqueſt</hi> had gotten over our firſt Parents and us. All of us by right of <hi>this Conqueſt</hi> were born ſlaves of Satan, until the Son of God, by right of Conqueſt over Satan obtained in our fleſh, did make us again the ſervants of God <hi>De jure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He took away the right of Satan, and eſtabliſhed his own over us. We are his ſervants by peculiar purchaſe. Now if any man whom the Son of God hath redeemed from this ſlavery unto Satan (and thus far he hath redeemed all) ſhall return to Satans ſervice and abandon the true ſervice of Chriſt, he wrongs him more then the Jewes did which put him to death; becauſe he was more willing to die for every one of us, then to ſuffer the works of Satan to be undiſſolved, or to be accompliſhed in any of us.</p>
               <p n="13">13. All of us even from our cradles have learned to take <hi>up</hi> the <hi>Name of a Jew, as a Proverb;</hi> and can take the boldneſs upon us (as occaſion ſerves) to cenſure the Scribes and Phariſees which put <hi>our Lord and Saviour</hi> to death as paternes of envy, malice, hypocriſie, and crueltie. But were not theſe very Jewes as forward and free to cenſure their forefathers (to whom they owed more reſpect then we do to them) for Idolatry, prophaneneſſe, and guilt of innocent blood; and thus they cenſured them without diſſimulation or affected zeal. And yet in thus judging their Fathers, they did condemn themſelves, for they did the ſame things, or worſe. But you will ſay, <hi>It is not poſsible, that we ſhould do the ſame things which theſe later Jewes did, or worſe things then they did:</hi> For, Chriſt cannot be buffeted, cannot be ſpit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot be crucified again. Yet may we do thoſe things (and would to God oft-times we did them not!) which are more diſpleaſing to him, now enthroned in Heaven, as King, then all that the Jewes did unto him whilſt he was in form of a ſervant here on earth.</p>
               <p>It was not the evil which the Jewes did to him, as to their profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, but the evil which was in themſelves, as their <hi>pride, envie, hypocriſie uncharitable cenſuring of others,</hi> which made him that made them, to be their enemie; and him that had been their Protector to fight againſt them. Theſe are diſeaſes not <hi>Proper</hi> to the Jewiſh Nation, but <hi>Epidemical</hi> and common to all Nations and places. The matter of them (as our Apoſtle in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſputes) is alike common to all. <hi>But the Jewiſh Nation came to their Criſis at Chriſts firſt appearance in humilitie.</hi> Our <hi>Critical Day</hi> is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected until his ſecond appearing in Majeſty and glory: Then, nothing which lies hid in the heart, but ſhall be laid open; then and not before will all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie betwixt the ſerpent and the womans ſeed appear. And, <hi>in that day it ſhall be more tolerable for them which crucified him then for us; unleſſe we take warning by Gods known Judgements upon them and their ſeed; to avoid thoſe practiſes and accuſtomances which wrought and ſwayed them by means ſecret and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>unſenſible to exerciſe enmitie and hoſtilitie againſt their Lord, their Maker and Redeemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. And here my purpoſe was to have uſed the former Parallel betwixt the <hi>Ancient Jewes</hi> which killed the Prophets, and <hi>the later,</hi> which, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for ſo doing, did not withſtanding kill our Saviour; as a Map where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

to ſhew you in what particulars, many in this Land, who not content with that diſcreet and <hi>judicious Reformation,</hi> which is contained in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Liturgie of our Church,</hi> by their ſolicitous care and anxious zeal to be extreamly contrary unto the Romiſh Church almoſt in all things, do by judging her and her children, condemn themſelves doing the very ſame things, or worſe things then ſhe doth, and help to make up that meaſure of iniquitie upon this Land, which the Romiſh Religion whilſt it was here authorized had left unaccompliſhed; But for this point and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which ſerve for uſe and application of the general Doctrine hitherto delivered, this preſent time will not ſuffice. The Application ſhall be brief. Take heed you meaſure not your love to truth by your oppoſition unto error. If hatred of error and ſuperſtition ſpring from ſincere love of truth and true Religion, the root is good, and the branch is good. But if your love to truth and true Religion ſpring from hatred to others error and ſuperſtition, the root is naught, and the branch is naught; There can no other fruit be expected, but hypocriſie, hardneſs of heart, and uncharitable cenſuring others.</p>

But <hi>Doctrinal Errors,</hi> which induce lewd practiſes, are more dangerous, more to be deteſted then the moſt groſs or lewdeſt practiſes into which ſome men fall, being not miſlead or drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by <hi>Plauſible Errors</hi> or falſe doctrine. Practiſes, how groſs ſoever, if they want the ſupportance or Countenance of Doctrinal Rules, pollute the ſouls &amp; conſciences of the parties peccant, they are not ſo powerful to ſeduce others. But <hi>Miſdemeanors or perverſe Affections being coutenanced by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or Colour of ſacred.

               <p>That which our Fore-elders did moſt condemn in the Romiſh Church, or at leaſt that which they went about to reform, was the <hi>Exceſsive Wealth</hi> which the Church or Clergie had gotten into their poſſeſſion, with the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent Authoritie of the Papacie,</hi> by which they ſought to detain what they had gotten, or to gather more.</p>
               <p>Whatever the manner of getting their wealth or Revenues was, the manner of uſing or imploying them was exceeding bad, and did deſerve, yea require a Reformation. Our Fore-elders did well in judging the <hi>Clergie</hi> for abuſing <hi>Revenues ſacred,</hi> to the maintenance of idleneneſs, ſuperſtition and idolatry. But would to God they had not <hi>condemned themſelves by judging them,</hi> or that they had not done the ſame things wherein they judged them. Happy had it been for them, and for their poſterity, if thoſe large Revenues which they took from ſuch as abuſed them, had been imployed to pious uſes; As <note place="margin">☜</note> either to the maintenance of true Religion, or to the ſupport of the needie, or to prevent oppreſsing by extraordinary Taxes, or the like. This had been an undoubted effect of <hi>pure Religion and undefiled before God.</hi> But it was not the <hi>different Eſtate</hi> or condition of the parties, on whom <hi>Church Revenues</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, that could give warrant unto their <hi>Alienation,</hi> or which might bring a bleſsing upon their intended <hi>Reformation,</hi> but <hi>the Uſes</hi> unto which they were conſecrated, or the manner how they were imployed.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>manner of their imployment,</hi> no man, whoſe Anceſtors have been Parties in this buſineſs, will take upon him to juſtifie. Nor have the poſterity of ſuch as were at that time moſt inriched with the ſpoils of the <hi>ſuperſtitious Church,</hi> any great cauſe to rejoyce at their Anceſtors eaſie purchaſe. It was a practiſe juſt and right, as being authorized by God himſelf, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould deſpoile the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of their coſtly ear-rings and gawdy jewels. But albeit the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were the borrowers, had better right unto them then the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which did lend them; yet much better had it been, if the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had either not lent them, or after the lone recovered them, than that they ſhould have afforded, as they did, both matter and opportunity for erecting golden Calves in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And of <hi>two Evils</hi> it had been the leſſe, if the Churches Revenues had been poſſeſſed by their firſt Owners; and not been miſ-imployed in ryot, luxurie and other branches of prophaneneſs, whereby the meaſure of this Lands Iniquity was rather augmented then diminiſhed; however, the nutriment of ſuperſtition and Idolatry, was by this means aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But be our Fore-elders fault, if not in alienating, yet in miſ-imploying,
<pb n="3692" facs="tcp:32220:205"/>
                  <hi>Church Revenues,</hi> as it may be, worſe then ſuperſtition, equivalent to Idolatry it ſelf: it was in no wiſe the fault of <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> nor of the Reformers of it; <hi>it muſt be charged upon the mainteiners of ſuperſtition:</hi> For at the <hi>Diſſolution of Abbies</hi> and other <hi>Religious Houſes,</hi> there was <hi>no Publick Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion attempted,</hi> ſave only, the denyal or Abjuration of the <hi>Popes Tranſcendent Authority</hi> and Reſtauration of the King unto his antient and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary right of Juriſdiction, in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtick. Nor was that <hi>Boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous King</hi> ſo much to blame in diſſolving material Temples or houſes (rather <hi>abuſed</hi> then <hi>conſecrated</hi> to ſuperſtition) as he was, after this Reformation (if ſo it may be called) in deſtroying ſo many living Temples of God, which ſought not the diſſolution of his Kingdom, nor any other Reformation of him and his people ſave only the clearing and purifying of their hearts and breſts, (which had been conſecrated unto Gods ſervice) from the infection of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſuperſtition</hi> and Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Idolatry was that, which in the firſt place required Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it did pollute the whole <hi>ſervice of God.</hi> And I think it would be hard to finde any generation of Chriſtian men ſince the firſt plantation of Chriſtianity, which did more abhor idols, or adoration of images in the Church, then the firſt Reformers of that Religion which we now profeſſe did; witneſs <hi>Thoſe learned Homilies againſt the peril of Idolatry.</hi> And yet, would to God, that many of thoſe times of high authoritie, and moſt zealouſly forward in the work of Reformation had not condemned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by judging the Romiſh Church, or their fore Elders which lived in it. Or that our Apoſtles cenſure of the Jewes hate or oppoſition unto Gentiliſm, had not fallen as jump and fit upon the times of <hi>Edward the ſixt,</hi> as it did upon the times and people to whom it was firſt purpoſely fitted. <note place="margin">☞</note> Our fore Elders (eſpecially the Nobilitie and Gentry of thoſe times) did abhor idols no leſſe then the Jewes did; and yet did commit more groſſe and <hi>palpable ſacriledge,</hi> then the Jewes to my obſervation, at any time had done.</p>
               <p>And what could it boote them to deface Images or pull down Idols in the material Churches, ſo long as by their very ſpoils, they nouriſhed that <hi>Great Idol,</hi> Covetouſneſs, in their own hearts: Thus to ſeek to inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or fill their private Coffers with the ſpoils of <hi>Abbies</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> or by Tithes and offerings, was but to continue the practiſe of the Prelacie or Clergie, in deſtroying Pariſhes to erect <hi>Monaſteries;</hi> or demoliſhing leſſer <hi>Religious houſes</hi> to build up others more ſumptuous, more Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Many, at this day there be, which out of zeal, complain that the <hi>Lawes againſt ſuperſtition</hi> and Idolatry are not ſevere enough: and there is no moderate man (unleſſe of the Romiſh faction) but could wiſh, that ſuch lawes as have been made for ſuppreſſing the growth of it were more conſtantly more impartially executed then they are. In all this neither of them are to blame. And yet by ſoliciting Gods cauſe and the cauſe of true Religion againſt the mainteiners of ſuperſtition and Idolatry, we ſhall but ſolicite our own condemnation, unleſs we bear a like zealous deſire and good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the depreſſing and rooting out of all ſacrilegious <hi>Practiſes</hi> or <hi>Opinions.</hi> And yet ſeriouſly to attempt <hi>the Reformation</hi> of this foul ſin, <hi>which is Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to Idolatry, and hath the ſame burthen of Gods curſe,</hi> would be a matter (I am perſwaded) as full of difficultie and danger in this Land; as to attempt the defacing of Images in the Church of Rome, or in any Province ſubject to her Juriſdiction. But the further proſecution of this point would better
<pb n="3693" facs="tcp:32220:205"/>
befit an Audience of States-men of Parliament-men, or Lawyers, then this place or Audience. Only let me forewarn you, <hi>That your Predeceſſors have been grievous offenders in this kinde,</hi> witneſs the ſhort revenues or poor En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of your goodly Churches.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But this ſin of ſacrilege or Church robbing hath been, though not common to all, yet in a manner peculiar to ſuch, as exerciſe the <hi>Co-active Power of Reformation.</hi> The Clergie, in whom the <hi>Power directive</hi> was, did either not at all or unwillingly partake with them in this offence; they have been and are the <hi>Patients,</hi> that is, the men which ſuffer wrong, not <hi>Doers</hi> of wrong in this kinde. And if we ſet aſide thoſe Points of Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which did not come to oppoſition or counterpoize with <hi>Power Royall,</hi> or with the <hi>Intereſt of Potentates</hi> or commodities of private men; <hi>The Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by our fore elders in other points of Doctrine was judicious and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</hi> They did no way condemn themſelves by judging the Romiſh Church. The judgement which they exerciſed was the judgement of the Lord. The Reformation which they intended and accompliſhed was <hi>The Lords doing.</hi> But many which have enjoyed the benefit of that wholſome Reformation, and of true Chriſtian libertie reſtored by it, have not ſubmitted themſelves, their opinions or Practiſes to the Lawes or Rules preſcribed by it. Many have taken upon them, and yet do, not only to judge or cenſure the Romiſh Church, but even <hi>to condemn the Reformation of their Anceſtors,</hi> as if it did to this day ſavour of the ſuperſtition from which it was ſevered: of thoſe men I only ſpeak, which out of an hatred, Antipathy or loathing the Romiſh Church, do <hi>caſt themſelves out of all Churches, and will be members of none, unleſſe they may be heads of ſome one new one of their own making,</hi> or of ſome that hath no real patern or <hi>Module</hi> ſave only in their own buſie heads or brains.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To inſtance in ſome <hi>particular errors</hi> into which, the very hate of Romiſh errors hath tranſported them, <hi>One of the moſt waightie Maſſes of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A Romiſh error requiring Reformation.</note> 
                  <hi>Poperie which required Reformation</hi> and <hi>Refining,</hi> was, that <hi>they made The Church,</hi> which in their Language, was, <hi>the bodie of the Clergie, A body Politick or kingdom diſtinct from the body of the Layetie:</hi> holding even Chriſtian Kings and Emperours to be Magiſtrates meerly Temporal or civil, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excluded from medling in affairs Eccleſiaſtick. Now this being granted, the <hi>Supream Majeſtie</hi> of every kingdom, State, or nation, ſhould be wholly ſeated in the Clergie: The greateſt Kings and Chriſtian Monarchs on earth ſhould be but meer vaſſals to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Hierarchie;</hi> or at the moſt, in ſuch ſubordination to it, as <hi>Forraign Generals</hi> and Commanders in chief are to the States or Soveraignties which imploy them, who may diſplace them at their pleaſure, whenſoever they ſhall tranſgreſſe, or not execute <hi>their inſtructions</hi> or Commiſſions. For this reaſon (as in the handling of the firſt verſes of the 13. Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Romans hath been declared unto you before) All the diſputes or Lawes concerning the <hi>Supremacie of Kings</hi> or Free States within their own Dominions were to no purpoſe, unleſſe this Root of miſchief and Rebellion be taken away, which makes the Clergie a body politick or Common-weal Eccleſiaſtick altogether diſtinct from the Layetie-Chriſtian. Now this erroneous <hi>Root of miſchief</hi> hath been well removed by <hi>the Articles of Religion</hi> eſtabliſhed in this Church and Land, <hi>Article the</hi> 37. wherein, <hi>The ſame authoritie and power is expreſly given to the Kings of this Realm and their ſucceſſors, which was in uſe and practiſe amongſt the Kings of Judah, and the Chriſtian Emperors, when king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Common-weales did firſt become Chriſtian.</hi> The Law of God and of
<pb n="3694" facs="tcp:32220:206"/>
nature, will not ſuffer the <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> in <hi>Cauſes Eccleſiaſtick</hi> to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from the <hi>Supream Majeſtie</hi> of any Kingdom or free Soveraigntie true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>But what be the contrary Errors, into which, ſuch as take upon them to be <hi>Reformers of the Reformation</hi> already made, have run headlong? Or how do they <hi>the ſame things</hi> wherein they judge the Romaniſts? The Romaniſts (as they well obſerve) deſerve condemnation by all Chriſtian States, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating the <hi>Name</hi> or Soveraign <hi>Dignitie</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> unto the Clergie, and by making the Prerogative of Prieſts and Prelates to be above the Prerogatives of Kings and Princes. The <hi>Contrary faction of Reformers</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">An Error of the Contraire extreme, diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging The <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                  </note> not content to deprive the Clergie of thoſe <hi>civil Immunities</hi> and priviledges, wherewith the <hi>Law of God,</hi> the <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> and the <hi>Fundamental Law of this Kingdom,</hi> have endowed them; will have them to be <hi>no true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the Common-weale or Kingdom wherein they live; Or at the beſt, but ſuch <hi>Inferior members</hi> of the Common-weale, as the Papiſts make the Layetie to be of the Church; men that ſhall have no voice in making thoſe <hi>Coercive Lawes,</hi> by which they are to be governed and to govern their flocks; yea men that ſhall not have <hi>neceſſary voyces</hi> in determining controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of Religion, or, in making Rules and Canons for preventing Schiſme. I ſhould have been afraid to beleeve thus much of any ſober man profeſſing Chriſtianitie, unleſſe I had ſeen <hi>A book to this purpoſe,</hi> peruſed (as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Frontiſpice) by the Learned in the Laws. But the Author hath wiſely concealed his own name, and the names of thoſe learned in the Lawes, <note place="margin">A Factious Schiſmatical Book, modeſtly Cenſured.</note> which are (in groſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>All Errors</hi> in this kind proceed from theſe <hi>Originals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, The Authors of them (Charitie may hope, by Incogitancie or want of conſideration, rather than out of Malice) ſeek to ſubject the Clergie unto the ſame Rule unto which the Church was ſubject for the firſt 300. years after Chriſt; during which time the Kings and Emperours, under which the Chriſtians lived, were Heathens. And whilſt the chief Governours were ſuch, no Chriſtians could exerciſe <hi>Coercive Authoritie,</hi> as to <hi>Fine, impriſon,</hi> or baniſh any that did tranſgreſſe the Lawes of God or of the Church. The Apoſtles themſelves could uſe no other manner of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Apoſtolical and Epiſcopal Power under heathen Princes; and after Princes were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aned.</note> beſides delivering up to Satan, Excommunication, or inhibition from hearing the word, or receiving the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Authors of the former Errors conſider not, That whileſt the Church was in this ſubjection to meer Civil and not Chriſtian Power; the Lay-Chriſtians of what rank ſoever, though noble men by birth, were as ſtraightly confined and kept under, as were the Clergie. Yea the Clergie in thoſe times had greater authoritie over Lay-Chriſtians, then any other men had; Authority much greater over the greateſt, then any beſides the Romiſh Prelates do this day challenge over the meaneſt of their flocks. But after Kings and Emperors and other ſupream Magiſtrates were once converted to the Chriſtian Faith, their dignities were no whit abated, but gained this Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their former Titles, that they were held ſupream Magiſtrates in Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Eccleſiaſtick: That is, they had power of calling Councils and Synods
<pb n="3695" facs="tcp:32220:206"/>
for quelling Schiſms and Hereſies in the Church; power likewiſe to puniſh the Tranſgreſſors of ſuch Laws or Canons, as had been made by former Godly Biſhops or Prelates which lived under Heathen States; or of ſuch as the Biſhops or Clergy, which lived under their Government, ſhould make for the better Government of Chriſts Church. Unto puniſhments <hi>meerly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> which the Apoſtles and Biſhops had formerly, only, uſed; Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors added puniſhments temporal, as impriſonment of body, loſs of goods exile, or death; according to the nature and qualitie of the tranſgreſsion. But that any Laws or Canons were made by Chriſtian Kings or Emperors, for the Government of the Church; or that any Controverſies in Religion were determined without the <hi>Expreſs Suffrages</hi> and Conſents of Biſhops and Paſtors, though all wayes ratified by the Soveraigntie of the Nation or State for whom ſuch Canons were made, no man until theſe dayes wherein we live did ever queſtion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And of ſuch as queſtion, or oppoſe <hi>Epiſcopal Authoritie</hi> in theſe Caſes, I muſt ſay (as once before out of this place in like caſe I did) <hi>If Heathen they be in heart and would perſwade the Layetie again to become Heathens, their Reſolutions are Chriſtian;</hi> at leaſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions are ſuch, as a good Chriſtian living under Heathens, would admit. <hi>But if Chriſtians they be in heart and profeſsion, their Concluſions are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh</hi> or worſe. For what Heathen did ever deny their Prieſts the chief ſtroke <note place="margin">The Antient Heathens gave, (and Turks give) more to their Prieſts, then ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity do to theirs; both for <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Maintenance.</hi>
                  </note> or ſway in making Lawes or ordinances concerning <hi>the Rites</hi> or ſervice of their Gods, or in determining <hi>Points Controverted</hi> in Religion? To conclude this Point; The men that ſeek to be moſt contrary to the Romiſh Church, and are moſt forward to judge her for enlarging the Prerogative of Prieſthood beyond its ancient bounds, <hi>do the ſame things</hi> ſhe doth, by <hi>Equivalencie,</hi> and run to the <hi>ſame End</hi> by a quite contrary way. The Romiſh Church (it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed) makes her Popes and Prelates, with other Pillars of their Church, plain Idols. They which out of an undiſcreet and furious zeal, ſeem moſt to abhor this kind of Idolatry, commit Sacrilege, and rob God of his honour, as the Romiſh Church doth. And he that robs God of his honour, doth <hi>the very ſame thing</hi> and no other, which an Idolater doth. Now they are ſaid in Scripture to rob God of his honour, and to commit an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more then heatheniſh <hi>(for the heathen do not ſpoil their Gods)</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud him of his tithes &amp; offrings, which were due unto the Prieſt for his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration and ſervice in Gods Houſe. But they rob God of his honour more immediately and more directly, which deſpiſe or contemn his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, not in word only, but in taking that Authority from them which he hath expreſly given unto them; and which is worſt of all, in ſeeking to alienate it unto them, over whom, he hath in matter of ſalvation appointed them <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Overſeers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Precept of our Apoſtle I am ſure will ſtand good, when all Laws, or <note place="margin">A Precept will be in force, when pretences will be out of date.</note> Intendments of Laws to confront it, will fail. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
               <p>What Rule doth he mean? meerly <hi>Civil</hi> or Temporal? No! What then? <hi>Eccleſiaſtick?</hi> Not that <hi>only,</hi> But <hi>the Rule of Government ſpiritual,</hi> ſuch as is proper to the Biſhops of the Church; For ſo it follows; <hi>for they</hi> (to whom you are to ſubmit your ſelves) <hi>watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give an accompt;</hi> and you are therefore to obey <hi>that they may do their office with joy, and not with grief; for that</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is unprofitable for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, that in this plenty of preaching and frequencie in hearing, The moſt
<pb n="3696" facs="tcp:32220:207"/>
hearers profit ſo little in the School of Chriſt; the true Reaſon is, for that <hi>men do not ſubmit themſelves unto their Paſtors in ſuch ſort as they ought,</hi> but think it his Duty or Office, <hi>only</hi> to preach, and their duty <hi>only</hi> to hear; not to be <hi>Ruled</hi> or <hi>Governed</hi> by him, whereas the ones preaching is vain, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hearing is vain, unleſs this duty of obedience be firſt planted in their hearts. <hi>The Paſtors Grief which ariſeth from neglect or contempt of this Duty, will prove in the iſſue the Peoples Curſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. But the <hi>main ſtream</hi> of Popery, from which the name of <hi>Babylon</hi> is derived unto <hi>Rome,</hi> was <hi>the Abſolute Infallibilitie of the Romiſh Church Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The main Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church, <hi>Infallibilitie;</hi> both in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding holy Scripture, and in atteſting Traditions. See the ſecond and third Books.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The branches of this ſuppoſed abſolute Infallibilitie were Two.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the ſenſe of Scriptures, which that Church doth maintain or avouch concerning <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Manners,</hi> is alwayes Authentick, undoubted and true.</p>
               <p>But whereas many <hi>Points,</hi> as well of <hi>Doctrine</hi> as <hi>Practiſe,</hi> concerning <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> were in that Church eſtabliſhed by <hi>Preſcription</hi> and <hi>Uſe,</hi> without ſo much as any <hi>Pretence</hi> of warrant from Scripture; They were inforced in the <hi>Second Place</hi> to maintain, That the <hi>Unwritten Traditions</hi> of the Church were of equal Authoritie with the Scriptures, and that <hi>the preſent Church</hi> was as Infallible in her Teſtimony of the One, as in her Judgment of the other. The <hi>Infallible Conſequence</hi> of which ſuppoſed Infallibilitie, <hi>is This,</hi> That the people were <hi>abſolutely to believe</hi> whatſoever that Church ſhould propound unto them, as a Point of faith or practiſe commendable; and to abjure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that Church ſhould condemn for hereſie, or ungodlineſs. By <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Belief</hi> or obedience, they intend a belief or obedience, not only <hi>without Condition</hi> or ſcruple in the firſt undertaking, but without <hi>Reſervation of appeal,</hi> upon any new diſcovery of dangers, unſeen, unſuſpected in the firſt undertaking. The Churches Authority once declared, was in their Divinity ſufficient to quell or put to ſilence, all ſucceeding Replies or mutterings of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Both theſe dangerous Errors were <hi>well Reformed;</hi> The later ſtream or <note place="margin">The Two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Romiſh Errors <hi>well Reformed.</hi>

For, <hi>every Biſhop</hi> at his <hi>Conſecration</hi> doth ſolemnly promiſe or vow, <hi>not to propound any thing to the people</hi> as a Point of Faith, <hi>unleſs it be either expreſly conteined in the Scripture, or may be thence deduced by neceſſary Inference,</hi> To bind or tie <hi>all Biſhops</hi> thus ſolemnly unto the obſervance of this Rule, the wiſdom of thoſe Times had theſe Reaſons: Not only to curb or reſtrain the licentious Abuſe of Biſhops former Authoritie, but becauſe they knew that the people were in many Caſes (concerning the ſervice of God and other Chriſtian duties) bound to yeeld more credence and obedience to their <hi>Biſhops and Paſtors</hi> then unto men not called to Sacred or Paſtoral Function. It is One Thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any Doctrinal Propoſition as <hi>A Point of Faith neceſſary to ſalvation;</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to believe it ſo far as we may ſafely adventure upon any practiſe or duty injoyned by ſuperiors, That is, to believe it, not Abſolutely but Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, and out of ſuch belief to obey them, not abſolutely but conditionally, that is, with reſervation of freedom or libertie, when either the truth ſhall be better diſcovered then now it is, or greater dangers appear then for the preſent we do ſuſpect. The Obedience which we give unto <hi>Superiors</hi> may be <hi>Ex Fide,</hi> of Faith, albeit the points of doctrine, or the perſwaſions out of which we yeeld this obedience, be not <hi>De Fide,</hi> No points of Faith or neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>

9. But a great many <hi>well-meaning men</hi> there were, who ſhortly after this <hi>happy Reformation,</hi> could not content themſelves to ſtand upon ſuch <hi>ſure Termes</hi> of Contradiction unto the Romiſh Church, as the firſt Reformers had done; but ſought in <hi>this Point</hi> (which was indeed above all others to be abhorred) to be <hi>moſt extremly Contrary</hi> unto her.</p>
               <p>Wherein then doth that Contradiction to the Romiſh Church (wherein the firſt Reformers of Religion did entrench themſelves;) and wherein doth <note place="margin">The <hi>Temper</hi> &amp; <hi>Bounds</hi> of the Right and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Reformer.</note> the <hi>Extream Contrarietie,</hi> whereunto others, more <hi>Rigid Reformers,</hi> if they could have effected their Projects, would have drawn this Church and Land, conſiſt?</p>
               <p>The Romiſh Church, as you heard before, did make <hi>Unwritten Traditions a Part of the Rule of Faith, as ſoveraign as the written Word of God,</hi> and did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude thoſe obſervances, which had no other warrant then ſuch Tradition, as altogether neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt Reformers</hi> of this Error were contented to <hi>contradict them only in this.</hi> And their Contradiction is expreſly mainteined, partly in the <hi>Articles</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Cure of the Error, by the Right <hi>Mean.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of Religion,</hi> partly in the <hi>Book of Conſecration of Biſhops.</hi> The Contradiction is <hi>This; That all things neceſſary to ſalvation are contained in Scripture;</hi> which is all one as to ſay, <hi>That the Scripture is the only Rule of Faith.</hi> Yet did they not for all this utterly reject <hi>All uſe of Tradition,</hi> or Ceremonies, as you may find expreſſed in the thirty fourth Article; in which, though Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or other cuſtoms of the Church be not injoyned in particular (as they take for granted) by God himſelf; yet obedience is due unto them in particular, and they which diſobey or tranſgreſs them in any particular are to be puniſhed or made Examples, <hi>leſt others be emboldened to do the like.</hi> And the Reaſon why they would have ſuch puniſhed (which I would requeſt you to obſerve) is, leſt their impunity ſhould miniſter offence to the weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; And a man cannot give greater offence to the weak or ignorant, then by emboldening them to diſobedience, in Caſes, wherein obedience is due.</p>
               <p>But ſoon after theſe <hi>Publick Injunctions,</hi> other <hi>Private Spirits</hi> roſe up, which out of deſire to be <hi>Extreamly Contrary</hi> to the Romiſh Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Traditions,</hi> did expreſly contradict their Lawful Governors in that <hi>Article.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Contrary Error</hi> into which they run (by ſeeking to avoid the error of the Romiſh Church) was, in brief, <hi>This; That no Chriſtian man is bound to obey ſuperiors in matters of ſacred Rite or Ceremony,</hi> or in Duties of ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, unleſs their Governors, or ſuch as demand their Obedience, can ſhew them <hi>expreſſe Authority of Scripture;</hi> or can convince their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <note place="margin">The Error ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Romiſh Error.</note> that God by his Word doth enjoyn them to obey <hi>in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thus to oppoſe the Romiſh Church by way of <hi>Contrarietie,</hi> is but to ſeek the overthrow of a <hi>Tyranny</hi> by the Erection of an <hi>Anarchie.</hi> For if the Flock or inferior members of the Church, owe no obedience unto their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, but upon theſe Termes, then <hi>Paſtors, Prelates,</hi> yea <hi>Kings,</hi> ſhould owe the ſame obedience unto the meaneſt Tradeſmen or Day-labourers, that Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Day-labourers owne to them. For Paſtors, and Prelates, even Kings themſelves are bound to obey the Word of God by whomſoever it ſhall be manifeſted or made known unto them, and to obey it in every particular which it manifeſtly injoynes. And if obedience were not due to Paſtors, Prelates and Kings in matters concerning the ſervice of God or ſacred Rites, until they can ſhew warrant for every particular, which they enjoyn, out of
<pb n="3698" facs="tcp:32220:208"/>
Gods word, there were no obedience at all due unto <hi>them,</hi> but unto Gods Word only; And every man might ſay to them as the Emperour ſaid to the <hi>Pope, Non Tibi ſed Petro.</hi> But ſo, the <hi>Sacred Rule of Faith</hi> and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſhould be not the Author of ſuch Order as we believe it is; but an occaſion of confuſion in every Chriſtian Eſtate or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But this is the happineſs of the Engliſh Church or Clergie, that all the Arguments which have been or can be brought by Factious or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſpirits in matters of Rites, Ceremonies, or Diſcipline, do draw their ſtrength from ſuch falſe or miſtaken Principles, as if way were given to their growth, or exerciſe of their force, they could not peck the leaſt hole in the Miter or make the leaſt thirle in the <hi>Surpellice</hi> without working a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble crack or flaw in the Royal Crown; Their Authors diſobedience to Lawes or Diſcipline Eccleſiaſtick would quickly induce, if opportunitie ſerved, open rebellion againſt the <hi>Prerogative Royal.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A Romiſh Error breeding</hi> Doubt of Salvation, <hi>charged upon its proper evident Ground; viz- Their making The</hi> Intention of A <hi>Biſhop Eſſentially neceſſarie to the Conſecration of A prieſt: And the</hi> Intention <hi>of a Prieſt ſo neceſſary that no Sacrament can be without it. The Error of The</hi> Contrarij <hi>Teaching a</hi> Prepoſterous immature Certaintie <hi>of Salvation. The</hi> Right Mean <hi>betwixt or cure of theſe extremities, preſcribed unto us by our Reformers of Bleſſed memorie, contained in the Publick Acts of The Church.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. ANother <hi>Doctrinal Point</hi> there was mainteined by the Romiſh Church, when our Fathers departed from it, which required <hi>Reformation.</hi> And this <hi>Point</hi> contains all the ſeveral <hi>Tenets</hi> of that Church, which did occaſion or nurſe <hi>Doubt of Salvation</hi> or <hi>Perplexity of Conſcience</hi> in every private man ſo often as he ſhould examine his <hi>Eſtate in Grace,</hi> his hopes or Intereſt in Gods mercy or promiſes to all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, by Gods aſſiſtance, Of the <hi>General Error</hi> or that branch of it <note place="margin">Three Points purpoſed.</note> which eſpecially required <hi>Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the <hi>Contrary Error</hi> or Inconveniencies into which many by Curioſitie of Reformation have run.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Of the <hi>True Mean,</hi> or Orthod oxal Doctrine which the <hi>Reformers</hi> of our Church did hold and maintain, and have delivered unto us in the <hi>Publick Acts</hi> of the Church approved and ratified by the General Conſent of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Error of the Romiſh Church was <hi>Doubt of Salvation:</hi> with <hi>This Error,</hi> that Church hath been often charged by all the beſt writers of <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches.</hi> But ſometimes, or by ſome men in thoſe Churches, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">A Romiſh Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, cauſing Doubt of Salvation. <hi>viz</hi> The intention of the Prieſt &amp;c.</note> ſo <hi>Evident Ground</hi> as it might be charged. For ſome there be which charge this Error directly upon their <hi>Tenet</hi> concerning <hi>The Nature of Faith or Hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, for their Defence, if we joyn iſſue with them upon thoſe Terms, they have more to ſay, then they can have, if we charge this Error upon their
<pb n="3701" facs="tcp:32220:209"/>
                  <hi>Doctrine</hi> concerning <hi>The Intention of the Prieſt</hi> in the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, By whoſe hidden vertue Faith and Hope are begotten and increaſed. For, how much ſoever they may ſeem to magnifie <hi>The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the New Teſtament</hi> in reſpect of the Sacraments of the Law (as, that they <hi>conferre Grace</hi> upon the receivers of them <hi>Ex Opere operato,</hi> by the very Sacramental action, which the Sacraments of the Law did not,) Yet, all this being granted, no man can be more certain of his Eſtate in Grace, then he is of the good Intention of the Prieſt which adminiſtred the Sacraments. Now this Aſſurance or perſwaſion of the Prieſts Intention can be no ſure Ground of Faith truly Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sacrament of Baptiſm they hold to be <hi>abſolutely neceſſary unto Salvation;</hi> and that, <hi>All ſuch infants as die</hi> without <hi>Baptiſme are excluded from the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And yet they hold withall, that <hi>Unleſſe the Prieſt, when he comes to Baptize any Infant, do intend to do what the Church</hi> appoints him to do, <hi>the Baptiſme is invalid</hi> or of none effect; albeit he uſe the <hi>Formal Words of Baptiſme,</hi> and apply the <hi>Sacramental element</hi> to the body of the Infant preſented by the ſolemn prayers of the Church, or Congregation preſent. Beſides the <hi>ſolemn Pronunciation</hi> of the Words <hi>[I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;]</hi> and the waſhing of the body in water, there muſt <hi>be Interior mentis intentio,</hi> the <hi>internal Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſts minde,</hi> muſt joyntly concur with the Word and Sacrament, or rather with the Holy Ghoſt, for producing the <hi>Inviſible Grace</hi> or Gift of the Spirit which is the proper Effect of the Sacrament. So that how well ſoever the Parents, the Friends and neighbours aſſembled demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at or before the performance of this <hi>Sacred Act,</hi> yet every Infant brought to the Sacred <hi>Laver</hi> may be <hi>Two Wayes</hi> remedileſly prejudiced by the Prieſt, to the ruine of its ſoul or loſſe of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It may be deprived of the fruit or benefit of this Sacrament (which <note place="margin">A Romiſh Prieſt may damn an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant through neglect or malice: by the Doctrine of that Church.</note> is by their Doctrine abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation) by the <hi>meer negligence</hi> or careleſneſſe of the Prieſt, as in Caſe he forget in heart or mind to intend his dutie, of doing that which the Church in like Caſe uſually doth or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points to be done; whatſoever elſe he do or ſay, all is nothing, it is no Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Infant may be ſo far prejudiced, as is ſaid, by the <hi>malice</hi> or impietie of the Prieſt. As in Caſe he be ſo wickedly diſpoſed, as ſecretly to ſubtract or withdraw his Intention by any interpoſed condition or Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation though not expreſſed, the Baptiſme is invalid, or of no effect. To give you <hi>One of their own Inſtances</hi> or <hi>Ruled Caſes. If one ſhould come to one of their Prieſts and requeſt him to baptize ſuch a mans child, naming his Parents, and he ſhall thus with himſelf reſolve. If this very child be brought unto me</hi> I intend <hi>to do to him as the Church enjoyns; but if any other be preſented unto me I have</hi> no Intention <hi>to baptize him, however I uſe the words of Baptiſme and waſh him with water.</hi> The Reſolution of their Doctors is, that in Caſe <hi>another child</hi> be brought unto the Font, and <hi>not that Individual</hi> child for which he was firſt ſpoken unto, he ſhall have no benefit by his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For a Prieſt to make ſuch ſecret Conditions limitations or reſervations, the Romiſh Doctors acknowledge to be a wicked and ſacrilegious part; But this is all the comfort which the Infant, preſumed to be baptized, or his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents can have, if the Prieſt be diſpoſed to be thus malitious. That the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> of the Prieſt is neceſſarily required, not only <hi>by way of Precept,</hi> or to the better adminiſtration of the Sacrament, but <hi>Neceſsitate Medii,</hi> as a meanes <hi>ſo</hi>
                  <pb n="3702" facs="tcp:32220:210"/>
                  <hi>neceſſary that without it there can be no Sacrament at all;</hi> not their School-men or private Doctors only, but ſome of their General Councils have declared. For the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> makes this Intention of the Prieſt to be of the <note place="margin">See <hi>Soto.</hi> in 4. Senten. diſ. 1. Q. 5. Art. 8.</note> very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament: Now, Eſſentia non Suſcipit magis &amp; minus.</hi> If the Prieſts <hi>Intention</hi> be of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of this Sacrament, it muſt be as neceſſary as the <hi>Intention</hi> of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And yet their later Doctors are in this point more Rigid then the ancient were, which lived not long after the Council of <hi>Florence.</hi> For <hi>Thomas of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine,</hi> the great Maſter of the modern Jeſuites, required only an <hi>habitual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> his Scholars, the Jeſuites, alwayes required a <hi>virtual Intention,</hi> which is more then an habitual.</p>
               <p>Again, whereas ſome of their Doctors in Ages paſt did think it a Probable Opinion, which might without Cenſure of impietie be believed, that in Caſe ordinary Prieſts were negligent or otherwiſe defective in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments; the High-Prieſt of our ſouls (to wit, Chriſt Jeſus) might or would ſupply their defect or negligence: <hi>Zuares,</hi> a late great Doctor in that Church, cenſures the Author of this opinion for his zeal without diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And <hi>Soto,</hi> another great Doctor, who was preſent at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> peremptorily denies all relief or remedy from Chriſt to any Infant, in Caſe the Prieſt will be ſo wicked, as either not to <hi>Intend</hi> to do what the Church doth appoint, or to withdraw his <hi>Intention</hi> or purpoſe to do him good by baptizing him. If the Prieſt purpoſe to remit his ſins by Baptiſm, they are remitted by Chriſt: if he purpoſe not to remit them, but to retain them, they are not remitted, but retained by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beſides the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which Two, the Reformed Churches only acknowledge inſtituted by Chriſt, as generally neceſſary to ſalvation, the Romiſh Church preſſeth <hi>Three</hi> other upon all Lay-People, as neceſſary unto their ſalvation, <hi>Ex neceſsitate praecepti,</hi> that is, they are bound in duty to receive them, and in Caſe they omit them when they may have them, they forfeit their intereſt in Gods promiſes. And thoſe are the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation;</hi> the Sacrament of <hi>Abſolution</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Confeſſion; and the Sacrament of <hi>Extreme Unction.</hi> Theſe make a plauſible ſhew or pretence that the Romiſh Church hath greater ſtore of means for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or for conferring Grace, then Reformed Churches have. But how well ſoever God by their doctrine hath provided for their Church, in granting it ſuch a multitude of Sacraments, &amp; ſuch an extraordinary manner, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> their ſuppoſed Sacraments confer Grace upon ſuch as receive them: yet when all is <note place="margin">Romiſh Prieſts have a ſtrange <hi>Negative voice.</hi>
                  </note> done, they grant a <hi>Negative</hi> voice to the Prieſt in the diſtribution of all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Grace. And <hi>ſuch a Negative</hi> as is not uſual in other Caſes. For all other Governors of humane Societies, whether Eccleſiaſtick or Civil, have only a <hi>Negative voice,</hi> which if they do not expreſly uſe, their ſilence is interpreted for a Grant, or teſtification of their Conſent unto the buſineſs propoſed. But albeit the Prieſt profeſs his Conſent unto the Sacramental Act by pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Sacramental words: yet if he be pleaſed by ſecret Condition, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Limitation to withdraw the Conſent of mind or ſpirit from his external act or words pronounced by him; the Spirit of God ſhall want his influence upon the ſouls of ſuch as receive the Sacrament. And as they grant a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> unto every ordinary Prieſt in the diſtribution of Sacramental Grace unto the Laytie: So they give the like <hi>Negative</hi> unto the Biſhop or Prelate in the diſtribution of Sacramental Grace unto their Prieſts. For the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Prieſts is in their Doctrine a Sacrament of the new Law or Goſpel; and of this Sacrament the <hi>Intention of the Biſhop</hi> or Prelate which admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth
<pb n="3703" facs="tcp:32220:210"/>
it, is an <hi>Eſſential part.</hi> If the Biſhop either through negligence or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs do not afford his ſecret Intention or conſent, the ordination of the Prieſt is invalid: the words pronounced by him, or impoſition of hands doth imprint no Character upon his ſoul, and without this character, he is no Prieſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And here by the way you may inform your ſelves, why ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in all points to believe as the Romiſh Church believeth, have their own Prieſts or Prelates in ſuch eſteem or eſtimation as no other people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides have their lawful Governors. The true Reaſon is, not any extraordinary worth in their perſons, but this ſtrange kind of Power or Authoritie, which were it true, or where it is acknowledged to be true, might juſtly exact double honour, more then humane; even both parts of that honour, which the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens reſpectively gave unto their ſeveral gods. Some gods the heathens ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with <hi>Placatorie Sacrifices,</hi> leſt being neglected, they ſhould do them harm: Other gods, whom they conceived to be the Authors or diſtributers of things good and comfortable, they adored or honoured with propitiatory Sacrifices. Both kinds of ſacrifices or ſervices, one and the ſame Romiſh Prieſt may wreſt from the people committed to his charge: The one, to wit, <hi>Placatorie</hi> Sacrifices, he may exact, and the people will be ready to perform, leſt he withdraw or alienate his <hi>Intention</hi> from them or their children, whileſt he adminiſters the Sacrament unto them. For his malitious or fraudulent withdrawing of his Intention from the Sacrament, may procure them greater loſſe or harm then the Heathen could conceive their angry or wreakful gods could work them. The other kind of Sacrifices, to wit, <hi>Propitiatorie,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple committed to his charge will be willing to exhibit to the Romiſh Prieſt, that he may be the more diligent, circumſpect and attentive, whileſt he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth the Sacraments, ſeeing upon ſuppoſal or preſumption of his diligence, or Intention in this buſineſs, they hope for a greater bleſſing then the heathens expected from their good or favourable gods.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this <hi>Firſt Point:</hi> If we put all theſe together:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Intention of the Prelate</hi> or the Biſhop <hi>neceſſary</hi> by their doctrine for conferring the <hi>Order of the Prieſthood,</hi> and for the <hi>efficacie</hi> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Neceſsitie</hi> of the ordinarie Prieſts <hi>Intention</hi> in adminiſtring the Sacrament of Baptiſm, of the Lords Supper, and of Extreme Unction, we need not be afraid or aſhamed to <hi>Charge their Doctrine</hi> in making the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> of the Prieſt or Miniſter of the Sacrament to be an <hi>Eſſential part</hi> of the Sacrament, with <hi>nurſing a perpetual diſtruſt or doubt,</hi> not only of ſalvation or perſeverance in Grace; but with diſtruſt or <hi>Doubt,</hi> whether men have the <hi>ordinary Meanes</hi> for attaining unto the <hi>Firſt</hi> or <hi>Second Grace.</hi> For of theſe <hi>Meanes</hi> they can be no more certain, no better aſſured then they are of the Prieſts Intention.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The former Extent of this <hi>Certaintie of ſalvation, to All true Believers,</hi> did give the foreſt blow to Reformed Religion, that ever it received; a <note place="margin">See Book 10. Fol. 3274. Where this Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor ſayes. 300. <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> 300 <hi>Valentiaes,</hi> could not do the Proteſtant Religion ſo much harm as Dr. <hi>Heſſels</hi> did, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this Doctrine.</note> wound more grievous than all our Adverſaries could have given it, had not her friends and lovers given them this Advantage.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Negative</hi> or <hi>Excluſive</hi> Interpretation of this place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as if all were <hi>Reprobates</hi> or without hope, which one time or other (after meanes of ſalvation have been offered) cannot aſſure themſelves of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate in Grace or Salvation, hath more deeply wounded the Conſciences of private men, then the conſciouſneſs of all their other miſ-deeds or practiſes. And the Doctrine is for this reaſon the more to be miſliked, for that it ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wounds ſuch as are of an <hi>humble and dejected ſpirit,</hi> and moſt afraid to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God either by unbelief, or by miſdeeds.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Both parts of my <hi>Concluſion,</hi> to wit, That <hi>This Doctrine admitteth either Doubt of ſalvation or Preſumption,</hi> will be made clear, or caſt upon you, from the Confluence of theſe <hi>two Errors</hi> mentioned, <hi>The One,</hi> which makes <hi>The Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of Salvation an Essential or reciprocal Property of Faith; The Other, which ranks all that have not this Aſſurance</hi> or <hi>Certaintie in the ſtate or condition of Reprobates;</hi> which is indeed but a Branch of another uſual <hi>Error</hi> (of which I muſt requeſt and admoniſh you to beware, in whomſoever you find it) of them, Who <hi>divide all mankind without Limitation into two ranks, into ſheep or goats, Reprobates.</hi> Though this be <hi>in due time and place</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of this Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſee Lib. 10. Fol. 3153, 3275.</note> moſt true, yet it is a truth much miſ-placed, if we make <hi>this Diviſion</hi> of all men before the hour of death, or day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>But you expect a clear Explication of the manner how theſe Two Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nurſe either a <hi>Doubt</hi> of Salvation or <hi>Preſumption,</hi> which is worſe then Doubt. Take it then <hi>Thus.</hi> If it were a Truth to be taught, or if it be taken as true, <hi>That whoſoever doth not attain unto the Certaintie of Salvation, is none of the Elect;</hi> or, <hi>That of all mankind the one ſort is irreviſibly ordained to life, the other irreverſibly ordained to death.</hi> Then, All ſuch, as have heard the Word preached, and received the Sacraments, and are not as yet aſſured that they are in the <hi>Eſtate of Grace</hi> or number of the <hi>Elect,</hi> muſt <hi>of neceſsitie doubt</hi> whether there be any poſsibility left for them to attain unto ſuch an Eſtate;
<pb n="3705" facs="tcp:32220:211"/>
or, whether they be not in the number of Reprobates. I know the uſual <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> to this <hi>Objection</hi> is, That albeit ſome men be irreverſibly appointed to death eternal before they be made part-takers of life temporal; yet becauſe it is unknown unto us, who they be that be thus ordained or appointed, therefore we muſt preach the Word and adminiſter the Sacraments indifferently to all, whom we ſee willing to hear the Word or receive the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>But all this doth no way diminiſh the former <hi>Doubt</hi> or diſtruſt in moſt hearers; for if it ſtill be true (as the former Doctrine ſuppoſeth) that ſome men, the farre greater part of men, which hear the Word preached, are <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſibly</hi> ordained to death, every man, which as yet apprehends not his own eſtate in Grace, or his Ordination to life eternal, cannot be Certain, muſt ſtill doubt, whether he be or ever ſhall be in the number of them, which are or ſhall be <hi>irreverſibly ordained</hi> to life. The Romiſh Church did never deny, but that the Prieſt may <hi>actually</hi> or <hi>virtually</hi> intend to do what the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points him to do, when he adminiſtreth the Sacraments. And yet, in as much as they teach withall, <hi>That if he do not intend to do as the Church of Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points him to do, the Sacramental Act is void,</hi> we hence juſtly charge their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with breeding or nurſing continual Diſtruſt or Doubt of Salvation. But if we withdraw or ſubſtract the <hi>Intention</hi> or purpoſe of God or of Chriſt, from concurring with the Word and Sacrament which we exhibit unto all, or from concurring with any part, or the greater part of men, we do neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breed a greater ſcruple, or nurſe a more dangerous Doubt of ſalvation in all men, as yet not effectually called, then the Romiſh Church doth. For <hi>Gods Intention</hi> or purpoſe to ſave men, is without all queſtion more Eſſential to the Efficacie of the Word preached, or of the Sacraments adminiſtred, then the Romiſh Church can conceive the <hi>Intention of her Prieſts</hi> to be. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this: If their <hi>Doctrine</hi> were true, who teach, <hi>That all ſuch men as in the iſſue prove Goats or Reprobates, were ſuch from their birth, or irreverſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated to death before they were born,</hi> God ſhould with-hold or withdraw his Purpoſe or <hi>Intention</hi> of Salvation from farre more hearers of the Word and partakers of the Sacraments, then the Romiſh Prieſts uſually do.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But, many (you will ſay) which hear the Word are already aſſured of their Eſtate in Grace, or of their ſalvation: And this Doctrine cannot occaſion any doubt or diſtruſt in them. It cannot indeed, whilſt they are thus perſwaded. But even this <hi>Perſwaſion it ſelf, if it be immature,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived before its time, doth ſecretly nurſe <hi>A Preſumption,</hi> which is far <note place="margin">See Book 10. Fol. 3262: and ſignes of the Time <hi>p.</hi> 63.</note> worſe then <hi>Doubt</hi> or diſtruſt of ſalvation: And ſometimes occaſions a worſe kinde of diſtruſt or Doubt, then the former doctrine of the Romiſh Church doth. For, ſuppoſe A man, which is to day <hi>ſtrongly perſwaded of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Eſtate in ſaving Grace,</hi> and certain of his ſalvation, ſhould to morrow or the next day fall into ſome groſſe or grievous ſin, and continue in it or the like for many dayes together. If his former aſſurance remain the ſame it was; it is <hi>No Aſſurance of Faith, No true Confidence</hi> but Preſumption. Or, if his former Confidence or Aſſurance upon conſciouſneſs of new ſins fail or abate: The <hi>Former Diviſion</hi> of All Mankinde into <hi>Goates</hi> and <hi>ſheep,</hi> into <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>Reprobates</hi> will thruſt him into Deſpere. For the Conſciouſneſſe of freedom from groſſer ſins, or of practiſe of good works cannot be a ſurer token of his <hi>Eſtate in Grace</hi> or ſalvation, then the conſciouſneſs of foul and grievous ſins is of Rejection or <hi>Reprobation,</hi> if it were true that every man is at all times either in the ſtate or condition of an <hi>Elect perſon</hi> or a <hi>Reprobate.</hi> For, The <hi>Rule of life and Faith</hi> is as plain and peremptory, that <hi>no Adulterer,</hi>
                  <pb n="3706" facs="tcp:32220:212"/>
                  <hi>no murtherer,</hi> no foul or grievous offender <hi>ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> as it is, That all ſuch as live a godly and a ſober life ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p>And yet our own conſciences can give a ſurer Teſtimony that we have committed groſſe and greivous ſins, then that they are cleanſed from the guilt of former ſins. Seeing the heart of man is more deceitful or more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable in its perſwaſions or Judgement of its good deeds or reſolutions then in its apprehenſion of groſſer facts committed by us. And for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I cannot perſwade my ſelf, That any man which hath any ſenſe or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>True Religion</hi> or rightly underſtands himſelf in theſe or the like Points, can, in the conſciouſneſs of groſſe and fouler ſins reſt perſwaded that he is <hi>in the ſame Eſtate of Grace</hi> wherein he was, or in the ſame way to life. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, even in the conſciouſneſs of fouleſt ſins he may and ought to have hope that he may be renewed by repentance. And yet to have ſuch an hope were impoſſible unleſſe he were perſwaded that there is a <hi>Mean</hi> or <hi>middle Eſtate</hi> or condition between the eſtate and condition of the <hi>Elect</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates.</hi>

Yet ſuch a man being called in queſtion for killing men uncondemned by Law, will not juſtifie his Action: If his inceſt be detected, he will be aſhamed of it; or being challenged for worſhipping ſtocks and ſtones, he will not allege any ſacred Authoritie for his warrant. But if you challenge a Romaniſt with ſome like practiſes, and tell him that he tranſgreſſeth the Law of God in thoſe particulars as grosſly as the Heathens do: his Reply will be, <hi>Though our facts be outwardly the ſame, yet our practiſes are moſt diſlike. Our practiſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be againſt the Law of God, ſeeing they are warranted by the authoritie of the Church and Pope, who is the faithful Interpreter of Gods Laws, and cannot erre in matters of faith or practice authorized by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the like caſe, if you ſhall oppoſe a man that makes himſelf <hi>thus certain of his ſalvation before his time,</hi> in this or the like manner, <q>Sir, you are as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, as great an oppreſſor of the poor, as uncharitable, as malitious, as proud and envious, as are the Heathen; or others whom you condemn for Infidels and no good Chriſtians;</q> And preſs him with ſuch evident par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in every kind, as would amate or appall an ingenuous Heathen, or other meer moral man that were conſcious of the like: yet you ſhall find him as <hi>ſurely locked up in his ſins,</hi> by this <hi>his immature perſwaſion of his own infallible eſtate in Grace,</hi> as the Romaniſt is by his <hi>Implicit Belief,</hi> or the Churches abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Infallibilitie.</hi> So long as this Perſwaſion laſts, <hi>that he ſhall certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> no Meſſenger of God ſhall ever perſwade him, that he hath done, or continues to do thoſe things, which whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to do ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

Unleſs Sathan had put <hi>this Fallacie</hi> upon ſome men in our times, it were impoſſible that they could ſleep upon the conſciouſneſs of ſuch uncivil behaviour as they uſe; or ſuch unjuſt aſperſions as they caſt upon all others, without reſpect of perſons, which diſſent from them in Opinions often diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between members of the ſame Church without diſſenſion. And of all the Points in Divinity this day controverted in any Church, or betwixt the members of any Church, there is no one that doth naturally better brook di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie of Opinions or acurate ſifting without hazard of breaking the bond of Chriſtian peace and charitie, then the Controverſie about <hi>the Certaintie of Salvation,</hi> or of Perſeverance in the ſtate of Grace.

               </p>
               <p>The only Queſtion is <hi>About the right</hi> or orderly <hi>placing of this Certaintie of Faith</hi> or full Aſſurance; Or <hi>What be the Points whereon it firſt muſt be pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe (queſtionleſs) muſt be <hi>Points Fundamental,</hi> and ſuch is that, <hi>That the Son of God did die for us,</hi> that he did fully pay the price of our Redemption. This, every man is <hi>firmly</hi> to beleive, otherwiſe he builds without a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>This Certainty of Faith</hi> or full aſſurance, you ſhall find continually preſt upon all hearers in the <hi>Book of Homilies, and other Acts of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how ſhall every private man be fully aſſured, that Chriſt did die for
<pb n="3708" facs="tcp:32220:213"/>
him, and that he fully paid the price of his redemption?</p>
               <p>Sure, no man can have a right or <hi>full aſſurance</hi> of <hi>this Particular,</hi> unleſs he firſt <hi>aſſuredly</hi> believe, <hi>that the Son of God did die for all men;</hi> that he hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>all mankind.</hi> He that firmly and conſtantly believes this Propoſition, in ſome reſpect <hi>univerſal [The Son of God did die for all men]</hi> can never doubt or waver in Faith, whether he died for him, or whether he hath paid the full Price of his Redemption. He which believes the <hi>General</hi> by an Hiſtorical or Moral Faith, cannot chuſe but believe the <hi>particular</hi> by the ſame Faith. He that believes the General by a ſpiritual and true Chriſtian Faith, muſt believe the particular by the ſame Faith. If the firſt Propoſition <hi>[Chriſt died for All men]</hi> be, <hi>De Fide,</hi> The Second likewiſe <hi>[Chriſt died for me]</hi> muſt be, <hi>De Fide,</hi> too.</p>
               <p>But how any man ſhould have <hi>Aſſurance of Faith,</hi> That Chriſt did die for him, or hath redeemed him, unleſs he be firſt aſſured by <hi>Certaintie of Faith,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt did die for all men:</hi> This, I confeſs, is a Point which I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be aſſured of, nor be ſatisfied in, by any that plead for <hi>Special Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Sure I am, that the Church our Mother doth teach us to begin our Faith or Aſſurance from the General, <hi>Christ died for All men, he hath redeemed all mankind,</hi> And this General She grounds upon that Saying of <hi>our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> The Appli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation or Uſe of this place you may find pithily preſt in the third Part of the <hi>Homily, Upon the Death and Paſsion of our Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom, ſaith the <hi>Author of the Homily,</hi> did he give his Son?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the whole world,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>to Adam and to all that come after him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was not given to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor to ſuch as come after him, until <hi>Adam,</hi> and all that came after him were loſt, until mankind were become his enemies. And this is that which ſets forth <hi>The wonderful love of God unto the world,</hi> that he would give his only Son, whom he loved, for all of us which were his enemies. <hi>Scarcely for a righteous man will one die,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>yet peradventure for a good man, ſome would even dare to die. But God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners he died for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. But when we are taught to beleive that Chriſt died as well for <hi>every one of us</hi> as he died for any, we are bound to beleive, not only that he ſhed as much blood for every one of us, as he did for <hi>St. Peter</hi> or <hi>St. Paul;</hi> but that he ſhed as much blood <hi>for every one of us</hi> as he did for <hi>all men.</hi> That he paid as great a price for my redemption, as he paid for the Redemption of all mankind. It was not the <hi>Quantitie</hi> of his blood ſhed, but the <hi>infinite Value</hi> of each drop which he ſhed that did pay the price of our Redemption. Had the whole ſtream of his blood been much greater then it was, if it had been <note place="margin">See <hi>Chapt.</hi> 4. <hi>Fol.</hi> 3338.</note> of value leſs then infinite, it could not have payed the price of one mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and of price more then infinite, his blood, what-ever quantitie had been ſhed, could not be for all. So that, <hi>he did as much for thee,</hi> as he did for <hi>both thee and me,</hi> as much for either of us, as he did for the whole world. His deſervings of every one of us are infinite. Were this apprehenſion or belief of the infinite and undivided love of God in Chriſt <hi>toward all and every man,</hi> rightly planted in mans heart, it would bring forth the fruits of Love; he which is thus perſwaded of Chriſts love towards him in particular, would love Chriſt, and would keep his Commandements, would truſt in Chriſt, and in all temptations rely upon him.</p>

14. To conclude all concerning <hi>The right ordering or placing of that Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie</hi> or full aſſurance, which is conteined in our belief of Chriſts Death and Paſſion.</p>
               <p>The firſt branch of it is, That, <hi>God by giving his only Son for us, did give us an ineſtimable pledge of his love to us in particular.</hi> This we muſt believe <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudine Fidei,</hi> by Certaintie of Faith. Upon this Foundation or Aſſurance of Faith, our Apoſtle builds another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9, 10. <hi>Much more then being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.

               <p>Theſe are the Prime Seeds of true Chriſtian Faith, and muſt be undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly planted in every mans heart, before he can be a fit Hearer, much leſs a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter in other Points of Divinitie, as of Election, Reprobation, &amp;c.

1. THe very worſt that the <hi>Jew or Chriſtian</hi> can object unto the Heathen, as <hi>Heathen,</hi> is the acknowledgement of many gods, or the adoring of ſtocks, of ſtones, or as <hi>Daniel</hi> enſtiles them, <hi>gods of gold, of ſilver, braſſe, iron, wood and ſtone.</hi> How beit even this Imagination of many <hi>gods</hi> (or the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of many imaginary gods) was but a Transfiguration or Transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>True and Only God</hi> into the ſimilitude of thoſe creatures, or viſible ſubſtances which they repreſented by the images which they worſhipped. This was the very height of heatheniſh Idolatry, as our Apoſtle inſtructs us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>They changed the glory of the incorruptible God,</hi> that is, of the only <note place="margin">Idolatry trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature into unfit ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes.</note> God, <hi>into an Image made like to corruptible man, and to birds and four-footed beaſts and creeping things.</hi> Of what things ſoever the images were which they did worſhip; they changed the glory of God into the ſimilitude of that thing whoſe Image they worſhipped; And by this means, as the Apoſtle inferres, ver. 25. <hi>they changed the truth of God into a lie, and worſhipped and ſerved the Creature more than the Creator, who is bleſſed for ever,</hi> So then, the Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Divine Nature into unfit ſimilitudes, is it, which muſt give us the True Scale or Scantling for meaſuring the haynouſneſs of that ſin which we call Idolatry. <hi>He that moſt groſly transforms, miſ-pictures, or changes the nature of the true and only God, is the moſt groſs Idolater; be he by profeſsion a Jew, a Turk, an Heathen, or a Chriſtian.</hi> And it was obſerved, and excellently proſecuted, by a Great Prelate, a moſt Reverend and Learned Biſhop in this Land, That the worſhipping of Images, and the worſhipping of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">The late R. R. <hi>Biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, B. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> in his Sermon on that Theme.</note> ſo the Imaginations and the Images be alike monſtrous or unfitting, come both to one Paſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the worſhipping of Images the Romiſh Church and the Heathens do (at leaſt for the outward Act) too well agree. And in this reſpect the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> are more averſe from the ancient Heathens, then the beſt in the Romiſh Church are. And if the ſinceritie of Gods worſhip did conſiſt in <hi>Negatives,</hi> as in not worſhipping the Images of any living thing; the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan</hi> or <hi>Jew</hi> might have the precedency of Reformed Churches. So farre are they from worſhipping Images, that they do not allow the making of Pictures, though for hiſtorical uſe. A Painter or Picture-maker is as execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a creature amongſt them, as a profeſſed <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Sarazen,</hi> or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of Idols is amongſt us. Yet are the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> notorious Idolaters, in that other main Branch, or rather Eſſential Root of Idolatry, that is, in worſhipping their own Imaginations; or in obſerving the Fables or Traditions of their Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>To omit then that Branch of Idolatry, which conſiſts in the worſhipping of Images, <hi>we muſt examine ourſelves</hi> (I mean we Chriſtians, whether Papiſts or Proteſtants) <hi>By our adherence to the Root of Idolatry,</hi> that is, the <hi>worſhipping</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> the root of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> See the fifth Book.</note> 
                  <hi>of Imaginations, or the Transformation of the Divine Nature into the ſimilitude of our corrupt deſires or affections.</hi> This is that which gave life and Being to the multiplicitie of imaginary gods amongſt the Heathens; And the Poyſon of this Idolatry may be more malignant in others then it was or is in them, for want of vent or iſſue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We of Reformed Churches rightly cenſure it as a Branch of heatheniſh Idolatry in the Romiſh Church, in that they teach the people to make ſolemn ſupplication unto Saints deceaſed, for their Interceſſion or mediation with God or Chriſt. And under this Cenſure fall all their prayers which they make in this or the like form, <hi>Sancta Maria, Sancte Petre, &amp;c. Ora pro nobis.</hi> Into this branch of Formal Idolatry they could not poſſibly ſlide, but through the other which properly conſiſts in the Transformation or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="3711" facs="tcp:32220:214"/>
of the Divine Nature into the ſimilitude of corruptible mans corrupt affections.</p>
               <p>Now how deeply that very Church is tainted with this Idolatry, Her own Plea for practiſing the former Branch, in praying unto Saints, will give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt them. For the beſt warrant which her Sons can pretend unto, to miſ-perſwade the multitude or vulgar, is this, <q>That <hi>God is a Great King, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> and therefore good manners requires that we do not preferre our Petitions immediately unto him, but uſe the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or interceſſion of deceaſed Saints, which are in greater favour with him, then we wretched ſinners are.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now by this very Imagination or Conceit, they transform the glorious Majeſtie of the inviſible God, and of his Chriſt, into the ſimilitude of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal men, of men though greater in power and Majeſtie then other men are, yet (for the moſt part) not ſo good as they themſelves are great, not ſo inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to poor mens Peritions, nor ſo compaſſionate of their miſeries as meaner <note place="margin">☜</note> men are. Or if by nature, breeding, or civil education, theſe great Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the world, be more affable or compaſſionate then other men are; yet are they not able to give diſpatch to half the Petitions that would be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, if every man might be admitted to be his own ſpokeſman, or to have immediate acceſs unto their preſence. However to compare God or his Chriſt in the Audience of our prayers unto the beſt and wiſeſt Kings that ever lived on earth, or to make the manner of preferring Petitions unto Potentates, as a patern for preferring prayers and ſupplications unto the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, is at the beſt but a Branch of Heatheniſm, <hi>A manifeſt transformation of the Divine Nature into the ſimilitude of mortal man.</hi> And the Romaniſt, both by this Practiſe and this Plea for it, doth evidently condemn himſelf in that wherein he judgeth the Heathen.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But would to God the Romaniſt alone did in this Particular condemn himſelf in thoſe things wherein he judgeth others, or that it were a common Error unto him, with the Mahumetan and the Jew, who though they abhorre Images more then he doth, yet they commit abominable ſacrilege which is equivalent to Idolatry in transforming the nature of the true God into the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of their own Imaginations. But beſides all theſe <hi>I am to give you notice of ſome in Reformed Churches</hi> (and <hi>private Warning</hi> as occaſion ſhall ſerve of ſome Writers in this Church where we live, but no way authorized by it) which commit the ſame error which they ſo much condemn in the Romaniſt.</p>
               <p>The Romaniſt (as you heard before) transformes or changes <hi>the nature of the incorruptible God, and of Chriſt himſelf, into the ſimilitude of earthly Kings</hi> and Monarchs, yet not of cruel and prodigious Tyrans. But theſe Writers whom I mean, (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> object, and the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> prove) trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <note place="margin">Some Writers, not Papiſts, transform the Divine Nature</note> the Majeſtie and glory of the immortal God into the ſimilitude of cruel Tyrans, yea of ſuch baſe and ſordid Pedants (as the meaneſt amongſt you would diſdain, ſhould have any authoritie over your children) that is, ſuch as delight more in puniſhing and correcting them, then to direct or amend them in learning or manners. For ſo ſome late Writers have expreſly taught, <hi>That the Almighty maker of all things doth as immediately as primarily and directly ordain ſome men to damnation, as he doth others unto life; that he delights as much in the exerciſe of punitive Juſtice, as he doth in the exerciſe of goodneſs, mercy, love, and bounty. That as by his determinate Decree he created ſome to be Elect veſſels of Honour for the manifeſtation of his Goodneſs: So by the ſame irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Decree, he ordains others to be veſſels of diſhonour, for the manifeſtation of his</hi>
                  <pb n="3712" facs="tcp:32220:215"/>
                  <hi>Juſtice.</hi> As if the manifeſtation of his <hi>Juſtice punitive,</hi> or vengeance (for that Juſtice they mean) were as neceſſary from Eternity as the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Mercy and Goodneſſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe and the like <hi>inconſiderate Tenets,</hi> which I forbear further to proſecute or rehearſe, did give, if not <hi>iuſt Occaſion,</hi> yet colourable <hi>Pretence,</hi> and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity unto the <hi>Lutheran Churches,</hi> for breaking off all League or Amitie with ſome other <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> becauſe, as they conceived, <hi>either they did not agree with them in the worſhip of the ſame God,</hi> or transformed Gods nature into the ſimilitude of his Enemie, into hatred and crueltie it ſelf. Now the beſt way to ſtop their mouthes, or to make up <hi>that Breach</hi> which the Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome inconſiderate men have made, would be <hi>to diſclaim their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as the moſt learned in other <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> have ſolemnly done. For ſo, <hi>that Great Light of the Heilderbergh Church,</hi> whileſt it flouriſhed, <note place="margin">Paraeus.</note> and he with it (for Both were in a manner extinguiſhed together) being chalenged by two Jeſuites that came to viſit him, profeſſing withall, that they would uſe the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> weapons to make their challenge good, <hi>For making God the Author of ſin,</hi> did in the Cloſe or iſſue ſtand upon this defence, <hi>That however this</hi> (perchance) might be <hi>Calvins Error,</hi> yet it was not <hi>Error Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſtarum,</hi> no General Error of the Calviniſts, as the Jeſuite objected. For, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Book</hi> 10. <hi>Fol.</hi> 3012.</note> as for <hi>Paraeus</hi> himſelf, albeit he could well brook to be accounted a <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,</hi> that is an adherer unto, or <hi>A Maintainer of Calvines Doctrine</hi> in other Points: yet <hi>in this particular concerning Reprobation,</hi> he did rather accord with <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine</hi> (and many others in the Romiſh Church) then with <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf. That he did not ſo well like of <hi>Calvines Opinion</hi> in this particular, or (at leaſt) <hi>his manner of expreſsing his Opinion,</hi> there is no man of learning or underſtanding that wiſhes well either to the memory of <hi>Calvin,</hi> or to the weal of <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> but will commend <hi>Paraeus</hi> his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ingenuity. But that <hi>this Good Author,</hi> ſhould like better of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bellarmines Opinion, then of Calvines,</hi> in this Point, I for my part commend his <hi>Ingenuity</hi> more then his <hi>Judgment.</hi> For if as good a Scholar as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> was, would take the pains to examine his Opinion as ſtrictly as he hath done <hi>Calvines,</hi> it would quickly appear, to be for <hi>Qualitie</hi> the very ſame, if not worſe, however for the <hi>Extent</hi> it may ſeem more tolerable.</p>
               <p>Both of them were to blame in taking upon them to determine the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner how God doth reprobate;</hi> And it is a matter of no <hi>Difficulty</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them both: But a greater <hi>Preſumption</hi> to determine any <hi>third manner</hi> diſtinct from both. Only this in <hi>General,</hi> is moſt certain, that ſeeing <hi>Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an Ordination unto death,</hi> no man <hi>is reprobated but for ſin.</hi> But, as it is not the Carpenter or Statuary, not he that works in ſtone, in wood, or braſs, which makes an Idol, for whileſt the work is under their tooles, it is an image or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue only: <hi>He which ſets it up or adores it, makes it an Idol.</hi> So this Opinion of Reprobation how harſh ſoever, yet whileſt <hi>Calvin, Bradwardine,</hi> or perhaps <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> did handle it, it was an Error only, or falſe Imagination. They who now would make it a <hi>Fundamental Point of Faith,</hi> or inſert it in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſmes, make it an Hereſie or worſe then an hereſie, an idolatrous or blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Imagination.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But admit all of us were free from transformation of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> all of us Orthodoxal in matter of opinion concerning the Attributes of God or of Chriſt, yet all this would not free us from another branch of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry as rife and luxuriant amongſt other Chriſtians, whether of the Romiſh or of Reformed Churches, as it was amongſt the Heathens, or is at this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Infidels: For, we may rob God of his honour no leſs then the
<pb n="3713" facs="tcp:32220:215"/>
Heathens or Infidels do, without any Idol or Image, without miſ-forming or miſ-picturing him in his Attributes. And our Apoſtle at the 22. verſe of this Chapter hath made the robbing or deſpoiling God of his honour equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to that branch of Idolatry which conſiſts in the adoration of Idols, <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit ſacrilege,</hi> or doſt thou rob <hi>God of his honour.</hi> The word in the Original extends to both, to all the branches of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry. Every one which adoreth Idols, takes that honour which is due to the only true God, and beſtows it on that which is not God: Yet in ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it they did offer it to a Divine power as they imagined it; They did not reſerve it to themſelves; Though ſelf-love or indulgence to corrupt deſire was the original of this Idolatry, or alienation of Gods Worſhip: the Idol was their partner.</p>
               <p>Now if any who is called a Chriſtian, give the ſame indulgence to his own corrupt deſires, as the Heathen did, he robs God of his honour no leſſe then they.</p>
               <p>Thus the Jews, who after their return from <hi>Babylon</hi> detained their Tithes and Offerings, were convinced by Gods Prophets, by God himſelf, who taught his Prophets thus to convince them, of as groſs Idolatry as any Heathens had committed. For the Heathens made a conſcience of ſpoiling their Gods, ſo did not <hi>Iſrael.</hi> That which their idolatrous Fore-fathers took from the true God, they offered unto the Queen of Heaven, unto other imaginary gods and goddeſſes: the later Jews ſpare this coſt, and appropriate all unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now that Idolatry which a man commits with himſelf, or the Alienation of that which is due to God, unto his own corrupt deſires, is of all others the <note place="margin">☜</note> worſt, for it is alwayes mixt with pride, or irreligion, which is worſe then ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</p>

               <p>Firſt, That the ſacrifices or ſolemn ſervices, which the Heathens performed unto their ſeveral gods, were but as ſo many luxuriant branches or <hi>excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of their own corrupt deſires, or of ſecret references to themſelves, we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hence, That every Nation or Province did principally affect the ſervice of that god or goddeſs, which in the common eſteem of thoſe ignorant times was beſt able to ſatisfie their longing deſires, or to give a temporal bleſſing to their labours.</p>
               <p>Though there were many which were called gods, and goddeſſes many: Yet unto the Inhabitants of the Iſle of <hi>Sicily</hi> there was in a manner but one goddeſs, that was <hi>Ceres,</hi> the ſuppoſed Patroneſſe of Corn.</p>
               <p>What was the reaſon?</p>
               <p>The revenues of that Iſland or Province, did moſt conſiſt in the fruitful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Corn, and hence were that people more deſirous to pleaſe, more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to offend this imaginary goddeſſe, then any other Divine Powers. She in a manner had the monopolie of their Devotions.</p>
               <p>The ſame Devotion and ſerviceable reſpects which the <hi>Sicilians</hi> profeſt to <hi>Ceres,</hi> the <hi>Baeotians</hi> (a people of <hi>Greece)</hi> performed to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Patron or Protector of Vines. Of <hi>Ceres</hi> they made as ſmall account, as the <hi>Sicilians</hi> did of <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What was the reaſon?</p>
               <p>The cheif Commodity which their Country naturally afforded, was Wine; A good harveſt did not much advance their Fortunes, nor a bad one much impair them. Their expectation was a ſeaſonable and fruitful Vintage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3714" facs="tcp:32220:216"/>
The <hi>Athenians</hi> eſteemed little of either of theſe gods, but held <hi>Minerva</hi> in more eſteem then the <hi>Sicilians</hi> did <hi>Ceres,</hi> or the <hi>Baeotians</hi> did <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What was the reaſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minerva</hi> was reputed the goddeſs of Wiſdom, the nurſe and foundreſs of thoſe Arts and Sciences, wherein the <hi>Athenians</hi> (their territories being for Corn and Wine but barren) did moſt delight. And ſo they might excell <note place="margin">See Book the Fifth.</note> others in wit, in learning and politick wiſdom, they cared not much for land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities.</p>
               <p>The Ancient <hi>Gaules</hi> (a people which inhabited that Country which we now call <hi>France,</hi> with the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and thoſe parts of <hi>Germany</hi> which are on this ſide the <hi>Rheine)</hi> were as peculiarly devoted unto <hi>Mercury,</hi> as the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians</hi> were to <hi>Ceres,</hi> the <hi>Baeotians</hi> unto <hi>Bacchus,</hi> or the <hi>Athenians</hi> unto <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> or <hi>Pallas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What was the reaſon?</p>
               <p>They were greedy of that gain which ariſeth from the exerciſe of traffique or merchandize, and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the fooliſh divinity of thoſe ignorant times, was a god of cunning or of wit in bargaining; a god, that, being well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, could teach them how to over-reach others, rather then to be over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Cyprus</hi> being by natural diſpoſition, and long cuſtom inclined unto wantonneſs, made choice of <hi>Venus</hi> for their Patroneſs.</p>
               <p>Other Cities and Provinces, whoſe livelihood and maintenance did conſiſt (as the <hi>Netherlands</hi> now do) in traffick by Sea, had <hi>Neptune</hi> in greateſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and admiration.</p>
               <p n="8">8. All theſe inſtances do clearly teſtifie, that the worſhipping of every Idol or of the imaginary power which it repreſented, was but an <hi>excreſcence</hi> or ſhute of ſome internal immoderate deſire. Now as the Schools ſay, <hi>Ubi unum propter aliud, ibi unum tantum;</hi> He that deſires Phyſick for healths ſake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deſires his health rather then the Phyſick; So it is again true, He that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to <hi>Ceres</hi> for a plentiful harveſt, to <hi>Bacchus</hi> for a fruitful vintage, or to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> for wit, did indeed reſpectively ſacrifice to his own deſire of gain or of cunning wit, or to ſome one or other corrupt deſire or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> (as our Apoſtle tels us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5.) <hi>is Idolatry.</hi> And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour cals it the <hi>Service of Mammon,</hi> The imaginary god of riches. Whence it will by good Logick follow, that <hi>he which is moſt covetous, is</hi> the greateſt Idolater in this kind, that is, <hi>the greateſt ſerver of Mammon,</hi> albeit he do not ſerve him in or by an Idol or Image. For the <hi>Idol</hi> is but an <hi>Acceſſary</hi> to this foul ſin, the <hi>Principal</hi> is the internal corrupt imagination or deſire. He that can cheat without a Broker, is never a whit the honeſter man then he which uſeth his help, but rather (as the Proverb is) a more crafty knave; or as he is a more cunning theif which can ſteal without an out-putter or receiver, then he which alwayes is inforced to uſe the help of one or other: So he that robs God of his honour (whether by poſitive ſacrilege, or by detention of that from him which is his due) though this he do without an Image or an Idol to be his partner, is as great an Idolater as the Heathens were. For he ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that unto his own Imaginations or deſires which the Heathens did unto their imaginary powers.</p>
               <p>To come to particulars.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If Merchants or Tradeſmen be as greedily ſet upon their gain as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Gauls</hi> were, which offered ſacrifice unto <hi>Mercury,</hi> they are no leſs grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Idolaters then they were. If this corrupt affection be as immoderate in
<pb n="3715" facs="tcp:32220:216"/>
Chriſtians as it was in Heathens, it will be of like force to withdraw their hearts, as it was to withdraw the hearts of the Heathen from the only true God: of like force to ſway them to as greivous tranſgreſſion of the firſt and cheif Commandement, as the Heathens could commit any againſt it. For impoſſible it is, they ſhould love God with all their heart, with any greater part of their heart, then the Heathens did, if their hearts be as ſtrongly ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on riches and worldly commodities, as the Heathens were. And ſo much of our love and heart as is withdrawn and alienated from God, is a detention or robbing him of his honour, it skils not much on whom it be beſtowed, ſo it be utterly alienated from him: The god of this world will place it where he liſt. But if the inordinate deſire of gain do miſ-ſway men, by profeſſion Chriſtians, to uſe deceit in bargaining, to over-reach their Neighbors; or to work their own advantage out of their brethrens miſeries or neceſſities, they tranſgreſſe the ſecond great Commandement as grievouſly as the Heathen did, the ſum whereof you know is, to love our Neighbors as our ſelves, to do to all as we deſire to be done unto. And by the manner and meaſure of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing theſe two great Commandements (on which the whole Law and Prophets hang) the true meaſure, as of Idolatry, ſo of all other ſins, muſt be taken.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If we ſhould take an unpartial ſurvey of all the ſeveral ſorts or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men throughout this Land, and of their demeanors in their ſeveral callings: What root or branch of goodneſs is there wherein we can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to overtop many Heathen Nations, unleſs it be in point of Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion? But theſe we know without correſpondencie in practiſe of good life, will be ſo farre from juſtifying us in reſpect of the Heathens or Infidels, that they will more deeply condemn us. Covetouſneſs, deceit and violences were not more rife amongſt private Heathens, then they are with us. If op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſerve, <hi>Homo homini fit lupus,</hi> every one is as a ſnare or gin unto his neighbor. The Remedy which God hath appointed for this enormitie are publick Laws and Courts of Juſtice. And yet if the greivances, which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men ſuffer from one another, were put in one ſcale, and the greivances, which befal them from the corruptions of Courts appointed to do them right (whether theſe be Civil or Eccleſiaſtick) were put in the contrary Scale, it would be hard to determine, whether ſort of greivances would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poize others. And if the remedie prove worſe then the diſeaſe, what hope of health? As for drunkenneſs, ryot and other prophaneneſs, theſe were not ſo rife in many Heathen Nations, as they are now in moſt Chriſtian States, becauſe for the moſt part more ſeverely puniſhed amongſt them then they are with us, and yet I pray God that the ſins of the Pulpit and of the Printing-houſe may be found much lighter then the ſins of the Play-houſe or the Tavern, &amp;c. when the great Moderator of Heaven and Earth ſhall weigh them in the Balance of his un-erring Juſtice. This is certain, that notorious delinquents almoſt in every other kind are aſhamed to juſtifie themſelves when their facts come to light; their very Conſorts will not be their Advocates when they are proved againſt them. Whereas many popular Sermons and Treatiſes, albeit ful ſtuft with Characters of more then Heatheniſh pride, hatred, malice, ſedition and ſcurrilitie paſs for currant amongſt the factions Conſorts, as containing rare expreſſions of fervent zeal in Gods cauſe, and of ſincere love to true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And if the light of the body be dark, how great muſt the darkneſs of that body be?</p>
               <p n="11">11. In drunkenneſs, in gluttony, in wantonneſs, and other branches of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, ſome Heathen Nations in former ages haply have exceeded
<pb n="3716" facs="tcp:32220:217"/>
us; But in this publick and farre ſpreading licentiouſneſs of tongues and pens in bitter invectives againſt their brethren, in audacious libelling againſt lawful Superiors, no Age before the Art of Printing was invented could, no State or Nation ſince the invention of that Art hath exceeded or may compare with thoſe times wherein, and thoſe people with whom we live.</p>
               <p>But admit the faults or delinquencies of our time were but equal to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquencies of the Heathen: yet as that ancient and religious Writer <hi>Salvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> well obſerves, Though the vices of the Heathens and the Chriſtians were but equal, yet the ſame vices, are more criminous and ſcandalous in Chriſtians then they can be in the Heathen. If the Heathens were prophane, were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, were diſſolute, licentious or diſobedient, what great matter is it? they never heard of <hi>A Redemption from this vain converſation to be purchaſed at ſo high a rate as with the pretious blood of the only Son of God:</hi> They never were called ſolemnly to vow integrity of life and converſation, as a ſervice due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Lord which had redeemed them. All this we have done, and yet have left our Maſters will (which we vowed to do) altogether undone, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do the will of his Enemie with as great alacrity and fidelity as the Infidels or Heathens do.</p>
               <p>Again, the Heathens had no expectation of any gratious immortal reward for well-doing: they feared no dreadful doom or ſentence after death, for the errors or miſ-doings of this mortal life. But we ever ſince we learned the ten Commandements and our Creed, have been hedged in on the right hand and on the left, on the right hand with hopes of a moſt bleſſed everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, on the left hand with fear of an endleſs and never-dying death: and yet have tranſgreſſed theſe bounds, have on both hands out-rayed as licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly as the Heathens did.</p>
               <p>Surely one ſpecial reaſon, why after ſo long, ſo much good preaching, there is ſo little practice of good life, ſo much licentiouſneſs in the wayes of death, is, becauſe we Preachers do not maintain that double hedge which Chriſt hath ſet us for keeping us in order, that is, we do not preſs the fear of death and hope of life everlaſting, ſo forcibly and ſeaſonably as we ought and might.</p>
               <p>Now theſe meditations of everlaſting life, and everlaſting death, are the points whereunto theſe diſcuſſions upon this Text have been praemiſed. God grant you docile hearts, and me the Spirit of Grace and Underſtanding for rectifying your hopes and fears of your final reward in that laſt and dreadful Day.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Points moſt conſiderable in the ſurvey of this Text are Three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, The Plain and <hi>Literal ſenſe,</hi> which wholly depends upon the <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>

                     <hi>Three points</hi> conſiderable.</note> 
                  <hi>Circumſtances</hi> as well precedent as ſubſequent.</p>
               <p>Second, The <hi>Emblematical Portendment of that prodigious fact,</hi> which did provoke this dying Prieſt and Prophet of <hi>the Lord</hi> to utter theſe words. Or which is all one, The fulfilling of his imprecation according to the <hi>Myſtical ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Third, The diſcuſſion of ſuch <hi>Caſes of Conſcience</hi> or controverſed Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as are naturally emergent out of the <hi>Myſtical</hi> or <hi>Literal ſenſe,</hi> and are uſeful for this preſent or future Ages.</p>
               <p>To begin with the <hi>Circumſtance of the time</hi> wherein they were uttered; <note place="margin">The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time.</note> That apparently was <hi>the dayes of King Joaſh,</hi> Heir and Succeſſor unto <hi>Ahazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> who was next Succeſſor ſave one unto good <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> by lineal direct deſcent; but no Succeſſor at all to him in vertue, or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or happineſs of Government For <hi>Ahaziah</hi> was <hi>Peſsimi patris haud melier proles,</hi> a very wicked ſon of a moſt wicked father, and too hard to ſay whether he or his Father <hi>Jehoram</hi> were the <hi>worſe</hi> King or more unfortunate Governour. But <hi>Joaſh</hi> the Orphan Son of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> hath the Teſtimonie of the Spirit of God, <hi>That he ruled well whilſt Jehiiada the High-Prieſt did live,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 2. And his zeal to the Houſe of the Lord (recorded at large in this chapter, as alſo in the 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 4.) was ſo great, as more could not be expected or conceived, either of <hi>Jehoſhaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> or good <hi>Joſiah.</hi> And thus he continued from the ſeventh year of his Age until the five or ſix and
<pb n="3718" facs="tcp:32220:218"/>
thirtieth at the leaſt. A competent time (a man would think) for a full and firm growth in goodneſs.</p>
               <p>But amongſt the Sons and Succeſſors of <hi>David,</hi> we may obſerve, that ſome begun their Reign very well and ended ill: Others, being extream bad in their beginning, did end better then the other begun. So <hi>Manaſſes</hi> in the beginning and middle of his Reign, filled the City with innocent blood, and died a Penitentiary. This preſent King <hi>Joaſh</hi> begun and continued his Reign for thirty years or thereabouts <hi>in the ſpirit,</hi> but ended <hi>in the fleſh</hi> (or rather in blood) leaving a perpetual ſtain upon the Throne and Race of <hi>David.</hi> This ſtrange Apoſtacie or Revolt argues, that his fore-mentioned goodneſs and zeal unto the Houſe of the Lord was Adventitious, and not truly rooted in his own breſt. That the fair Lineaments of a pious man and noble Prince were drawn not by his own skill, but by the manuduction of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High-Prieſt; as Children oft-times make fair letters while their Tutors guide their hands, but ſpatter, and blot, and daſh, after they be left to their own gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jehoiada</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>waxed old, and was full of dayes: an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died, and they buried him in the City of David among the Kings, becauſe he had done good in Iſrael, both towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſolemnization of his death was a ſtrong Argument of the reſpect and love which both Prince and People did bear unto him whilſt he lived; and much happier might both of them have been, had they continued the ſame reſpect, unto his Son and Succeſſor. But they buried their love unto <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and (which was worſt) the zeal which he had taught unto the Houſe of God, in his Grave. For ſo it followeth, verſe 17, 18. <hi>Now after the death of Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da came the Princes of Iudah and made obeyſance to the King; Then the King hearkened unto them, and he left the Houſe of the Lord God of their Fathers, and ſerved Groves and Idols.</hi> Yet Gods love to them doth not determine with the beginning of their hate unto the Houſe of God and to his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. <hi>For notwithſtanding that wrath came upon Iudah and Ieruſalem for this their treſpaſſe, yet he ſent Prophets to them to bring them again to the Lord; and they teſtified againſt them but they would not give ear. And the Spirit of the Lord came upon</hi> (or cloathed) <hi>Zechariah the Son of Iehoiada the Prieſt, who ſtood above the people and ſaid unto them, Thus ſaith God: Why tranſgreſs ye the Commandement of the Lord that ye cannot proſper? Becauſe ye have forſaken the Lord he hath alſo forſaken you. And they conſpired againſt him, and ſtoned him with ſtones at the Commandment of the King, in the Court of the Houſe of the Lord. Thus Ioaſh the King remembred not the kindneſs which Jehoiada his father had done unto him, but ſlew his Son, and when he dyed he ſaid</hi> (or, inter moriendum, dixit) <hi>The Lord look upon it, and require it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But did the Lord hearken to him, or require his blood at the Kings and Princes hands which ſlew him?</p>
               <p>Yes! that he did; oftner then once. For it was required of their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: But for the preſent he did viſit both the King and his Princes moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably, by an unexpected Army of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> unto whoſe Idolatrous Rites they had now conformed themſelves, complying too well with them, and with their neighbors the Heathen, in all ſorts of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Polititian</hi> will reply, That the <hi>Syrians</hi> did upon other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons intend to do ſome miſcheif to the King, the Princes and People of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi> For it was never unuſual to that Nation to vex or moleſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi>

               <p>Secondly, There lies open a ſpacious field for ſuch as affect to expatiate in <hi>Common Places</hi> or dilate upon that Old Maxim, <hi>Laici ſemper ſunt infenſi Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricis,</hi> to tax the inveterate enmity of ſecular men againſt the <hi>Clergie.</hi> Whoſe violent out burſtings into <hi>Prodigious Outrages,</hi> did never more clearly appear then in the wicked ſuggeſtions of the Princes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> unto infortunate King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> againſt this Godly High-Prieſt <hi>Zechariah</hi> for his zeal unto the Houſe and ſervice of the God of their Fore-fathers. But however the like prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cruelty had not been exemplified before this time, yet in many later ages, the <hi>Prelacie or Clergie</hi> have not come an inch ſhort of theſe Lay-Princes in working and animating Kings and ſupream Magiſtrates to exerciſe like ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and oppreſſing cruelty, not upon Laicks only, but upon their Godly and religious Prieſts, or inferior Clergie.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtories almoſt of all Ages and Nations, ſince the death of <hi>Maurice the Emperor</hi> unto this laſt Generation, will be ready to teſtifie, whenſoever they ſhall be heard or read, more then I have ſaid, againſt the <hi>Romiſh Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> whoſe continual practiſes have been, to make Chriſtian Kings the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of their furious ſpleen againſt their own Clergie, or neighbor Princes; or to ſtirre up the rebellion of Lay-ſubjects, againſt all ſuch of their Leige-Lords or Soveraigns as would not ſubmit themſelves, their Crowns and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, or (which is more) their Conſciences unto <hi>Peters pretended Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſum of all I have to ſay concerning this Point, is This; As there ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="3720" facs="tcp:32220:219"/>
have been any very Good Kings, or extraordinary happy in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (whether in the line of <hi>David,</hi> or in Chriſtian Monarchies) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advice and aſſiſtance of a Learned and Religious Clergie; ſo but a few have proved extremely bad without the ſuggeſtions of covetous, corrupt or ambitious Prieſts. So that the ſafeſt way for chief Governors is, to keep as vigilant and ſtrong Guards upon their own breſts and conſciences, as they do about their bodies or palaces.</p>
               <p>Now the ſpecial and ſafe guard which they can entertain for their ſouls and conſciences is, <hi>to lay to heart the Examples of Gods dealing with former Princes,</hi> with the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> eſpecially, according to the eſteem or reverence, or the diſ-eſteem which they did bear unto his Laws and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another ſpecial meanes to ſecure even Greateſt Monarches from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Gods wrath or revenging hand, is, not to hearken unto, not to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate too much upon, or at leaſt not to miſconſtrue a Doctrine very frequent in all Ages, to wit, <hi>That Kings and ſupreme Magiſtrates are not ſubject to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any other men, nor to the coercive authoritie of humane Laws.</hi> The Doctrine, I dare not, I cannot in conſcience deny, to be moſt true and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxal. And for the truth of it, I can add one Argument more then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; That Gods judgments in all Ages or Nations, <hi>have not been</hi> more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently executed by <hi>Counter-paſsion</hi> or <hi>Retaliation</hi> upon any ſort or ſtate of men then upon Kings, or Princes, or greateſt Potentates which pollute their Crowns and Dignities with innocent blood (as King <hi>Joaſh</hi> did) or with other like out-crying ſins. As if the moſt Juſt and Righteous Lord <hi>by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Examples</hi> tending to this purpoſe would give the world to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That <hi>none are fit to exerciſe Iuriſdiction upon Kings or Princes beſides himſelf;</hi> and withall, to inſtruct even <hi>Greateſt Monarchs,</hi> that their Exemption from all Controulment of humane Laws, cannot exempt or priviledge them from the immediate judgement of his own hands, or from the contrivance of his juſt puniſhments by the hands of others as by his inſtruments, though <hi>his Enemies Agents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I forbear to produce more inſtances of <hi>Divine Retaliation</hi> upon moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign <note place="margin">Touching <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation,</hi> ſee the 6.

A prodigious liberty or licence for a King to Grant, and more furiouſly executed by the Princes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> his <hi>Patentees</hi> or <hi>Commiſsioners</hi> for this purpoſe. And yet the moſt righteous Judge of all the world, did neither animate nor authorize the Prophets, Prieſts, or Levites, or other cheif men in this Kingdom to be the avengers of Blood, or to execute judgement upon the King or Princes of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſervice in Divine Wiſdom and Juſtice was delegated to the <hi>Syrians</hi> their neighbor Nation. And the Hoaſt, not by their own skill or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, but by the diſpoſition of Divine Providence, did <hi>Geometrically and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly proportion the execution of vengeance to the quality and manner of the fact.</hi> The Princes of <hi>Iudah</hi> who had murthered <hi>Zechariah</hi> in the Courts of the Temple of <hi>the Lords</hi> Houſe, were all deſtroyed by the <hi>Syrian</hi> Hoaſt in their own Land, and the ſpoil of their Palaces ſent unto the King of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> And King <hi>Ioaſh</hi> (by whoſe authority <hi>Zechariah</hi> was ſtoned to death in his <hi>Pue</hi> or Pulpit) after the <hi>Syrians</hi> had grievouſly afflicted him, was ſlain in his own Palace, upon the bed of his deſired or appointed reſt, by the hands of
<pb n="3721" facs="tcp:32220:219"/>
two of his own ſervants; yet neither of them <hi>by birth his native Subject;</hi> the one the ſon of an <hi>Ammoniteſs,</hi> the other of a <hi>Moabiteſs;</hi> both the illegitimate off-ſpring of two of the worſt ſort of aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all this appears the <hi>ſpecial finger of God.</hi> But though all this were done by Gods appointment; yet may we no way juſtifie the conſpiracy of <hi>Ioaſh</hi> his own ſervants againſt him, though both aliens, unleſs we knew what ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all warrant they had for the execution of Gods judgments, which are alwayes moſt juſt. However, we have neither warrant nor reaſon to exclaim <hi>againſt</hi> them or their ſins, ſo farre or ſo much, as by the warrant of Gods Word we might <hi>againſt</hi> the Princes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> for the inſtigating of their lawful King or Liege-Lord to practice ſuch prodigious cruelty (as hath been expreſt) upon <hi>Zechariah</hi> the Lords High-Prieſt; or <hi>againſt</hi> the diſpoſition of the ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked Jewiſh Nation in general, <hi>moſt perſpicuous for the Criſis</hi> at that time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But to exclaim againſt the Princes or People of that Age we need not; for their poſterity hath amplified the <hi>curſed Circumſtances</hi> of this moſt <hi>horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fact;</hi> and charged theſe their fore-fathers with ſuch a meaſure of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as <hi>No Orator this day living,</hi> without their directions or inſtructions could have done. <hi>Septies in die cadit juſtus, The juſt man fals ſeven times a day,</hi> was an ancient and an authentick <hi>Saying,</hi> if meant at all by the Author of it, <hi>of ſins and delinquences,</hi> rather then of <hi>croſſes and greivances</hi> which fall upon them, or into which they fall, was never meant of <hi>Groſſer ſins</hi> or tranſgreſſions. But of that dayes work wherein <hi>Zechariah</hi> was ſlain theſe later Jews ſay: <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem tranſgreſsiones fecit Iſrael in illo die.</hi> I ſhall not over-Engliſh their meaning if I render it thus, <hi>Iſrael that very day committed ſeven deadly ſins at once,</hi> that is, without interpoſition or intervention of any good work or thought.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They allege, <hi>Zechariah</hi> was their High Prieſt, and to kill a Prieſt, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Cluſter of Deadly Sins</hi> in the Horrible murther of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> the High-Prieſt.</note> though of inferior rank, was a ſin amongſt all Nations, more then equivalent to the killing of a meer ſecular Potentate. A ſin ſometimes more unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then any ſin could be committed within this Kingdom, beſides the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Allom.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As theſe Jews allege, <hi>Zechariah was a Prophet;</hi> and to kill a Prophet, was the next degree of compariſon in iniquity unto the laying of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent hands upon Kings and Princes, for he which forbid <hi>To touch his annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> did alſo forbid <hi>to do his Prophets any harm,</hi> both are given in the ſame charge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Zechariah</hi> was a ſecond Magiſtrate among his People: and to kill a prime Magiſtrate is more then murther: or at leaſt a mixture of <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, This Prieſt and great Magiſtrate (by the Teſtimony of their ſons who murthered him) was upright and entire in the diſcharge of all his Offices, and a man unblemiſhed for his life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they polluted the Courts of the Lords Houſe, within whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts <hi>Zechariahs</hi> bloud was ſhed, without ſuch reverence to the place, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada</hi> his Father upon a farre greater exigencie, for the preſervation of <hi>Ioaſh</hi> and his Kingdom did obſerve. For he would not ſuffer <hi>Athaliah,</hi> though guilty of murther of the Royal Seed, and of high Treaſon againſt the Crown of <hi>David,</hi> to be put to death within the Courts of the Temple, but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to be killed at the Gates of the Kings Houſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3722" facs="tcp:32220:220"/>
Sixthly, As theſe <hi>Iewiſh Rabbins</hi> obſerve; Their fore-fathers polluted the Sabbath of the Lord, for on a Sabbath day (as it is probable, not from their teſtimony only, but from the Text) <hi>Zachariah</hi> was thus mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
               <p>That which makes up the full number of <hi>ſeven</hi> and the meaſure of their unexpiable iniquity, the <hi>Sabbath</hi> wherein this unexpiable murther was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted was the Sabbath of the great Feaſt of Attonement.</p>
               <p>All theſe tranſgreſſions or deadly ſins (for every circumſtance ſeems a tranſgreſſion or principal ſin, not an acceſſary) were committed in one day or at once.</p>
               <p>Another circumſtance theſe later <hi>Iews</hi> charge their fore-fathers withal, <hi>That they did not obſerve the Law of the</hi> * <hi>Deer or of the Hart,</hi> after they ſhed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Zachariah's</hi> innocent blood; for they did not ſo much as cover it with duſt: But this Circumſtance will fall into the diſcuſſion of the <hi>Third General</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. The ſins or circumſtances hitherto mentioned were enough to ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate the Execution of <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s dying prayers or imprecations, <hi>Lord look upon it, and require it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another circumſtance for aggravation of this ſin (ſpecially on King <hi>Io, aſh</hi> his part, omitted by the later <hi>Iews)</hi> might here be added, For that this good man, this godly Prieſt and Prophet of the Lord, <hi>Zachariah,</hi> was by birth and bloud of neareſt kindred (as we ſay, <hi>Couſin Germane)</hi> to <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> as being the Son, by lawful deſcent, of <hi>Iehoſhabeath</hi> (daughter of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and ſo Aunt to King <hi>Ioaſh)</hi> whom <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the Prieſt had to wife, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 11.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But did theſe <hi>Aggravations</hi> or curious Commentaries of later <hi>Jews,</hi> upon this and the like ſins of their fore-fathers any way help to prevent the like diſeaſes in ſuch as made them? Rather their Exclamations againſt them and <hi>Rigid Reformation</hi> of them, and their affected Zeal unto the Prophets whom their Fathers had murthered did caſt them into farre worſe diſeaſes of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>hypocriſie;</hi> whoſe <hi>ſymptomes</hi> were fury, madneſs and ſplenctical paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which in the iſſue brought out more <hi>prodigious murther,</hi> as will better appear in the Second General propoſed, which was, <hi>The Emblematical por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of this cruel and prodigious Fact againſt Zechariah,</hi> or the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his imprecations according to the <hi>myſtical ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For proof of our laſt Aſſertion or Concluſion of the <hi>Literal ſenſe,</hi> no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority can be alleged or deſired, then the authority of our Saviour Chriſt. No better Commentaries can be made, upon the <hi>myſtical ſenſe</hi> of the former Hiſtory, then he who was the Wiſdom of God made upon it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. verſe 29. <hi>Wo to you Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites</hi> (ſo he had indicted them <hi>ſeven or eight times</hi> in this Chapter, before; But the height or rather the depth of their helliſh hypocriſie was reſerved unto this verſe; and the original thus expreſſeth it:) <hi>Becauſe ye build the tombs of the Prophets and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ſepulchers of the righteous; and ſay, If we had been in the dayes of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the Prophets, wherefore ye be witneſſes unto your ſelves, that ye are the children of them which killed the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What if they were ſo? What will follow? Muſt the children be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their fathers ſins, or for the acknowledgment of them?</p>
               <p>Surely no! if they had repented of them. But to garniſh the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Prophets, or the righteous men, whom their Fathers had killed, was <hi>no good Argument of their true Repentance.</hi> So farre was this <hi>counterfeit Zeal</hi> unto the memory of deceaſed Prophets, from waſhing away the guilt of
<pb n="3723" facs="tcp:32220:220"/>
blood wherewith their fore-fathers had polluted the Land, that it rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the nutriment of hatred and of murtherous deſigns, againſt the <hi>King of Prophets, and Lord of life.</hi> And to this effect the words of the Evangeliſt St. <hi>Luke, chap.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 48. would amount, were they rightly ſcann'd and fully expreſs'd. <hi>Truly ye bear witneſs and allow the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them</hi> (to wit, the Prophets and righteous) <hi>and ye build their ſepulchres.</hi> In building the Sepulchres and acknowledging their fathers ſins which killed the Prophets, they did bear Authentick Witneſs, that they were their ſons; And in not bringing forth <hi>better fruits of Repentance</hi> then the beautifying of their Graves, they did bear witneſs againſt themſelves, <hi>that they were but as Graves</hi> (as <hi>our Saviour</hi> ſaith in the 44. verſe) <hi>which appear not</hi> (or do not outwardly ſhew what is contained in them) <hi>and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. That the Scribes and Phariſees (who were reſpectively Prieſts and Lawyers) did more then witneſs, <hi>that they were the ſons of them which killed the Prophets;</hi> that they did, though not expreſly, yet implicitely, more then allow their Fathers deeds, and were at this inſtant bent to accompliſh them, is apparent, from our Saviours fore-warnings or threatnings againſt them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. 32, 33. <hi>Fill ye up then the meaſure of your fathers, ye generation of vipers! how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell,</hi> or the judicature unto <hi>Gehennah?</hi> That the Scribes and Phariſees, and <hi>the People miſled by them,</hi> were now prone to make up the full meaſure of their Fathers ſins, is apparent from <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 34, and 35. <hi>Wherefore behold I ſend unto you Prophets, and Wiſemen, and Scribes, and ſome of them ye</hi> ſhall <hi>(or will) kill. &amp; crucifie, and ſome of them ye</hi> ſhall <hi>ſcourge in your Synagogues, and perſecute them from City to City. That upon you may come all the righteous blood, that was ſheed upon the earth, from the blood of the righteous</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See the <hi>next Sermon</hi> upon this Text.</note> Abel, <hi>unto the blood of</hi> Zacharias <hi>the ſon of</hi> Barachias, <hi>whom ye ſlew between the Temple and the Altar.</hi> Verſe 36. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, all theſe things ſhall come upon this Generation.</hi> Or, as it is in <hi>St. Lukes</hi> Narration of our Saviours Comment upon this Story, taken by himſelf or by others who heard him, in the very ſame words wherein he uttered it: <hi>Therefore alſo, ſaith the Wiſdom of God; I will ſend them Prophets and Apoſtles, &amp; ſome of them they</hi> ſhall <hi>(or will) ſlay &amp; perſecute, That the blood of all the Prophets which was ſhed from the foundation of the world may be required of this Generation: from the blood of</hi> Abel <hi>unto the blood of</hi> Zacharias <hi>which periſhed between the Altar and the Temple. Verily I ſay unto you it ſhall be</hi> required <hi>of this Generation.</hi> This vehement reiterated Aſſeveration literally and punctually referrs unto the words of my Text. The <hi>Implication</hi> or Importance is as much as if he had ſaid: <q>Ye Scribes and Phariſees may call to mind that when your Fore-fathers (whoſe murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acts ye acknowledge) did ſlay <hi>Zacharias</hi> the High-Prieſt, he expired with theſe words in his mouth: <hi>Lord look upon it, and require it.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>His innocent blood was then in part required upon King <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> upon the Princes of <hi>Judah,</hi> and other chief offenders; But ſhall now again be required in full and exact meaſure of this preſent Generation, more murtherous and bloody then their idolatrous fore-fathers at any time were.</p>
               <p n="9">9. What ſhall we ſay then, That this laſt Generation was guilty of the murther of <hi>Zachariah, or to be plagued for their fathers ſins in murthering him?</hi> This Point will come to be diſcuſſed in the <hi>Third General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And however that may be determined; This Caſe is clear: that, <hi>Theſe later Iews did make up the full meaſure of their fore-fathers iniquity,</hi> in killing Gods Prophets; eſpecially in murthering <hi>Zechariah,</hi> who was the moſt <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Type of Chriſt</hi> the Son of God, in the Manner of his death, and for the
<pb n="3724" facs="tcp:32220:221"/>
Occaſions which theſe ſeveral Generations took reſpectively to murther <hi>them both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſpecial Occaſion</hi> which their fore-fathers took to kill <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Son of <hi>Iehoiada</hi> or <hi>Barachias</hi> (for he bore both names, though both in effect the ſame, or one equivalent to the other) was, becauſe he taxed them for their <hi>idolatry,</hi> and laboured to bring them again to the worſhip of the true God.</p>
               <p>The only quarel which the malice of the later Jews could pick againſt <hi>our Lord and Saviour,</hi> was, becauſe he taxed their <hi>helliſh Hypocriſies,</hi> which their too Curious Reformation of their fore-fathers Idolatry had bred: And taught them how to worſhip God in ſpirit and truth, not in Ceremonies or meer bodily obſervance.</p>
               <p>Neither Generation were ſo blind as to perſecute men <hi>whom they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> to be immediately ſent from God. Yet were <hi>both</hi> furiouſly prone to perſecute ſuch as <hi>indeed were ſent from God,</hi> for pretending or promulging their Commiſſion from God, or taking the names of Prophets upon them, <hi>ſo often as their doctrine did croſſe their practiſes or violent paſsions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This later Generation of Scribes and Phariſees (after they had failed in their Proofs of any Capital matter of Fact or point of doctrine delivered by Chriſt) condemned him for anſwering <hi>affirmatively</hi> to this Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. <hi>Tell us, art thou the Son of God?</hi> or, as <hi>St. Mark</hi> more punctually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, <hi>Art thou the Chriſt the Son of the Bleſſed? Mark</hi> 14. 61. <hi>Zechariah</hi> (as was now ſaid) was Chriſts true Picture for <hi>Quality,</hi> for <hi>Office,</hi> and for the <hi>Relation of Names</hi> and kindred. For <hi>Zechariah</hi> was a Prophet and a Prieſt the Son of <hi>Iehoida,</hi> which ſignifieth as much as <hi>The knowledge of God;</hi> or, as our Saviour expreſſeth the Reality anſwering to his name, <hi>The ſon of Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi> that is, <hi>The bleſſed of God.</hi> And our Saviour was <hi>The Son of the only wiſe God,</hi> the wiſdom of God, and <hi>The bleſſed of God, the very God of bleſsing,</hi> being the <hi>Great Prophet of God</hi> and high-Prieſt of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Princes of <hi>Iudah</hi> having by glozing flattery perſwaded their King to authorize their projects againſt <hi>Zechariah</hi> the High-Prieſt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Lord, put them in execution upon the <hi>ſolemn Feast of Attonement</hi> or expiation.</p>
               <p>The Scribes and Phariſees equal or Superior to theſe Lay-Princes in cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, importuned <hi>Pilate</hi> by pretended obſervance and loyal obedience to the <hi>Roman Caeſar,</hi> to ſacrifice <hi>The Son of the Bleſſed</hi> (whom they had unjuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned) unto their malice at <hi>that ſolemn Feaſt,</hi> which was prefigured by the <hi>Feaſt of Expiation,</hi> the Feaſt inſtituted in the memory of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <p>THeſe words (—) were uttered by our bleſſed Lord and Saviour againſt the Scribes and Phariſees, with their Aſſociates in Blood, a little before the Feaſt of the Paſsover; Whether that Laſt Paſsover; wherein this Lamb of God prefigured by that Solemn Feaſt (as alſo by the Death of <hi>Abel</hi> and his Sacrifice) was offered upon the Croſs, is or may be a Queſtion amongſt the learned, not at this time to be diſputed; But rather (if occaſion ſerve) in the explication of the laſt verſe; <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth, till that ye ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>For gathering the true and full Connexion of <hi>this Paſſage</hi> with the former Relations, it ſhall ſuffice to obſerve; that as our Saviour <hi>never ſpared the Scribes and Phariſees:</hi> So at this time above others he reproves them moſt fully and ſharply. The <hi>Matter of this Reproof, was their avarice and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie:</hi> The <hi>End, partly to prevent the like deſire of vain-glory, with other Enormities in his Diſciples; Partly to cure</hi> (if it were poſſible) <hi>the Scribes, and Phariſees of their hereditary diſeaſe.</hi> Hence, whereas they moſt affected <hi>Complemental Greetings</hi> in publick places, or glorious Titles of <hi>Rabbies:</hi> Our Saviour to allay this humour, for reſpectful <hi>Salutations</hi> preſents them <hi>Woes;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of glorious Titles he inſtyles them <hi>Hypocrites:</hi> For ſtriking at ſeven ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Branches of their Hypocriſie, he ſeven times in this Chapter begins his ſpeech in this ſtyle; <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites.</hi>

The principal and moſt deadly <hi>Branch</hi> of this bitter <hi>Root,</hi> was, <hi>Their garniſhing the Sepulchers of the Righteous, and building the Tombs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> In which notwithſtanding they did not ſo mightily deceive others, as their own ſouls; yet by a <hi>Fallacie</hi> very familiar, and apt to inſinuate it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all our thoughts.

reſpect to Good men, whether alive, or lately dead, as a ſure Teſtimony of his own goodneſs or integrity? eſpecially in reſpect of theirs, that either have perſecuted them living, or defamed them after death? Howbeit this kind of Teſtimony, generally admitted for currant, would make way to bring <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Hypocriſie</hi> into Credit with our ſouls. Many we have known, either in hope of filling, or fear of emptying their purſes, pinch their bellies: But as none can be ſo miſerable, as not to deſire to fare well rather then ill, ſo he might have good chear as good cheap as bad: So, hardly can any be ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as not to like better of Godlineſs or vertue in others, then of vice, ſo the one be no more prejudicial or offenſive to him, then the other. Now the Fame or memory of godly men long ago deceaſed, or farre abſent, cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate the wicked, or malitious, nor whet their pride to <hi>Envy.</hi> For <hi>Envie</hi> (though a moſt unneighborly quality) <hi>is alwayes conceived from neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or vicinitie.</hi> Contrariwiſe <hi>the righteous, that live amongſt the wicked,</hi> are (as the wiſe man ſpeaks) <hi>a Reproach unto them,</hi> becauſe their works are <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 9. Pto. 28. 4. Wiſd. 2. 12. 1 Joh. 3. 12.</note> good, and the others evil. This different eſteem of vertue preſent and abſent, the Heathens rightly had obſerved. <hi>Virtutem incolumem odimus; ſublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi.</hi> For as Bats and Owls joy in the Suns light after it is gone down, though it offend their eyes, whileſt it ſhines in full ſtrength and comforts all other creatures indued with perfect ſight; So can the ſons of darkneſs endure the ſons of light after their departure out of this world, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it a perpetual eye-ſore unto them living in the ſame Age, or ſociety. Upon this humor did Sathan (that great Politician) work; putting ſuch a <hi>Gull</hi> upon theſe <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> as <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperor did upon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. For as this Tyrant, when he purpoſed any cruelty, or murther, would alwayes make ſpeeches in Commendation of mercie, or clemencie, to prevent ſuſpicion: So the old Serpent having made choice of theſe Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, as fitteſt inſtruments to wreak his ſpight upon our Saviour; firſt ſets them a work <hi>to build the Tombs of the Prophets, and garniſh the ſepulchers of the righteous, whom their fathers had ſlain,</hi> leaſt they ſhould ſuſpect themſelves of any like intent againſt <hi>that Juſt one, of whom they proved the betrayers and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</hi> Time had ſo fully detected their fathers ſins, that it was bootleſs for them to attempt their concealment. The ſafeſt, and moſt plauſible courſe to appeace their conſciences, was freely to proteſt againſt them; for they ſaid, <hi>If we had been in the dayes of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is it credible, that men ſo ingenuous, as thus to confeſs their fore-elders ſhame, and ready as farre as was poſſible, to make the dead Prophets amends for wrong done to them by their anceſtors many hundred years ago, ſhould attempt any cruelty againſt the Prince of Prophets, whom <hi>Moſes</hi> their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had ſo ſtrictly commanded them to obey?</p>
               <p>No; the world muſt rather believe Chriſt was not that Great Prophet, but a Seducer, becauſe ſo much hated of theſe great Rabbies, which ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the memory of true Prophets, whom their fathers perſecuted. With ſuch vain ſhews do theſe blind guides deceive the ſimple, being bewitched themſelves by Sathan with groundleſs perſwaſions of their own ſincerity, and <note place="margin">Of <hi>Phariſaical Hypocriſie,</hi> See <hi>Book</hi> 4. and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sermon on <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.</note> devotion towards God, and his Meſſengers.</p>
               <p>To think this hypocritical Crue ſhould wittingly and purpoſely uſe theſe devices, as <hi>politick Sophiſmes</hi> to colour their bad intentions, were to make us think better of our ſelves, then we deſerve, by thinking worſe of them, then our Saviour meant in that cenſure: <hi>They do all their works to be ſeen of men.</hi> This (according to the like phraſe moſt frequent in Scripture) doth argue
<pb n="3727" facs="tcp:32220:222"/>
the praiſe of men to be the Iſſue of their works, but not the End they purpoſely aimed or intended, For, their hypocriſie ſuppoſed a miſ-guided zeal or aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the mark they ſought to hit, cauſed from their immoderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of honour and applauſe, which did ſo intoxicate and over-rule their minds, and like leaven diffuſe it ſelf through out all their actions, that even the beſt works, they did, could be pleaſant only unto men, not unto God, which trieth the heart, and looks as well, that our <hi>Intention be ſound</hi> and entire, as that we <hi>intend that which is good,</hi> becauſe commanded by him. To honour the memory of <hi>Holy men</hi> was a good work, but ill done by them, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from a contrite and penitent heart. To ſtint <hi>the Crie of ſo much righteous blood,</hi> as had been ſhed by their Anceſtors, what could it (alaſs) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to deck the places where their bodies lay buried? That God was grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offended, they could not doubt; and to think he ſhould be pacified by ſuch ſacrifices, was to imagine him to be like ſinful men, which can wink at publick offences for ſome bribe given to their ſervants, or ſome toyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon their children. Thus to acknowledge their fore-fathers cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not to be more touched with ſorrow for it, was to give Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, as our Saviour in the 31. verſe inferres; <hi>So then ye be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes unto your ſelves, that ye are the children of them which killed the Prophets.</hi> Or as <hi>St. Luke</hi> relates the ſame paſſage; <hi>Wo be to you, for ye build the Sepulchres of the Prophets, and your fathers killed them. Truly ye bear witneſs and allow the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and ye build their ſepulchres.</hi> For, not to amend that in our ſelves, which we reprove in others, but rather to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume liberty to our ſouls, as if we were acquited by ſuch reproofs or correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their miſ-deeds, is in deed to allow, what in word we diſclaim. Had theſe Scribes and Phariſees never taken notice of their fathers ſins, they could have had no occaſion to conceit their own holineſs ſo highly; but now by comparing their own kindneſs to dead Prophets bones, with their fathers cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties againſt their living perſons, they ſeem in compariſon like Saints, hence emboldened to treſpaſs more deſperately againſt the Holy One of God. In this reſpect our Saviour in the words immediately going before the Text, not content with this ordinary Title of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> or <hi>blind Guides,</hi> cals them <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> and a <hi>generation of Vipers.</hi> 
                  <q>As if he had ſaid, Ye are children or ſeed of the old Serpent, the Divle, which was a murderer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and now ye are ready to take his part againſt the <hi>promiſed</hi> Womans <hi>ſeed:</hi>
                  </q> And whereas they thought themſelves of all men moſt free from ſtain of the Prophets blood, whoſe tombs they garniſhed, our Saviour in my Text layes that eſpecially to their Charge, indicting them of all the murther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from the beginning of the world, until that preſent time, or at leaſt till <hi>Zechariahs</hi> death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Indictment we muſt believe to be moſt true and juſt, becauſe fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Truth it ſelf: But what the true meaning of it ſhould be, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by any Interpreter we have hitherto met with. Such as a man in reaſon would ſooneſt expect beſt ſatisfaction from (for the moſt part) paſs it over in ſilence: Others (like young Conjurers, which raiſe ſpirits they cannot lay) caſt ſuch doubts, as they are not able to aſſoil. For acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with as much, as my reading or Obſervation (upon late deſires to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſelf in a point ſo difficult and uſeful) have attained unto, give me leave to reflect upon 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 22, and to look fore-right alſo into the words of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> chapt. 11. verſe 51. <hi>[Verily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>of this Generation.]</hi> Which few words include <hi>the greateſt meaſure of righteous blood moſt unrighteouſly ſhed that ever was laid to any People or Nations</hi>

For the Charge is laid <hi>by the Wiſdom of God,</hi> by the ſupreme Judge of quick and dead, as you may ſee from the forty ninth verſe. <hi>Therefore alſo, ſaith the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, I will ſend them Prophets and Apoſtles, and ſome of them they ſhall</hi> (or will) <hi>ſlay and perſecute, that the righteous blood of all the Prophets which was ſhed from the foundation of the world may be</hi> required <hi>of this Generation, from the blood of</hi> Abel <hi>unto the blood of</hi> Zechariah <hi>which periſhed between the Altar and the Temple.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And of ſuch Queſtions the firſt is, <hi>Who this</hi> Zachariah <hi>in St.</hi> Matthew <hi>and St.</hi> Luke <hi>is: Whether it be He that was ſlain (as is told)</hi> 2 Chron. 24. 22. <hi>or ſome other of that name?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second, (ſuppoſing, the ſame <hi>Zecharias</hi> to be meant in all three places;) <hi>Why the Wiſdom of God after he had laid the blood of all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men and Prophets whom their fore-fathers had ſlain; or haply whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſlay, ſhould inſtance in</hi> Zachariah <hi>the ſon of</hi> Jehoiada <hi>or of</hi> Barachiah, as the laſt man whoſe blood was to be <hi>required.</hi>

                  <pb n="3729" facs="tcp:32220:223"/>
The Third; <hi>Whether the blood of</hi> Zecharias, <hi>or other Prophets or righteous men ſlain by their fore-fathers, or the blood of the Son of God himſelf, or of his Apoſtles, of whom this preſent Generation were the murtherers, was in ſtrict, and</hi>

                  <hi>Logical Conſtruction of theſe words,</hi> required <hi>of this preſent Generation?</hi> Or in other Terms, <hi>thus;</hi> Whether the murther of Our Saviour, or of his Apoſtles, plotted or practiſed by this preſent Generation, or rather the cruelties practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their Fore-fathers upon the Prophets and other righteous men, were the true and Poſitive Cauſe of all thoſe unparalleld Plagues and Calamities which befel the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation within forty or more years after our Saviours death: of the deſolation of <hi>Jewry,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> utter extirpation thence by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Adrian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fourth, <hi>In what Caſes, or how farre, the poſterity or ſucceſſors of any people or nation are liable to the puniſhment of their Anceſtors ſins; or what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of repentance is required for the known and groſſe ſinnes of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Sixth (which might as well have been the Firſt) is; <hi>VVith what Intent, or to what End,</hi> The Wiſdom of God <hi>did ſend Prophets, Apoſtles and VViſe men unto this preſent Generation, or their fore-fathers: As whether to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue them from the Plagues denounced againſt them by</hi> Zachariah <hi>and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> or <hi>to bring their Righteous Blood upon them.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. To the firſt Queſtion, <hi>VVho this Zacharias was.</hi> Some have queſtioned whether He was <hi>Zechariah</hi> Coaeval to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and witneſs of his Eſpouſal, <note place="margin">The firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Who this Zechariah was.</hi>

                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Others there be of opinion, this <hi>Zachariah</hi> here meant ſhould be <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> the Prophet, whoſe Propheſie is extant in the Sacred Volume, the laſt in order but one, as he was one of the laſt in time, and prophecied about this peoples return from <hi>Babylon.</hi> And it is true indeed, that this Prophet was the Son of <hi>Barachiah,</hi> as appears from the very firſt words of his Prophecie. But this opinion is obnoxious to the ſame exceptions the former is: <hi>viz.</hi> it is neither warranted by Scriptures, nor by any good Writer. Neither is it credible, that the <hi>Jews</hi> then living would kill the Prophet of the Lord imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after their deliverance from captivity; At leaſt, the Reverence to the Temple then ſcarce finiſhed, would have made them abſtain from ſhedding his blood within the walls of it near the Altar.</p>
               <p>Others there be amongſt the Ancients (but few later Writers of better note) which think this <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſhould be <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Father; what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſhould have ſo to think I cannot conjecture, ſave only Our Saviours words in the 35. verſe <hi>[VVhom ye ſlew between the Temple and the Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi> This in ordinary ſpeech may ſeem to implie, that this juſt man had been kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>this people now living,</hi> not by their Fathers; For ſo our Saviour hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply had ſaid, <hi>Whom your Fathers ſlew, not Whom YE ſlew.</hi> But it is a Rule in Divinity, to gather our Saviours and his Apoſtles meaning by the uſual Phraſe of Scriptures, not by our common manner of ſpeech. Now it is uſual to the Prophets and Sacred Writers to lay the fathers ſins unto the childrens charge if they continue in the like, or repent not for them. And if this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now living muſt be plagued for the ancient Prophets blood; no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they were guilty of it, and may be ſaid to have ſlain them, in the ſame ſenſe, they are endicted as guilty of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3730" facs="tcp:32220:224"/>
That our Saviour ſhould not mean <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Father, is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, His death is not mentioned in the New Teſtament; nor in any Good Eccleſiaſtical Writer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe it no way benefits the Authors of this Opinion, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſeth the difficultie.</p>
               <p>For if he were ſlain by <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, who was a Philiſtine by Parentage, why ſhould not <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s death be laid to their charge being ſlain by <hi>Herods</hi> Son? Nay, why not our Saviours or his Apoſtles, whom he fore-tels they would ſhortly kill, and perſecute?</p>
               <p>This plainly argues, that the reaſon, why he names this <hi>Zacharias,</hi> was not <note place="margin">This punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agrees with the Copy.</note> his ſlaughter. And beſides this reaſon there is none, why we ſhould think this <hi>Zacharias</hi> was <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Father. As for the Apocriphal Stories or Traditions, which are pretended for this gueſſe, or groundleſs conjecture, we have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that it rather brought forth them, then that they ſhould firſt deliver it.</p>
               <p>Not to trouble your patience with any more Reaſons for refuting thoſe Opinions; it is agreed upon by moſt late Writers I have read, Papiſts, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and by <hi>St. Hierom</hi> the beſt in this kind of all the Ancient, that this <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah,</hi> here ſpoken of, was the ſon of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt, whoſe death we have ſet down 2, <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. verſe 21. <hi>And they conſpired againſt him, and ſtoned him with ſtones at the Commandement of the King, in the Court of the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> In what Court it is not ſpecified, but it is moſt probable from the circumſtance of the Text, that it was in the Court, where the Prieſts offered ſacrifices, or in the place, where he inſtructed or bleſſed the people; for it is evident that <hi>Zechariah</hi> was ſlain in his Pue or publick ſeat appointed for inſtructing the People.</p>
               <p>And hereunto the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> in their Traditions accord. This is that our Saviour ſaith in my Text, that <hi>he was ſlain between the Temple and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi> By the Temple we are to underſtand the outward Courts, or Iles, or as <note place="margin">The <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Altar.</hi>
                  </note> we diſtinguiſh betwixt the Church and the Chancel, the body of the Temple comprehending <hi>Atrium Iſraelis &amp; mulierum,</hi> the Courts, wherein the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of men and women ſtood; By the place between theſe and the Altar, the Court where the Prieſts taught, or celebrated their ſervice. And ſo it is ſaid, verſe 20. That <hi>Zachariah ſhould ſtand above the people,</hi> when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered that meſſage unto them, for which they ſtoned him to death.</p>
               <p>Why this <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſhould be called the ſon of <hi>Barachiah,</hi> divers Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors bring divers reaſons, all probable in themſelves, and each agreeable with other. Some think his father (as was not unuſual amongſt the <hi>Jews)</hi> had two names, or a name and a ſur-name, <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and <hi>Barachiah.</hi> Others think, that our Saviour did not ſo much reſpect the uſual Name, whereby the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets father was called, as his Conditions, or vertues unto which the name of <note place="margin">Why <hi>Zachariah</hi> called the ſon of <hi>Barachiah.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Barachiah</hi> did as well, or better agree, then <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> although the one of theſe cannot much diſagree in ſenſe from the other, for the one ſignifies <hi>The knowledge of the Lord,</hi> the other, to wit <hi>Barachiah, The bleſsing of the Lord,</hi> or <hi>Man bleſſed of the Lord.</hi> Well might both names befit that Famous High-Prieſt, famous both for his wiſdom and piety, every way bleſſed of God, and a great bleſſing to this people: For as it is ſaid 2 <hi>Chronicles,</hi> chap. 24. verſe 16. <hi>He had done good in Iſrael, both towards God, and towards his houſe,</hi> In which reſpect he was buried in the City of <hi>David</hi> amongſt their Kings. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting then <hi>Jehoiada</hi> either uſually had, or were for the reaſons intimated ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of theſe two Names, it is not without a ſpecial Reaſon, perhaps a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
<pb n="3731" facs="tcp:32220:224"/>
that our Saviour in this place ſhould call <hi>Zachariah</hi> rather the ſon of <hi>Barachiah,</hi> then of <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> 
                  <q>For the more bleſſed his Father was of God, the greater bleſſing he had been to Iſrael; the more accurſed was this <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> Notes on <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. fol. 125. where he cites <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> Lib. 4. cap. 19. for another <hi>Zacharias,</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the Seige, which puts a ſhort end to this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ungratious people in killing his vertuous and religious ſon in the Houſe of the Lord, for diſſwading them from Idolatry:</q> And the more fully did they prefigure the ſin of this wicked generation their children, which for the like cauſe did now go about to kill the Son of God Chriſt Jeſus Bleſſed for ever.

               </p>
               <p>Thus much of the firſt Point <hi>[Who this</hi> Zachariah <hi>was]</hi> gives ſome light unto the Second.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Spaniſh Ieſuite Maldonate in his Comments upon this place</hi> would perſwade us. His beſt Anſwer to this Queſtion ſolemnly propoſed by him, is This. <q>Chriſts purpoſe was only to inſtance in thoſe Prophets, whoſe ſlaughter was expreſly teſtified in the Bible, leaſt the Scribes and Phariſees might deny them to have been ſlain by their fore-fathers: Now of Prophets, whoſe deaths are mentioned in Scripture, <hi>Zacharias</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> was the laſt.</q> We have juſt occaſion to ſuſpect his conjecture (were it true) to be impertinent becauſe the Reaſon whereby he ſeeks to confirm it, is evidently untrue. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Zacharias</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> was not the laſt of all the Prophets, whoſe bloody deaths are recorded in Scripture. For in the 26. chap. of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> There is expreſs mention of one <hi>Uriah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Shemaiah</hi> of <hi>Kiriath-jearim,</hi> who for propheſying againſt <hi>Hicruſalem</hi> was put to death (240. years after <hi>Zechariah</hi> by <hi>Jehoiachim King of Judah,</hi> and by his Council of State and of Warre, and was fetcht back from <hi>Egypt,</hi> whither he had fled for refuge, by <hi>Elnathan</hi> the ſon of <hi>Achbor</hi> a great Counſellor of State, and other Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for this purpoſe, unto <hi>Iehoiachim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſlew him with the ſword, and caſt his dead body into the graves of the common people.</hi> And this Prophets blood, and other indignities done unto him and to his Calling after his death, were Required of that Preſent Generation, of the King eſpecially: For, as <hi>Ieremie,</hi> perhaps taking his hint from this Bloody Fact, had foretold, ſo it came to paſs; that <hi>Iehoiachim</hi> was caſt out of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> not into the Graves of the Common people, but into the Open Fields, for he had no other burial then the Burial of the Aſs, or other like contemptible creature.</p>
               <p>But however the blood (perhaps) of this Prophet amongſt many others, was to be further Required of this Preſent Generation; Yet <hi>Zacharias</hi> was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zachariah</hi> the only Prophet that dyed with an Imprecation</note> the Laſt, and I think the Firſt of all the Prophets which at the moment of his death did beſeech God to Require his blood and to revenge his death. And <hi>this</hi> (I take) <hi>is the true Reaſon,</hi> why Our Saviour after he had indicted the <hi>Jews</hi> of the blood of all the Prophets and righteous men ſhed from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, ſhould inſtance only in <hi>Abel</hi> the ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> the ſon of <hi>Iehoiada</hi> or <hi>Barachiah.</hi> Chriſts Inſtance in <hi>Abel</hi> literally and punctually referres to that Dialogue betwixt God and <hi>Cain: Gen.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto</hi> Cain, <hi>where is</hi> Abel <hi>thy Brother? And he ſaid, I know not: Am my brothers keeper? And he ſaid, what haſt thou done? The voyce of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood cryeth to me from the ground, and now art thou curſed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3732" facs="tcp:32220:225"/>
But did the voyce of <hi>Zacharias</hi> his blood cry in like manner unto the Lord after his death, or ſollicit the like Curſe or vengeance upon them which ſhed it or their poſteritie as <hi>Abels</hi> did? yes, beſides the fore-mentioned Imprecation, <hi>Lord look upon it, and</hi> Require <hi>it,</hi> which was uttered by him, after a great part of his blood and Spirits were ſpent, his blood ſpake as bad things, as that of <hi>Abels;</hi> For ſo the <hi>Iewiſh Rabbins</hi> (beſides that Cluſter of ſeven deadly ſins, committed by their fore-fathers at once in the murther of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Fol.</hi> 3721.</note> mention another Circumſtance ſubſequent, not recorded in Scripture; or not ſo plainly, as a Chriſtian Reader without their Comment or Tradition would take notice of it; which in my Opinion doth better illuſtrate that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Scripture whereon they ground or ſeek to countenance it, then any Chriſtian Commentator hath done, <q>Our Fathers (ſay they) in ſhedding <hi>Zacharias</hi>'s blood, did not obſerve the Law of the blood of the Deer or Hart:</q> For ſo it was commanded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 13. <hi>Whatſoever man there be of the children of Iſrael, or of the ſtrangers that ſo journ among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beaſt or fowl that may be eaten, he ſhall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with duſt.</hi> But <hi>Zacharias</hi> blood (though ſhed in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) was not ſo covered, it was apparent. To this purpoſe they allege that of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap: 24. 6. <hi>Wo unto the bloody City, Her blood is in the middeſt of her, ſhe ſet it upon the top of a rock, ſhe poured it not upon the ground to cover it with duſt: that it might cauſe fury to come up to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No queſtion but the Prophets entire purpoſe was to indict <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as our Saviour doth in my Text) of all the Innocent blood that had been ſhed before his time within her Territories, and withall to note her Impudence in committing ſuch foul ſins ſo openly, without care to cover the conſpicuous marks of her own ſhame. Yet this no way argues that the Prophets did not point out ſome <hi>Memorable and Prodigious Fact,</hi> which might ſerve as an <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>Emblem</hi> of her ſhameleſs careleſsneſs in all the reſt. Such Alluſions to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars ſufficiently known in their own times are very uſual in the Prophets: This is the <hi>ſpecial Reaſon why their Writings in General are ſo obſcure to us,</hi> why ſome of their Metaphors ſeem harſh or farre fetcht, becauſe in truth their ſpeeches in theſe Caſes are not meerly Metaphorical, but include Hiſtorical References to ſome famous Accidents preſent or freſh in memory. From the ſame Cauſe, all antient Satyriſts, or ſuch as tax the capital vices of their own times, are hardly underſtood by later Ages, without the Comments of ſuch as lived with them or not long after them: as our Poſterity within few years will hardly underſtand ſome paſſages in the <hi>Fairie Queen,</hi> or in <hi>Mother Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> or other Tales in <hi>Chaucer,</hi> better known at this day to old Courtiers then to young Students.</p>
               <p>It may be theſe murtherers ſayd of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> as their poſteritie ſaid of our Saviour: <hi>His blood be on us, and on our Children.</hi> It is not likely they would be careful to cover it with duſt, or wipe the ſtain of it (whileſt freſh) out of the wals or ſtones of the Temple, becauſe they had ſolemnly forſaken the Houſe of the Lord, and made a league to ſerve Groves and Idols, willing perhaps to let the Print of his blood remain to terrifie others from beeing too forward in reproving the King and His Council for their offences againſt God.</p>
               <p>But whether the marks of it were left on purpoſe, or through mere forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this people, God in his Providence, as the Prophet intimates, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſo to remain, <hi>To cauſe fury to come, and to take vengeance.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this fact, or forgetfulneſs to cover it, was in the words before attributed to
<pb n="3733" facs="tcp:32220:225"/>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem: Her blood is in the middeſt of her, ſhe ſet it up on the top of the Rock, ſhe poured it not upon the ground to cover it with duſt;</hi> The Prophet after inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Cauſe, why it ſo remained; <hi>To cauſe fury, &amp;c.</hi> Immediately adds, in the Perſon of God; <hi>I have ſet her blood upon the top of a rock, that it ſhould not be covered.</hi> Of theſe words no meaning can be rendred more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, then This; To wit, That God did ſuffer the print of <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood to remain in the Temple, as it were to ſollicit vengeance for all the reſt, that had been, or ſhould be ſhed in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to crie unto him, as <hi>Abel's</hi> did from the earth, which (as it ſeems) was not covered, certainly the voice of it was not ſmothered with duſt.</p>
               <p>How long the ſtain of blood, eſpecially daſhed out of the body by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, will be apparent upon ſtones, or moiſt wals, experience doth not often teach, becauſe it is uſually covered, or wiped off whileſt it is freſh. Yet ſome prints of blood have longer remained (unleſs <hi>Domeſtick Traditions</hi> be falſe) on ſtones, then the blood it ſelf could have done by courſe of nature in the veins that incloſed it. Albeit we may with good probability preſume, that <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s blood (if we conſider the manner of his death) might continue, by Gods permiſſion or appointment, farre above the time that any <hi>Ordinary Experience</hi> can teſtifie.</p>
               <p>More ſtrange it is, which <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Writers</hi> report of this <hi>Prophets body,</hi> that being cruſhed with ſtones, it ſhould be found otherwiſe intire and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in the dayes of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> which was above a thouſand years after his death. Unleſs they had greater Occaſion, then I can conceive, to lie, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dare diſtruſt <hi>this Report</hi> of theirs, nor the other <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by whoſe account the ſtain of <hi>His</hi> blood remained a greater part of two hundred years in the Temple.</p>
               <p>However, we may (with good probability) conclude, that the <hi>true Reaſon,</hi> why our Saviour mentioned <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s death as one ſpecial Cauſe of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalems</hi> laſt deſtruction, was not becauſe he was <hi>the laſt,</hi> or <hi>one of the laſt</hi> of the Prophets that had been murthered by the Scribes, and Phariſees Fore-elders, but rather becauſe his murther was <hi>the moſt foul Prodigious Fact,</hi> that was committed in that Land, and did from the very Commiſſion of it, <hi>portend</hi> Deſtruction to the Temple; and the <hi>Conſequents of it</hi> fore-ſhadowed the miſeries, which were afterwards to befal the Nation. The truth of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion will better appear from Diſcuſſion of the third Point propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

               <p>The <hi>modern Jews</hi> peremptorily deny <hi>Their long Exile and Calamitie</hi> to have been inflicted upon them as a juſt puniſhment for putting Chriſt to death; becauſe their Fathers did not (in their judgment) therein of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>

               <p n="1">1. OF ſeveral <hi>Queries</hi> or <hi>Problems</hi> emergent out of theſe words (propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">See fol. 3729. where this was the 4 Queſtion propounded.</note> unto this Audience a year ago) <hi>One</hi> (and that one of greateſt difficultie) was; <hi>How the ſins</hi> of former Generations can be <hi>required</hi> of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">From <hi>Abels</hi> to <hi>Zachariahs</hi> death were 3000. years. from <hi>Zach.</hi> to theſe words ſpoken were 00. or 900.</note> ſpecially in ſo great a diſtance of time as was between the death of <hi>Abel</hi> and of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> and this laſt Generation which crucified the Lord of life: the Diſcuſſion whereof is my preſent Task.</p>
               <p>In this diſquiſition you will I hope diſpenſe with me for want of <hi>a formal</hi>
                  <pb n="3738" facs="tcp:32220:228"/>
                  <hi>Diviſion</hi> or <hi>Dichotomie,</hi> becauſe the Channel through which I am to paſs is ſo narrow and ſo dangerouſly beſet with Rocks and ſhelves on the right hand and on the left; as there is no poſſibility for two to go on breſt, nor any room for <hi>Steerage,</hi> but only <hi>Towage.</hi> One paſſage in my Diſquiſition muſt draw another after it, by one and the ſame direct Line.</p>
               <p>For firſt, if I ſhould chance to ſay any thing which either <hi>Directly,</hi> or by way of <hi>Conſequence</hi> might probably inferre this Affirmative Concluſion, <hi>[That God doth at any time puniſh the children for the fathers ſins, or later ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations for the Iniquities of former;]</hi> This were to contradict that <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truth</hi> which the Lord himſelf hath ſo often proteſted by Oath, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>And the word of the Lord came unto me again, ſaying: What mean ye that ye uſe this Proverb concerning the Land of Iſrael, ſaying; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have eaten ſour grapes, and the Childrens teeth are ſet on edge? As I live, ſaith the Lord God, ye ſhall not have occaſion any more to uſe this Proverb in</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. <hi>Behold, all ſouls are mine; as the ſoul of the Father, ſo alſo the ſoul of the Son is mine; the ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die.</hi> And again, verſe the laſt; <hi>I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dyeth, ſaith the Lord God: wherefore turn your ſelves and live ye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to contradict any Branch of theſe or the like <hi>Protestations</hi> or <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> would be to make ſhipwrack of Faith, more dangerous then to ruſh with full ſail upon a Rock of Adamant.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, if I ſhould affirm any thing, either directly, or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which might inferre any part of this Negative <hi>[That God doth not viſit the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children, or of former Generations upon later:]</hi> This were to ſtrike upon a ſhelf no leſs dangerous then to daſh againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Rock; directly to contradict <hi>Gods ſolemn Declaration</hi> (in the ſecond Commandement) of <hi>His Proceedings in this Caſe,</hi> which are no leſs juſt and equal, then the former <hi>Promiſe, Ezekiel</hi> the 18. By this you ſee <hi>the only ſafe way for paſſage</hi> through the ſtraits propoſed muſt be to find out <hi>the middle Line,</hi> or <hi>Mean,</hi> whether <hi>Medium Abnegationis,</hi> or <hi>Participationis;</hi> or in one word, The difference betwixt this Negative <hi>[God doth not puniſh the Children for the Fathers ſins]</hi> and the other Affirmative <hi>[God viſiteth the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children, even unto the third and fourth Generation,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
               <p n="2">2. But in the very firſt ſetting forth, or entry into this narrow Paſſage, ſome here preſent perhaps have already diſcovered a <hi>ſhelf</hi> or <hi>ſand,</hi> to wit, that <note place="margin">See a following Sermon, on 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 26.</note> the paſſage fore-cited, out of the <hi>ſecond Commandement,</hi> doth better reach or fit the Caſe concerning <hi>Joſiah his death, and the calamity of his people,</hi> then the preſent difficultie or Problem now in handling. For <hi>Joſiah</hi> was but the third in ſucceſſion from <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and dyed within fewer years, then a Generation <note place="margin">A Generation contains thirty years: betwixt <hi>Manaſſeh's</hi> and <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> death were about thirty three years.</note> in ordinary Conſtruction imports, after his wicked Grand-father. But if the blood of <hi>Zachariah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> or other Prophets ſlain in that Age, or the Age after him, were required of this preſent Generation; God doth viſit the ſins of Fore-fathers upon the Children, after more then three or four, after more then <hi>five times five</hi> Generations, according to <hi>St. Matthew</hi>'s account in the Genealogie of our Lord and Saviour. Yet this ſeeming Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty <note place="margin">The Objection is hardened by taking in <hi>Abels</hi> Blood. <hi>Zechari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was ſlain 900. years, <hi>Abel</hi> 3800. years before Chriſt ſpoke the words of the Text.</note> (to uſe the Mariners Dialect) is rather an <hi>Over-fall</hi> then a <hi>ſhelf,</hi> or at the worſt but ſuch a <hi>ſhelf</hi> or <hi>ſand</hi> as cannot hinder our paſſage <hi>if we ſound it by the Line or Plummet of the Sanctuary,</hi> or number our Fathoms by the ſcale of ſacred Dialect in like Caſes. For when it is ſaid in the Second Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that God doth <hi>viſit the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Him:</hi> This is, <hi>Numerus certus pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>incerto aut indefinito:</hi> an expreſſion or ſpeech equivalent to that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

                  <hi>Amos. For three tranſgreſsions of</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>and for four I will not turn away the puniſhments thereof. For three tranſgreſsions of</hi> Tyrus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Both ſpeeches, as well that in <hi>Amos,</hi> as in the <hi>Second Commandement</hi> (reverently to compare <hi>magna parvis)</hi> are like to that of the Poet,</p>

In this Caſe they provoke or pull down the heavy ſtroak of his out-ſtretched Arm of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This difficultie in the Entry into or Barre of this narrow paſſage being cleared, we may ſafely proceed by the former way propoſed; that is, by ſearching the <hi>Mean</hi> or ſounding the difference between theſe two Abſolute Truths. 1. <hi>[God never puniſheth the Children for their Fathers ſins.]</hi> Secondly, <hi>[God uſually viſiteth the ſinnes of the Fathers upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt <hi>punctual difference</hi> of theſe two undeniable Truths, to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and Obſervation, is this: <hi>To puniſh the Children for their Fathers ſins,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What it is to puniſh Children for their fathers ſins.</note> 
                  <hi>implies a puniſhment of ſome perſons</hi> (be they more or few) <hi>without any perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal guilt in them, or actual tranſgreſsions committed by them.</hi> And thus to do in awarding puniſhments temporarie, whether Capital or Corporal (for with puniſhments everlaſting, or in the world to come, I dare not meddle or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my verdict) were open injuſtice. The ſons of Traytors or Rebels againſt the Crown and dignitie of the State wherein they live, are not by humane laws obnoxious to any Corporal or Capital puniſhment, unleſs they be in ſome degree guilty of their Fathers treaſon or rebellion, not by <hi>miſpriſion</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by <hi>Aſſociation.</hi> And however Good Laws do deprive guiltleſs Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lands and Titles of honour which their Fathers enjoyed; yet are they oftentimes upon their good demeanor reſtored to their blood, and to the lands and dignities of their Anceſtors, even by ſuch Princes as are no fit pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of that Clemencie which becometh Princes; Not ſo much as good foyls to ſet forth or commend the clemencie and benignitie of God, if we conſider it, as it is avouched by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the eighteenth Chapter. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever earthly Princes may demean themſelves towards the guiltleſs or well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving ſons of Traytors or Rebels, the reaſon or intendment of ſevereſt publick Laws in this Caſe provided, was not to lay any puniſhment upon the Children, but rather a Tye or bond upon their Fathers not to offend in this high kind, ſo often as otherwiſe they would do, ſave onely for the love they bear unto their Children and poſterity, or for the fear of tainting their blood,
<pb n="3740" facs="tcp:32220:229"/>
or diſhonouring their Friends and Families. Of the equity or good intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Laws we have the faireſt patern in the fore-cited place of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> chap. 18. 31, 32. <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſsions whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart and a new ſpirit, For why will ye die O ye houſe of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>For I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dyeth, ſaith the Lord God; wherefore turn your ſelves and live ye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>To viſit the ſins of the Fathers upon their Children,</hi> alwayes ſuppoſeth <note place="margin">What it it is to viſit the ſins of fathers, &amp;c.</note> ſome degree of perſonal guilt in the Children: yet ſuch a guilt or ſuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions as would not be puniſhed ſo greivouſly either for <hi>meaſure</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> as uſually they are, unleſs their Fathers had ſet them bad Examples by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the ſame or like kind.

               <p>The Second, if their Fathers puniſhments have been upon <hi>Regiſter</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> ſo remarkably ſuited unto their ſins, that their Children might (as they ought) have taken notice of the occaſions of Gods diſpleaſure againſt them or puniſhing hand upon them.</p>
               <p>To draw theſe <hi>Generals</hi> more cloſe unto the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> or to joyn them together by annexing ſome particular Inſtances unto them.</p>
               <p>Few here preſent can be ſo ignorant either of domeſtick or publick <hi>Statutes</hi> amongſt us, but may eaſily obſerve that the <hi>ſame offence being re-iterated</hi> or often committed by one and the ſame party, is, or ought to be, more grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly puniſhed for the <hi>ſecond Turn</hi> then for the <hi>firſt,</hi> more greivouſly for the <hi>third time</hi> then for the <hi>ſecond,</hi> more for the <hi>fourth,</hi> then for all <hi>the three former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This manner of proceeding in Colledges or Academical Societies, is moſt agreeable to the Ancient Conſtitutions of this Kingdom for the manner of <hi>Proceſſes in Courts Eccleſiaſtick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The not appearing upon lawful Summons in Courts Eccleſiaſtick, was for the firſt neglect, but a mulct of Twenty pence according to the Rate of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in thoſe dayes. The ſecond mulct for not appearing upon like Summons did double the firſt; and ſo did the third, the ſecond. The mulct for the fourth neglect did more then double or treble all the former. For the party thus offending the fourth time in the ſame kind, became liable to the Writ <hi>De Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi> without more ado. And this was an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie puniſhment if it were executed according to <hi>William Rufus his Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note here</hi> 1. That God made this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them and their Poſterity in ſucceſſive Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations as with one man, or one aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Body or Corporation. 2. It was not only a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Life and Promiſes, but of Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Death alſo.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Covenant of Life and Death</hi> which God made with the <hi>Seed of Abraham,</hi> or with the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> upon their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> (afterwards, in more expreſs words, with the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> or tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> throughout their generations) is the true Patern or Authentick leading Caſe of all Juſt and Legal Proceedings, with One and the ſame Partie, for often committing the ſame Offence; eſpecially in Caſe he had been ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fore-warned, whether without any puniſhment at all, or with ſome light puniſhment annexed for the firſt time. Every fore-warning makes the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing offence, though in it ſelf not ſo great, a great deal more hainous and liable to more greivous puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To take a more particular view of the <hi>peculiar Aſpect,</hi> which theſe heavenly Lights (Gods Laws I mean) had to the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah:</hi> For in reſpect of other Kingdoms or Nations their aſpect admits ſome variation: To keep the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> upright in the wayes of Faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of their fathers left them a Twofold Regiſter <note place="margin">God left <hi>Iſrael</hi> a <hi>Regiſter</hi> of Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</note> to be perpetually continued by his Prophets or other ſacred Writers. The One, containing their fore-fathers Good deeds and the proſperity which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes did attend them. The Other, of their Fore-fathers groſſeſt ſins or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and of the calamities which purſued them. The former Regiſter was to encourage them to do that which was good and acceptable in his ſight. The other, to deterre them from evil, from turning aſide from him and his Laws. <hi>The manner of Gods augmenting the puniſhments</hi> or plagues upon ſucceeding Generations, which would not take warning by the puniſhments of their fore-fathers, uſually runs by <hi>the ſcale of ſeven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every man that ſeeth me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cain,</hi> after the Lord had convented him for killing his brother) <hi>will kill me;</hi> whereas, there was not a man in the world beſides his father and himſelf; But <hi>a mans Conſcience</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>is a thouſand witneſſes:</hi> And his Conſcience did ſufficiently convict him, to have deſerved Execution, whereas there was neither Witneſs nor Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>According to this Sentence engraven in this murtherous heart, did God afterwards enjoyn <hi>Noah,</hi> and gave it in expreſs Commandement under his hand to <hi>Moſes [Whoſoever doth ſhed mans blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.]</hi> If this Law were Juſt amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> why was it not executed upon <hi>Cain the firſt Malefactor in this kind?</hi> Nay, why doth God expreſly exempt him from it, and puniſh him with exile only? Doubtleſs this was from His Gracious Univerſal Goodneſs, which alwayes threats before it ſtrike, offereth favour before he proceed to Judgment, and mingleth Judgment with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, before he proceed in rigor of Juſtice. Now <hi>Cain</hi> had no former warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how diſpleaſant murther was to God, and therefore is not ſo ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as every murtherer after him muſt be. For ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Whoſoever ſlayeth Cain, vengeance ſhall be taken on him ſeven-fold.</hi> Yet for any of <hi>Seths</hi> Poſteritie to have killed murtherous <hi>Cain,</hi> had been a ſin in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture farre leſs then for <hi>Cain</hi> to murther his righteous brother: yet (by Rule of divine Juſtice) to be more greivouſly puniſhed then <hi>Cains</hi> murther was; becauſe, <hi>in him they had their Warnings.</hi>

That the viſitation of ſins of Fathers upon their Children, may be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſeventy Generations, even from the firſt giving of the Law by <hi>Moſes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlds End, is apparent, from the verſes following, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 37. unto This: <hi>[Yet will the Lord ſtill remember the Covenant made with</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>

                  <hi>To confeſs the ſins of their Fathers,</hi> according to the intendment or purpoſe of Gods Law, implies an <hi>hearty Repentance</hi> for them, and repentance truly hearty implies not only an <hi>Abſtinence from the ſame</hi> or like tranſgreſſions wherewith their Fathers had provoked Gods wrath, <hi>but a zealous Deſire or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to glorifie God by conſtant Practiſe of the Contrary vertues</hi> or works of Piety.

VVE do not; God forbid we ſhould deny, <hi>This laſt Generations per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal offences againſt our Saviour to have been moſt heynous,</hi> moſt meritorious of exemplary puniſhment in this life. But I know not how it <note place="margin">This referres to the third Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Fol. 3729. handled Fol. 3733.</note> comes to paſs, that many Chriſtian Writers, partly by meaſuring the grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> offences amiſs; partly by deriving their plagues from a wrong root, do nurſe ſuch ſecurity in their hearers, as was in theſe <hi>Iews;</hi> And occaſion them to make up the meaſure of theſe later <hi>Jews</hi> ſins, as they did the meaſure of their fore-fathers.</p>
               <p>In civil Juſtice we know the ſame abuſe is much greater, and more greivouſly puniſhed, whileſt offered to an Officer, though but a Petty Conſtable, then to a meer private man; greater to a Juſtice of Peace, then to a Conſtable, though greater to a Juſtice of Aſſiſe, then to an ordinary Juſtice; but Greateſt of all unto the Prince himſelf. Thus we imagine the puniſhment inflicted upon thoſe <hi>Iews</hi> for their offences againſt our Saviour to have been ſo much more grievous, then any puniſhment for the ſame offence againſt the Prophets, or any Temporal Prince, as Chriſt was greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Prophets, or earthly Princes.</p>
               <p>In this ſhort Collection, notwithſtanding there be three groſſe Inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt:</hi> Admitting, that every degree of dignitie in the party offended (as much as can be demanded) brings forth a correſpondent degree of exceſſe in the offence, ſuppoſing the matter of the offence to be, <hi>(quoad caetera)</hi> equal: Yet, what proportion one degree hath to another, or unto what height any perſonal offence, though againſt our Saviour Himſelf, could by this
<pb n="3745" facs="tcp:32220:231"/>
reckoning amount, is only poſsible for Infinite Wiſdom to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Admitting every perſonal offence againſt Chriſt to be infinite in all ſuch as believe him to be truly God, yet the <hi>Jews</hi> Caſe may differ, becauſe they took him to be but Man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, admitting their perſonal offences againſt him to have been the moſt greivous ſins, that ever were, or could be committed; This will not inferre the Concluſion intended by <hi>Maldonate</hi> and others, That the plagues here threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Saviour muſt wholly be aſcribed to the murthering of Him and his Apoſtles, without any Reference to the ſlaughter of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Infiniteneſs of the Perſon offended makes up but one and not the greateſt Dimenſion in the body of ſin:</hi> the Soliditie or heynouſneſs of it muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived <note place="margin">See Fol. 3341. and Book 8. in quarto pag. 142.</note> from another Root. And though it be moſt true, that every ſin is an offence againſt an <hi>Infinite Majeſtie;</hi> yet is He, whoſe <hi>Majeſtie is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> in a manner infinitely more offended with ſome ſinnes, then with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ignorance of thoſe great myſteries <hi>(which we beleive and acknowledge)</hi> did ſomewhat mitigate the <hi>Iews</hi> offences, as perſonal againſt our Saviour, and excuſe their Perſons a <hi>Tanto,</hi> though not a <hi>Toto. We ſpeak the Wiſdom of God—which none of the Princes of this world knew;</hi> for had they known it, <hi>they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7, 8. And <note place="margin">Luke 23. 34. They know not what they do.</note> again, <hi>They of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and their Rulers becauſe they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the Prophets, they have fulfilled them in condemning him, Acts</hi> 13. 27. <hi>St. Peter</hi> hath avouched as much upon his own knowledge, as <hi>St. Paul</hi> did, in mitigation of theſe Jews offence. <hi>And now brethren I wot that out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ye did it, as did alſo your Rulers, Act.</hi> 3. verſe 17. Some rigid Accuſer of theſe hateful men would perhaps reply that they were <hi>ignorant through their own default.</hi> All this being granted, their fault lies properly in the true and immediate Cauſe of their Ignorance, not in that ignorance which was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Cauſe of their actual murther, then by not reſtraining their malice, which firſt brought forth ignorance, and then murther. What then were the true and proper Cauſes of their malitious Ignorance? <hi>Self-conceit of their own righteouſneſs, pride, ambition, covetouſneſs;</hi> unto all which, as alſo to their <hi>obdurateneſs in all theſe,</hi> and like enormities; ſuch partial apprehenſions of their fathers idolatry and cruelty in killing the Prophets, as we have of their hypocriſie and cruelty againſt Chriſt, did concurre as <hi>Acceſſarie</hi> or <hi>Cauſes Collateral.</hi> Being ſo much addicted to covetouſneſs, to pride and ambition, and ſo ſelf-conceited of their own righteouſneſs in reſpect of other men, it was impoſſible they ſhould not do as they did. Theſe Collections to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion are the ſame with that of our Saviour; <hi>He that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is their condemnation:</hi> What? That they went about to kill Chriſt? No; but <hi>that light is come into the world, and men loved dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather then light.</hi> But why did they ſo? <hi>Becauſe their deeds were evil. For every one that doth evil hateth the light.</hi> He that now is otherwiſe as evil, as they were before Chriſt came, would have hated him and his Diſciples, as much as they did, and is as liable, as they were to any puniſhment, which they ſuffered for their treſpaſſes againſt him. Suppoſe he had come into the world in the dayes of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who put <hi>Zachariah</hi> to death, done the ſame works, uſed the ſame admonitions and reproofs to have recalled that headſtrong genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Idolatry, which he did to reclaim the Scribes and Phariſees from
<pb n="3746" facs="tcp:32220:232"/>
their hypocriſie and malice; Gods Prophets, which knew their temper, would not (I am perſwaded) have been too forward <hi>to have been their Bails</hi> for much better behaviour towards <hi>their Lord and Maſter,</hi> then they had ſhewed towards themſelves his ſervants. <hi>St. Stephen's</hi> Cenſure of this people from <note place="margin">Doth God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh men for what they would have done in ſuch and ſuch Caſes? Quaye.</note> time to time; <hi>[Ye do alwayes reſiſt the holy Ghoſt: As your fathers did, ſo do ye.]</hi> gives us occaſion to ſuſpect that they were ſometimes afore Chriſts time ſo wicked, as if he had come in their dayes, they would have done as this later generation did. But theſe have killed him <hi>De Facto;</hi> Their ſin notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not hereby greater then theirs, that would have been as forward to kill him, if he had given them the like provocation. For ſo his manifeſtation in the fleſh ſhould neceſſarily have made this later Generation worſe then any former had been, and God had dealt leſs graciouſly with them in preſenting his Son unto them, then with their wicked fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which never had ſeen him. But againſt theſe and the like neceſſary Conſequences of the former Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our Saviour proteſts; <hi>God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved, John</hi> 3. 17. And this ſalvation was firſt (out of love no doubt) to be tendred unto <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and her children.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Iſſue of theſe Deductions in brief is this; The Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees did no way exceed their fathers in wickedneſs, unleſs perhaps in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie or unwillingneſs to be reclaimed. Chriſt was a better Teacher then the Prophets were, and unto us it is manifeſt, that theſe Scribes and Phariſees, which would not learn goodneſs of him, were moſt wickedly wilful; But whether more wicked or wilful, then any of their fathers before, or others, that lived ſince that time have been, is more then man can determine. It muſt be left to his judgment, which judgeth not as man doth, by the Event, but by clear ſight of the heart. For the ſame reaſon it cannot be reſolved, whether they that put our Saviour to death were greater ſinners then King <hi>Ioaſh</hi> and his Princes: Only this we know and muſt believe, <hi>That theſe later did fill up the meaſure of their fore-fathers iniquity;</hi> that the complement of their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being come, the vials of Gods wrath were poured more plentifully upon this laſt Generation, then upon any former, but ſhould not have been ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully poured upon it, unleſs <hi>Zacharias</hi> and the Prophets had been ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſlain by their fathers. And for any Argument that can be brought to the contrary, <hi>had Chriſt been crucified, when</hi> Zacharias <hi>was ſlain, and</hi> Zacharias <hi>ſlain when he was crucified</hi> (all other proper Circumſtances of each Fact (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this change of time) continuing the ſame) it is probable from my Text, That <hi>Gods judgments upon this Nation, had been leſs in the former age then they were; and more greivous, more ſudden and terrible in the later, then are now recorded.</hi> Nor can this Conſequence be any whit prejudiced, albeit we grant the practiſes of cruelty againſt our Saviour to have been ſeven hundred thouſand times more heynous in themſelves, then any could have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted againſt <hi>Zacharias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The deſtruction of our Saviours Enemies, upon the firſt Arreſt or ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs abuſe of <hi>His ſacred Body,</hi> in juſtice might, and <hi>(without his Interceſsion)</hi> perhaps would have been more ſudden and dreadful then <hi>Sodoms</hi> was. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate pride, unrelenting cruelty and general impenitencie for other foul ſins, as they concerned the <hi>Whole Trinity,</hi> or were matter of ſin againſt the <hi>Holy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">According to this opinion; Matth. 12. 32. may have a very commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> he could not remit or make interceſsion for them in the dayes of his fleſh, but is to call their Authors to ſtrict account, as he is the Judge of quick and dead: But he that by vertue of his <hi>Commiſsion, as Son of man</hi> did freely forgive all other ſins, did (as my Text imports) remit <hi>all perſonal offences,</hi>

                  <hi>as they only concerned himſelf,</hi> and did not ſuffer the fruits or effects of theſe later <hi>Jews</hi> malice to come upon <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſcore for ſhedding of righteous blood. It was not his Will to have any, more greivouſly puniſhed for being malitiouſly bent againſt him, then they ſhould otherwiſe have been for the unrelenting habitual bent of their malice againſt whomſoever it had beene ſet. Never was bitter enmitie practiſed againſt any ſo little deſirous of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or ſo unwilling to accuſe his enemies, as he was, for ſo he proteſts unto the <hi>Jews</hi> which ſought his life. <hi>Do not think that I will accuſe you to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is one that accuſeth you, even</hi> Moſes, <hi>in whom ye truſt. John</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 45. <hi>Moſes,</hi> though (till Chriſt came) <hi>the meekeſt man</hi> that had been <hi>on earth,</hi> had foretold and ſolemnly threatned thoſe plagues, whoſe execution moſt of the Prophets had ſollicited. But this <hi>Great Prophet</hi> beyond all meaſure of meekneſs and patience, whereof humanity, ſo but meer humanity, is capable, ſeeks by prayer, by reproof, by admonitions and exhortations, by all means juſtly poſſible to prevent them; he often fore-warns what would be the iſſue of their ſtubbornneſs, which he never mentions but with greif and ſorrow of heart; he often intimates, that the moſt malicious murtherer amongſt this people was not ſo deſirous of his death, as he was of all their lives, witneſs his affectionate prayers ſeaſoned with ſighs and tears, even whiles they plotted the execution of their long-intended miſcheif againſt him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which firſt moved me to make, and muſt juſtifie the interpretation of theſe words here made, is <hi>a remarkable Oppoſition</hi> expreſly recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>betwixt our Saviours and his Diſciples deſires</hi> uttered at their death for this peoples good, and the cry of <hi>Abels blood,</hi> and <hi>Zachariah's dying voice, both ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing</hi> vengeance from Heaven againſt their perſecutors. <hi>When they were come to the place, called</hi> Calvarie, <hi>they crucified him; Then ſaid Ieſus, Father forgive them; for they know not what they do, Luke</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 33. This <hi>Infinite Charity,</hi> notwithſtanding, ſome (alwayes jealous, leaſt God ſhould ſhew any token of love towards ſuch as they miſlike, or Chriſt manifeſt any deſire of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom they have markt <hi>for Reprobates)</hi> would have reſtrained unto the Garriſon of Souldiers that conducted him to the Croſs. But Reaſons we have many to think, or rather <hi>firmly</hi> to believe, that he uttered thoſe Prayers <hi>Indefinitely for all,</hi> that either were <hi>Actors</hi> in this buſineſs, or <hi>Approvers</hi> of it, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles:</hi> And if both his <hi>Doctrines</hi> and Miracles, whiles he lived on earth (as all muſt acknowledge) did, why ſhould not his <hi>dying Prayers</hi> in the firſt place reſpect the <hi>loſt ſheep of Iſrael? Roman Souldiers</hi> they were not, but <hi>Jews</hi> of the moſt malignant ſtamp, which martyred <hi>St. Stephen;</hi> yet after he had commended his ſpirit unto <hi>Ieſus</hi> in near the ſame terms, that Jeſus did his unto his Father, <hi>he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord lay not this ſin to their charge; And when he had ſaid this he fell aſleep, Acts</hi> 7. 60. It is no ſin I hope to ſuppoſe, that <hi>the Maſter</hi> was every way as charitable at his death as his Diſciple. It is requiſite that he, which bids us <hi>bleſs our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,</hi> ſhould ſet us a more exquiſite patern, then we are able to expreſs; His prayers for his greateſt perſecutors were more fervent and unfeigned, then ours can be for our deareſt friends. <hi>St. Stephen</hi> in thus praying for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies did but imitate his Maſter, and bear witneſs of his loving kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all. But when <hi>Cain</hi> had killed <hi>Abel,</hi> the voice of <hi>his blood cried unto the Lord from the earth;</hi> and the cry procured a curſe upon him; for the earth became barren unto him, and he was a fugitive and vagabond from the Land, wherein he lived before: Herein (as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> excellently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) a Type of the Jewiſh Nation, who having the prerogative of birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right amongſt Gods People, for the like ſin became fugitives and vagabonds
<pb n="3748" facs="tcp:32220:233"/>
on the face of the earth, whileſt the good Land, which God gave unto their fathers hath been curſt with barrenneſs and deſolation for their ſakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And <hi>this Cry of Abels blood againſt his brother, God would have regiſtred in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his book, as a Proclamation againſt all like impious and bloody Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies until the worlds end:</hi> Whereby the <hi>Iews,</hi> to whom the manner of Gods proceſs with <hi>Cain,</hi> was ſufficiently known, were condemned <hi>Ipſo Facto,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further folicitation of Gods judgments, then their own attempts of like practiſes. No marvel if his puniſhment fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow theirs, when as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any did ſo manifeſtly and notoriouſly revive his ſin, as this Generation here ſpoken of did. <hi>Cain</hi> (ſaith <hi>St. Iohn) was of that wicked one, and ſlew his brother? And wherefore ſlew he him? Becauſe his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous,</hi> 1 John 3. 12. <hi>Ye are of your father the divel</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to theſe <hi>Iewes) and the luſts of your father ye will do; he was a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer from the beginning; Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 44.</p>
               <p>And why did they go about to murther him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe he had told them the truth which he had heard of God; ver.</hi> 40. And as he had taught before in the third of S. <hi>John, They would not receive him, although he came as a light into the world, becauſe their deeds were evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> had foretold, That <hi>the Great Prophet, was to be this peoples Brother;</hi> and, in that they would not hearken to him, they ſtood condemned by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Sentence; <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Whoſoever will not hearken unto my words, which he ſhall ſpeak in my name, I will require it of him, v.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abel,</hi> as pleaſing God by his ſacrifice, and as being ſlain by his ungratious brother, was the <hi>live Type of Chriſt,</hi> as man, whoſe murther by his brethren, though moſt diſpleaſant, yet his ſacrifice was moſt acceptable unto his God. The ſame God, which in the fourth of <hi>Geneſis</hi> admoniſheth <hi>Cain,</hi> partly by threatning, partly by promiſes, <hi>to deſiſt from his wicked purpoſes, doth here in my Text</hi> as lovingly, and yet as ſeverely dehort theſe <hi>Jews</hi> from following his foot-ſteps, leaſt his puniſhments fall heavier upon them: And they not taking warning by <hi>Cain</hi>'s example (to repent them of their envie and grudging againſt their brother) <hi>the Crie, not of Chriſts blood which they ſhed,</hi> but of <hi>Abel</hi>'s, overtakes them; for <hi>Chriſt was conſecrated as the Sanctuary, or place of Refuge, whereto they ſhould have fled;</hi> And <hi>Abel</hi> was the <hi>Revenger of blood,</hi> which did purſue them. So likewiſe doth the <hi>Cry</hi> of <hi>Zacharias</hi>'s at his death; (for that was quite contrary to <hi>our Saviours</hi> and <hi>St. Stephen</hi>'s) <hi>When he died he ſaid; The Lord look upon it, and require it,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 22, The preſent Effect of this his dying ſpeech compared with <hi>St. Lukes</hi> narration of Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Admonition, affords the true Comment on my Text, <hi>Therefore (ſaid the wiſdom of God) I will ſend them Prophets and Apoſtles, and ſome of them they ſhall ſlay; That the blood of all the Prophets ſhed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation, from the blood of</hi> Abel <hi>unto the blood of</hi> Zacharias; <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be required of this generation,</hi> Luke 11. v. 49, 50, 51. The Emphatical reſuming of the Terms which <hi>Zacharias</hi> uſed <hi>[It ſhall be required of this generation]</hi> implies as much, as if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had ſaid, <q>The day of vengeance and execution, which <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited againſt your fathers for their <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> from God, and their <hi>Cruelty</hi> towards him, is yet to come. His innocent blood, which was in part requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of that wicked King and the Princes which ſhed it, ſhall be required in fuller meaſure of <hi>this generation,</hi> which is more bloodily minded then that was, and herein worſe then all the former, in that it will not take warning, either by <hi>Cain</hi>'s puniſhment, or the calamities which befel this people for

their cruelty towards <hi>Zacharias</hi> and other Prophets:</q> For the Army of the Syrians came with a ſmall company, and the Lord delivered a very great hoaſt into their hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they had forſaken the Lord; So they executed judgment againſt <hi>Joaſh;</hi> And left him in great diſeaſes; and his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants conſpired againſt him for the blood of the ſons of <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> the Prieſt, and ſlew him, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 24 24, 25.</p>

                  <hi>words only by way of Prophecie,</hi> fearing belike, leaſt his uſing of them by way of <hi>Curſe,</hi> or <hi>Imprecation,</hi> might argue he died not in perfect charity. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was a Prophet, he might foreſee many reaſons unknown to us, not to pray for them, but againſt them. Or if out of the bitterneſs of his ſoul, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at this graceleſs Kings ingratitude, he did thus pray againſt him, and his people; we may not condemn him of ſin, although <hi>it would be a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſin in us to imitate him in like Caſes;</hi> Nor is it neceſſary we ſhould think he did wiſh their eternal deſtruction, but only indefinitely deſire, that God would not ſuffer ſuch an <hi>Execrable Conſpiracie</hi> to go unpuniſhed, leaſt others ſhould be emboldened to do the like. And though we know not upon what motives or warrants all other Prophets of God, or Types of Chriſt, in their perplexity and diſtreſs ſo zealouſly pray for vengeance againſt their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſecutors: yet we ſhould know <hi>One true Uſe or End of theſe their uſual practiſes to be this; that the world might note the difference between them, and the promiſed Meſsias;</hi> who though he had ſuffered greater indignities, more open ſhame, and more greivous vexations at this peoples hands, then all his fore-runners had done: yet never complains, never prayes againſt them, but for them, even whiles they crucifie him. This his <hi>peculiar Character</hi> argues he came into the world <hi>not to condemn, but to ſave it.</hi> And when his Diſciples deſire him to call down fire from heaven, as <hi>Elias</hi> did, he derives <hi>his ſharp Check</hi> from this Principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they ſhould have known; <hi>Ye know not what Spirit ye are of; for the Son of God is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them, Luke</hi> 9. 55. Did then <hi>Elias</hi> or <hi>Eliſha</hi> his Scholar ſin in taking vengeance upon the enemies of their God? Who dare avouch it? Or if to execute vengeance were lawful to them, <hi>as they were Prophets,</hi> was it unlawful for <hi>Zacharias</hi> upon greater perſonal indignities to deſire the Lord would revenge his death? <hi>Yet Chriſts Diſciples might not do ſo, becauſe they were to be of another Spirit,</hi> as having a better example ſet by their Maſter at his death.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But whence is it, that <hi>Zacharias</hi>'s curſe ſhould take better effect againſt <note place="margin">This relates to the third Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> this Generation, which had never offended him, never known him, then our Saviours prayers powred out for their ſafety, whiles he offered himſelf in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice?

God forbid! Rather this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by reviving their fore-fathers ſins, awaked Gods Juſtice to renew their plagues; and by their impenitencie made themſelves uncapable of that <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon,</hi> which Chriſt had procured for all that be penitent, or would rightly uſe it: But neither did he pray, that their ſtubbornneſs might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, nor did <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s curſe make them ſtubborn. <hi>Their impenitency is from themſelves,</hi> and whiles they continue ſtubborn and impenitent, they can have <hi>no Allowance of that General Pardon,</hi> which they will not plead or ſtand to, as ſtanding too much upon their own integrity. Since Chriſts death they have been perpetually puniſhed for their impenitencie, yet not puniſhed with perpetual impenitencie for putting him to death.</p>

To ſatisfie Gods juſtice for the leaſt treſpaſs committed by our Anceſtors is impoſſible; But to avert their juſt puniſhment from our ſelves, by unfeigned Converſion unto God in thoſe particulars, wherein our fathers have forſaken him, is a duty poſſible, becauſe neceſſary to every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoul.

If the father have been a blaſphemer, or greivous ſwearer, the ſon muſt conſecrate his tongue to God, and uſe no ſpeech, but ſuch, as may miniſter grace unto the hearers.

But if poſitive or actual tranſgreſſions otherwiſe equal be liable by the Rule of Divine Juſtice, to more then double puniſhment in the ſon, that hath had fair warnings in his father: It is very conſonant to the ſame Rule, that the ſon, albeit he do not imitate his fore-fathers in actual tranſgreſſions, ſhould ſuffer greater temporal puniſhments, then they did, <hi>for not confeſsing their ſins,</hi> as Gods Law requires; or not glorifying Gods name by his fidelity in contrary practiſes of charity, and godlineſs. Many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by not making reſtitution of goods ill gotten by ſome of their Anceſtors, have forfeited unto Gods hands whatſoever all had gotten. The beſt way for all to make kingdoms, or private inheritances greater in length or duration; <note place="margin">☜</note> would be to diminiſh them in maſs, or ſubſtance, by paring off what is tainted or corrupted.</p>
               <p>But leaving theſe particulars to the Application, let us apply the doctrine hitherto generally delivered unto the point in Queſtion. We muſt conſider, that the Jewiſh Nation had many fore-warnings of Gods diſpleaſure in the Ages before <hi>Zacharias;</hi> That in his time, both Prince and People, the whole Nation ſtood as condemned by that his ſentence ſolemnly pronounced <hi>Ex Cathedra; [ye ſhall not proſper; ye have forſaken the Lord, and the Lord hath forſaken you:]</hi> though God, tempering his judgments with mercy, reprieved this State in hope of amendment. But of ſucceeding Princes ſome proved more groſs Idolaters then <hi>Joaſh</hi> had been; <hi>viz. Ahaz:</hi> Some ſhed more innocent blood then he had done; ſo did <hi>Manaſſes.</hi> And of the people more grew worſe, few better, then their fathers had been; ſuch as were better were not ſo forward to expiate the ſins of former times, as the worſe ſort were to augment them. And according as they were augmented, Gods judgments did gather and multiply by degrees againſt this people; And the ſentence ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly denounced by <hi>Zachariah,</hi> often re-iterated in more ſevere termes by later Prophets, is executed at length, according to the full meaſure of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; witneſs the firſt and ſecond deſtruction of the City and Temple, the deſolation of the Land, and captivity of the whole Nation. The whole
<pb n="3752" facs="tcp:32220:235"/>
manner of Gods proceeding againſt them, firſt in Mercie, then in Judgment, laſtly in Severity and fury is moſt directly ſet forth unto us by Our Saviour in the Parable of the Vineyard <hi>let out to husbandmen,</hi> whoſe eſtate in it was utterly void upon the firſt Non-payment of rent, if the Lord had dealt in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice with them. But though of his ſervants, or rent-gatherers they had bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten one, and killed another, and ſtoned a third; yet in merciful expectation of their amendment he ſent other ſervants, mo then the firſt, and they did unto them likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Though this iniquity exceeded the former, yet the Lords mercy exceeded both: and out of his abundant kindneſs, laſt of all he ſent His Son, ſaying, <hi>[They will reverence my Son.]</hi> But as mercy had abounded; ſo their ſins did ſtill ſuper-abound: For when they ſaw the Son, they ſaid among themſelves, <hi>[This is the Heir; Come let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his inheritance:]</hi> And as they ſaid, ſo they did; <hi>[They caught him, and caſt him out of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and ſlew him.]</hi> So fully ripe for Juſtice was iniquity once come to this height, that they themſelves, whom this Caſe concerns, adjudge the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this murther uncapable of mercy. For to Our Saviour demanding of them <hi>[When therefore the Lord of the vineyard cometh; What will he do unto theſe husbandmen?]</hi> They make Reply <hi>[He will miſerably deſtroy thoſe wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which ſhall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him the fruits in their ſeaſon,</hi> Matth. 21. Luke 20.</p>
               <p>Moſt men (I doubt not) underſtand the General meaning of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And it is in effect the ſame with the Prophets Song of his Beloved concerning his vineyard, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 1. The one is as a Paraphraſe upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The hiſtories of this Nation from that time to this, is as a full and juſt Commentary upon both. <hi>The vineyard of the Lord of hoaſts</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, v. 7.) <hi>is the houſe of Iſrael; and the men of Judah his pleaſant plants;</hi> And being reaſonable plants, they were alſo the husbandmen here meant. The fruits looked for were <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and in ſtead of it <hi>behold, oppreſsion: righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>St. Chryſoſt.</hi> upon the fifth of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
                  </note> and in lieu hereof, behold a Cry. Theſe were wild grapes. If any liſt to deſcend to more particulars, By the fruitful hill, wherein the vineyard was ſeated; he may underſtand <hi>the hill of Sion,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> by the Tower, the <hi>Temple:</hi> By the hedge the <hi>fortifications of Hieruſalem,</hi> begun by <hi>David,</hi> without which our Saviour (who is the heir meant in the Goſpel) was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; being ſentenced to execution within the vineyard. The judgment, which the chief Prieſt and Elders gave againſt themſelves: was by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet referred unto the Inhabitants of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and men of <hi>Judah.</hi> The <hi>Tenour</hi> of it is the ſame in the Prophet and the Evangeliſt, <hi>I will tell you</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>what I will do to my vineyard; I will take away the hedge thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up, and break down the wall thereof, and it ſhall be troden down; And I will lay it waſte, and it ſhall not be pruned, or digged; But there ſhall come up briars and thorns. I will alſo command the Clouds, that they rain no rain upon it:</hi> That is, Not whiles it remained in <hi>Judah,</hi> whoſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are now become like the mountains of <hi>Gilboah,</hi> accurſed for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the King of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>The execution of this Sentence was fitted to divers times in different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, according to their unfruitfulneſs, or fertility in bringing forth wild grapes, when good grapes were moſt expected.</p>
               <p>More exactly parallel to the Parable, as it is propoſed by our Saviour, we <note place="margin">

                  <hi>The Firſt</hi> we take from <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s death; a Seaſon, wherein God (the men or <hi>Iudah</hi> being Judges) might juſtly expect extraordinary fruit of his vineyard. For <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High-Prieſt, father in <hi>Zachariah,</hi> had laſtly <note place="margin">1. at the death of <hi>Zechariah.</hi>
                  </note> pruned and dreſt it, re-ingrafting <hi>Joaſh,</hi> as a forlorn Plant, into the ſtock of <hi>David,</hi> from which he had been for a while diſ-planted by <hi>Athaliah</hi> the Queen Regent; through whoſe cruelty all the reſt of the Royal Branches utterly periſhed: But inſtead of grapes the Princes bring forth wild grapes. <hi>After the death of</hi> Jehoiada, <hi>Came the Princes and made obeyſance to the King; who hearkened unto them. And they left the Houſe of the Lord and ſerved groves: So wrath came upon</hi> Judah, <hi>for this treſpaſs. Yet he ſent Prophets to them, to bring them again unto the Lord; and they teſtified againſt them; but they would not give ear. After all this, the Spirit of the Lord came upon</hi> Zachariah, <hi>and he ſaid unto them, Thus ſaith God; Why tranſgreſs ye the Lords Commandements that ye cannot proſper?</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 17, 22. He ſaid no more then <hi>Moſes</hi> their Law-giver had expreſſed in that Divine Song, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. which this people were to teach their children, that it might be a witneſs againſt them. Notwithſtanding in deſpight of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and the Spirit of the Lord, which emboldened <hi>Zachariah</hi> to preach it; they confirm their deſperate league with the Prophets blood, that did diſſwade it.</p>
               <p>Of thoſe other Servants of the Lord, ſent unto them about the ſame time; we may without breach of charity ſuſpect; one at leaſt was beaten and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlain; Becauſe it is certain, that <hi>Zachariah,</hi> whoſe Father had deſerved ſo well of King, Princes and People of <hi>Judah,</hi> was by the Kings appointment ſtoned to death. And (beſides the Calamities of warre, which befell the Land in the end of that year) the Temple, in which he died, was by his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curſe deſigned to ruine and deſtruction. It could not be purged from guilt of his guiltleſs blood, but by that fire, which in the next generation did devour it.</p>
               <p>Yet before the approach of this Second Climacterical Seaſon; <hi>The Lord</hi>

                  <hi>God of their fathers ſent to them by his Meſſengers, riſing up betimes, and ſending; becauſe he had compaſsion on his people, and on his dwelling place. But they mocked the Meſſengers of God, deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord aroſe, till there was no remedy,</hi> 2 Chron. 36. 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This affectionate deſcription of Gods tender care and compaſſion in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prophets to reclaim them, argues (what Our Saviour expreſſeth in the <note place="margin">This Referres to the ſixth Queſtion.</note> Parable) <hi>That he ſent moe, then before.</hi> And in the age following <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s death, lived all the Prophets, whoſe Prophecies are extant; But unto all thoſe (though moe) they did, as they had done unto the former, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (as the <hi>Jews</hi> confeſs) was ſlain by <hi>Manaſſes; Uriah</hi> (as you heard before) was killed by <hi>Jehoiakim;</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſometimes beaten, ſometimes impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, perpetually abuſed, during the reign of <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> And ſo at length the plagues threatned, and in part executed upon this people imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after <hi>Zechariah</hi>'s death, are multiplied upon that wicked generation. The Rod of Gods wrath is for faſhion the ſame, but now more ſharp and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Their fathers had ſlain <hi>Zachariah</hi> in the Temple: And for this ſin not expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but continued and approved, at leaſt by like practiſes of this Generation; <hi>The Lord brought upon them the King of the</hi> Chaldees, <hi>who ſlew their young men with the ſword in the houſe of their Sanctuary, and had no compaſsion upon young men or maidens, old men, or him that ſtoopeth for age, he gave them all into his hand. And all the veſſels of the Houſe of God, great and ſmall, and the treaſures of the Houſe of the Lord, and the treaſures of the King and of his Princes; all</hi>
                  <pb n="3754" facs="tcp:32220:236"/>
                  <hi>thoſe he brought to</hi> Babylon, 2 Chron. ch. 36. v. 17, 18. What are thoſe but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meer enlargements of the former calamities, which enſued the Butchery of <hi>Zacharias?</hi> which were theſe. <hi>It came to paſs in the revolution of the year, that the hoaſt of</hi> Syria <hi>came up againſt</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh, <hi>and they came to</hi> Judah <hi>and Jeruſalem, and deſtroyed all the Princes of the people from among the people, and ſent all the ſpoil of them unto the King of</hi> Damaſcus, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 23. Some principal particulars of the ſpoils here intimated, are fully expreſſed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. where the reſt of this ſtory is omitted: <hi>And</hi> Jehoaſh <hi>King of</hi> Judah <hi>took all the hallowed things, and all the gold, found in the treaſures of the Houſe of the Lord, and in the Kings houſe, and ſent it to</hi> Hazael <hi>King of</hi> Syria, <hi>and he went away from</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had burnt the Houſe of God and the Palaces of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with fire, had deſtroyed all the goodly veſſels thereof; yet the Lord doth not utterly forſake his vineyard, his Church <hi>(the Quire of Saints)</hi> ſtill neſtles in the branches that are tranſplanted, whoſe off ſpring within ſeventy years is reſtored unto their native ſoyl, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> repaired, the Temple re-edified, and the Land of <hi>Iudah</hi> ſown with the ſeed of man and beaſt. After this State thus raiſed again from Civil Death, if poſterity will not believe, nor bring forth better fruits then heretofore their fathers have done; neither would they believe, though <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were raiſed from the dead to exhort them to repentance.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon, after their return from <hi>Babylon</hi> and re-edification of the <note place="margin">The <hi>Third Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterical Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> at Chriſts coming.</note> Temple, God ſends no more Prophets (ſave ſuch as they brought with them) until the fulneſs of time, or the <hi>Third Climacterical Period</hi> of this State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the diſeaſe being become more deſperate; he ſent <hi>his only Son the Heir of all things,</hi> as knowing, that if he could not, none ever after ſhould be able to recover it. <hi>This his Son was that Lord,</hi> which, by his peculiar preſence, had <hi>brought this vine out of Egypt,</hi> but (after he had planted it in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and let it out unto theſe husbandmen) went into a farre Country, that is, <hi>he appeared not unto them,</hi> as he did to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> &amp;c. until in the laſt dayes he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Heaven in the true form and ſubſtance of man to receive the fruits: He looked (at this time eſpecially) his vineyard ſhould had brought forth grapes, but it brought forth more wild grapes then before. He looked for weighty matters of the Law, and behold tithing of Mint, Anniſe and Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min; He looked for judgment, mercy and faith; But behold, covetouſneſs, extortion, pride and cruelty; grapes more bitter then the grapes of <hi>Sodom; Sourneſs it ſelf</hi> the very <hi>leaven of Hypocriſie;</hi> yet upon the firſt denial of ſuch fruits, as he expected, he departs not from them, he accuſeth them not unto his Father: But (as they had two or three fore-warnings more remarkable then ordinary in ſeveral Generations of their Anceſtors; ſo) he expects a loyal Anſwer at more times of fruit, then one or two, preſenting himſelf to them for three years and more together at every ſeveral Paſsover, beſides other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary ſolemnities. And yet at laſt for conſtant delivery of that Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which he had from his father, they caught him, and condemned him in the vineyard, but carry him out of it to be crucified in Mount <hi>Calvarie.</hi> And thus at length <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s Prophecie againſt <hi>Ioaſh</hi> and his wicked Princes, and his Imprecation at his death, are fulfilled in this wicked generation; they formally forſook their God, when they cried <hi>[We have no King but Caeſar]</hi> and demanding <hi>Barabbas</hi> a murtherer (the ſon of their father the Divle;) they deſtoyed <hi>Ieſus the Son of God,</hi> And the Lord hath utterly forſaken them, not the Temple and City only, but the Inhabitants, but the whole race of the Jewiſh Nation, and hath let forth His Vineyard to us Gentiles. They were
<pb n="3755" facs="tcp:32220:236"/>
ſo rich by his bounty, that they were aſhamed to acknowledge ſo mean a man as Our Saviour, for their Lord, and Owner of the Land they inhabited. And as the Prophet foretold, <hi>they hid their faces from him;</hi> And therefore, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> teſtified againſt them in his dying Song, <hi>The Lord hides his face from them.</hi> Darkneſs did over-ſpread the Land of <hi>Iudah</hi> at his Paſſion, and the light of his countenance, ſince that time, hath never ſhined upon that Nation. They loſt Gods extraordinary Illumination by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> (as ſome hold) at <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s death, (as moſt agree) at the deſtruction of <hi>Salomon</hi>'s Temple; but now are deſtitute of the light of Scripture, without all knowledge of Gods Word, ſince they rejected <hi>Him, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world;</hi> In the very ſun-ſhine of the Goſpel, they grope like blind men, that cannot ſee a beaten way, and muſt ſo continue throughout their generations unto the worlds end; until they ſhall unfeignedly <hi>confeſs the iniquity of their fathers, and that they have walked contrary unto me; And that I alſo have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies,</hi> Lev. 26. 40, 41.</p>
               <p>As the ſins of thoſe Jews, which rejected <hi>the Light of the world,</hi> and <hi>ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revolted from their King;</hi> have been thus remarkably viſited upon their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that will not confeſs their ſins in ſo doing, nor acknowledge him, whom they rejected, for their expected Redeemer: So were the ſins of that generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſlue <hi>Zachariah,</hi> viſited upon this, which crucified our Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they neither did truly confeſs them (but rather revive and increaſe them) nor finally admit of his Sacrifice, which was appointed for the expiation of that Prodigious Fact (as of all others) wherewith the City and Temple had been polluted. Unleſs God's mercy had warded off the ſtroke of his juſtice, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> it ſelf had been made an heap of ſtones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when King <hi>Ioaſh</hi> ſtoned <hi>Zachariah</hi> to death: So had the Temple it ſelf, wherein his guiltleſs blood lay uncovered, been covered with Duſt. The whole Nations plagues in rigour of juſtice might have been much greater at that time, then they have been ſince.</p>
               <p>Now all the mercie or mitigation of Juſtice, which former Generations found, was through the Mediation of the Son of God. And ſeeing theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have been more refractorie to this their Mediator himſelf, then were their fathers to his Prophets; ſeeing they have ſolemnly diſavowed him, and bid a defiance to his Embaſſadors; Gods mercies, which had daily ſhrowded <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> from his wrath, as the hen doth her young ones from the ſtorm, leave it, and her children open to his juſtice.</p>
               <p>For Reſolution of the main Point or difficulty propoſed; The forſaking, or putting the Son of God to death, is (for ought I can gather) no direct and poſitive cauſe of all the miſeries expreſſed or intimated in my Text: <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch a Cauſe of Ieruſalems deſtruction, as the Pilots abſence is of ſhipwrack;</hi> a Cauſe of it only in this ſenſe, that her inhabitants by forſaking him have exempted themſelves from his wonted protection; and God's juſtice, which had long watched his departure from the City and Temple (as Sergeants do their egreſs, which have taken Sanctuary) now attatches them, when there is none to become their Surety, none to intercede for mitigation of Juſtice, none to hinder, why judgments heretofore alwayes abated, and oft-times alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deferred, may not be executed upon them in full meaſure. But that their Perſonal Offences againſt their Mediator ſhould wholly, or ſpecially procure this woful doom, or come at all into the Bill of their Indictment, is (in my Opinion) no way probable. The character of his own ſpeeches, as well in my Text, or elſewhere, altogether diſclaims this Aſſertion, as unconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="3756" facs="tcp:32220:237"/>
to the form of wholſome doctrine. But may we ſay, that albeit his blood did not augment their plagues that ſhed it, becauſe never laid unto their charge, it may notwithſtanding exempt them and their children from hope of mercy, or mitigation of puniſhments due unto them for other ſins? Or that ſuch, as ſince his death have <hi>pined away in their own ſins, and the ſins of their fathers,</hi> did therefore periſh, becauſe he had <hi>abſolutely decreed</hi> not to ſave them or grant them means of repentance? God forbid! This were more, then to ſay <hi>[They ſtumbled that they ſhould fall.]</hi> And in as much, as the riches of the world will be much greater by their fulneſs, then by their Fall or diminution, the fault is ours, as well as theirs, that their Converſion is not accompliſhed; Both we and they are liable to a ſtrict account, <hi>That we would not be gathered, when God would have gathered us.</hi>

               <p>For your better ſatisfaction in the Former Point, You are to conſider, the Nature and Tenor of Gods General Covenant with this people. The mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Bleſſings and extraordinary Curſes propoſed unto the two ſeveral wayes of Life and Death, which <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt had ſet before this people, are ſufficiently known, being moſt expreſly ſet down, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. throughout the whole Chapters.</p>
               <p>The like Covenant was renewed with <hi>Davids</hi> Line, in the ſame Tenor. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 29, &amp;c, <hi>His Seed will I make to endure for ever; and his Throne as the dayes of Heaven.

not in their Immunitie from puniſhments, but in the Aſſurance of their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, upon their penitencie.</p>
               <p>The Tenor of both Covenants then (in brief) was Thus. <q>Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Levit. 26. Deut. 7. 14. and 28.

But I will remember them according to the Covenant of old, Or, I will for their ſakes remember the Covenant of their Anceſtors, whom I brought forth out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. And in the 42. verſe of the ſame Chapter, <hi>(when they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their iniquity before him in their diſtreſſe)</hi> He ſaith, He would <hi>remember His Covenant with</hi> Jacob, <hi>and alſo his Covenant with</hi> Iſaac <hi>and with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</p>
               <p>The ſame Covenant is more ſolemnly eſtabliſhed at the Dedication of the Temple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. by <hi>Salomon.</hi> He ſuppoſed this People ſhould be plagued for their ſins, as others were: But <hi>yet if they turned to the Lord with all their heart, and with all their ſoul, in the Land of their captivity;</hi> the effect of his Petition is; <hi>That the Lords eyes ſhould be open, and his ears attent unto the prayers which they made towards the Temple which he had built.</hi> And in this ſenſe is God ſaid <hi>to ſhew mercie unto thouſands in ſuch as love Him and keep his Commandements:</hi> Becauſe for <hi>Abraham</hi> and for <hi>David</hi>'s ſake, they ſtill enjoyed the aſſurance of recovering their ruinate and decayed Eſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet here we are again to conſider, that the Covenant was not made <hi>In capita,</hi> as if it were to begin intirely <hi>with every particular Man;</hi> but rather with their whole Succeſſions in their ſeveral Generations. They ſtood all joyntly bound to obey the Lord their God: So as Poſterity muſt make up the Arrerages of their Fathers ryot, by their warie and diligent obſervance of thoſe Commandements which the other had broken. If the Fathers had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Idolatry, the Poſterity muſt redeem their ſins or break them off, by preaching reformation of Religion, and reſtoring the true Worſhip of God again. If the Fathers had cauſed Gods wrath upon the Land by oppreſſion, extortion and cruelty, the Children muſt divert it, by mercie, bountie and open-handedneſs towards the Poor; and by reſtitution of goods ill-gotten by their Fathers, unto their proper Owners; or by reſtoring goods right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyed, but imployed amiſs, unto their natural and right uſe. If the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have tranſgreſſed all or moſt of Gods <hi>neg.</hi> Commandments, the children are bound to rectifie their errors, by practiſing the affirmative duties of the Law. In a word, as the Fathers offences have been greater, either in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, magnitude, or continuance, ſo muſt the Vertues and Piety of Poſterity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound <hi>in Perfection of Parts, Intention of Degrees and Duration of time.</hi> For although it be moſt true, that <hi>the Childrens teeth are not ſet on edge, for their Fathers eating ſour grapes, but the ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die, Ezek.</hi> 18. Yet is not this ſo to be underſtood, but that the ſon may be puniſhed for thoſe ſins which his Father only did actually commit, if ſo he ſeek not to rectifie his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, by inclining to the Contrary Duties: For, not ſo doing, <hi>His fathers ſins are made his by participation,</hi> and the Curſe becomes hereditary. As he that
<pb n="3758" facs="tcp:32220:238"/>
helpeth not when he may, doth further or abett the evil done by others, and is thereby made Acceſſary or part-taker of other mens ſins: So likewiſe are the Children guilty of their fathers tranſgreſſions, and liable to Gods wrath cauſed by them, if they ſeek not to rectifie the ſame, by their zealous prayers, ſpeedie repentance and unfeigned turning to the Lord. So is it ſaid, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>The Son that ſeeth all his fathers ſins, which he hath done, and feareth, neither doth ſuch like;</hi> but rather if the father have cruelly oppreſſed and ſpoiled his brother by violence, he feeds the hungrie, and clothes the naked, and keeps all Gods Statutes, <hi>he ſhall live.</hi> Hence it is, that this people of God in their diſtreſs make <hi>The Confeſsion of their fore-fathers ſins as Eſſential</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Confeſſion of fore-fathers ſins a neceſſary Ingredient of Repentance.</note> 
                  <hi>an Ingredient</hi> (or Condition) <hi>of their prayers, as the confeſsion of their own, Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106: 6, 7. For this the Lord himſelf had expreſly taught them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. <hi>For your tranſgreſsions the Land of your enemies ſhall eat you up.</hi> And <hi>they that are left of you ſhall pine away for their iniquitie, and for the iniquities of their fathers ſhall they pine away with them alſo. Then they ſhall confeſs their iniquity, and the wickedneſs of their fathers.</hi> Ver. 38. <hi>Thus doing, I will remember</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>my Covenant with</hi> Jacoo, <hi>and my Covenant alſo with</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and alſo my Covenant with</hi> Abraham <hi>will I remember, and will remember the Land.</hi> You ſee then it is evident, that as <hi>Adam</hi>'s-ſin remaines in his Poſterity, until it be taken away in Chriſt; ſo doth Gods wrath abide upon a Land, for the former Inhabitants ſins, and paſſeth from the Dead unto the Living; unleſs the Attonement be made by the ſweet incenſe of prayer and fervencie of ſpirit, which is to be in every Chriſtian and ſpiritual Prieſts heart as ready upon this occaſion, as fire from the Altar was in <hi>Aarons</hi> hand, when he ſtayed the Plague, by ſtanding betwixt the dead and them that were alive, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 46. It is not the ſacrifice, though of the calves of mens lips, without an <hi>humbled and contrite ſpirit,</hi> and fervent zeal of bleſſing Gods Name by <hi>Contrary good deeds,</hi> that can ſtay the plague and divert the wrath gone out from God againſt a Land, for her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Inhabitants their Predeceſſors ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From theſe Principles we may eaſily gather, How Gods Mercies may be abridged towards a Land or People leſs ſinful perhaps then others former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been for <hi>actual tranſgreſsions,</hi> if we conſider the ſins only of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time. From the ſame Principles we may likewiſe clearly diſcern, how the full meaſure of any Lands or Peoples iniquity may be accompliſhed then, when to mens ſeeming their out-rages be nothing ſo greivous, as others <note place="margin">☞</note> before them have been, or when their Princes or Rulers are more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily religious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Where the tranſgreſſions of Predeceſſors have been many and grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and the Reformation of their Succeſſors, but ſlight or imperfect: the wrath of God procured by the former, may remain ſtill, and light heavieſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Reaſons why a people leſſe actually ſinful is more plagued.</note> the Third Generation following, who ſhall procure it further, if they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Grandſires ſins, notwithſtanding their immediate Parents or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors did in part repent, or in ſome ſort renounce their Fathers wayes. For the fruits of ſuch repentance, ſeeing it is <hi>not Total and proceeds not from a perfect and unfeigned heart,</hi> do but as it were for a time put off the Fit or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Gods wrath: they take not away the diſeaſe it ſelf, which therefore returns to its courſe again: As the Pſalmiſt excellently deſcribes the effects of ſuch repentance. <hi>When he ſtew them, they ſought him, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned</hi>

                  <hi>and ſought God early. And they remembred that God was their ſtrength, and the moſt high God their Redeemer: but their heart was not upright with him: Neither were they faithful in his Covenant.</hi> The fruit of this was, that oft-times

he called back his anger, and <hi>would not ſuffer his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe:</hi> This ſtayed the Courſe or Motion of his wrath; It did not miniſh the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Propenſion of the ſame. But when the former ſins burſt out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, either in them or their poſterity: His judgments drew nearer unto them then before; and his vengeance was more fierce and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Where the Reformation of Religion and turning unto the Lord is on the Princes parts perfect and compleat, yet the people do not inwardly repent, and with a perfect heart abjure their fore-fathers wayes: the wrath of <note place="margin">☜</note> God due unto their fathers ſins comes upon them, and is executed by taking away their good, and giving them Princes alike minded to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And ſo by little and little <hi>they fulfil the iniquity of their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. To give you a view of theſe General undoubted Truths in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of this Kingdom.

                  </note> this Land and People, ſo farre over-ballancing his Juſtice, that all the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſon had ſet up (albeit idolatry be a moſt greivous ſin) did not any more, then bring his Mercie to an <hi>Equipoize</hi> with it again. But <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> following his Fathers footſteps in evil, not his religious Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers paths in good, puls down Gods judgments upon his head, and firſt bears the rod of his tranſgreſſion, having more then one half of his Kingdom rent from him by his ſervant <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and afterwards both he and <hi>Judah,</hi> which had remained with him, bear the ſtrokes of their iniquity, by the hand of <hi>Shiſhak</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who forraged the Land, and took away the treaſures <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 14. 25.</note> of the Temple of the Lord. But in this God did but ſhake his ſword over their heads: Theſe beginnings of plagues and judgments are but the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of His wrath which abides not: for his Mercie preſently retired unto the ſame Point where it ſtood at <hi>Jeroboams</hi> revolt. Of an unwiſe father there ſprung up immediately an unrighteous ſon <hi>Abijam,</hi> who though he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">Abijam.</note> good ſucceſs againſt his enemies: yet as the ſequel of this Story inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 3. he had almoſt brought Gods fierce wrath upon the Land, by following his fathers footſteps; but that the Lord as yet drew back his puniſhing hand, for Righteous <hi>David</hi> his great Grand-fathers ſake. <hi>For</hi> David<hi>'s ſake did the Lord his God give him a light in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and ſet up his ſon after him, and eſtabliſhed</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.

Although <hi>Jehoſhaphat's</hi> heart was upright: yet did he work no perfect Reformation. For the high places were not taken away.

(a ſucceſſor to the Kings of Iſrael in all wickedneſs and Idolatry.) And as his life was wicked, ſo was his eſtate unfortunate, his end terrible, and his death ignominious. In his dayes did <hi>Edom</hi> make his final revolt from <hi>Iudah,</hi> 2 Chron. 21. 10. <hi>and Libnah, at the ſame time, becauſe he had forſaken the God of his fathers.</hi> And ver. 14. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elijah</hi> to him by a letter,) <hi>with a great plague will the Lord ſmite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives and all thy ſubſtance.</hi> And ſo Gods judgments came upon him and his Children: He himſelf dies of a lingering loathſom diſeaſe, without the wonted ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Funerals. And <hi>Ahaziah</hi> his youngeſt ſon (all the elder being ſlain <note place="margin">Ahaziah.</note> by the Arabians: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 1.) is about a year after killed by <hi>Jehu</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting judgment upon the houſe of <hi>Ahab.</hi> After all this were All the Royal <note place="margin">Athaliah.

For the Princes hearts were wholly ſet upon idolatry: And the King himſelf is drawn upon his own deſtruction by them, after <hi>Iehoiada</hi>'s death. As his beginnings were good and godly: ſo were his later dayes idolatrous and cruel; and <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s blood was recompenſed upon his head, and upon the head of <hi>Amaziah</hi> his ſon; who, though he were not (like his father) guilty as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <note place="margin">Amaziah.</note> of actual murther in putting a Prophet to death: yet thus farre by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation</hi> guilty of his fathers ſin, that he is impatient of the Prophets juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof: As his father killed, ſo he threatens the Prophet for reproving him for his ſins; <hi>for taking the gods of</hi> Edom <hi>for his gods,</hi> 2 Chron. 25. 14. <hi>Have they made thee the Kings Counſellor? Ceaſe thou: why ſhould they ſmite thee? And the Prophet ceaſed, but ſaid, I know the Lord hath determined to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou haſt done this, and haſt not obeyed my Counſel.</hi> His doom is read, and judgment followes: For he is ſhamefully foyled, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 23. by <hi>Ioaſh</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and led captive home to his own good Town of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> four hundred cubits of whoſe wals were broke down to make entrance for his triumphant enemies, in the ſight of his own people. And after his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, bought with his own treaſure and with the treaſure of the Lords houſe; his own Subjects conſpire againſt him, and purſue him unto death, where he dies (his fathers death) by the hands of his Servants, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 27. As <hi>Amaziah</hi> from good beginnings grew idolatrous; ſo <hi>Uzziah</hi> his ſon after <note place="margin">Uzziah.</note> good ſucceſs, became in his later end, ſacrilegiouſly preſumptuous. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling with the Prieſts Office, he becomes liable to the Prieſts Tribunal: He is judged a Leper, and removed from adminiſtration of the Kingdom, for the leproſie wherewith the Lord had ſmitten him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thus in proceſs of time is ſtill the increaſe of ſin: either their Kings are wicked (as but two from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time which continued in good:) Or if their Kings be vertuous and religious, as <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> had been, and <hi>Iotham</hi> ſon to <hi>Uzziah</hi> now is: yet in his dayes again <hi>the peoples hearts are not prepared to ſerve the Lord,</hi> 2 Kings 15. 35. <hi>But the high Places were not</hi>

Nay, to encourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to follow him, the Lord gave him victory over the enemies of <hi>Judah, and He grew mighty, becauſe He directed His wayes before the Lord His God,</hi> 2 Chron. 27: 6.</p>

6. But neither did he nor any Prince of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſince Righteous <hi>David,</hi> ſo perfectly <hi>direct,</hi> as <hi>Ahaz</hi> his ſon did <hi>pervert his wayes</hi> before the Lord. This is the firſt that adds ſtubbornneſs to infidelity, and drunkenneſs to thirſt, as the <note place="margin">Ahaz.</note> Spirit tels us, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 22. <hi>In his tribulation did he yet treſpaſs more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord; (this is King Ahaz,</hi> ſaith the Text) you muſt expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable monſter in his dealings; <hi>For he ſacrificed unto the gods of</hi> Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, <hi>which plagued him, and he ſaid: Becauſe the gods of the Kings of</hi> Aram <hi>helped them, I will ſacrifice unto them, and they will help me: yet they were his ruine, and of all Iſrael,</hi> ver. 23. This people was alwayes prone to wickedneſs, even during the reign of moſt religious Kings; but are now ſo violently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to all miſchief, having got this prepoſterous Monſter for their Governor, that as a ſhip ſailing with advantage of wind and tide, and help of oares, continues motion when ſail is ſtricken and Rowers ceaſe; ſo <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> after <hi>Ahaz</hi> their Commander in miſchief ceaſed from his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed labours, held on ſtill their miſchievous courſes, even in good King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s dayes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whereas Gods threatnings had been but particular heretofore; either to the King alone, or to his Line and Houſe, or of ſome momentary deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Land: Now God thunders out a General Deluge of Calamity to the City and Temple, by the Prophet <hi>Micah:</hi> Sion <hi>ſhall be plowed as a field, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be an heap, and the mountain of the houſe ſhall be as the high places of the forreſt.</hi> Here the ſcattered clouds of Gods judgments, which had long ſoared over <hi>Judah,</hi> are gathered as it were into one ſhower, ready to fall upon her (as it were an Hawk ſtooping to her prey:) but that good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the people by his example, laid faſt hold upon his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <note place="margin">Hezekiah.</note> and averted his fierce wrath from them, by hearty and unfeigned prayer: <hi>They feared the Lord, and prayed before him, and the Lord repented him of the evil, that he had pronounced againſt them.</hi> Whiles I behold the Compleat Reformation which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> wrought, and the peoples will to accord with him therein; Me thinks I hear the Lord wiſhing from heaven, as he did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to their fathers in the wilderneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an heart in them to fear me, and to keep all my Commandements alway, that it might go well with them, and with their children for ever. But</hi> Hezekiah <hi>did not render according to the reward beſtowed upon him: For his heart was lifted up, and wrath came upon him, and upon</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 25. Not that it did ſeize upon them, but that it was ready to ſmite. For as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, ver. 26. <hi>Notwithſtanding,</hi> Hezekiah <hi>humbled himſelf (after his heart was lift up) he and the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the dayes of</hi> Hezekiah, but of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> his ſon, who pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Manaſſes.</note> it down upon his own and his peoples heads. For as it is regiſtred, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 21. 3. <hi>He went back and built the high places, which</hi> Hezekiah <hi>his Father had deſtroyed, and erected Altars for</hi> Baal, <hi>and made a grove as did</hi> Ahab <hi>King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and worſhipped all the Hoaſt of Heaven, and ſerved them. And,</hi> as if he meant to thruſt the Lord out of his own Houſe, <hi>He built Altars in it, of the which the Lord ſaid; In</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>will I put my Name. And he built Altars for all the Hoaſt of Heaven, in the two Courts of the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> ver. 45. And beſides theſe and many other ſins, wherewith he cauſed <hi>Judah</hi> to ſin, and to do evil in the ſight of the Lord, after the abominations of the Heathen, which the Lord had caſt out before them, he <hi>filled</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>from corner to corner with innocent blood,</hi> whoſe cry did fill the Courts of Heaven. So both <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 16.</note> he and his people are plagued for their grievous ſins; He is the Firſt King of <hi>Judah</hi> that is led into Captivity; yet upon his returning to the Lord his God
<pb n="3762" facs="tcp:32220:240"/>
he is reſtored again. But his good example doth not move his peoples hearts unto like repentance, as his former bad example had cauſed them to ſin. Wherefore albeit the Lord repent him of the evil which had befallen his perſon; yet <hi>(Amon</hi> his ſon and ſucceſſor imitating his fathers ſins, but not his repentance, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 21.) doth he not turn away from his fierce wrath <note place="margin">Amon.</note> wherewith he was angry againſt <hi>Judah;</hi> albeit <hi>Joſiah</hi> his vertuous Nephew (or Grand-child) had <hi>turned to him with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, according to all the Law of</hi> Moſes. <hi>Manaſſch</hi>'s ſin therefore is ſaid to be the Cauſe why the Lord did caſt off <hi>Judah,</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe as the Addition of the laſt weight may be ſaid to caſt the ſcale, which was inclined that way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, albeit reſtrained from motion by a counterpoize, until the laſt weight over-powred the Reſtraint. God's wrath remained ſtil upon the Land from <hi>Salomon</hi>'s and <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s reign: And the weight of his judgments was dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed more and more; howſoever the final execution of them was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, at the inſtant prayers of religious Kings and righteous people: But now <hi>Manaſſch</hi> hath made up the full meaſure of all his fore-fathers ſins; the weight of God's Judgments hath ſo farre over-grown his Mercies, that there is no hope of recovery left, unleſs Prince, Prieſt and People would fill <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as full with their repentant tears, as <hi>Manaſſch</hi> had with blood; and devote the whole courſe of their life, to doing good, as their fore-fathers had ſold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to work wickedneſs; which good <hi>Joſiah</hi> for his part performs; and <note place="margin">Good Ioſiah.</note> ſo deads the ſtroke of God's judgments whilſt they are in motion. But his peoples hearts are not ſo ſtrongly ſet on their God. Although they joyn with him in renewing the Covenant betwixt God and them, the chief ſtrength of their zeal and fervencie is ſpent in the firſt Act of Repentance, or in the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Retire to God; Their Permanent Diſpoſition and Propenſion is not firm: Their very turning unto God, is rather forced then voluntary; ſo as they hold off God's judgments only for a time. As if a man by haling and pulling with might and main ſhould keep ſome heavie and mighty body from falling, or ſome great weight from ſwaying the full compaſſe; whereas the ſolid weight of it ſtill remains the ſame, and will have full ſway when his actual ſtrength fails him. Thus they quickly become weary of well-doing, and God's heavieſt judgments take their courſe. For however it be ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 33. That <hi>they did not turn back from the Lord God of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, all the dayes of</hi> Joſiah: Yet was this their cleaving to him, but compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: It conſiſted more in the outward ſolemnity or publick faſhion, then in inward ſincerity and integrity: They did not profeſs, or openly practiſe the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn worſhip of ſtrange gods; but had ſtill a longing after foreign faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as appears out of the Prophet <hi>Zephanie,</hi> who wrote of thoſe times; Chap 1. 8, 9. <hi>And it ſhall be in the day of the Lord's ſacrifice, that I will viſit the Princes and the Kings Children, and all ſuch as are clothed with ſtrange appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. In the ſame day alſo will I viſit all thoſe that dance upon the threſhold ſo proudly, which fill their Maſters houſes by cruelty and deceit.</hi> The corruption of both the Clergy and Magiſtracie had continued greivous from <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s <note place="margin">See this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor's Sermons on <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.</note> dayes, wherein it cried for vengeance. And this peoples repentance of theſe ſins in <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s dayes, was either none, or but feigned and hypocritical; as the ſame Prophet teſtifieth, Chap. 3. ver. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Wo to her that is filthy and polluted, to the robbing City. She heard not the voice; She received not corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; She truſted not in the Lord; She drew not near to her God. Her Princes within her are as roaring Lyons; Her Judges are as Wolves in the evening, which leave not the bones till the morrow. Her Prophets are light and wicked perſons; Her Prieſts have polluted the Sanctuary, they have wreſted the Law,</hi>

And even for this peoples proneneſſe to fulfil the meaſure of their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſins, was good <hi>Ioſiah</hi> removed from off the earth; leſt Gods judgments ſhould come upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his dayes. And no marvel, if the fulneſs of <hi>Judah's</hi> ſin be accompliſhed in <hi>Ioſiah</hi>'s dayes, though he were the moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Prince of <hi>David</hi>'s line.

For when his wiſe and graveſt Counſellors did humbly intreat him in the behalf of State and Country, to ſuffer at leaſt ſome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be brought up ſecretly as his own, leſt <hi>Millain</hi> might be delivered up to ſome Forrainer: He requeſted them to ſet their hearts at reſt; The unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py family had run their race; and it was impoſſible, but that the bloody practiſes of his Anceſtors ſhould blot out the very name in him: A Prince though otherwiſe in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifths eſteem, the wiſeſt of all the <hi>Italian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his time, yet herein indued with wiſdom in an higher rank, then the ſtatelieſt Potentates are wont to trouble themſelves withal, in that he could ſo well foreſee, <hi>There was no counſel againſt the Lord;</hi> whoſe Decrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any Land or People, then uſually take place, when as Poſterity ſeeks earneſtly by ſecular Policie, to patch up the rents and breaches of a State de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed &amp; ruinate by the heavie burthen of their Predeceſſors ſins. Such was the temper of <hi>Ioſiah's</hi> States-men &amp; Princes, though his heart was of another me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and had been faſhioned in another mold. Wherefore the Book of the Law, which had long laid buried, is now riſen out of the duſt, to proclaim <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> downfal, and <hi>Sions</hi> burial in her aſhes. And this ſentence of the Law now found, is ratified by the Propheteſs <hi>Huldahs</hi> mouth: <hi>Gods wrath ſhall</hi> preſently <hi>be kindled againſt this place, and ſhall not be quenched.</hi> But unto good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who ſought the Propheteſſes, and not the Politicians advice, is this ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort left. <hi>To the King of</hi> Judah, <hi>who ſent you to inquire of the Lord, ſo ſhall ye ſay unto him: Becauſe thine heart did melt, and thou haſt humbled thy ſelf before the Lord, when thou heardeſt what I ſpake againſt this place, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Inhabitants of the ſame,</hi> to wit, <hi>that it ſhould be deſtroyed and accurſed; and haſt rent thy clothes and wept before me,</hi> I <hi>have alſo heard it, ſaith the Lord.

Yes, this his burial was in peace, in that he was buried in the Sepulchres of his Fathers, and mourned for by all his people, without the moleſtation of their enemies. This was a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of peace, which none of his Sons or Succeſſors enjoyed. For of them all, not one but dies captive in the enemies Land, or in their own, without the decencie of Princely funerals. And who knows, Whether <hi>Ioſiah's</hi> violent death was deſerved by going to battel without the Lords advice?

the increaſe of that diſeaſe, wherewith no Prince of all the ſtock of <hi>Iudah,</hi> but had been more or leſs infected, and which now, as it ſeemeth, was grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him. All of them in their proſperity, began to trade in ſecular Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, whoſe practiſe was <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ruine, and <hi>Iudahs</hi> wreck; howſoever right dear in the ſight of the Lord was the death of this holy and religious King, who if he had lived the longer, ſhould have died the oftner. His Childrens and peoples ſins are now full ripe for the ſword; and their vengeance haſtens on ſo faſt, that either he muſt ſuddenly die, or elſe ſee their manifold miſeries, farre worſe then ſo many ſeveral deaths. For what pangs would it have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his tender heart, which melted even whileſt the noiſe of <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> curſe did but approach his ears, if his eyes ſhould have beheld the flames of Gods fierce wrath devouring her gates, and his ears had been filled with her woful out-cries in the dayes of mourning? For <hi>Ieremie</hi> or <hi>Baruch,</hi> two Prophets ſo poor that their fore-warnings of theſe miſeries could not merit any credit with this politick generation, to live and ſee the event, was a bleſſing of God; and bare life given them a bountiful prey; But what benefit could ſo great a Prince have reaped by life; What comfort in length of dayes, to have ſeen the children of his loins, born unto higher hopes then any Princes of the world beſides, either led captive into the enemies land, or made a prey unto the birds of heaven in their own? Much better an enemies arrow ſtick once for all faſt in his ſide, then that the ſword ſhould continually pierce thorow his ſoul, whilſt he ſhould ſee his deareſt people cut down like graſs; and <hi>Iudah</hi> the Lords incloſure laid open like a common field, to their bordering enemies ſpoil; and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> his hearts joy, which the Lord had hedged and walled about, laid waſte like a forlorn vineyard, whoſe grapes were wild and naught. Yet ſuch are the dayes which immediately enſue his death: The Land is one while ranſackt by the <hi>Egyptian;</hi> another while made tributary to the <hi>Chaldean;</hi> another while forraged by the <hi>Aramite, Ammonite</hi> and <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,</hi> until it was utterly laid waſte. For judgment is here begun already at the houſe of God; and in godly <hi>Ioſiah's</hi> fall might the ungodly <hi>Iudah</hi> read her Fatal Deſtiny regiſtred in Characters of blood. And doubtleſſe at this his <note place="margin">☞</note> ſudden unexpected end, the execution of Gods fierce and violent wrath did begin; Of the ſucceſſive degrees whereof, I ſhall, God willing, hereafter ſpeak. For the <hi>Manner</hi> of it, I only note thus much now in general; That not all the wiſdom of their moſt Politick Enemies, albeit the Lord had given them libertie to have plotted this peoples overthrow at their pleaſure, could have invented ſo readie and ſure a courſe for their ſwift deſtruction, as this people themſelves <hi>(in great Policie to their ſeeming)</hi> ſtill make choice of. Not one project which they can forecaſt, but proves an inevitable<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gin to intrap themſelves, and is as a fatal ſnare unto their owne feet.</p>

The Heroical attempts of whoſe Princely reſolution and zeal in reſtoring the true worſhip of God unto this people, needs not mine, it hath the commendations of Gods Spirit, who hath been curious in calculating his particular good deeds throughout this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to have been matchleſs in <hi>Davids</hi> Race; and how then poſſible to be parallell'd in any other Princes Line? And what? If through the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious care and induſtrie of ſome one or two Princes, whom the Lord in mercie had raiſed up as Lights unto this Land, the foggie miſts of Superſtition, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and Idolatry be driven hence?

Or what avails it to have purged our hearts from all conceit of merit, if we pollute our hands with bribes? Or what availes it to give God the glory in all good actions, and yet daily diſhonor his name with bad dealings? I will ſpeak more plainly, What advantageth it us, to object unto the Papiſts, that they ſeek to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit heaven by their works, and ſhare with God in the honour of good deeds, if they can truly reply upon us, That the free Almes of Papiſts Founders, have been by Proteſtants ſet on ſale unto their brethren?

               <p>As from my heart I reverence their religious labors, who have of late ſo effectually ſtirred up our Sovereignes heart to this purpoſe, and earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt your heartie prayers unto Almighty God, that his Holy Spirit may continually enflame his royal heart with thoſe good motions which have been kindled in it of late: ſo do I deſire from the very centre of my ſoul, both, that men of place, Authoritie, Gravitie, Learning and Integritie of life, may proſecute it; and that young Divines (whether <hi>young in years</hi> or <hi>manners,</hi> it skills not) would oftentimes, even for <hi>Sions</hi> ſake, hold their peace, or at leaſt be wary <hi>where</hi> and <hi>when</hi> they open their mouths in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.

               <p>The Former of the two Parts: <hi>[The Poſsibilitie of their Proſperitie and Repentance]</hi> was proved from the perpetual <hi>Tenor</hi> of Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> with this people, firſt made with <hi>Moſes,</hi> afterward renewed with <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and ratified by <hi>Jeremie</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> The <hi>Tenor</hi> of the Covenant, as you then heard, was a Covenant not of <hi>Death</hi> only, but of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> of Life, if they continued faithful in his Covenant: of Death, if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in diſobedience.</p>
               <p>The later Part of the ſame Aſſertion, <hi>viz. [That this Peoples Repentance and Proſperitie was the end intended by God]</hi> was proved from that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his deſire of their everlaſting Proſperitie, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. <hi>Oh that there were ſuch a heart in this people, to fear me, and keep my Commandments alwaies, that it might go well with them, and their poſteritie for ever.</hi> And the like place <hi>Pſalm</hi> 81. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48. 18.</p>
               <p>Theſe places manifeſt Gods love, and deſire of this peoples ſafety; But the <hi>Abundance,</hi> the <hi>Strength,</hi> with the unrelenting <hi>Conſtancie</hi> and tenderneſs of his love, is in no place more fully manifeſted then in theſe words of my Text. The <hi>abundant fervencie</hi> we may note in the very firſt words, in that his mouth which never ſpake idle nor ſuperfluous word, doth here ingeminate the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem.</hi> This he ſpake out of the <hi>abundance of his love.</hi> But Love is oft-times fervent or abundant for the preſent, or whiles the Object of our love remains amiable, yet not ſo conſtant and perpetual, if the qualitie of what we loved be changed. But herein appears the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>conſtancie</hi> of Gods love, that it was thus fervently ſet upon <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> not only in her pure and virgin dayes, or whiles ſhe continued as chaſte and loyal, as when ſhe was affianced unto the Lord by <hi>David,</hi> but upon <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> often drunk with the cup of Fornications; upon <hi>Her,</hi> long ſtained and polluted with the blood of his deareſt Saints, which ſhe had even mingled with her Sacrifices: Upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and her children, when (after he had cleanſed her infected habitations with fire, and carried her inhabitants beyond <hi>Babylon</hi> into the North-land, as into a more freſh and pure aire: Yet after their return thence, and replantation in their own Land) returned with the dog
<pb n="3769" facs="tcp:32220:243"/>
to his vomit, and with the waſhed Sow, to wallowing in the mire; <hi>God would have gathered even as the Hen doth her chickens under her wings, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In which words, beſides <hi>the tenderneſſe of Gods Love</hi> toward theſe Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes, is ſet out unto us the ſafety of his <hi>Protection,</hi> ſo they would have been gathered. For as there is no creature more kind and tender then the Hen unto her young ones, none that doth more carefully ſhroud and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them from the ſtorm, none that doth more cloſely hide them from the eye of the <hi>Deſtroyer;</hi> ſo would God have hidden <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his wings, from all thoſe ſtormes which afterward overwhelmed her, and from the <hi>Roman Eagle,</hi> to whom this whole generation preſent became a prey. If ſo <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with her children, after ſo many hundred years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his fatherly love and tender care had not remained more fooliſh than the new hatched brood of reaſonleſs creatures: If ſo they had not been ignorant of his Call, that had often redeemed them from their enemies. <hi>How often would I have gathered you, and you would not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here were large matter for Rhetorical Digreſſions, or mellifluous Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mions of <hi>Divine Love:</hi> Points wherein many Learned Divines have in later times been very copious, yet ſtill leaving the truth of that Love which they ſo magnifie, very queſtionable. It ſhall ſuffice me at this time,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To prove the undoubted truth, and unfeignedneſſe of Gods tender <note place="margin">Two Points propounded.</note> Love even towards ſuch Caſt-awayes as theſe proved, to whom he made this proteſtation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To unfold (as far as is fitting for us to inquire) how it is poſſible that they ſhould not be gathered unto God, nor ſaved by Chriſt, whoſe gathering and whoſe ſafety, he, to whom nothing can be impoſſible, had ſo earneſtly, ſo tenderly, and conſtantly longed after.</p>
               <p>Theſe are Points of ſuch Uſe and Conſequence, that if God ſhall enable me ſoundly, though plainly, to unfold their truth; you will, I hope, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with me for want of artificial Exornations, or words more choice then ſuch as naturally ſpring out of the matters handled, as willingly as the poor amongſt you pardon good houſe-keepers for wearing nothing but home-ſpun cloth For as it is hard for a man of ordinary means to beſtow much on his own back, and feed many bellies; ſo neither is it eaſie for me and my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent opportunities, both to feed your ſouls with the <hi>Truth,</hi> and to cloath my Diſcourſe with choice words, and flouriſhing phraſes. And I am perſwaded many Preachers might in this <hi>Argument</hi> often prove more <hi>Theological,</hi> ſo they could be content to be leſſe <hi>Rhetorical.</hi> My purpoſe is not to diſſent from any of the Reformed Churches, but only in thoſe particulars wherein they evidently diſſent from themſelves, and from <hi>General Principles</hi> of Truth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all that believe God or his Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Were I to ſpeak in ſome Audience, of <hi>this Point,</hi> it would be needful to dip my pen in <hi>Nectar,</hi> or ſweeten my voice with <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> to allay the harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Poſition, <hi>That God ſhould ſo earneſtly deſire the converſion of ſuch</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>God earneſtly deſires the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſuch as periſh:</hi> The former Point.</note> 
                  <hi>as periſh.</hi> Howbeit the ſureſt Grounds of that Charitie which God requires ſhould be in every one of us <hi>towards all</hi> (our greateſt enemies not excepted) is <hi>Firm Belief</hi> of this <hi>his unſpeakable Love towards all,</hi> even towards ſuch as kill his Prophets, and ſtone the Meſſengers of their peace. <hi>I exhort</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1.) <hi>that firſt of all ſupplications, prayers, interceſsions and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for Kings and for all that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi> Yet did moſt ſuch in thoſe dayes, <hi>oppreſs Chriſtians, and draw them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Judgement Seats,</hi> James 2. 6. even becauſe <hi>they did pray unto the true God</hi>
                  <pb n="3770" facs="tcp:32220:244"/>
                  <hi>for them, who did blaſpheme that worthy Name,</hi> &amp;c. This Dutie, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (which was ſo odious unto thoſe great and rich men, for whoſe good it was performed) S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>was good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 3. Why acceptable in his ſight? Becauſe (v. 4.) <hi>he would have all men</hi> (and therefore the ſworn enemies of the Goſpel) <hi>to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to come to the knowledg of the truth,</hi> which they now oppugned. Or, if the expreſſe Authoritie of the Apoſtle ſuffice not, his Reaſons drawn from the Principles of Nature, will perſwade ſuch as have not quenched the Light of Nature, by ſetting not the corruptions only, but the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> at odds with <hi>Grace; For</hi> (v. 5.) <hi>there is one God;</hi> had there beene moe, every one might have been conceived as partial for his own Creatures. But in as much as all of us have but <hi>one Father,</hi> his love to every one muſt needs be greater then any earthly Parents love unto their children, in as much as we are more truly <hi>His,</hi> then Children are their Parents. But here (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle foreſeeth) might be Replyed, That albeit <hi>God be One</hi> and the onely Creator of all: yet in as much as all of us are the Seed of Rebels with whom he is diſpleaſed, our <hi>Mediator</hi> might be more partial, and commend ſome to Gods love, neglecting others: To prevent this Scruple, the Apoſtle adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. that as there is but <hi>One God,</hi> ſo there is but <hi>One Mediator between God and Man,</hi> and he of the ſame Nature with us, <hi>A Man.</hi> But men are partial: yet ſo is not the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> that is, <hi>The Man annointed by the Holy Ghoſt to be the Saviour of the world.</hi> As he truly took our fleſh upon him that he might be a faithful and affectionate High Prieſt; ſo, that we might conceive of him as of an <hi>unpartial Solicitor</hi> or Mediator betwixt God and us, he took not our Nature enſtampt with any <hi>Individual Properties,</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters or References to any one Tribe or Kindred. Father according to the fleſh he had none, but was framed by the ſole immediate hand of God, to the end that as the eye, becauſe it hath no ſet colour, is apt to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of every colour: So Chriſt, becauſe he had not thoſe carnal Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which others have, but was without father, without brother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſiſter on earth, might be unpartial towards all, and account <hi>every one that doth the will of his Father which is in heaven, as ſiſter, mother, and brother. Thus ſaith the Lord unto the Eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths, and chuſe the things that pleaſe me, and take hold of my Covenant: Even unto them will I give</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>in mine houſe, and within my walls, a place and a Name better then of ſons and of daughters. I will give them an everlaſting Name that ſhall not be cut off.</hi> Briefly, he is <hi>A Brother</hi> to all mankind, more loving and more affectionate then brothers of intire blood are one towards another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The very <hi>Ground</hi> of the Apoſtles <hi>Reaſon</hi> thus <hi>barred,</hi> will of its owne accord reverberate <hi>that diſtinction</hi> which hath been laid againſt his meaning by ſome otherwiſe moſt worthy defendants of the truth. The <hi>Diſtinction</hi> is, that when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved,</hi> he means, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera ſingulorum,</hi> not <hi>ſingula generum; Some few of all ſorts, not all of every ſort.

                  <hi>Gentiles, ſome Italians, ſome Engliſh, &amp;c.</hi> The Illuſtrations which they bring to juſtifie this manner of ſpeech, did the time permit, I could retort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, and make them ſpeak more plainly for my Opinion then for theirs. It ſhall be ſufficient by the way to note the <hi>Impertinencie of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> ſuppoſing the Inſtances brought by them were juſtifiable by the Illuſtrations which they bring; Or, to ſhew how little it could weaken <hi>Our Aſſertion,</hi> although it might intercept all the ſtrength or aid <hi>this Place</hi> affords for the Fortification of it. For what can it help them to turn theſe words (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="3771" facs="tcp:32220:244"/>
they make towards us) from their ordinary and uſual meaning; or to reſtrain Gods Love only unto ſuch as are ſaved; when as <hi>the Current</hi> of it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages of Scripture is evidently extended unto ſuch as periſh? In ſtead of many words unto this purpoſe uttered by him that canot lye, thoſe few, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. ſhall content me. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord God I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live, turn ye, turn ye from your evil wayes. For why will ye dye, O ye houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If God <hi>will</hi> the ſafetie of ſuch as periſh, yea even of moſt deſperate ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born ſinners: no queſtion but he wills <hi>all</hi> ſhould be ſaved and come unto the knowledg of his truth. The <hi>Former diſtinction</hi> then will not ſtop this paſſage. Howbeit ſome Learned amongſt the School-men, and other moſt religious Writers of later times, have ſought out <hi>another</hi> for intercepting all ſuccour, this or the like places might afford to the maintenance of that truth, which they oppugn and we defend. That God doth not will the death of a ſinner <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate ſigni,</hi> they grant; but that he wills it <hi>Voluntate beneplaciti,</hi> they take as granted; That is in other termes, <hi>God doth not will the death of him that dies by his</hi> Revealed Will, <hi>but by his</hi> Secret Will. Not to urge them to a better declaration then hitherto they have made, in what ſenſe God <hi>(being but One)</hi> may be ſaid to have <hi>two Wills.</hi> That he <hi>wills</hi> many things which we know not; that he hath divers <hi>Secret Purpoſes,</hi> we grant, and believe as moſt true, indefinitely taken: But becauſe <hi>theſe Wills or Purpoſes are Secret;</hi> man may not, man cannot without preſumption, determine the particular matters which he ſo willeth or purpoſeth, otherwiſe they ſhould not be <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> but <hi>revealed</hi> to us, whereas <hi>things ſecret, as ſecret,</hi> belong only unto God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. In that they oppoſe <hi>Gods Secret Will</hi> to Gods Revealed Will, they do (as it were) put in a <hi>Caveat,</hi> That we ſhould not believe it in thoſe particulars whereto they apply it. For we may not believe any thing concerning the ſalvation or damnation of mankind, or the meanes which lead to either, ſave what is <hi>revealed;</hi> But this <hi>Secret Will</hi> is not Revealed; therefore not to be believed. Nor are we by the Principles of <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> bound only <hi>not to believe it,</hi> but utterly to <hi>diſclaim it.</hi> For admitting (what was before granted) <hi>an Indefinite Belief,</hi> that God wills many things which he keeps ſecret from us; yet we muſt abſolutely believe, <hi>That he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wills any thing ſecretly, which ſhall be Contrary or Contradictory to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Will Revealed is ſet, or to that which by the expreſſe warrant of his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word we know he wills.</hi> Now every Chriſtian muſt infallibly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately believe, <hi>That God wils not the death of the wicked, or of him that dies;</hi> ſeeing his written Word doth plainly regiſter his peremptorie deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this Negative; therefore no man may believe the <hi>Contradictory</hi> to this, to wit, <hi>That he wills the death of him that dies:</hi> otherwiſe <hi>this Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction admitted, untwines the very bonds of mans ſalvation.</hi> For what ground of hope have the very <hi>Elect,</hi> beſides <hi>Gods Will Revealed,</hi> or (at the beſt) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by oath? Now if we might admit it but as probable, That God, <hi>Voluntate Beneplaciti,</hi> or, <hi>by his Secret Will,</hi> may purpoſe ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what he promiſes by his <hi>Revealed Will,</hi> who is he that could have, I ſay not, any <hi>Certainty,</hi> but any <hi>moral Probabilitie</hi> of his Salvation? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God aſſures us of Salvation only by his <hi>Word Revealed,</hi> not by his <hi>ſecret will or purpoſe,</hi> which, for ought we do, or poſſibly can, know, may utterly diſanul what his <hi>Revealed Will</hi> ſeems to ratifie. Laſtly, It is an <hi>infallible Rule or Maxime in Divinitie,</hi> That <hi>we may not attribute any thing to the moſt pure and perfect Eſſence of the Deitie, which includes any imperfection in it;</hi>
                  <pb n="3772" facs="tcp:32220:245"/>
much leſſe may we aſcribe any <hi>impuritie</hi> or <hi>untruth,</hi> unto that <hi>Holy One, the Author of all truth.</hi> But to ſwear one thing, and to reſerve a <hi>ſecret meaning,</hi> contrary to the plain and literal meaning profeſſed, is the very <hi>Idaea of untruth,</hi> the Eſſence of impious <hi>Perjury,</hi> which we ſo much condemn in ſome of our Adverſaries, who, if this Diſtinction might <hi>generally paſſe for current a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us,</hi> might retort; that we are as maliciouſly partial againſt the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were againſt <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> that we are readie to blaſpheme God rather then ſpare to revile them: ſeeing we attribute that unto his <hi>Divine Majeſtie,</hi> which we condemn in them as moſt impious and contrarie to his Sacred Will, who will not diſpenſe with <hi>Equivocation</hi> or <hi>mental Reſervation,</hi> be the cauſe wherein they are uſed, never ſo good; becauſe <hi>to ſwear one thing openly,</hi> and <hi>ſecretly to reſerve a contradictorie meaning,</hi> is contrary to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Truth;</hi> the moſt tranſcendent ſin that can be imagined. Wherefore, as this <hi>Diſtinction</hi> was lately hatched, ſo it were to be wiſhed that it might quickly be extinguiſhed, and lye buried with their bones that have revived it. <hi>Let God be true in all his words,</hi> in all his ſayings, but <hi>eſpecially in all his oaths,</hi> and let the Jeſuite be reputed as he is, a double diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling perjured Liar.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The former Place of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as it is no way impeached by this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction laſt mentioned; ſo <hi>doth</hi> it plainely <hi>refute</hi> another <hi>Gloſſe</hi> put upon my Text by ſome worthy and Famous Writers. <hi>How oft would I have gathered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">An odd Gloſſe refuted.</note>

                  <q>Theſe words (ſay they) were uttered by our Saviour manifeſting his deſire <hi>As Man.</hi>
                  </q> But unleſſe they be more then men which frame <hi>this Gloſs,</hi> Chriſt as man was greater then they, and ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he had in <hi>expreſſe Commiſsion</hi> from his Father. We may then I truſt without offence take his words as here they ſound, for a better interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Fathers Will, then any man can give of his meaning in this paſſage uttered by himſelf in words as plain as they can deviſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe words indeed were ſpoken by the mouth of him that was man, yet by a mouth as truly manifeſting the deſire and good will of God for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his people, as if they had been immediately uttered by the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head without the Organ or Inſtrument of humane voice. But why ſhould we think they were conceived by Chriſt, <hi>as he was man,</hi> not rather by him as the <hi>Mediator between God and man,</hi> as the Second Perſon in the Trinity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in our Fleſh? He ſaith not, <hi>Behold my Father hath ſent,</hi> but, in his own Perſon, <hi>I have ſent unto you Prophets and Wiſe men,</hi> &amp;c. Nor is it ſaid <hi>How often would my Father?</hi> but, <hi>How often would I have gathered you?</hi> This <hi>Gathering</hi> we cannot referre only to the <hi>three yeers of his Miniſterie,</hi> but to the whole time of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> her running aſtray from the Prophets <hi>Calls:</hi> from the firſt time that <hi>David</hi> firſt took poſſeſſion of it, till the laſt deſtruction of it. For all this time, He that was now <hi>ſent</hi> by his Father in the ſimilitude of man did ſend <hi>Prophets, Wiſe men</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to reclaim them, if they would have hearkned to him, or his Meſſengers Admonitions. S. <hi>Luke</hi> puts this out of Controverſie, for, repeating part of this ſtory, he ſaith expreſly, <hi>Therefore</hi>

<pb n="3773" facs="tcp:32220:245"/>
blood. How any ſuch flagrant deſire of their welfare which finally periſh, ſhould be in God, we cannot conceive, becauſe our minds are more dazeled with that inacceſſible Light which he inhabits, then the eyes of Batts and Owles are by gazing on the Sun. To qualifie <hi>this Incomprehenſible Glorie of the Deitie,</hi> the Wiſdom of God was made Fleſh, that we might ſafely behold the true module or proportion of Divine Goodneſs in our Nature: as the eye which cannot look upon the Sun in his ſtrength, or as it ſhines in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may without offence behold it in the water, being an <hi>Element homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal</hi> to its own ſubſtance. Thus ſhould <hi>all Chriſts Prayers, deſires,</hi> or pathetical <hi>wiſhes</hi> of mans ſafetie be to us as ſo many viſible pledges, or <hi>ſenſible Evidences</hi> of Gods Inviſible and Incomprehenſible Love; and ſo he concludes his <hi>laſt Invitation</hi> of the Jewes. <hi>I have not ſpoken of my ſelfe, but the Father which ſent me, he gave me Commandment what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak; And I know that his Commandment is everlaſting life; whatſoever I ſpake therefore even as the Father ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpake.</hi> Joh. 12. ver. 49, 50.</p>
               <p>And what ſaith our Saviour more in his own, then the Prophet had done in the Name and Perſon of his God? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Sion complained, the Lord hath for ſaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.</hi> But he anſwered. <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſsion on the ſon of her womb? yea! they may forget; yet will I not forget thee. Behold I have graven thee upon the palmes of my hands. &amp;c.</hi> Theſe and the like Places of the Prophets, compared with our Saviours ſpeech here in my Text, give us plainly to underſtand, That <hi>whatſoever Love any mother can bear to the fruit of her womb,</hi> (unto whom her bowels of compaſſion are more tender then the fathers can be) <hi>or whatſoever affection any dumb Creature can afford unto their tender brood,</hi> the like, <hi>but greater doth God bear unto his children.</hi> Unto the <hi>Elect</hi> moſt will grant: But is his Love ſo tender towards <hi>ſuch as periſh?</hi> Yes; the Lord carried the whole Hoſte of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (even the ſtubborne and moſt diſobedient) <hi>as the Eagle doth her young ones upon her wings,</hi> Exod. 19. 4.</p>
               <p>Earthly Parents will not vouchſafe to wait perpetually upon their children. The Hen continueth not her Call from morning to night, nor can ſhe endure to hold out her wings all day for a ſhelter to her young ones: as they grow great and refuſe to come, ſhe gives over to invite them. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith the Lord by his Prophet,) I <hi>have ſpred out my hand all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts. A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that ſacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incenſe upon Altars of bricks, which remain among the graves, and lodg in the monuments; which eat Swines fleſh, and broth of abominable things is in their veſſels; which ſay</hi> (adding hypocriſie unto filthineſſe and Idolatry) <hi>ſtand by thy ſelf, come not neer unto me, for</hi> I <hi>am holier then thou.</hi> Iſai. 65. ver. 2, 3, 4.

eaſily have been put off by theſe incredulous Jewes, unto whom he had not referred the judgment in their own Cauſe; if they could have inſtanced in man or other Creature, more willing to do what poſſibly they could do, either for themſelves or others, then he was to do <hi>whatſoever was poſsible to be done</hi> for them: <hi>And now O Inhabitants of Jeruſalem and men of Judah, judg I pray you betwixt me and my Vineyard; what could more have been done to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi> Iſa. 5. v. 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the greater we make the Truth and Extent of Gods Love, the more <note place="margin">The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Point, <hi>How is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould not be gathered, if God ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly will &amp;c.</hi> as fol. 3 769.</note> we increaſe the difficultie of the <hi>Second Point</hi> propoſed. For amongſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men many there be that would; amongſt dumb Creatures, ſcarce any that would not, redeeme their ſucklings from death by dying themſelves. Yet what is it that they can do, which they would not do to ſave their owne lives? And did not God ſo <hi>love the world that he gave his only begotten Son for it?</hi> Yes, for the world of the Elect; I ſee not why any ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the number. But to let that paſſe; Gods deſire of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which periſh, is undoubtedly ſuch as hath been ſaid: Yet ſhould we ſay that he hath done all that could be done for them, <hi>How chanceth it that all are not ſaved?</hi> Was the Vineyard more barren then <hi>Sarah?</hi> the fruit of whoſe womb he made like the Stars of the sky, or as the ſands by the Sea ſhore innumerable. Was it a matter more hard to make the impenitent <hi>Jew</hi> bring forth fruits worthy of Repentance, then to make a Virgin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and beare a ſon? If it were not, how chanceth it, the Word of the Lord (and that but a ſhort one) ſhould bring the One to joyful Iſſue, whilſt the other (the repentance of the Jewes, and other ungodly men) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many exhortations and threatnings, after ſo many promiſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and ſo many denunciations of woes, as the Prophets, the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors have uſed, is not to this day, nor ever will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed?</p>
               <p>If repentance of men born and brought up in ſin be a work <hi>altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible,</hi> all of us ſhould utterly periſh, none repent; if poſſible to any, ſhall it not be poſſible to the Almighty, who alone can do all things? if poſsible to him, why is not repentance wrought in all, whoſe ſalvation he more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires then the moſt tender hearted mother doth the life and welfare of her darling infant? Hence with <hi>Seeming Probabilitie,</hi> ſome may Conclude, either that Gods Love unto ſuch as periſh is not ſo great as ſome mothers bear unto their children, or elſe his <hi>Power</hi> in reſpect of them is not infinite. And againſt our Doctrine, perhaps, it will be Objected, That by thus magnifying Gods <hi>Love</hi> towards <hi>All,</hi> we miniſh his <hi>Power</hi> towards <hi>Some:</hi> From which to derogate ought, is, in ſome mens judgements, the worſt kind of Blaſphemie; a Point as dangerous in Divinitie, to ſpeak but doubtfully or ſuſpiciouſly of it, as in matter of State to determine or limit the <hi>Prerogative Royal.</hi> Howbeit, if no other choice were left, but a neceſsitie were laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us of leaving either the infinite Power or infinite Goodneſſe of our God queſtionable or unexpreſſed; the offence were leſſe, to ſpeak not ſo much of his Power as moſt do, than to ſpeak ought prejudicial to that conceipt which even the Heathens by light of Nature had of his Goodneſs. <hi>This Attribute is the Chief Object of our Love,</hi> and for which he himſelf deſires to be loved moſt; and in this reſpect to derogate ought from it, muſt needs be moſt offenſive. But his curſe be upon him that will not unfeignedly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the abſolute infiniteneſſe as well of his Power as of his Goodneſſe. Whoſoever he be that loves his Goodneſſe, will unfeignedly acknowledge,
<pb n="3775" facs="tcp:32220:246"/>
that he is to be feared and reverenced as the Almightie Creator, Preſerver, and Judge of men; and unleſs he were in Power infinite, he could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Good. Howbeit he that reſtrains his Love and tender Mercie, only unto ſuch as are ſaved, doth make his Goodneſs leſs (at leaſt extenſively) then his Power. For there is no Creature unto which his Power reacheth not, but ſo doth not his loving kindneſs extend to all, unleſs he deſire the good and ſafetie of ſuch as periſh.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For winding our ſelves out of the <hi>Former Snare,</hi> we are to conſider a <hi>main difference</hi> between the Love of man or other Creatures, and the Love of God to mankind. Dumb creatures alwayes affect what they moſt deſire, if it be within the precincts of their power, becauſe they have neither Reaſon nor other Internal Law of right or wrong to controll or counter-ſway their brutiſh appetites. Man although indued with <hi>Reaſon</hi> and natural <hi>Notions</hi> of right and wrong, is notwithſtanding oft-times drawn by the ſtrength or inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of his tender affection, to uſe ſuch <hi>Means</hi> as are contrarie to the <hi>Rules of Reaſon, Equitie</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> for procuring their ſafetie or impunitie on whom he dotes. Howbeit, among men we may find ſome, which cannot be wrought by any promiſe or perſwaſion, to uſe thoſe unlawful courſes for the impunity of their children or deareſt Friends which the world common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt approveth. Not that their Love towards their children, friends or acquaintance is <hi>leſſe,</hi> but becauſe their Love to publick <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Equitie,</hi> and reſpect to their owne Integritie, is <hi>Greater</hi> then other mens are.</p>
               <p>A fit Inſtance we have in <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> King of <hi>Locris,</hi> who having made a ſevere Law, <hi>That whoſoever committed ſuch an offence</hi> (ſuppoſe Adultery) <hi>ſhould loſe his eyes:</hi> It ſhortly after came to paſs, that the Prince, his Son and Heir apparent to the Crown, treſpaſſed againſt this <hi>Sanction.</hi> Could not the good King have granted <hi>A Pardon</hi> to his Son? He had <hi>Power,</hi> no doubt, in his hands to have diſpenſed with this particular, without any danger to his Perſon; and moſt Princes would have done as much as they could, for the ſafetie of their Succeſſor; nor could <hi>Priviledges</hi> or <hi>Indulgences</hi> upon ſuch ſpecial circumſtances, be held as breaches or violations of Publick Lawes, becauſe the Prerogative of the perſon offending cannot be drawn into Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But <hi>Zaleucus</hi> could not be brought to diſpenſe with his Law, becauſe he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Juſtice no leſſe dearly then his Son, whom he loved as dearly as himſelf; and to manifeſt <hi>the Equalitie of his love to all three,</hi> he cauſed one of his own eyes, and another of his Sons to be put out, that ſo the Law might have its due, though not wholly from his ſon that had offended, but in part from himſelf as it were by way of puniſhment for his partialitie towards his ſon. It were <hi>Poſsible,</hi> no doubt, for a King to reclaim many Inferiors from theft, from robberie or other ungratious Courſes, ſo he would vouchſafe to abate his own expences to maintain theirs, or afford them the ſolaces of the Court, make them his Peers, or otherwiſe allow them means for compaſsing their wonted pleaſures. But thus far to condeſcend to unthriftie ſubjects, were ill beſeeming that <hi>Gravitie and Majeſtie</hi> which ſhould be in Princes. If one ſhould give notice to a Prince, how eaſie and poſsible it were for him by theſe means to ſave a number from the Gallowes: his reply would be, <hi>Princeps id poteſt quod ſalva majeſtata poteſt; That only is poſsible to a Prince which can ſtand with the ſafetie of his Majeſtie.</hi> But thus to feed the unſatiable appetites of greedie unthrifts, though ſuch as he otherwiſe loves moſt dearly, and whoſe welfare he wiſhes as heartily as they do that thus ſpeak for them, is neither Princely nor Majeſtical. For a King in this Caſe to do as much as by ſome
<pb n="3776" facs="tcp:32220:247"/>
means poſsible he is able to do, were an act of weakneſſe and impotencie, not an act of Soveraigne power, a great blot to his Wiſdom, Honor or Dignitie, no true Argument of Royal Love or Princely Clemencie.</p>
               <p>In like Caſe we are to conſider, That God albeit <hi>in Power infinite,</hi> yet his <hi>infinite Power</hi> is matched with <hi>Goodneſſe as truly infinite;</hi> his <hi>infinite Love,</hi> is as it were counterpoiſed with <hi>infinite Majeſtie:</hi> And though his <hi>infinite mercie</hi> be as Soveraign to his other <hi>Attributes,</hi> yet is it in a ſort reſtrained by the <hi>Tribunicial Power of his Juſtice.</hi> This <hi>Equalitie of infiniteneſſe</hi> betwixt his <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes</hi> being conſidered; the former <hi>Difficultie</hi> is eaſily reſolved. If it be demanded, whether God could not make a thouſand worlds as good or better then this, it were infidelitie to deny it. Why? Becauſe this is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>meer Power,</hi> and might be done without any Contradiction to his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> to his <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> to his <hi>Mercie,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> all which it might ſerve to ſet forth. And this is a Rule of Faith; <hi>[That all Effects of mere Power though greater then we can conceive as poſſible, may be done of him with greater eaſe then we can breath.]</hi> His only Word would ſuffice to make ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds. But if it be queſtioned, <hi>Whether God could not have done more then he hath done for his Vineyard? whether he cannot ſave ſuch as daily periſh?</hi> The Caſe is altered, and breeds a Fallacie, <hi>Ad plures Interrogationes.</hi> For mans Salvation is not a work of <hi>meer Power,</hi> it neceſſarily requires, <hi>An Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Goodneſs, of Majeſtie, of Mercie and Juſtice,</hi> whereunto the <hi>infinite Power</hi> is in a manner ſubſervient. Nor are we to conſider his Infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alone, but as matched with Infinite Majeſtie; nor his Infinite Mercie and Goodneſſe alone, but as matched with infinite Juſtice; and in this caſe it is as true of God as man. <hi>Deus illud poteſt quod ſalva majeſtate poteſt; quod ſalva bonitate &amp; juſtitia poteſt: God can do that which is not prejudicial to his Majeſtie, to his Goodneſs and Juſtice;</hi> And he had done (if we may believe his Oath) as much for his Vineyard as the Concurrence of his Infinite Power and Wiſdome could effect without diſparagement to the Infinitie of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, or that Internal Law, or Rule of Infinite Goodneſs whereby he created man after his own Image and Similitude.</p>
               <p n="8">8. God, as he hath his <hi>Being,</hi> ſo hath he his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of himſelf: And his <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> is his <hi>Being:</hi> As impoſſible therefore that he ſhould not be <hi>Good,</hi> as not <hi>Be.</hi> Man as he had his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> ſo had he his <hi>goodneſs</hi> wholly from his <hi>Creator.</hi> And as Actual <hi>Exiſtence</hi> is no part, no neceſſarie Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of his <hi>Eſſence;</hi> ſo neither is his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> neceſſarie or eſſential to his <hi>Exiſtence.</hi> As his <hi>exiſtence,</hi> ſo his <hi>goodneſs</hi> is mutable; the one neceſſarily including a <hi>poſſibilitie of declination,</hi> or decay, the other an <hi>inclination to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe</hi> or falling into evil. As he was made after the Similitude of God, he was actually and inherently Good; yet was not his Goodneſs eſſential, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or immutable. Nor did he reſemble his Creator in theſe <hi>eſſential Attributes</hi> but rather in the Exerciſe of them <hi>ad extra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Exerciſe</hi> was not neceſſarie but free in the Creator; for God might have continued for ever moſt Holy, Righteous and Good in himſelf, albeit he had neither created man nor other Creature. Wherefore he made them good as he was freely Good, and ſuch is the Goodneſſe communicated to them in their Creation, not <hi>neceſſarie,</hi> but <hi>free;</hi> and if <hi>free,</hi> as well including a <hi>poſsibilitie of falling into evil</hi> as an actual ſtate of goodneſs.</p>
               <p>If then you ask, <hi>Could not God by his Almightie Power have prevented A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams eating of the forbidden Fruit?</hi> None (I think) will be ſo incredulous as to doubt, whether he that commanded the Sun to ſtand ſtill in his ſphere and did dead <hi>Ieroboams</hi> arme when he ſtretched it out againſt the Prophet,
<pb n="3777" facs="tcp:32220:247"/>
could not as eaſily have ſtayed <hi>Adams</hi> hand from taking, or turned his eies from looking upon, or his heart from luſting after the forbidden fruit. All theſe were <hi>Acts of Meer Power.</hi> But had he by his <hi>Omnipotent Power</hi> laid this <hi>Neceſsitie</hi> upon <hi>Adams</hi> will or underſtanding; or had he kept him from tranſgreſſion by <hi>reſtraint,</hi> he had made him uncapable of that happineſſe whereto by his <hi>infinite Goodneſſe</hi> he had ordained him. For, by this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he had not been <hi>Good in himſelf:</hi> Nor could he be capable of true fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, but he muſt be capable likewiſe of puniſhment and miſerie. The <hi>Ground</hi> of his Intereſt in the One, was his <hi>actual and inherent Goodneſs,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in his Creation: Nor was he lyable to the other, but by the <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie</hi> of his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> or poſsibilitie of falling into evil. In like manner, he that gave that known Power and Vertue to the <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> could as eaſily draw the moſt ſtony hearted ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> unto Chriſt, as <hi>it</hi> doth ſteel and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. But if he ſhould draw them by ſuch a <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>natural motion,</hi> he ſhould defeat them of all their hope or intereſt in that exceſſive Glory which he hath prepared for thoſe that love him. If again it be demanded, <hi>Why God doth not ſave the impenitent and ſtubborn ſinner?</hi> It is all one as if we ſhould ask, <hi>VVhy he did not crown brute Beaſts with honour and immortalitie?</hi> That thus he could do by his <hi>Infinite Power,</hi> I will not deny; and if thus he would do, no Creature juſtly might controll him, none poſsibly could reſiſt or hinder him. Yet I may (without preſumption) affirm, That, <hi>Thus to do, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with the internal Rule of his Juſtice, Goodneſſe and Majeſtie.</hi> Nor can it ſtand better with the ſame Rule to ſave all men, if we take them <hi>as they are,</hi> not, <hi>as they might be;</hi> Albeit, he have endued all with reaſon to diſtinguiſh between good and evil. For many of them <hi>ſpeak evil of thoſe things they know not, but what they know naturally as brute beaſts, in thoſe things they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt themſelves.</hi> Jude v. 10. It ſtands leſſe with <hi>Gods infinite Goodneſs</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> if we conſider them as linkt with infinite Juſtice or Majeſtie, to bring ſuch unto true happineſs, then to advance brute beaſts to Immortality. <hi>It is a people,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27. 11.) <hi>of no underſtanding, therefore he that made them will not have mercie on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favor.</hi> God out of the abundance of his Goodneſſe, Mercie and Long-ſuffering, tolerates ſuch as the Apoſtle and Prophet ſpeak of, and out of his infinite Love ſeeks by the Preaching of his Word, and other means not prejudicial to his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> to gather them as he would have done <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> here in my Text. But (finally) there is a certain <hi>Meaſure of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie</hi> which when it is full, or, <hi>an height of ſtubborneſs</hi> and profaneneſs, whereunto if once they come, the ſtroke of his infinite Juſtice falls heavie upon them for wilful contempt of his infinite Mercie.

               </p>
               <p>In Brief we anſwer, <hi>There have been Two Extremities in Opinions continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally followed by the two main Factions of the Chriſtian world;</hi> The One, <hi>That God hath ſo decreed all things, as that it is impoſsible ought ſhould have been that hath not been, or not to have been, which hath been.</hi> This was the Opinion of the Antient <hi>Stoicks,</hi> which attributed all Events to <hi>Fate,</hi> and it is no way mitigated, but rather improved, by referring this <hi>abſolute Neceſsity,</hi> not to ſecond Cauſes or Nature, but to the Omnipotent Power of the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This was refuted in our laſt Meditations, becauſe it makes God the ſole Author of every ſin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Extremity</hi> is, <hi>That in man before his Converſion by Grace, there is a freedome or abtliment to do that which is pleaſant and acceptable unto God, or an activity to work his own Converſion.</hi> This was the Error of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and is in part communicated to the modern Papiſts, who hold a mean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but a falſe one, betwixt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and the <hi>Stoicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true Mean from which theſe Extremities ſwerve, may be comprized in theſe <hi>two Propoſitions:</hi> The One Negative: <hi>In Man after Adams Fall there is no Freedom of will, or ability to do any thing not deſerving Gods wrath or Juſt indignation.</hi> The Other Affirmative: <hi>There is in man after his Fall, a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility left of doing or not doing ſome things, which being done or not done, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes paſſively capable of Gods mercies; doing or not doing the contrary, he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from mercie, and remaines a veſſel of wrath, for his Juſtice to work upon.</hi> For whether a man wil call this <hi>Contingencie in humane actions,</hi> not, <hi>a poſſibility of doing or not doing,</hi> but rather <hi>a poſſibility of acknowledging our infirmities or abſolute impotencie of doing any thing belonging or tending to our ſalvation:</hi> I will not contend with him. Only of this I reſt perſwaded, That all the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Prophets &amp; Apoſtles to work humilitie and true repentance in their Auditors, ſuppoſe a poſsibility of Humiliation and Repentance; a Poſsibility likewiſe of acknowledging and conſidering our own impotencie and miſery; a Poſsibility likewiſe of conceiving ſome deſire not meerly brutiſh of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption or deliverance. Our Saviour (ye know) required not only <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> of health, of ſight, of ſpeech in all thoſe whom he healed, reſtored to ſight, or made to ſpeak, but withal <hi>a kind of natural belief</hi> or conceit that he was able to effect what they deſired. Hence ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 58. <hi>He could not do many miracles among them becauſe of their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi> Yet Chriſt alone wrought the Miracles, the parties cured were mere <hi>Patients,</hi> no way <hi>Agents.</hi> And ſuch as ſolicited their cauſe in Caſe of abſence at the beſt were but <hi>By-ſtanders.</hi> Now no man I think will deny that Chriſt by the Power of his Godhead could have given ſight, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Yet <hi>in a good ſenſe</hi> it is alwayes moſt true, That <hi>Gods will is alwaies ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</hi> We are therefore to conſider, That God may will ſome things <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,</hi> others <hi>Diſjunctively:</hi> or that ſome things ſhould fall out <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> others not at all, or <hi>contingently.</hi> The particulars which <hi>God abſolutely</hi> wils or which he wills ſhould fall out <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> muſt of neceſſitie come to paſs; otherwiſe his Will could in no caſe be truly ſaid to be fulfilled. As unleſſe the Leper, to whom it was ſaid by our Saviour, <hi>[I will be thou clean]</hi> had been cleanſed; Gods Will manifeſted in theſe words had been utterly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But if every particular which he wills <hi>disjunctively,</hi> or which he wills <hi>ſhould be contingent,</hi> did of <hi>neceſſitie</hi> come to paſſe, his whole Will ſhould utterly be defeated. For his Will (as we ſuppoſe) in this Caſe is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this, nor that particular ſhould be neceſſarie, but that either they ſhould not be, or be <hi>contingent.</hi> And if any particular, comprized within the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of this Contingencie with its conſequent, come to paſſe, his Will is truly and perfectly fulfilled. As for Example: God tells the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that by obſerving of his Commandments they ſhould live, and die by tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them. Whether therefore they live by the one meanes, or dye by the other, his Will is neceſſarily fulfilled, becauſe it was not that they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily obſerve his Commandments or tranſgreſſe them: But to their tranſgreſſions, though Contingent death was the neceſſary Doome: So was life the abſolute neceſſarie Reward of their Contingent obſerving them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But the Lord hath ſworn, <hi>That he delights not in the death of him that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> but in his repentance: If then he never repent, Gods delight or good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <note place="margin">Another Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Anſwer thereto</note> is not alwayes fulfilled, becauſe he delights in the one of theſe, not in the other.

<pb n="3780" facs="tcp:32220:249"/>
ſuffer our ſelves to be ſaved, the ſame delight or pleaſure is ſet upon our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and fulfilled upon us: and if we would but enter into our own hearts, we might ſee the Image of Gods Will hitherto manifeſted by his Word di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly written in them; and that the Rule which his infinite Juſtice obſerves <note place="margin">See Book the 6.</note> in puniſhing the wicked and reprobate, is to meaſure out their plagues and puniſhments, according to the meaſure of their neglecting his Will, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting his delight in their ſalvation: that as the riches of his Goodneſs lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to repentance hath been more plentiful; ſo they by their impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie ſtill treaſure up greater ſtore of wrath againſt the day of wrath. To this purpoſe doth the Lord threaten the obſtinate people before mentioned, Iſai. 65. 5. <hi>Theſe are as a ſmoke in my noſe, a fire that burneth all the day. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is written before me;</hi> I <hi>will not keep ſilence, but will recompenſe, even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe into their boſom, your iniquities, and the iniquities of your Fathers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (ſaith the Lord) which have burnt Incenſe upon the mountains, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me upon the Hils; therefore wil I meaſure their former work into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</hi> Both theſe parts of Gods delight are fully expreſſed by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 1. 21. <hi>VViſdom crieth without, ſhe hath uttered her voice in the ſtreets; ſhe crieth in the chief place of the Concourſe, in the opening of the gates; in the Citie ſhe utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her words, ſaying, How long ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity, and the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners delight in their ſcorning, and fools hate knowledg? Turn you at my reproof Behold I wil pour out my ſpirit upon you, I wil make knowne my words unto you.</hi> Theſe paſſages infallibly argue an unfeigned delight in their repentance, and ſuch a deſire of their ſalvation, as the Wiſdome of God hath expreſſed in my Text. But what followes? <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand and no man regarded: But ye have ſet at naught all my counſel, and would none of my reproof,</hi> I <hi>alſo wil laugh at your calamity,</hi> I <hi>wil mock when your fear cometh.</hi> Thus his delight remaines the ſame, but is ſet upon another Object. To the ſame purpoſe, Iſai. 65. 12. <hi>Therefore</hi> I <hi>wil number you to the ſword, and ye ſhall all bow down to the ſlaughter, becauſe when</hi> I <hi>called, ye did not anſwer, when</hi> I <hi>ſpake ye did not hear, but did evil before mine eyes, and did chuſe that wherein</hi> I <hi>delighted not.</hi> So then whether by the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wicked, or the ſalvation of his Choſen, Gods name is ſtill alike glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: His Juſtice exacts what ſhould have been, but was not payed unto his Mercie. He can be no loſer by mans unthankfulneſs or ungratiouſneſſe; The Caſe is all one, as if we ſhould take that from a thief with the left hand, which he had picked out of our right hand. <hi>Thus much of the two Points pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</hi>

of his ſalvation cannot be inferred but from indefinite Premiſſes; from which no certain Concluſion can poſsibly follow.

               <p n="14">14. Without admiſſion of the <hi>Former Doctrine,</hi> it is impoſſible for any man rightly to meaſure the heinouſneſſe of his own or others ſins. Such as gather the infinitie of ſins demerit from the infinite Majeſtie againſt which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, give us the ſurface of ſin, infinite in length and breadth, but not in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie. <note place="margin">See Fol. 3341.</note> The will or pleaſure of a Prince in matters meanly affected by him, or in reſpect of which he is little more then indifferent, may be neglected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greater offence then meaner perſons may juſtly take for foul indignities or grievous wrongs.

Conſider then, that as the Majeſtie and Goodneſſe of our God, ſo his Love and Mercie towards us, is truly infinite. That he deſires our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as earneſtly as we can deſire meat or drink in the extremity of thirſt or hunger; as we can do life it ſelf while we are beſet with death; That this our <hi>God manifeſted in our fleſh did not deſire his own life ſo much as our redemption.</hi> We muſt therefore meaſure the heinouſneſs of our ſins by the abundance of Gods Love, by the heighth and depth of our Saviours Humiliation: Thus they will appear infinite not only becauſe committed againſt an infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, but becauſe with this dimenſion they further include a wilful neglect of infinite mercie, and Incomprehenſible deſires of our Salvation. We are by nature the ſeed of Rebels, which had lift their hands againſt the <hi>infinite Goodneſs of their Creator,</hi> in taking the forbidden fruit, whereby they ſought to be like him in Majeſtie. Conſcious of this tranſgreſsion, the firſt Actors immediately hid themſelves from his preſence: And, as if this their terror had imprinted a perpetual <hi>Antipathy</hi> in their poſteritie, the leaſt glympſe of his glory for many generations after, made them cry out, <hi>Alas we ſhall dye! becauſe we have ſeen the Lord.</hi> We ſtil continue like the off-ſpring of tame Creatures growen wild, alwayes eſchewing his preſence that ſeeks to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, as the Bird doth the Fowler, or the beaſts of the Forreſt the ſight of fire. And yet unleſs he ſhelter us under the ſhadow of his wings, we are as a prey expoſed to the deſtroyer, already condemned for <hi>Fewel</hi> to the flames of hell, or as nutriment to the brood of ſerpents.

infinite. He that was equal with God, was converſant with us here on earth in the form and condition of a ſervant.

                  </note> things neceſſary for this life: So did not the Son of God, his humanitie was charged with all the miſeries whereof mortality is capable, ſubject to hunger and thirſt, to temptations, revilings and ſcornings, even of his ſervants, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie which cannot befal ſlaves or vaſſals either born, or made ſo by men. Or to uſe the Prophets words, <hi>He bare mans infirmities,</hi> not ſpiritually only, but bodily. For, <hi>who was weak, and he was not weak?</hi> Who was ſick, and he whole? No malady of any diſeaſe cured by him, but was made his by exact and perfect ſympathie. Laſtly, <hi>He bare our ſinnes, upon the Croſſe,</hi> and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to greater torments then any man in this life can ſuffer. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe were as diſpleaſant to his humane Nature, as to ours, yet were our ſins to him more diſpleaſant. As he was loving to us in his death, ſo was he wiſe towards himſelf, and in ſubmitting himſelf to this ignominious and cruel death, did of two evils chuſe the leſſe: Rather to ſuffer the puniſhment due to our ſins, then to ſuffer ſin ſtil to reign in us, whom he loved more dearly then his own life. If then we ſhall continue in ſin after manifeſtation of this his Love, the heinouſneſſe of our offence is truly infinite, in as much as we do that continually which is more diſtaſteful to our gracious God, then any torments can be to us: So doing <hi>we build up the works of Satan which he came purpoſely to deſtroy.</hi> For of this I would not have you ignorant, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the end of his death was to redeem ſinners; yet, <hi>the only means predeſtinated by him for our Redemption is deſtruction of the works of Satan, and renovation of his Fathers Image in our ſouls.</hi> For us then to re-edifie the works of Satan, or abett his Faction, is ſtill more offenſive to this our God, then was his Agony and bloodie Sweat. For taking a fuller meaſure of our ſins, let us hereunto adde his patient expectation of his enemies Converſion after his Reſurrection.</p>

If the ſon of <hi>Zaleucus</hi> before mentioned ſhould have pardoned any as deeply guilty as himſelf had been of that offence for which he loſt one eye, and his Father another; the world would have taxed him either of injuſtice, folly, or too much facility, rather then commended him for true Juſtice or Clemencie. But that we may know how far Gods Mercie doth over-beare his Majeſtie, he proceeds not ſtraight way to execute vengeance upon theſe Jewes which wreaked their malice upon his deare and only Son, who had committed nothing worthy of blame, much leſſe of death. Here was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wrath and indignation ſo juſt as would have moved the moſt merciful man on earth to have taken ſpeedy vengeance upon theſe Spillers of innocent blood, ſpecially the Law of God permitting thus much.

Yet he patiently expects their repentance which with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting fury had plotted his deſtruction. <hi>Forty yeers long had he been grieved with this generation after</hi> the firſt Paſſeover celebrated in ſign of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, and for their ſtubborneſſe <hi>he ſwore they ſhould not enter into his reſt.</hi> And now their poſterity after a more glorious delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Powers of darkneſſe, have fortie yeers allotted them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance before they be rooted out of the Land of Reſt or Promiſe. <hi>Yet hath not the Lord given them hearts to perceive, eyes to ſee, or ears to hear unto this day, becauſe ſeeing they would not ſee, nor hearing they would not hear, but har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened their hearts againſt the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Lord give us what thou didſt not give them <hi>hearts of fleſh,</hi> which may melt at thy threats, ears to hear the

                  <q>That however that Inheritance which wee hope for by Chriſt, be much more <hi>Glorious</hi> then the Inheritance which God promiſed to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by <hi>Moſes:</hi> yet Gods Promiſes unto us for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into this glorious Reſt, are ſubject to the ſame Conditions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſoes, which the Promiſes made to the Iſraelites were, for entering into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now many of them came ſhort of thoſe Promiſes:</q> And ſo our Apoſtle takes as granted; Many of thoſe Hebrewes unto whom he wrote this Epiſtle, might fall further ſhort of thoſe glorious Promiſes made unto them in Chriſt. All of them were, as all of us by Baptiſm are, the the Sons of God, and Heirs of Promiſe; yet moſt of them, as moſt of us, <hi>Haeredes praeſumpti, non haeredes apparentes,</hi> Heires preſumed or by adoption, not Heires apparent; that is, not heires diſ-inheritable, or irreverſibly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained unto eternal Life. And from this Ground our Apoſtle takes occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thought it neceſſary to preſs repentance ſo forcibly upon them; firſt by way of <hi>Threatning;</hi> then by <hi>Promiſe,</hi> or incouragement.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, here in the beginning of my Text: But we meet with the ſame word again in the concluſion of it. And if you will have the Subject of all the Propoſitions in my Text, which (as I told you before) ſome Modern Interpreters have rent aſunder, (by making an <hi>Hiatus</hi> or chink between the 12 and 13 verſes) we muſt put the <hi>two firſt words,</hi> and the <hi>four laſt,</hi> together. And ſo the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will appear to be not only more full, but a great deal more elegant in the <hi>Original,</hi> then it is in the ordinary Latin, or then I know how to make it in our Engliſh: As thus, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>About tranſlating the Original in the laſt words of my Text, there is ſome diverſitie amongſt Interpreters.

And ſo the <hi>Syriack</hi> renders it, ſave only that He puts it in the <hi>third Perſon plural; To whom men muſt give an account;</hi> which words according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of that Tongue, (and of the Hebrew) may be taken imperſonally, <hi>to whom account muſt be given.</hi> And this Interpretation I find warranted by the Authoritie of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,</hi> two of the beſt Expreſſors of <note place="margin">S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Theophylact:</note> the Original or Greek Dialect. And thus the <hi>Original</hi> will run clear without any <hi>Hiatus</hi> or interruption either in the Subject or Foundation, or in the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Attributes or ſeveral Propoſitions.</p>
