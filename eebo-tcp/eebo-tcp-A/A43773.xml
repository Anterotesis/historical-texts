            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>FArewel damn'd <hi>Stygian</hi> Juyce, that doſt bewitch,</l>
               <l>From the Court Bawd, down to the Country Bitch;</l>
               <l>Thou Liquid Flame, by whom each fiery Face</l>
               <l>Lives without Meat, and bluſhes without Grace,</l>
               <l>Sink to thy Native Hell to mend the Fire,</l>
               <l>Or if it pleaſe thee to aſcend yet higher,</l>
               <l>To the dull Climate go, from whence you came,</l>
               <l>Where Wit and Courage do require your Flame;</l>
               <l>Where they Carouſe it in <hi>Veſuvian</hi> Bowls,</l>
               <l>To cruſt the Quagmire of their ſpungy Souls:</l>
               <l>Had <hi>Dives</hi> for thy ſchorching Liquor cry'd;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> in Mercy had his ſuit deny'd;</l>
               <l>Had <hi>Bonner</hi> known thy force, the Martyrs Blood</l>
               <l>Had hiſs'd in thee, and ſav'd the Nations Wood:</l>
               <l>Eſſence of Ember, ſcum of melting flint,</l>
               <l>With all the Native ſparkles floating in't;</l>

               <l>And double ſtill'd, nay quinteſcenc'd thy Juyce,</l>
               <l>To charcoal Mortals for his future uſe.</l>
               <l>Fire-ſhip of Nature, thou doſt doubly wound,</l>
               <l>For they that graple thee, are burnt and drown'd:</l>
               <l>Gods paſt and future Anger breath in you</l>
               <l>A Deluge and a Conflagration too.</l>

               <l>View yonder Sott, I do not mean Sh—</l>
               <l>Grilled all o're, by thee, from head to foot,</l>
               <l>His greaſie Eye-lids ſhoar'd above their pitch,</l>
               <l>His Face with Carbuncles, and Rubies rich,</l>
               <l>His Scull inſtead of Brains ſupply'd with Cinder,</l>
               <l>His Noſe turns all his Handkerchiefs to Tinder;</l>
               <l>His Stomach don't concoct, but bake his Food,</l>
               <l>His Liver even vitrefies his Blood;</l>
               <l>His trembling hand ſcarce heaves his Liquor in,</l>
               <l>His Nerves all cracle under's Parchment Skin;</l>
               <l>His Guts from Natures drudgery are freed,</l>
               <l>And in his Bowels <hi>Salamanders</hi> breed.</l>
               <l>The moveing Glaſs-houſe lightens with his Eyes,</l>
               <l>Singes his Cloaths, and all his Marrow frys,</l>
               <l>Glows for a while, and then in Aſhes dyes.</l>
               <l>Thus like a ſham <hi>Promethius</hi> we find,</l>
               <l>Thou ſtol'ſt a Fire from Hell, to kill Mankind.</l>
               <l>But ſtay, leaſt I the Saints dire Anger merit,</l>
               <l>By ſtinting their Auxilliary Spirit.</l>
               <l>I am inform'd, whate're we wicked think,</l>
               <l>Brandy's reform'd, and turn'd a godly Drink</l>
               <l>Thou'ſt left thy old bad Company of Vermin,</l>
               <l>The ſwearing Porters, and the drunken Carmen;</l>
               <l>And the new drivers of the <hi>Hackney</hi> Coaches,</l>
               <l>And now takſt up with fage diſcreet debauches;</l>
               <l>Thou freely dropſt upon Gold Chains, and Furr,</l>
               <l>And Sots of Quality thy Minions are.</l>
               <l>No more ſhalt thou foment an Ale-houſe brawl,</l>
               <l>But the more ſober Riots of <hi>Guild-Hall</hi>;</l>
               <l>Where by the Spirits fallible Direction,</l>
               <l>We Reprobates once pol'd for an Election:</l>
               <l>If this trade hold, what ſhall we Mortals do,</l>
               <l>The Saints Sequeſter even our Vices too.</l>
               <l>For ſince the Art of Whoring's grown preciſe,</l>
               <l>And Perjury has got demurer Eyés,</l>
               <l>'Tis time, high time to circumciſe the Gill,</l>
