         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>A good air then hath no excesse in the qualities, that is, neither too hote nor cold, moist nor dry: if it exceede this measure, it is better to decline to drouth than to waknesse, for drouth is still more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some than raine: It is also of a mediocre sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betweene grosse and subtile, being pure and neate, cleare and light, constant and equall: such an aire reviues the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, purifieth the blood, procureth appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, helpeth the digestion, banisheth the excrements foorth of the body in good tyme, coloureth the face, rejoyceth the heart, quickneth the senses, sharpneth the wit, and fortifieth the members, so that all the actions of the body animals, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and naturals are made better by it.</p>

and the night groweth long, for in September the day and the night hath each of them twelue houres, but from thence the day diminisheth, and the night grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth longer. Amongst the signes Libra is more hote than cold: Scorpion is very hote and dry: Sagittarius is more cold than dry. Libra is so called, because the night and day are in equall ballance: and Scorpion by reason of the byting of the cold sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile aire, as a scorpion, making the earth dry and cold. And Sagittarius, while by the shooting of his arrowes, hee makes as it were the ground and all things dead. In Libra, Bootes a signe with 22 starres, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ehiefe is Arcturus, is remarked: The Harvest is cold, in regarde of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and dry in respect of the Winter: it is not absolutely hote or dry, cold or humide, and so not temperate, as is the spring: for there is not only found an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie in the whole season, but also in one day, which is now warme now cold, as at noone it is hote, at night it is cold: This inconstancie causeth diverse diseases inconstant and dangerous, by the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humors of inequall temper, throgh the cold it hindereth the dissipation of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere,

            <p>Women with child are likned to one bearing a weightie burden, by a small threed tyed to their hands, who going, softlie, and warily may happily bring their burden to the purposed place: but if they bee agitate by any inordinate or violent motion, easily their burthen partly by the weight, and partly by reason of the small

string will fall to the ground: so it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with them, for if they move vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, or suffer agitation either in a Coach or chariot, or by any other sort of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or if they bee troubled suddainly by the passions of the mind, or vse evill food, smell evill savoured things, behold things fearefull, a suddaine impression of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first in the spirits, next in the blood and last by these in the tender bodie of the child, the knittings breaking, they readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie are brought to bed before tyme.</p>
            <p>For this end let them haue a care to keepe a moderat dyet in all things, vsing good and nourishing meats, being more sparing in the first moneth then afterward, because the menstruous blood doeth then abound, not imployed either for grouth, or nourishing of their birth as yet; it is better to take often and little rather than too much at once: they should flee, all meats of a bytting facultie, also all windie, all procuring either the fluxe of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or of their flowers, as capirs, oynions, garlik, safrane, and strong wine: they should vse little drinke, least the ligaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, sl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4663:62"/>
should bee quyetly past over without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The second a soft gentle walking is good. The third a little quicker. The fourth, fifth, and sixth admitte greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, and stronger motion. The seventh, eight, and till halfe of the nynth, requires some greater rest and quyetnesse than the former, among these the eight as most dangerous, would bee quyetest and most carefullie keeped, from the middle of the nynth till their birth, a more quicke mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and frequent, exercise is properest for the furthering of the same. They should shun the companie of men the first moneth, for feare of a new conception, afterward they may bee more bold: also all passions of the minde, because by chasing the blood inward, they choke the child, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falleth out in great wrath, or sadnesse. Too long sleepe is not evill, from the which they should awake quietlie. They should keepe themselues from excessiue cold or heat, and from the North and South wind, for both the one and the other doe moue a distillation, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce a cough, the which hastneth their birth before, the tyme flying alwayes the noyse of thunder, &amp; guns of great belles, and the like: and because

that women with child, either hath lost all appetite, or are troubled with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, as a desire to eate strange things, as also with a paine in the stomack, gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the heart, great spitting, short breath, sore head, swelling in the legges, and an vniversall heavinesse thorow the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, proceeding from the suppression of their flowers, (yet there be some so full of blood, who hath them, the first moneths, others all the tyme) least these and the like by weakning of the mother, doe precipitate both mother and bairne in hazard of death: it is better to purge these vitious humors, than to suffer such manifest dangers. The properest tyme for purging, according to <hi>Hipp.</hi> is from the fourth moneth to the seveneh; for the child (saith <hi>Galen.)</hi> is tyed to the matrix of the mother, as the fruites are to the trees, the fruites new budded out haue the stalk so tender that little shaking will make them fall, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with tyme more firmely tyed to, they are not so shortly broken, till the tyme of their maturitie, where they fall off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe without helpe; so women with child are in lesse danger the fourth, fift, and six moneths, then the first and the last.</p>

               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:4663:63"/>
Women with child should not be bled, except in a great necessitie, least the bairne by bleeding, frustrate of his foode, bee forced to breake foorth before the tyme to looke for meate; yet there bee some women who are so full of blood, that except you draw blood of them, they will chocke the child in their belly, of such blood may bee taken once or twise.</p>
            <p>Women with child should cast away their buistes, which they vse, to keepe them small about the middle, and that so soone as they find their bellie to swell: for they hinder the grouth of the child, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth it often to come foorth before the tyme.

               <head>Of their governement, the tyme of their birth, and after the same.</head>
               <p>There bee three things required to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall birth, the first a-like fordwardnesse both in the mother and the child: so the child requiring more meate than the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can afford, and greater libertie to take the aire, hee tares with his hands and feete his thinne membranous sheettes: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix againe wearied of its burden, doth contract the selfe, for the expelling of it: Now if any of these bee inlacking, their birth is not without danger: for if the whole action be imposed on the mother, as it falleth when the child is dead, or verie weake, it is with great paine, which sometymes bringeth death: and if the child get all the businesse to doe, by reason of the mothers weaknesse, it is of no lesse hazard. The second is a due forme, which <hi>Hipp.</hi> describeth in his first booke
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4663:64"/>
                  <hi>de morbis mulierum,</hi> and in his booke <hi>de natura pueri,</hi> in these words: A childe (saith hee) if the birth be naturall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth foorth head-long, and he giveth the reason in an other place of this, because the parts aboue the middle are heavier than beneath it: Moreover if the feete come first foorth, they in stretching of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues should stoppe the passage to the rest of the body: so the custome of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents was, (as reporteth <hi>Plinius</hi> in seven bookes of his naturall history,) and is now also to carie the dead with their feete for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest, because that death is contrarie to life. The third thing required, is, that it bee quicke, easie, and without great paine or many symptomes.</p>

               <p>Nature (saith <hi>Arist.)</hi> hath set downe a certaime terme and tyme of birth almost to all the creatures, only man hath diverse tymes: so the doue hath her mouthly birth: the bitch keepeth still foure moneth: the mare nine moneth, the Elephant two yeare: only woman changeth, having for terme the 7 8. 9. or 10 moneths: the first is the seventh, before which no childe can bee liuely: the next is the eight, in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4663:65"/>
which, according to <hi>Hipp.</hi> and other Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are not liuely: the nynth is the mostna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and best of all: the tenth and eleventh in the first dayes are liuelie also, although that birth doth not fall often foorth in them.</p>
               <p>Now that women be not troubled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tyme, remarke heere the signes of birth approaching, these are, a paine from the navell to the secret parts going about to the loynes or small of the back; a discent of the bairn-bed causing a swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about the privie members, a rednesse of the face: the mouth of the matrix open and straight, and in the entrie of it there is found a lumpe about the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of an egge a shivering through the whole bodie, and in end a certaine liquor issueth foorth: first in little quantitie then more larglie: and lastly there floweth a watrie blood if it bee a femall chylde, but pure, if a man child.</p>
               <p>There are three things to bee remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked about the tyme of the birth. The first, that the travelling woman be not burdened with too much meate, for thereby the naturall heat is drawne from the matrix to the stomack. Secondly that the Mid-wyfe doe not handle roughly, the bairn-bed of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4663:65"/>
these who are long in travelling, but gentlie their hands being oynted with oyle: Thirdly that the woman bee not troubled, till the foresaid signes appeare, especialy the straight<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse of the mouth of the matrix, and the eshuing of these humidities. These ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, let her so be placed that her loins bee free, le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ning most on her back and shoulders, her heeeles bee bowed inward toward her buttoks being lifted vp, and that her thighs bee so farre asunder as possible they can. Thus let her leane ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than sit, holden vp behind by a chaire, or the bed-side. Others standing do bring foorth their birth leaning to their hands, fastned to an hold. This tyme if the air of the chamber bee too warme, it must bee refreshed by opening of the windows, least they faint. And when the paine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth, the mouth of the matrix being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, let her who is travelling containe her breath, keeping her mouth and nose fast, and presse downe-ward with all her power, the Midd-wyfe softly with her hands hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her by pressing also from the navell downward, desisting when the matrix be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to close, least they travell in vaine.</p>
               <p>The childe should bee received by the

mid-wife in a soft small and warme linnen cloath, and that quyetly, least any of the members should bee hurt. This done, the woman should bee laide in her bed, in a darke chamber, with her thighes asunder, least the issuing of the blood should bee stopped, which ought to bee dryed vp by the oft changing of warme clothes, least either by the sharpe byting, or the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome stinking, it grieue the delyve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It were not amisse to ty a band of two hand-breadth about her navell, both for the furthering of her purgation, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from hindering of inflations from cold wind, which readily then entereth through the emptinesse of the matrix, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after breedeth a suffocation of the same: after her delyverie a drink of the best in little quantitie will doe no harme: let her absteane two dayes from flesh, vsing the while caddels, aleberries; and such like ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie digestable meates, and nourishing, for the repairing of her forces, eshewing all suddaine charging of the stomack, either by the great quantitie, or diverse qualitie of the meate: for her weake force doth not admit that, rather come by degrees to the former dyet, shunning all suddaine

                  </gap>hem, with the brest large and great: Secondly, let her bee in the flower of her age, that is, betweene 25 and 35: one younger aboundeth in super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous excrements, and older is too dry, by lack of the naturall moist, and heate dayly decressing: Thirdly, see shee be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, lustie, merry, sober, chast, meeke, not sluggish nor sadde, no gluttoun, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate of her mouth, no drunkard or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, not cholerick, or envyous, but gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and courteous: for the child doth not follow so much the nature of any, (except the parents) as the Nurses: Fourthly, that shee bee not of a long tyme delyvered, for when they passe two moneth without causing suck their pappes, nature becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4663:69"/>
forgetfull to furnish them matter for milk: Fiftly, that she be not with child, otherwise the best part of the blood will bee imployed for the intertaining the child in her belly: Sixtly, that her last birth be a man child, because her blood is purer, and the excrements are fewer, and so the milk must bee better: Seventhly, that she hath beene brought to bed at the tyme, for they who are before the tyme, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly sickly, or infirme: Eightly, that their milk bee of an mediocre substance betweene grosse and subtile, thick and cleare, of colour white, of tast sweete, in smell pleasant, and in sufficient quantitie.</p>
               <p>The Nurse should vse much nourishing meate (except shee abound in milke) and of easie digestion, as wheate bread of two dayes, the flesh of vealles, kiddes, fowles and birds of the field, pearches, trouts, solles, pykes, and soft rosted egges, flying all spyceries, all sowre or bitter things, and mustard. Fruites are not good, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept prune-damase, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>igges: nor wine, or strong drink, neither the companie of man. First, because dallying with <hi>Venus</hi> troubleth the blood, and consequently the milke: secondly, because it diminisheth the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4663:69"/>
quantitie of the milke, by turning the course of the blood downe-ward from the breast to the matrix: thirdly, because it giveth the milk an evill smell by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of its qualities: and lastly, because it lifteth the Nurses apron, and putteth a kidde in her kilting.</p>
               <p>Milke is deficient to the Nurse, either from lacke of meat; great care, too much griefe and paine, or from any in disposition of the whole body, or of the pappes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if lacke of victualls cause it, cause help her dishes both in quantitie and qualitie: if care, griefe, or paine, cause banish them. Goates pappes or yewes boyled with their owne milke haue a peculiar facultie for restoring of the milke lost, as also wheate bread baken with kynes milke, decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made with the leaves and seede of greene finkle, or of anise and milk.</p>
               <p>The Nurse should haue care to keepe the chylde in a place of temperate aire, shunning the Sunne, the night, raine, and all sort of intemperate season. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the milke is to bee taken from the age, complexion, and the desire the child hath to sucke. The first moneth lesse, by reason of his inabiltie to digest much: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4663:70"/>
better for him: so hee that is of a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plexion humide sooner than hee who is drye: also one that is wholesome, than he who is infirme and sicklye. Diseases al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so according to their diverse nature will change the terme, causing waine him soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later: such-like the season, for in Summer it is not good to waine him, for to give him solide meate in place of his milke, which are not so easily digested: in like manner the region, for in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie verie cold hee may bee wained in the midst of summer, &amp; in a very hot, in the hart of winter. Also the sexe for the males may bee sooner wained than the femals: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue their teeth sooner, and haue greater heate and force to digest their meate.</p>
               <p>Hee should bee wained by little and little, by giving more seldome the pape and ofter of other meate. And if hee bee not willing to quyte it, you must cause rubbe the head of it with wormewood or Aloes or any bitter thing.</p>
               <p>Being wained, Veilles, mutton, capons, henns, partridges, and birds of the field are fittest for them: boyled meate is better than rosted; soft egges are never evill, so

Their drinke should bee small aile or watter, no wayes wyne, because it easily hurts their braine and nerves, being as yet weake and tender, as also addes heat to heat, whereby their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall moysture or humiditie is dryed vp. The child should sleepe much because he is of a moyst complexion, and sleepe moisteneth more by hindering the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipation of his naturall humide substance: hee should ly on his back, till his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers bee strong, and hee beginne to vse stronger meat than milk: and easie rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is best, for by it the naturall heat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires the selfe within, and the spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come drowsie: but a toylsome catching, tosseth the milk to and fro in the stomack, hindereth the disgestion, troubleth the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and braine.</p>

The pustuls of the mouth, according to <hi>Galen.</hi> commeth of the sharpnesse, and serositie of the milk which easily exulcerateth that place, being as yet tender: Vomiting is from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the milk, over-charging the weake stomack: the cogh is from the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of the braine distilling on the lightes. night watching, of the sharpnesse of the vapours that ariseth from the stomack to the head Feare in the sleepe, is of the meate corrupted in the stomack, which sendeth evill vapours to the head, from the which aryseth dreames, procuring feare. The run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the eares is, from the humiditie of the braine: the inflammation of the navell proceedeth of the evill cutting and binding of the same: The icth of the gumes, from the pricking of the teeth prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing foorth.
