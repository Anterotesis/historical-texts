         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Lord not only gave his People the Land of promiſe, but cities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, to which thoſe ſled purſued, not ſo faſt by an ill conſcience, as the avenger of bloud, though a corrupt conſcience be the only vulturean a venger. The Miniſters of the Goſpell were not tipified (as I conceive) in the ſilver trumpets only, but in thoſe burning tapers, whoſe lights ought to bee ſeen as well as their voices heard, therefore Chriſt gives a charage they ſhould not only preach, but ſhine. Surely they were meant alſo in thoſe ſheltring Cities, whether the Soules of men ſhould not barely repaired for ſpirituall ſuccour, (being chaſed by that roring Lion) but alſo for other kind of releife who ought not onely to be ſpirituall, but temporall granaries, in whome ſhould be found both corporall, and mentall comforts.</p>

            <head>To the honorable the Committee for Contribution of monies to the diſtreſſed Paoteſtants of Ireland.</head>
            <p>RIght Honorable, Neceſſity hath as many tongues and pennes as <hi>Briarius</hi> hands, <hi>Argus</hi> eyes, or ſin advocates, and thoſe dictators of our miſeries, never had a juſter cauſe than now to ſupplicate for their own ſilence, and by a divine proportion, Charity hath not only large bowels but many and open eares, ſo that the ſpeakers and auditors have an equality in number. No Nation hath had larger taſtes of the firſt, than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor any Nation ever produced a larger crop of the laſt (to furniſh the firſt) than <hi>England</hi>): The traine oyle of our calamities hath made the lamps of their Charities to ſhine the world o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whilſt the oyle from their cruſes and meale from their barrels hath not failed to furniſh, us &amp; as they are to be honored for this crop, we are alſo to honor you for the carefull ſtoring and diſtributing thereof. Me thinks I find no yeare of <hi>Jehoaſh</hi> ſo famous as that in the 2 of <hi>Kings,</hi> 4, 5. and 15. v. in which was the care to repair that holy fabrick dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, and in that work nothing more glorious than the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that truſt by them that were to effect this repaire; for it ſeems the generall contribution was not ſo rich or great, as the honeſty of thoſe entruſted. The calamitous Proteſtants are the temples of the holy Ghoſt, which like that ruined ſtructure, want repair, that a ſupply of the former cares and zeale were requiſite, &amp; as thouſands cannot but praiſe God for the indefatigable pains and labours in your pious diſtributions, yet divers that have ſtaid longeſt and ventured, ſuffered, and effected moſt, have not had ſo much as a taſt of this hony, with <hi>Jonathan</hi> on the tip of their rod to cheere their feeble and fainting ſoules ſpent in the purſuit, and ſlaughter of thoſe Iriſh Philiſtims, who thirſt after ſome of the hony combe of Charity, pine for It, and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh without it. I repine at no mans ſucceſſe, but it appeares to mee that thoſe wyich brought their cloaths and meanes away before the rebellion, had warm'd a houſe, ſhould find Cloaths, meanes and warm'th

here, when as ſuch as ſtaied to ſpend and venture their lives, and blou ſhould find neither, ſo that I muſt conclude our deſires to do ſervice there, detain'd us ſo, that now our deſires cannot be ſerv'd. I am not ignorant what juſt cauſe of ſuſpence may be given your honours from thoſe that uſurped the name of ruined Proteſtants, and of ſome which I could produce that have gone by their own virgin Sirnames, their firſt husbands, and their husbands by two names, which cheating of the publick charity, might juſtly incenſe your honours to explode the truly deplorable Petitioners which are as worthy of relief, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of puniſhment, were it the only laboure of ſome knowne man, to examine the petitions, and ſubſcriptions, certificates, and perſons, this abuſe might be reformed, if not cured; but I hope ſome particulars will nor ecclipſe, thoug it a darken a while a publike good, and with Charity, which warmed theſe impoſtures will heate, ſuch as truly want her beames: the Sun alters not his courſe, becauſe the earth is ful of lay-ſtals. No Act of the Apoſtles wins more upon me, than their publike charity transferred into Judea to the diſtreſſed brethren, by the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> in thoſe dayes of emptineſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.29.30. The ſame your honours are to us the ſons of conſolation, in which act of theirs, thete was not only a good purpoſe, but a proſecution. The care of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in proviping is not to be preferred before that of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing, by which he not only ſuſtained the ſubject, but enrich the King, you have the ſame power for what relief you offered to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Crowns the head (Chriſt Jeſus) who ſignes acquaintances to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable works with his own hand (inſomuch as you have done it unto one of theſe little ones, you have done it unto me.)</p>
            <p>I more like the peace and charity of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperour procured to the poore Chriſtians, then his erecting or repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Churches, and I more applaud that Centurion, for loving the Jewiſh nation, then for building them a Sinagogue, becauſe the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plls made with hands (which I honur as publick places appointed for Gods worſhip, may become dennes of thieves, cages of uncleanneſſe, or as amongſt the Iriſh (Jewes in ſome traditions) publik market pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119757:4"/>
or what is more terrible as I have known the two moſt famous Cathedralls in Dublin made a meeting place for uncleanneſſe, though all this while that holy pile is innocent, though abuſed, or which is yet worſe, may become Popiſh Sanctuaries, refuges for the moſt impious or laſtly be made the ſtorehouſes, or ſupporters to ſuch profane, and Idolatrous images, as the purer Temples of the Holy Ghoſt (which Temples we are) ſhall not onely abhorre, but demoliſh, as Moſes the Calfe.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles were not ſtiled <hi>oratores,</hi> and <hi>vinatores,</hi> for their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tilling, or pruning the Church, but for ſowing their bread upon the waters, and relieving the living vines, the diſtreſſed Saints, O heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Charity the laſt companion of the ſoul, thou immortall vertue, how many naked haſt thou to cloath, hurt to heale, hungry to feed, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to viſit, captived to ranſome, fatherleſſe to protect, harbourleſſe to lodge, widowes to defend, many of which thy lengthened arm hath reached, even as farre as Argier, Germany, and that diſconſolate neighbour of thine, the moſt diſconſolate of all Ilands gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning grieving, pernning Ireland, who according to her ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, hath ſent thee, knowing yet O Englands charity, thy breaſts full of milk, and bones of marrow,) thouſands of her children to ſofter, for there ſhe feares like Tekoahs widow, The beſtiall family is riſen upto deſtroy the heire, and quench his ſparckle which is left, and ſhall not leave to her husband either name, or poſterity upon the earth, your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours being the pious agents to the Engliſh charity, may comfort this juſt neceſſarie, and conſiderable complaint, ſaying with that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hymniſt, go to thine houſe, and I will give a charge for thee, amongſt the reſt of the unrelieved, I come like Eſau from the Iriſh woods to your honours, to whom I ſpeak, as hero Iſaac, in the ſame words and bitterneſſe, haſt thou but one bleſſing my Father, bleſſe me, even me alſo my Father, and the God of compaſſion bleſſe your Honours, that you as a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night, may help to lead us that lately came from that land, now the houſe of bondage, in our poore and wearie pilgrimage, to the land of promiſe, where God ſhall return your ſheaves with a harveſt theſe are the prayers of your devoted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr. <hi>Matchett</hi> Miniſter of Maharafelt, was after long impriſonment and extream hard uſage, the Lord having given him the bread of teares, and aſhes to drinke, he being an aged and reverend Gentleman, was moſt cruelly murthered at Lievetenant <hi>Thurſbies</hi> in the County of London-Derry, the Lievetenant and his wife being both Recuſants, could not by any meanes or intreaties, eyther ſave or reſpite him from death, ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour found the Engliſh Papifts amongſt the Iriſh, and ſuch finde the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh revolters with the Spaniard, between whom is as great correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as between the Scotch and French Nations.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hudſon,</hi> Miniſter or Deſert Martin, after many troubles, and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, was taken from betweene two fetherbeds, out of Mr. <hi>Chappels</hi> houſe, where that vertuous Gentlewoman had long fed, and concealed him, but at length the Rebels gave a date to her charity to him, and to his life, for the Rebels in a moſt cruell and moſt barbarous maner murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Campion</hi> of Kilowen, being at the battell of Ballemony, which the Engliſh in regard of the fatability of the day, call Blacke Friday, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received a great overthrow, which in all poſſibility had beene the loſſe of Colerane, and a diſmall day to all the poore Proteſtants within it, had not God infatuated eyther the wiſedome, or daunted the courage of thoſe Rebels, under the command of <hi>Colkittoes</hi> ſonnes, there did this Gentleman ſeale his love to the Goſpel with his bloud, like <hi>Zuinglius</hi> in the head of his Company, honourably expiring amongſt his ſlaughtered Brethren.</p>

death, of which none but one <hi>Greene,</hi> a Tapſter to Mr. <hi>Butterfield</hi> of the Newry eſcaped, ranſoming his life for forty ſhillings: this <hi>Greene</hi> brought me this Relation in May 1642. and as they were leading to their ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the poore Gentleman called upon Sir <hi>Con Magenis</hi> for mercy, and performance of his promiſe; but the perfidious tyrant ſtopped his eares, to his and their complaint; upon which Mr. <hi>Tudge,</hi> in the bitternes of his ſoul deſired God to require his bloud at their hands, with theſe words of the pſalmiſt; (Judge and revenge my cauſe, O Lord) then he with his fellow Martyrs, taking the Communion in a little running water, in ſtead of the bloud, and a piece of an oaten ſtrowen, in ſtead of the body of their Saviour, commending themſelves, and their vile bodies into his hands that was able to tranſlate them into glory, yeelded their lives to the ſtroke of the bloudy executioners, by whom he was hanged: but Lievtenant <hi>Trever</hi> and his wife with ſome of the reſt, which were divers were cut to pieces.</p>
            <p>Soone after, as all the Engliſh Inhabitants of that place often affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Sir <hi>Con Magenis</hi> was by the ſtrange judgement of God, ſtrucken with a ſtrong frenzy, running home to his owne houſe on foot, the Lord taught him by the way, as Gideon taught the men of Succoth and Penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, his clothes and skin being juſtly torne by the buſhes and briers, in thoſe uncouth wayes his madneſſe made choyce of, raving on his death bed, Take away <hi>Tudge,</hi> take away <hi>Tudge,</hi> doe you not ſee how hee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues me for his bloud? in which deſperate condition he died.</p>

            <p>The firſt digreſſion is form the ſubject. With mr. <hi>Fullerion</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Mr. <hi>Morgan Aubrey</hi> Eſquire, and his man (who though no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) I have thought good to mention in regard of thoſe many deare tyes of love and friendſhip between us, to whoſe diſaſtrous death I dedicate this tragick remembrance as a monument of his ſufferings, and my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, a Gentleman of an active, brave, and Roman ſpirit, whoſe breaſt was not only filled with pleaſing flames of learned Poetry, but the more heroick fire of reſolution, ſweetly allayed with a modeſt and wel tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red diſpoſition; a man that had merited as much from that laethe drinker
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119757:15"/>
Sir <hi>Phelomy O Neal,</hi> as a Gentleman could, having effectually negotiated for him in many particulars of conſequence with the late Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> to whoſe Counteſſe he had been Gentleman uſher, yet was he all ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments waved, betraied by letters of ſafe conduct to a cruell and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe butchery, firſt ſtripping him, then killing him at a bogs ſide. But on his ſervant <hi>Henry Lawrence</hi> (whom I have heard to be of a mighty ſtature and valour) a Warwickſhire man, who by ſurpriſing one of the Rebels ſwords, having ſlaine foure or five before he was ſeiſed on, was ſhewed that cruelty which was forborne to ravilliac the parricide of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, that <hi>Coelor</hi> of the the Flower <hi>du liz</hi> and was only exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by <hi>Cambiſes</hi> upon one of his unjuſt judges whoſe ſkinne he ſlaied off, and nailed it to the tribunall, as a terrour to his ſonne that ſucceeded him, had but ſome of ours been made ſo exemplar, unjuſt votes had not laden our Kingdome with theſe bloudy conteſtations. The Judges of Iſrael rid on their white Aſſes, to ſhew I thinke as well their purity and innocency, as their patient undergoing the inſupportable weight of their callings; but it is feared ſome of them have not only caſt off that integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but purity and conſtancy alſo, this <hi>Laurence</hi> after many wonnds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, they ſlead ſome part of him, and ſo leſt him cruelly murdered.</p>
            <p>The ſecond digreſſion is from the Province, but ſomething adhering to the Subject. But above all barbarous, inhumane, hetheniſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of murders, was that of Mrs. <hi>Smithſon</hi> a miniſters wife living at the Kilne of the Grange within foure miles of Dublin, who being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to returne to her houſe, in hope to have the Communion cup, and a barrell of wheat given her, all which was promiſed by her ſatanicall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer, her poverty having made her too credulous, ſhe went along with her maid ſervant, no ſooner had they gotten this unfortunate Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in their power, but they ſtript her of her apparrell, ſetting her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a ſtride upon a leane jade, tying heavy weights at her heeles, then with ſtripes forced they the horſe to runne through waters, and leap o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ditches, and to travell in the moſt uneaſie paſſages till they brought her into their army, that ſo they might not ſeeke for any other then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſticall evidence of this their beſtiality; this uſage ſhe had untill her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was torne in a unheard of manner, feeding her with bread and water, which was rather affoarded to protract the miſeries they intended her then to preſerve or reprive a life, and when that her body could not any more be made a ſpectacle of their ſhame, ſhe was reſtrained, where firſt

And all that ſaw it, ſaid, there was no ſuch thing done nor leen ſince the time that the children of Iſrael came up from the land of Egypt unto this day.</p>
