            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Voice of the Stars, the Meſſengers
of the Lord, cry aloud in my Ears, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the great Troubles and Afflictions
and Calamities which are coming on us;
Inſomuch, that I can no longer refrain from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
known unto you People what the Lord is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to do, O Chriſtian Reader, the great God
and Creator of all things doth not now ſhow what
he is about to doe by Viſions, or working Miracles
as he was pleaſed to do to his People formerly, as
you may read <hi>Joshua</hi> 10. 12, 13. <hi>Sun ſtand thou ſtill
in Gibeon, and thou Moon in the Valley of Ajalon,</hi> and
the Sun abode, and the Moon ſtood ſtill; and in
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 38. verſ. 8. the Sun went back ten Degrees
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105487:3"/>
and returned again, theſe things are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
now to manifeſt unto us the Intention of
the Almighty; for the Sun, the Moon and the
Stars remain firm in their Courſes and Orbs; O
you Engliſh Men, you that have Ears to hear, and
Eyes to ſee, the Stars and ſtrange Signs in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
have more Reaſon to cry out with Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than <hi>Dyoniſius Areopagita,</hi> who ſeeing the
ſtrange Eclypſe of the Sun and Moon at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
hour of our Saviours Paſſion said, <hi>Aut Deus
Naturae patitur aut Mundi machina diſſolvitur,</hi> which
is, either the God of Nature ſuffers, or elſe the
Frame of the World is Diſſolved, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
are now met together which hath not been
almoſt this Thirty Years. <hi>Saturn</hi> you muſt know
is lodged in that place of the Heavens, wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch is
by many Learned Men termed Hell, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Station ſo is his Nature, Evil and
Corrupt, Self-ended, Covetous and Malitious, one
who hath been an underground worker this many
Years in contriving damned Plots to the Ruin and
Subverſion of Nations, but now meeting with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
whoſe Reſident place is in the third Heaven
(which St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions) being by Nature good
and upright in all things and Religious, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<hi>Saturn</hi> of his wicked deſigns, ſo that by
this we may have ſome hopes of a better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
amongſt Men, and after the bitter taſte
of three Judgments is over, then there will be
a bleſſed day of Peace in the whole Univerſe, and
before the three Judgments are paſt, <hi>viz.</hi> War,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105487:3"/>
Famine and Plague, there will ariſe three Heads,
and they will look three ways, two of them will
not remain, but one will ſtand faſt; <hi>Mavors,</hi> one
of the Meſſengers of the Creator informs me, that
a rumbling noiſe af War will ſound loud in our Ears
from the Eaſt, attended with Ruine and Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Building, inſomuch that it will make the
Miter and Half-Moon to move, and then the four
Winds will begin to blow and come from the four
cor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers of the Earth, and ſpread it ſelf through the
whole World, but eſpecially in <hi>Italy, Scicily, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,
Turkey, Rome,</hi> and ſeveral other Countreys,
and this will be after <hi>Falcifer</hi> and <hi>Mavors</hi> have
whiſpered together, which will be in the Year
1684. <hi>October</hi> the 3d. Then Women will begin to
ſtand in the place of Men, and ſpread their Wings,
as a Hen to ſave her Young ones. Again, two
Meſſengers more cry aloud to me ( <hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Titan</hi>
and <hi>Lucina</hi> the two great Lights or Lamps of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
informing me that there will be a great and
fierce Diſpute about Religion, and preſently a great
Mortality and Peſt in moſt parts of <hi>Europe</hi> with
strange Signs to be ſeen in the ſtarry Heaven,
great Diſtempers, Hydropical Diſeaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with
Sedition and the Diſeaſe of <hi>France, Naples, Spain,</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> and indeed of all the World; let them
that are much inclined to Venery have a care, and
thus much from the great Eye of Heaven.</p>
            <p>The next news is from <hi>Lucina</hi> the leſſer Light,
which threatens Rebellion and Tumults amongst
People againſt their Head and Rulers, by reaſon of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105487:4"/>
a ſcarcity of Bread and deadneſs of Trade, theſe
things will be after a dark Day and a dark Night,
in which the two great Lights of Heaven will ſuffer
an Eclypſe, Viſible to us even to Admiration,
the dark Day will be <hi>July</hi> the Second, and the dark
Night will be <hi>December</hi> the 11th beginning at 11
at Night.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour tells us, that before the Diſſolution
of the World, there ſhall be Wars and rumors of
Wars, I can aſſure you here are coming great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
and Changes, here hath appeared a New
Star almoſt viſible to the whole World, as was at
the Birth of our Saviour, juſt before whoſe Birth
there was a great Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
in <hi>Leo,</hi> which is ſpecified by <hi>Abraham Judaeus.</hi>
Likewiſe, there was a great Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi>
and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Aquarius, ante exitum Judaeorum de</hi>
Aegypto, which is likewiſe mentioned in the ſame
Author, I will lay before your view the Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
paſſages which have followed the Conjunction
of the two Superiors <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Fiery
Trigon, <hi>viz.</hi> being in number 7.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Tranſlation.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Noah</hi>'s Eloud.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Deliverance.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Glory.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Redemption.</item>
               <item>6. <hi>Charles</hi> the Great's Greatneſs.</item>
               <item>7. The Lambs Marriage with the Bride.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Both in Scripture and Hiſtory you may find
that the Church of God was afflicted before Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105487:4"/>
according to the ſaying of the famous
<hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> who Writes that the firſt Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Leo</hi> was under <hi>Enoch</hi>
in 800 Years of the World, he walked with God,
and lived 365 Years, and ſo long was the Church
of God preſerved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Second Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi>
and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Leo,</hi> was under <hi>Noah,</hi> in 1600
Years of the World, which World was Deſtroyed,
at what time <hi>Noah</hi> was a preſerver of the Church
of God in the Arke.</p>
            <p>The Third Revolution fell out in the 2400
Years of the World under <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was a
Deliverance of the People of God from the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Yoak.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Revolution fell out in the 3200
Year of the World under <hi>Solomon</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
who builded a Temple for the People of God.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Revolution fell out in the 4000 Year
of the World, at what time Chriſt came upon the
Face of the Earth to work Mankinds Redemption.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Revolution fell out in the 4800 Year
of the World, which was under <hi>Charles</hi> the Great,
who cauſed a flouriſhing State of the Church of
God.</p>
            <p>The two Superiors <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> come to
a Conjunction in three Numbers of Years, <hi>viz.</hi>
every 800 Years. Secondly, every 200 Years, and
Thirdly, every 20 Years, but theſe forementioned
Remarks are taken from the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 800
Years, which is their Revolution from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105487:5"/>
of the World, and this one of theſe Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
under which may be ſuppoſed the time in
which God will Unite his People together both
Jews and Gentiles, and they ſhall be all of one
Minde, and of one Heart, and of one
Flock, having onely one Shepherd, this muſt be
ſays the Scripture before the final end of the
World, the time is approaching, we may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it if we but take notice of that Star which
Uſhered in this Remarkable Conjunction under the
next great Revolution in the Fiery Trigon, which
will be in 800 Years, will be the Diſſolution
of this World, every thing returning and Remaining
in its former Chaos or Confuſion.</p>
