         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </expan> skill:
iudged to conteyne ſparkes of matter, which with
due nourishment might geue occaſion to kindle far off the light
of the Goſpell, winninge ſuch fauour of migthy ſtates that it
might turne to the comon good of Chriſtendome. This Iew ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by his epiſtle to be of great autority, not only amonge
Iewes, which are in Conſtantina the chiefeſt of the world, that he
carying them after him, the reſt over the eaſt will ſoner folow: but
alſo with the greateſt there: of whoſe affection nothing may be
ſpoken, vntill it pleaſe him ſelf to open his mynde. He writeth in
the tongue that was firſt vſed in the world: in which all the holy
prophetes bookes are written: and all diuinity graduates muſt
know, or bethought to ſee with other mens eyes: &amp; by English
vniuerſities they are bound to know: ne ther may plead ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce:
but as they are higheſt in your maieſties praeferment, ſo the
care to awnſwer toucheth them principally. His epiſtle penned
with exquiſite care sheweth in his firſt entrance, skill putting all
to the tryall, ether to overmatch Chriſtianes by Iudaiſme, for all
theyr grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, yf they graunt his, &amp; paſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer as not dashing
all faith: or, yf by modeſty &amp; dexterity he be taught, how both
Talmudes wilfully diſturbe the Bible, that the Light of Chriſt
should not shine to them being in Satans darkenes: he cannot
by Lerning lenger reſiſt: but by all Turkes iudgement, vpon his
owne groundes of Scriptures auctority, he shalbe vtterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen.
After his begininge, he continueth ſundry poinctes in
Lerned reuerence: Firſt commending, matters of England: next,
requeſting ſome petitiones of inſtruction. Our diuinity is in his
ſpech highly eſtemed: as ſtanding vpon the clear power of Gods
hand: &amp; removing weedes: ſuch as I think he blameth in Grekes.
For as the Iewes, ſo they, haue overwhelmed all the Scripture, as
with netles: which being vncutdowne, the thrueth cannoth be
ſene. Then he thinketh that N. hath great occaſion to reioyce for a
greate nomber that he hath broght on to the knowlegde of God:
<pb facs="tcp:13578:3"/>
from which help he alſo the Iew him ſelf ſtretched out his hand: &amp;
caught an Omer full: while he ſtandeth behind the wall: looking
through the lattice, &amp; knocking at the gates of vnderſtanding.
After this he slideth vnto commendation of your highnes Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,
at the city of Conſtantine, for his great care to ſettle him in
Chriſtianity, And after this praeparation he floweth moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
into your maieſties commendation: that by your ſpeciall
tendering haue diuines ſo ready in the Golden candelſtick of the
Law for the generalles to bring them vnto few heades: &amp; for the
particulares, the bowles, Knoppes, &amp; flowres. Others he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth,
as may appeare in his Epiſtle: and after, he cometh to
his requeſtes: wherin firſt he sheweth a fervent deſire, &amp; moſt
harty affection to haue N. ſent to teach all the ſynagoges in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantina,
promiſing that he shalbe receaued as an Angel. But firſt
he wold haue the ſum of all the Scripture plentifully handled:
&amp; endeth his Epiſtle with à Lerned ſonnet. This Letter was
brought vnto my Lordes grace, to croyden: where he should be
beſt at leaſure. But his grace ſeing an English Endorcement, and
ſaing that he could rede no further, bade the bringers ſend it to
me. Others alſo counted ready in the tongue of diuinity, could or
wold ſay litle to it. Here vpon it returned towardes the eaſt, not
with ſmall hazard: yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Gods goodnes, it came ſafe to me to
Baſil. I durſt not returne the Letter: being of ſo weighty impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
to abide new daunger. But I printed an awnſwer to my Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
grace: shewing the principall effect: thinking that his gr. wold
haue ſent for an whole copy or haue written: that in this ſo
weighty byſines, to doe good to all the world, no shadow of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or delay should appeare. But becauſe that is not done, I
haue printed the whole Epiſtle vnto your M. whom the care
should chiefly touch: &amp; will shew, according to my leaſure more
then others had hereyn, my poore opinion of proceding: yf your
highnes geue me leaue. My care is the greater: for his G. dealin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in as great matters about the Bible, Labored in, ten whole
yeres, vpon your M. word: &amp; croſſed after all that labour, &amp; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of ſo great time, by his Graces will &amp; autority. I shewed his
G. how, vpon Dan. 11. 38. vnskilfulnes, allowed by his skill, betrayd
Gods name, &amp; whole religion, to Satan. Yet there, three Greke
translationes, yf they had bene knowen in England, might haue
geuen light vnto à ſure trueth: beſides the moſt ſtedfaſt certenty
of the Ebrew terme: So Polychronius the Greke, might for all
Daniel. Then his G. yelded: with high Promiſes. Since a new diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

A Greater cauſe his G. never dealt in: then to open all te bible,
both Teſtamentes in Ebrew. And yf his G. knoweth nought in
Ebrew: Greke will doe as well, for Byzantium: and better for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:

which this Epiſtle to the Iew will quiet: &amp; brede a windeleſſ
Cymatolegen. His G. knoweth who ſtirred a diſſention: for the
principal article of the Crede: for Chriſt his paſſion, wether his
ſoule went from his body. The Greke tongue, in ſpech to this Iew
will cut off all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy: as Lerned linguiſtes &amp; the ſure in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
groundes know that all was euer plain to the Simpleſt. The
Euangeliſtes told that Chriſt his ſoule should goe preſently from
his body to his kingdome, to Paradiſe, to the hand of God; euen
through the veile of his flesh into heauen. This the Euangeliſtes
taught: and no one ſyllable in te Prophetes euer taught otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.
Now the prophetes phraſe of all ſoules departing this life is: a
deſcendinge to Sheol, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

happy caſe: &amp; with theyr Goddes. So the Crede is penned by a
phraſe vnwreſtable: plain to all Iewes &amp; Gentiles: till the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
wold Lerne Diuinity, as from Dauus in the market, againſt
religion &amp; all Lerning. This all his G. may cure ſaffely by writing
in Greke, wher none may ſay that Chriſt deſcended to Gehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuo:
